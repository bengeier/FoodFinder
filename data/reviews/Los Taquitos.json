{"text":"I did catch an episode of Diners, Drive-in's, and Dives and since they did get Matt's Big Breakfast right, I was hoping for the same for this place. I have to say the Bombero burrito rocked! It was so tasteful with the right amount of heat (certainly not 5 alarm, but nice), and other Mexican spices. The kids had two $1.15 taco's each which was the right amount for them (if you're an adult, I would probably get 4). The place is tiny, not the best setup, but the line moved fairly quickly.  I'll certainly be back, it ranks up there with Carolina's as one of my ATF for Mexican in the valley."}
{"text":"The absolute best place in Ahwatukee for authentic Mexican food. it's right next to the Safeway on 48th and Elliot, so a bit of a drive from the foothills but so worth it! The restaurant is clean and has plenty of seating. I've always had a pleasant experience with the cashiers, they're very friendly and don't mind if you ask questions (some of the menu is in spanish). I get food from here at least once a week, the quesadillas, tacos, burritos and bowls are all amazing and decently prices. always get the meal/plate, they add in beans and rice for only a couple bucks extra. they also have fresh horchata which might be my favorite part! the service is always quick and they have never messed up an order for me. if you're looking for great Mexican food, you need to go to Los Taquitos!"}
{"text":"The carne asada torta is great. Terrific flavors, soft bread, tender meat. Actually anything with the carne asada or the carnitas is good. And the ladies in the kitchen and behind the counter are super sweet. It's good place to stop by for lunch or you can phone your order in and they'll usually have it ready within 10 to 15 minutes."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere Very well lit with tasteful decor Cheap food Vegetarian friendly  We had the veggie burrito which had potato, beans, grilled veggies and maybe cheese. It was very good though. Out whole meal with one burrito and chips and guacamole was about 7.50 which is better than chipotle and you don't need to get chipotlaway (southpark reference). The Guac was good and creamy and had a good flavor. The burrito was big enough to feed us both with the chips. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Pretty good tacos. The salsas werent very impressive or flavorful. The amount of chips you get with salsa or guac is pitiful. Especially considering the cost. The guacamole doesn't taste all too different then blended avocado. Very little flavor."}
{"text":"I saw them on FoodTV and realized that they are right down the street from us (by Safeway at 48th and Elliot). Decided I had to give them a shot and wow - great food! Our favorite take-out for a pool party. Only complaint is that the service is a little slower than we would like."}
{"text":"i have been to Los Taquitos a few times for lunch and once for dinner. Love the street tacos and the green chili pork burrito. The margaritas are $3 at happy hour and are surprisingly good. Certainly not the sweet mixer kind! We did have to wipe down our own table at lunch. But overall good food at a good price"}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place very often and the food is always delicious and served quickly. I love their tacos and chile relleno."}
{"text":"The food was very good, we had nachos, chicken taco's and burrito's.  The venue was small, like a pizza parlor back east, it is not a full service restaurant.  If you are in the area and looking for decent themed cuisine, it is worth a stop."}
{"text":"Today was a cheat day, so I  opted  for something new and unhealthy.   I had the sweet pork tacos with rice and beans.  The tacos were moist, sweet and possessed a lot of flavor. The rice was nothing special, but the beans are phenomenal!! I went back and ordered a side of it.  Very pleasantly surprised, as I  had never heard of this establishment. This is definitely not my last, I highly recommend giving the a try ..."}
{"text":"Do you ever get so hungry /hungover/ had too much coffee that you need an emergency taco?  This is my go-to rescue place.  It's charming inside, and has a small patio.  The street tacos are right-sized and right-priced.  And damn tasty.      I recommend the pastor.  Don't be afraid to try something new people.  How many chicken tacos can one person eat?  Be adventurous - get a sope or a torta.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I went here with very high hopes, given the good reviews on here.  But I came away thinking that it is unlikely I will ever go back.  Service - the cashier was not friendly and got confused over me telling her that I wanted a crispy taco.  She thought I was asking for all of the ingredients to be fried to a crispy texture.  Really?  Food - I have been looking for a great shredded beef taco, and this is definitely not the place.  Cheap hard taco shells that are not cooked to order (think Taco Bell) - no wonder she had no idea of what a crispy taco is.  The meat essentially had no flavor at all.  This was my first time going to this place, so, in fairness, maybe they have better tasting food on the menu.  But I came to a place called Los Taquitos, looking for a great tasting taco.  I left very disappointed, and without any desire to return.  I guess my quest for the perfect taco will just have to continue."}
{"text":"Very good food, service..i ordered the \"Marinated Pork\" very good..minus one star for the weird table setup and soda machine location...but the counter girls were very helpful and pleasant.."}
{"text":"Their tacos cant be beat. They are so good. I always get an assortment of tacos. And that's really the way to do it. Although my favorite is the steak tacos with flour tortilla. My only criticism is the wait. Always a long wait."}
{"text":"I can be a picky person but this place definitely appeases. It reminds me of Southern California taco shops, which is what I grew up with and am accustomed to. It's got a super open dining room and a true tomato red sauce for the enchiladas. Also they offer deliver thru DoorDash with incredibly reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Lives up to the hype. Great food, great price. You can't go wrong. Green Chile pork is amazing!"}
{"text":"I wish I could describe the flavors that they can pack into their food! I always get the bombero burrito and it always puts a smile on my face! Everything I have ever had has always been delicious!   I once went for breakfast and the burrito I was given was just off the charts! Always fresh and delicious!   I would highly recommend los taquitos!"}
{"text":"The many positive reviews on yelp led me to try this place. Those reviews must be bogus because this place was awful. My enchilada sauce looked and tasted like it came from a can, I could not recognize nor taste the beef in my enchilada, and the cokes were warm. Taco Bell would be an improvement."}
{"text":"Authentic street style fare at top notch quality and taste. The limited seating and lack of wait staff is the only barrier between this \"dive\" setting and a fine dining restaurant."}
{"text":"Despite the negative reviews, I gave this place a shot....Basically because I was craving mezi food and I was starving. I ordered the carne asada burrito and chips and salsa.   The food overall was not even mediocre. The burrito was tiny! Similar to those littlle miniature .49 cent bean and cheese burritos that del taco used to serve. Only these little morsels are about $8.00.  Then I dove into the chips and salsa, which were $1.99. The salsa was served in a decent sized cup and it was pretty good. As for the chips, they were horrific. God awful. It was obvious they came out of a bag and they were stale and full on salt licks.  Then I tried the rice and beans.... Rice was okay and the beans were out of a can and cold.   I can't wait to get home to Orange County and have real mezi food.... However, this flight may be spent in restroom with Mr. Montezuma!"}
{"text":"The best Carne Asada around! I love the taste of their Carne, the flavor is indescribable. I usually get a Carne Burrito or Carne Quesadilla.  They've moved into a larger Suite next door. Much nicer. Even though it may not look like a \"Dive\" anymore, the food is still amazing."}
{"text":"Came in to check out the street tacos on Taco Tuesday and left with a smile a mile wide. Simple, fresh ingredients but big on taste. The ladies up front were super friendly. Nice find."}
{"text":"I was not real impressed my first visit but being close to home  I thought I would pick something up to take home and give it another try. The food made me sick to my stomach and I found what appeared to be a small stick in my rice. I will not go back."}
{"text":"Ordered Sunday around six pm. I don't know how in the world this place gets so many five star reviews. This place was pretty bad. First... It is hard to find the names don't match up. And second... The food is really dry. We spent forty bucks between fish tacos, steak tacos and burrito. Chicken tacos. Bean tostada. Etc. Everything was dry. And on the tacos all you could taste were the corn tortillas. I'm from Nashville and we have MUCH better Mexican than this. Y'all need to stop over-hyping places like this. So people like me can have a good experience"}
{"text":"I've been here on a few occasions, and it's never disappointed. The ambience isn't necessarily the best, but the incredibly satisfying food more than makes up for it."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying I frequent Los Taquitos regualrly at their 16th St. location and love it. The airport location is terrible. I actually threw my food out. The beans where watery and flowed out across the entire container, the rice was bland and over cooked, and the meat was under seasoned. Do yourself a favor and go to LGO or one of the other places that is doing good airport food, and only go to Los Taquitos outside of the airport."}
{"text":"This place is supposed to be all about the tacos and between the meat choices and tortilla choices I think you could have around 10 different tacos, but they are traditional tacos with just meat, onions, and cilantro inside of 2 small tortillas (corn or flour.)  The problem with this is that I can't eat onions or cilantro... at all... I hate them.  So, I went with tostadas.  I had 1 chicken and 1 carne asada.  I enjoyed both very much!  The tostadas are very simple; layered bottom to top are: tostada shell, beans, meat, lettuce, cheese, tomatoes.  Both the chicken and carne asada were very flavorful, and while the beans were a bit watery, they tasted really good as well.  The place is tiny and crowded, but the service is very friendly and I think the quality of the food makes up for the downfalls.  This is probably my favorite Triple D place so far."}
{"text":"Shrimp Taco is awesomeness. I hate that the seating is not ideal, but the food is so worth it. My first time having authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Great Place! I found it while searching for \"pozole\" on Yelp lol :)   What did I get?  I have tried the Chilaquiles and Pozole! Both so incredibly delicious!!!!   Pricing?  For both I pay $13, which is crazy to me! So cheap and great food... Can't go wrong with that!"}
{"text":"Los Taquitos is one of our favorite Mexican restaurants.  We have been going there for several years now.  It is our go-to place for tacos, quesadillas, posole, tortas, etc.  Their food is delicious, and made with great quality ingredients."}
{"text":"The food here is good but its such a shame the customer service sucks. The lady taking your order was rude and in a bad mood. Manager, the lady up front is the face of your business you might wanna change her for someone more friendly... Free advice"}
{"text":"First of all I saw this resturaurant on diners drive ins and dives. I thought I'd give it a try. I ordered the hard shell carne Asada tacos, they were awful. They tasted like rubber just very bland. I think the meat might have been over cooked. Needless to say I will not be returning"}
{"text":"Was visiting friends and found this place thanks to Yelp. The food was good but not good enough to warrant 4 stars."}
{"text":"Visited early November.  Few tables so getting there on off-hours proved a wise choice.  GREAT carne asada (street) tacos.  Must have eaten 8 of them.  Had the refried beans also which were tasty.  They give you like 4 choices of salsa in squeeze bottles for whatever your palette or mood which was great as I could combine a couple to get exactly what I wanted.  Service was fast but slow enough to know that they made my tacos after I ordered them.  As good as my favorite stand in Tijuana?  No but about the best I've had on this side of the border so far."}
{"text":"The best street taco's i've had.  As authentic and cheap as it gets...  If you do take out, pick up a bombaros burrito for lunch for the next day as well, its really hot, but tasty.  Don't tell me ATF or any other spot is better, they dont come close unless you like your \"street tacos\" with sour cream, cheese and lettuce LOL."}
{"text":"The carne asada burrito was delicious. The tortilla itself I could have eaten plain. The meat has a great smoky flavor.   The verde salsa is spicy but has great layers of flavors. Their tortilla chips were very yummy. Guacamole was overly processed and lacked depth of flavor. Definitely would not get it again.   Super fast take out."}
{"text":"First impressions, only been to this place once: The place was packed on a Saturday night around 8pm, but it's also a fairly large space so we were able to find a seat. I ordered the 3 taco combo plate with rice & beans, along with a fountain drink--price came to just over $9. My friend ordered essentially the same but with chips, his order came to $11. This place feels like a fast food place to me, not a restaurant. $11 bucks is too much for fast food IMO. For me, prices get a  thumbs down.  There was a large group of people near the register waiting for their orders, we found a seat & waited too. No kidding we waited for about 40 min for 6 tiny tacos, chips, beans & rice. We had a gig at Cactus Jacks, which shares the same strip mall so we actually were trying to kill time but under normal circumstances--I would have asked to be refunded. A few people complained about why things were taking so long. I don't know if that is typical service, but I'm gonna have to give it a thumbs down.   The food was actually pretty good, but Not worth a 20 min drive for me. If I happened to be around that area, I might stop in & try a few more menu items. Maybe."}
{"text":"Have been here several times, and I am never disappointed!  The best dinner we have found here is a carne Asada chimichanga enchilada style( with red over the top).  This is always a hit, and what we will continue to order.  My only complaint is I would love a branch opened in tucson!!  Love their food, worth the trip!"}
{"text":"4.5 Stars but giving 5 as I'd like to see this business to stay. This particular location of this strip mall has had businesses come and go too often too much. This Los Taquitos offers fresh yummy food with very reasonable price. The decor is cute and it is clean. We (4 of us) all loved our street tacos. Everything tasted fresh and clean."}
{"text":"I'm so glad I stopped in. I had the combo street taco plate with carne asada, fish, and pastor tacos.  They were delicious and the rice and beans were great. The portion was adequate for a normal person. The only thing lacking is a salsa bar. I will definitely return."}
{"text":"I gave this place a try for the third time hoping I had an off experience before. I ordered the green chili pork burrito enchilada style with green sauce. It was okay - the pork was a little too salty for my taste and the green and red sauce were just okay.  The restaurant itself had a great vibe and clean."}
{"text":"Im from texas, the taco capitol of the US, and i can vouch for the pollo, asada, pastor, and carnitas tacos.  Great food and friendly staff....i will eat here every trip to phoenix i take."}
{"text":"Stopped in accidentally for Taco Tuesday, best surprise ever! The street tacos are $1, only the chicken, carnitas and al pastor. The taste was good and it was a good portion of meat. Didn't skimp on the tacos. Their menu looked pretty decent. Will be going back again to try other items."}
{"text":"I went to this Mexican Restaurant because Guy Fieri went to the Elliott Rd one and said some very good things about it. The one of 16th St and Glendale is terrible, I had the enchilada's in red sauce, the red sauce had no flavor at all the refried beans were like paste right out of a can. I can 't believe they were made fresh, the rice was ok. The place is very clean and the staff was very friendly but it all comes down to the food which is not worth the money. And I was so looking forward to going their because of Diners drive-ins and dives."}
{"text":"You must try the CARNESADA BURRITO ENCHILADA STYLE (Green Chilie Sauce) DELICIOUS!!!! We live near a small town tip of AZ going west, all the mexican food resturants there are authentic, the border is minutes away and all I know is they got nothing as delicious as this enchilada style burrito. Good customer service... Our first time eating here....We'll definitely be back! \"This burrito has spice kick that will kick yo ass!\" lol"}
{"text":"Whenever I have a cold I always head to Los Taquitos!  They are spice, but spice with flavor and Purpose.  I caught them on a late night showing of \"Diner's, Drive in's, and Dives\" and could't wait to try it out.  I have been going ever since then. I love their soft shell taco's with chicken and their green sauce!"}
{"text":"Hadn't been there in a year and the renovations are great!  Same old food brought back memories when I used to live in Ahwatukee.  Good stuff as always.  Excellent authentic Mexican food.  They still have cute gals at the registers to make it an all round delight"}
{"text":"WOWSERS!!! This place is delicious.   F: I tried the carne asada and shrimp street tacos. They were just right. The only thing I didn't like was the shrimp taco needed just a little more flavor. They are grilled which I think taste better than the fried. I tried my brother's burrito and was pretty good. Wasn't overflowing with ingredients like other places. The red salsa is soooo good, better than green. Trust me.  S: The service was great. The register hottie knew what was in the food. Made some great recommendations, especially about which salsa to use for my tacos and burrito.  I highly recommend Los Taquitos, even if you live far, it is worth it. Give your taste buds a reward. Go now! Why are you still reading!?"}
{"text":"This place was nice and small. Nothing fancy here but if you want good food you should head over. It can be a little busy with a lone almost to the door but what do you expect? Yum!"}
{"text":"My family and I were in town for the weekend and stumbled upon this place for lunch.  The tacos, rice, chips and salsa were delicious and the menudo was AMAZING!  Everything was so good that we made a special trip the next morning to try their breakfast burritos (which were also delicious) before we headed back home.  I can't wait until the next time I'm in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Its about the best mexican i've had in PHX.  Super consistent and delicious!"}
{"text":"Great street tacos!  Small portions but a good enough deal. The downfall is this is a no gun zone so I will not come back. Because we all know the criminals obey the no gun zone signs right? ."}
{"text":"I've gone to this place twice this month, and I can honestly say the breakfast burritos are GREAT!! I haven't been for lunch, but I truly recommend breakfast here. I ate about 8am and I wasn't hungry again until 4pm. The portions are generous and the price is small."}
{"text":"Read the reviews on Yelp and took a shot.....it is only a mile from my house.  Had 2 shrimp street tacos and one fish with beans and rice.  Tasty as hell!  The shrimp were delicious with a nice spice and smokey flavor.  They also had some freshly made tamarindo water which was excellent as well.  Ambiance lacks a bit but there is a cool mural wall which is interesting.  Eat there."}
{"text":"My first sopa ever.  Yummy.  and the menudo was perfect too.  Casual, no fuss place. Its legit."}
{"text":"(Edited 12/6/2012 to 5 stars from 4, because I have to compare how good these guys are to the 2 years of Mexican food shenaniganery that we have been subjected to in, of all places, L.A. Alright, back to the original review.)  Being from San Diego as well, taco shops are hard to like in Phoenix.  This one isn't.  We went there because of Guy Fieri.  But the carnitas is why we go back...4 times since November.  And we live in Queen Creek.    It's a taco shop.  Taco shop = street food, not fast food.  Street tacos are small.  Thankfully, so is the price.  $1.25 each.  That means I walk out full with authentic Mexican food cravings satiated for $5.    My wife's favorite - carne asada and carnitas tacos.  While the carne asada is good to great, the carnitas is excellent.  Both have the typical onion/cilantro accouterments with red hot sauce added..  The carne asada has tasty guacamole added also.  I'd prefer they leave the sauce off and give me the option.  They have a green sauce also.  Both are delicious.    The carnitas burrito is what I want, though.  First time I ordered it I asked for no beans (a burrito with beans is a strike against them) and got a flour tortilla packed with melty, juicy, glorious carnitas meat.  If you're looking for pure, concentrated, braised pork flavor get the burrito sans beans.    Other notables:  the chili relleno, the sopa (topped with any meat you'd like.  We, of course, tried the carnitas).  I waffled between 4 and 5 stars because of the aforementioned bean faux pas, and their signature burrito, the Bombero, just didn't cut it for us( consider this a 4.5 star review?).  The sauce was a hybrid between enchilada and american barbecue sauce.  Weird.  But the insides were still great.  Try them."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good....but I'm not sure I'd call it great. Like many Mexican restaurants, I didn't feel the good was authentic but instead kids toned down. Still, I'd recommend giving it a shot."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in Ahwatukee.  It is busy for a reason.  Food tastes fresh.  Probably the best refried beans I have had in a Mexican restaurant.  Love the decor inside.  It is our go-to place.  Just wish there were more seats."}
{"text":"Favorite Mexican restaurant of all time, and I'm an Austin TX native. Try their cactus (can't remember actual name) margarita! Try two and get an uber!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely known for their tacos, and I now I know why. So yummy. The carne asada tacos were delicious"}
{"text":"This place I love. Great tasting Mexican food but they lack on customer service the girls there are very snobby there is only one who has a great personality and her name is Alexa. Who helps is every time. The other girls have forgotten my order a good 2 to 3 times but food is great."}
{"text":"If you want street tacos that will remind you of the ones you get south of the border, this is the place to be! Their horchata tastes like home-made as well. My fiance loves the bombero burrito, but beware because it is big and spicy. Every time he orders it, I need to have a bit because it is so tasty but he needs to stop me because I have horrible heart burn problems."}
{"text":"I had very low expectations only because the Qdoba that previously was located here gave me a bad taste in my mouth. But I gave it a shot. I had the steak bowl Arizona style. The steak was delicious and there was lots of it. Look out chipotle king of the meat skimping. I took my order to go wait was only about 5 min. Food was hot when I got it home I live about 3 miles away. All in all give it a shot it's about the same price as chipotle but there isn't a line out the door.. yet. Check it out!"}
{"text":"BEST street tacos e.v.e.r.!!!  We loved this place and ate there for lunch every day of our Phoenix vacation.  Excellent find, thank you Yelp!  So happy we discovered it.  Best eats of our trip.  Ala Carte tacos are my pic - they are just over a buck a piece and we loved the pork and carne asada ones.  YUM"}
{"text":"No flavor that simple.  The food sucks, ordered Carne asada taco and buro. Plain no spices no flavor, small drinks  horchata is OK.  Chips and quac, the guacamole is fake it sucks  not fresh one bit"}
{"text":"This is the BEST taco place I have ever been to. and they have way more than just good tacos on the menu. I can never decide what I want because it is all so good. Basically anything with carne asada is good, especially the chimichangas. They also have great tamales. The rice and beans are good, and this list goes on. The salsa is the best ever, but it might be too spicy for some. Bottom line, I could eat at this place for breakfast lunch and dinner if it wouldn't give me a heart attack!"}
{"text":"Known for their diner drive and dives signature dishes.  I found their fish taco's to be really superb."}
{"text":"Negative stars go to the cashier and the hate filled childish little grown woman prepping the food. Having food allergies isn't fun, dealing with your temper tantrum because I ordered food that won't kill me and you prepped it incorrectly is even less fun. I was very specific with my order, which was actually easier to make than normal, and you still botched it. Hopefully you get fired soon so no one else gets treated like I did, but if not, I hope you figure out a way to find joy in scooping guac for future travelers that stop by Los Madlittlewomanós for a burrito."}
{"text":"My favorite mexican restaurant in the valley! I've been going to their Awatukee location for years, right after Diners, Drive-in and Dives featured it in an episode. I even drive to their 16st & Glendale location when in that area. If you like fresh, authentic mexican food, without a  mountain of sour cream, shredded iceberg and yellow cheese on top, you will also love their food.  I've pretty much tried everything. My favorite is the carnitas torta. The carnitas are not greasy,  they have a distinct flavor, with a hint of cinnamon. The bread is slightly sweet and just the right bite to it. Of the two salsas, the red one is my favorite. I wish they would bottle it for sale. Their chile rellenos are unique with really good cheese and chunks of potatoes with a flavorful but not spicy red sauce on top. Did I mentioned their margaritas? They are fantastic! Strong, good quality, without that after taste found in a lot of other places. My husband, the health nut, ultramarathoner  loves their trainer salad and bean burritos. On another note, I keep asking the cashiers, to ask the owners where they get their playlist music. I'm originally from Latin America and just love their selection of latin music."}
{"text":"The service was almost as bad as the food.  I got the steak burrito for myself & tacos for my wife. Neither of us made it past the first bite."}
{"text":"This was my first visit.  So, I went with a #37 combination plate.  It had a taco, enchilada and a tamale.  All was very good but the tamale was dry (?) as it had already been unwrapped and had a chance to dry out before I received my meal.  The counter help was real nice.  The meals are served on black plastic plates.  The plastic utensils are long handled.  They offer Coke products and tea.  They were out of Mr Pibb during my visit.  It was good enough that I will stop back in.  And I would recommend the place to others."}
{"text":"Remodeled and expanded Los Taquitos is better than ever. Now serving alcohol and Cerveza. Love this place and the amazing food. Just wish that they opened earlier for breakfast."}
{"text":"I love the fact that they don't over stuff their burritos with a lb of rice! In fact they don't put rice in them at all. With that being said they didn't fill the burrito with much of anything. I ordered the carne asana and it came with 3 small chunks of meat. The only plus I enjoyed were their sauces. Both are on the spicy side and I enjoyed the green just as much as the red..."}
{"text":"Looks just like their location on Elliot as far as the artwork and seating. The staff at this place seemed a bit more upbeat and courteous. I ordered a carne asada torta (Mexican sandwich) which was very good, although it was not cut in half like they usually are so it was a bit of work to get it unwrapped and cut myself since it got a bit messy. Overall the meat texture was good, not dry, and well seasoned.  I ordered a side of beans and rice which also tasted pretty good and were not too salty. The red salsa was very good and tasted homemade but the green salsa needed some work as it was bland.  My husband ordered four mini taquitos which were pretty tasty and came with onion and cilantro. I thought the cilantro was too light and had to go ask for a side but other than that it was good!  We also ordered a ceviche tostada (lime marinated shrimp) and that was very good as well! It was drenched in lime and had enough onion and spices to give it that authentic ceviche taste! Will definitely order another tostada at this location soon!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best mexican food I've ever had . The pastor and carnitas were cooked and seasoned  perfectly! The rice and beans were so delicious and authentic, they reminded my dad of the ones his  grandma use to make him when he was a kid . All around excellent service , great food and ambiance. We were just passing through on our way to Sedona but will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Second time visiting this location. Family of four were very pleased with our lunch. Normally my stomach does not agree with beans but it has not made any noise since we left there. Everything was very tasty and fresh. Only request, the kids meal steak taco could use some garnishing. My daughter was asking why it was just a corn tortilla and meat. I just put lime juice and hot sauce on it for her. A few tomatoes and cabbage or lettuce would help :)"}
{"text":"Love this place! Tacos are amazing, and their Bombero burrito is simply delicious. Service is always kind and friendly and food is delicious for the price you pay. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Good consistent food & they keep service running pretty smoothly even when it gets busy.   Because it is frequently busy I usually put my order in for pick up. The other day, they mixed up my order with someone else's & that person left with my food. Accidents happen but I was annoyed to be waiting for all my food to be remade & I wasn't told outright about what was going on- I had to hear the other person calling back saying they had the wrong order. Ultimately when I brought up my annoyance I was met with apologies, prompt service & a refund. I'm so used to apathy at a food counter & I was pleasantly surprised with their willingness to rectify the situation as best they could in a timely manner & I really appreciate that kind of service."}
{"text":"To the person who said this pales in comparison to filibertos obviously has never had the free colon cleanse that comes with filibertos. Or your friggin high!"}
{"text":"Pretty good food - decent prices for the airport. Usually get breakfast here when we're flying out early. Don't feel like staff is overly friendly and major downside - no definite opening hours. They aren't posting anywhere and when people ask the staff gets exasperated and rolls their eyes \"Ugh 5:30 or 6\" is what I heard the young lady say several times this morning. Understandable that it's frustrating to be asked multiple times per morning but post the hours somewhere and remember we are your customers and be a little nicer. Update: actually never opened this morning before I had to leave. Workers moving super slow and not even acknowledging that there are lots of people I line after the opening time."}
{"text":"Really good tacos at a very reasonable price, carne asada tacos were amazing and the fish taco was really good"}
{"text":"Food:  I've tried: chicken tacos, pork tacos, carne asada tacos, chicken burrito, guacamole, chips, & green salsa.  Los Taquitos has the best tacos I've ever had; their chicken tacos are my favorite.  I've lived in the Phoenix area for 21 years and eaten at many a Mexican restaurant.  Los Taquitos uses chopped chicken rather than shredded chicken in their taco & burrito (which is A+ in my book).  Many restaurants confuse heat with flavor, but not Los Taquitos!  The seasoning on their meat is so delicious, I can't describe it appropriately.  The tacos have your choice of meat cooked with the most excellent combination of herbs & spices; plus, fresh cilantro leaves, and diced red onion.  They are served in two small (street taco size) corn tortillas.  When I eat the average taco, I like cabbage or lettuce, cheese, sour cream & salsa.  But not at Los Taquitos!  Their tacos are so simple yet so flavorful.  I've been thinking about how good it was for the last week, and wondering how it would do if I used their food for a party?  The only downfall is I live about 30 min away and I'm not sure how it would be if not eaten right away.  I thought the guac had too many onions.  The chips were over cooked and bland (you couldn't taste the corn flavor which is so delicious in fresh tortilla chips).  I liked the chicken burrito, I probably wont have it again just because I don't really enjoy beans, I can take them or leave them.  I did like how the burrito did not have rice in it.  Price: Very affordable.  I did notice that online they have prices listed and the Phoenix location is more expensive and has a little different menu options.    Ambiance:  I've never been to the location.  My office brought food in for us on two different occasions.  (I must qualify my opinion of the tacos by saying that I do not care for shredded chicken.  Typically it has no flavor of it's own and has a slimy texture.   I prefer shredded chicken over shredded beef, so I usually end up with shredded chicken dishes at the average Mexican restaurant)"}
{"text":"I love this place so much! Nachos, tacos and that the quac isn't packed with onions. Haha this place is great and the girls are wonderful!!! Yummm!!!!"}
{"text":"Good stuff!!....I especially liked the tacos al pastor-it tasted authentic and had bits of pineapple. Prices are excellent and this place is a real find, as at the hour we went (dinner) it was not full due to an area that probably caters more to lunch crowds."}
{"text":"Geez, it's been years since I last ate at this airport, but didn't expect the food to be so ridiculous. So, if you ever need to eat a burrito before 10 am, then get a breakfast burrito. I got too excited and got a carne asada burrito. OMG! The burrito is just refried beans! The other customers were looking at it and I told them it's suppose to be a carne asada. They told me to inform the employees. Was $9 worth asking if I got the right order. I guess it was. So I went up and said that I got the wrong order. I was suppose to get a carne asada burrito. They said the order is right. I showed them the beans filled burrito... then, then held up the small scoop to show how much meat customers get on their \"carne asada\" burrito. What a joke! Plate already has rice and bean, plus burrito filled with beans?! LOL. I had no choice since I didn't want food to waste. Anyway, if 1 star is okay because Cashier Shino gave great customer service. It would be a 2 hr flight. Good luck passenger mates. This girl just ate lotsa beans. LOL"}
{"text":"I am Originally from LA where Mexican food is the best!! street tacos and taco trucks in every corner and the bets places are the hole in the wall. When I first saw this place I thought it was going to be another Americanized place offering overpriced bland food. Little did I know this place is a must!!  The food is tasty, they also have a variety of alcoholic beverages you could choose from. I wish they had super spicy salsa. But most places don't. I've had the tacos, which I love that they're small and not full of sour cream and cheese. They're are almost like street tacos which I love!  I've also had the ceviche which I must say is better than some of the seafood places I've tried out here.  I also like that they have different salsas to be used in the front. The wait is pretty long. I usually go for my lunch and I spent most of it waiting for my order.  The staff there is extremely friendly and the artwork is awesome.  I cant wait to try their Pozole yummy!"}
{"text":"Great food, good prices, and a good menu. Only downside is the wait is a little long and the place is cramped. Overall a great place for your die hard Mexican food lover."}
{"text":"Good burritos.  Unfortunately tried to add the $2 chips and salaa (didnt see it on the menu) after the order was placed.  Cashier wouldnt do it because the $2 is the discount with the order.  Try harder?  Little annoyance it was so easy to solve.  She couldnt be bothered.  Please train your cashiers she should have known how to do it."}
{"text":"Growing up Mexican, I have pretty high standards for Mexican food, and this place delivers.   Food: Absolutely delicious. I recommend the al pastor burrito. It's so good that within the first bite, I instantly wished that I had fifty more. You could taste the pineapple in the meat, which is so tender and not lacking in flavor at all. The burritos are a good size, big enough to leave you full but not Chipotle-sized. Both the red and green salsas are incredible. The horchata is delicious; I usually find that a lot of horchatas have the problem of being super sweet, but this one has just the right amount of sweetness and cinnamon flavor.  Service: Many people are complaining about the wait time, but every time that I have come, I have never waited for longer than a few minutes. I've never thought that the employees were particularly rude, just as polite as they needed to be.   Decor/Cleanliness: They have recently remodeled and I must say that it's a nice upgrade. Before, the place was tiny, a very hole-in-the-wall establishment with not much room for seating. However, now they expanded into the business next door and it looks a lot more open and airy. They also upgraded their signs and menu board to look a lot more sleek and refined. The only thing is that in their old place, they used to have a huge mural that I really loved, but with the remodel, they had to tear down that wall. There are still murals of La Catrina and such, but I really loved the last one. Very clean, never once questioned how hygienic the place was."}
{"text":"The breakfast burritos are off the chart! The street tacos are fantastic. I have been eating here for many years and the food is always good."}
{"text":"Thank you, Guy!  Went to this place last Friday at lunch, and the line was out the door and the place was packed with people waiting for their to-go orders.  I got the 3-taco combo, and chose chicken, pork and steak.  The pork and steak were incredible and the chicken was great too.  Fantastic flavors.  This is not a place you can go and drink beers and margaritas or even get fresh guac, but they serve some DAMN good tacos with amazing flavors."}
{"text":"I stopped by on a Wednesday about 5:30. I got the pollo flautas with beans and rice. They came with sour cream and guacamole. The flautas were crisp and the chicken was tender.  Beans were good and traditional. But the rice!!! Reminded me of my grandpa's Mexican rice and I was so happy to experience it once more!  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just as good as the Ahwatukee location. Very nice staff, very clean. I had the pollo flautas with rice and beans. Perfect and delicious.  I only wish they would offer a small side of pico with the meal (even for a little more $) so that I didn't have to pay $2.50 for a large side of pico that is too much in quantity."}
{"text":"30 minutes for rice and beans?  And to be rewarded with average food with rotten pico de gallo?  Free is too expensive.  Do not bother with this place."}
{"text":"This place is so good we stopped by again on the way to the airport to bring some burritos home to Seattle with us!!! We even smuggled the salsa home!"}
{"text":"A must for Taco Tuesday's. Also if you love menudo or posole. Both are delicious here. Been there many times and it always hits the spot."}
{"text":"Rice was a little salty, but they make up for the bomb red and green salsa. Street tacos are as close as you get to the East L.A. lunch truck here in AZ."}
{"text":"I probably would give it somewhere between 4 and 5 stars. I had been wanting to try this place after seeing it featured on Food Network since it is only a few miles from my house.  My boyfriend and I went and as soon as we walked in it smelled amazing. There were quite a few people there but the service was fast and friendly. There seemed to be a lot of people coming in from the bike shop next door which is always a good sign.  I ordered the carne asada torta and a marinated pork taco and my boyfriend ordered 3 carne asada tacos and we shared a soda and it came to about $13. The food came out quickly and was hot and fresh. I do not like very spicy food and I thought that the spice was perfect. The hot sauce was great; it had a slight after kick and a great sweetness too. I personally thought that the carne asada torta was the best part. The bread was absolutely delicious. The tacos were great too, although I think the carne asada ones were better than the pork. I was not a HUGE fan of the tortillas, but they were certainly authentic. I just prefer flour tortillas I guess and should have ordered them instead of the corn.   I would definitely return to Los Taquitos and I am looking forward to trying other menu items!"}
{"text":"We have lived within 2 blocks of this place for over 3 years and always seen the sign but never went in. We decided to try it a few months back and boy was it worth it (wishing we had walked through those doors earlier). We visit once if not twice a week. They  have a great burrito, street tacos are delish and the salsa is super hot red or green. Every Tuesday is $1 tacos so that's a must. Fridays they have chicken abondigas and that's another awesome meal. If your in Phoenix looking for an updated Mexican restaurant this is the place!"}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food I have eaten in the valley and I've tried many restaurants in the past 6 years!   I love, love, love their carne asada street tacos! Perfect flavoring and combination of cilantro, onions and sauce. The homemade tortillas, refried beans, carne asada quesadillas and pollo tacos are also delicious.  They offer a great happy hour with $1 pollo, carnitas and pastor street tacos along with $3 margaritas (very tasty), beer and wine.  The service is fantastic and there is a nice patio for when the weather actually cools down!  Try this restaurant if you like authentic Mexican food - by far the best I've had since my San Diego days!!!"}
{"text":"The carne asada burrito w/ beans is my favorite and the sasla yummy  pour it on .Thanks for having excellent mexican food."}
{"text":"I've always been a big fan of Los Taquitos! I had the trainer salad today for the first time! One word- Amazing!  I'm watching carbs in my diet and after doing the math, it's only 4.2 g of carbs.  Something this good, should not be called a salad!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I tried Los taquitos for the first time. Not far from our home. Nice little place, reasonably priced and good food.  Come with an appetite as the portions are large!"}
{"text":"The best Mexican food I've had in Phoenix. The Bombero burrito is delicious. It's spicy, but it has great flavor as well, so it's not just spice."}
{"text":"Los Taquitos rocks!  The carne asada burrito and the cheese quesadilla  are my favorites!"}
{"text":"This is one of my 2 favorite Mexican places in Phoenix. The chicken here is delicious and I highly recommend the chicken tacos, a chicken burrito enchilada style (combo 29 I think), or a bombero burrito.   The ingredients are always very fresh and you can tell. I don't care much for the carne asada here. I also love the green salsa."}
{"text":"It wasn't anything special. Their ratio in the burrito was bad, not enough rice and it was plain. It's too expensive and it's not worth it. I would not come back here."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  Really great tacos , the carne asada and the chicken tacos were great.  Also had the carne asada torta and that was superb too."}
{"text":"This has been my 'go to' taco place for years! Great food, reasonably priced. They remodeled in the past year and now the decor/artwork matches the quality food! I always look forward to going to Los Taquitos!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Carnitas street tacos are my fav! Everything here is great. The pickled carrots are also a must!!!!!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat and everything is fantastic. I've been coming here for years and still make it over here two or three times a week."}
{"text":"I'm typically don't crave Mexican food, but when I do there are many options in the Phoenix area. I read some other Yelp reviews and this place was very close to home so I grabbed my friend, Donatella and checked it out. I had a hard asada taco and a fish taco. The asada was okay, but the fish taco was delicious. I will come back for a Taco Tuesday meal! I shared an asada quesadilla which was okay- the salsas that they offered were fantastic; the green had a nice kick and the hotter, smokey salsa made the asada items even better. Donatella had shredded beef tacos and cheese enchiladas. According to Donatella, we are coming back so it must be good."}
{"text":"THE Best Veggie burrito I've ever had! The beans and rice are great too. And...a very filling dinner and drinks for two for under $18!!! Can't beat that!"}
{"text":"I've eaten here 5-6 times in the last 3 weeks after hearing about it on Diner's, Drive-ins and Dives - I live in Ahwatukee and had just ignored this place until i saw the show.  I dig the food...the service needs an overhall (but from what I can tell so far, its a just one of the girls, everyone else seems nice). Like I said, I've been there quite a bit lateley and I've gotten the same girl at the counter on every occasion but once....and she is unfriendly to say the least. I've tried to be overly nice to her, say the order real slow, and repeat...and I barely get a smile from her and she has messed up my order twice (this is out of 6 times, so not a good average). She makes me feel like she's doing me a favor by allowing me to eat there...and it's made my wife not want to go back - the only problem...  ...I can't stay away! In the sea of chain restarants in Ahwatukee and East Valley, its a nice discovery.   So in short. Food good. Al Pastor burrito and tacos and tortas are killer. Green hot sauce in money.  Sevice horrible - I'm hoping someone from the restaurant will read this review and just sits her down...all she needs is to check herself and this place will be golden."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday Tacos for $1! Pretty nice place. Reasonably priced. They have beer and a selection of mixed drinks. Horchata is pretty good here. Overall pretty legit!"}
{"text":"This is my new go to place for taco Tuesday. Their street tacos are amazing, and I come for the shrimp tacos almost every week. They also have specials every day on other menu items, and it is definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Green Chile chicken tacos & pork tacos are fantastic!! Don't get the shrimp...it is obviously frozen, had a weird flavor & was not deveined. Margaritas are also very good, we tried Tamarind, blood orange & pomegranate."}
{"text":"I hate giving this place such a low rating but this location has gone down hill this year. We used to get food every week here but no more! Tonight I had to toss my burrito out after 3 bites because it loaded with oil, had no beans or other ingredients. Just carne asada and a ton of oil that soaked through 4 Bounty paper towels and my shirt. Love their Elliot Rd location but its a bit far and the 16th St one is up the road from me. I'm done wasting hard earned money only to toss out my meal because its saturated with oil."}
{"text":"Great food. Some of the best I've had, but very slow service. Waited over 20 minutes for a quesadilla when the place was nearly empty."}
{"text":"Dear Marquita,  Thanks for butchering my name this morning. I'm used to people getting my name wrong, but when your coworker asked you about it, your were rude & justified your mistake instead of owning it. I'm happy to share how rude & unapologetic you were.  I'm happy to spend my money elsewhere."}
{"text":"To be fair, I have not been here since the renovation, so this review is solely based on their food and customer service. I noticed that they changed their sign outside about a month ago I think, so I guess that's what ya'll are referring to. Moreover, ambiance and size don't make a difference to me unless they greatly impede or considerably improve the enjoyment of my meal. When I went, the location did neither, so my opinion on the matter is neutral.   So unless their food changed with the renovation, this review will be helpful. On second thought, I would like to add that the floors did not look very clean. Not in a nit-picky sort or way, but in the way that the edges of the furniture and some of the walls looked grimy and dark. Hopefully that was improved by the renovation.   Let me begin by saying that I know what truly good Mexican food is. This is NOT truly good, authentic Mexican food. It's not gross or anything, but it's definitely nothing special. Honestly, the biggest turn-off for me was that the meat didn't have a good, grilled taste. It almost tasted like they had used liquid smoke to give it a grilled flavor. My husband thought the same.   However, thumbs up for customer service. I asked for a slight change in one of the orders and they fulfilled my request without a fuss or even an extra charge, which I was willing to pay but was told would be unnecessary."}
{"text":"I couldn't even think of putting into words how great this place is. The tacos... they are the best. Really truly the best I have eaten. Super small place with just a few tables but worth it 100%. Go get the number 1, 3 tacos, rice and beans. Asked for the threaded pork and you will not be sorry."}
{"text":"Good food & prices. Decent customer service. Not bad, not good. Today the rice was not cooked well. Not gross. Just not as good as usual.  The shrimp street tacos are good. They did over charge my card by a couple bucks & did nothing to fix it when I told them. I still wonder why they don't have WiFi for the customers. Good place though. I wouldn't come here though if it weren't close to me."}
{"text":"This is a place to go for mexican. My family always get tamales for Christmas here and go here whenever we want mexican food. I always get a burrito chimi style and 3 street tacos. Breakfast is also very good. Have to try breakfast quesadilla because it is delicious."}
{"text":"Outstanding food and service.  Very friendly!  Between my wife and I we have tried everything on the menu and we are never disappointed.  I would definitely recommend Los Taquitos to cure any Mexican food craving you might have."}
{"text":"Cute, clean, awesome tacos & margs! Good happy hour & sweet girls that run it! Best in Chandler"}
{"text":"Great tacos, open for breakfast but no coffee. You can get Starbucks next door in the Safeway."}
{"text":"These tacos are the single most amazing food I have ever consumed. And the tacos aren't crap compared to there amazing burritos and quesadilla. I could eat it for breakfast lunch and dinner. But I want to stay healthy so I don't advise that. 5/5."}
{"text":"Really good street tacos and if you like spicy try the habanero salsa. My wife really loved the margaritas and they have a super friendly staff."}
{"text":"The grilled veggie burrito (I got it without beans) is pretty spectacular. Maybe a little pricey at just under $5 but very, very filling, stuffed with rice, potatoes, onions, peppers, and tomato. The red and green sauces were both delicious, a bit of a smokey flavor in the red, spicy and awesome. My sister wasn't super impressed by the beef fajitas. The location is great though, five minutes away, and I'll definitely be back for $1 tacos on Tuesday."}
{"text":"I normally love Los Taquitos - I am pretty sure they make the best nachos in Phoenix and their burritos are normally delicious, but after tonight my opinion has changed.  I ordered a bean and cheese burrito with sour cream and my roommate ordered the bean nachos to go tonight.  Everything else in the order was correct, so I do not think this was a mix up with someone else's order.  My burrito had hardly any beans and a ridiculous amount of fried egg whites.  I found some egg whites within the first few bites and pulled it out thinking maybe they cooked egg whites near my burrito and it slipped in.  I was wrong.  The amount of egg whites in my burrito equaled the amount of about 4-5 eggs.  I placed my order via phone about 15 minutes before closing, so possibly they didn't have any beans left but this was not okay.  It was disgusting in flavor and texture.  If this is a new menu feature, please warn people because many are allergic to egg whites.  Taco Bell has better bean and cheese burritos.  Disgusting."}
{"text":"I have been to Los Taquitos at least 50 times.  I have frequented every location in the valley due to work travel.   I have never,  I repeat,  never been let down by the awesomeness of their food.   Don't believe the trolling of a couple people... More than likely competitors that are scared...  try it for yourself.   The street tacos are awesome but I tend to fall back on my usual,  the pollo torta (chicken sandwich).  I also get a side of rice as well as some pico to mix in with it.   It's fabulous!!"}
{"text":"Service is extremely slow and food mediocre at best. While standing in line waiting for my food I watched two co-workers argue with each other."}
{"text":"That was one of the worst burritos I have ever eaten in my life. The chicken was so salty I am still drinking water in an attempt to rehydrate myself. The refried beans in the burrito were watery. For some reason they threw in some chopped red onions.  Chips and salsa, not included, $3.99 extra  I'm done"}
{"text":"One of the best MX food restaurants I have been to! I am a regular."}
{"text":"When to Los Taquitos looking for shrimp tacos.  Not spectacular.  Beans okay and breakfast burrito good but the help was not.  It was very cold inside as if they decided not to turn on the heat or they do not have heat.  When I commented on the cold to the gal taking our order we just got a shoulder shrug and yeah.  We probably will never go back."}
{"text":"My husband just had to try this place way before the renovation because of the Diners Drive ins and dives place featured them at one point. Really great street tacos and quesadillas! The chicken on the salad is a little dry so I'd recommend getting it on other things. The new renovation looks great and gives the place more room for sure! It is our go to place for tacos."}
{"text":"I remember seeing the Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives that featured Los Taquitos, but never got the urge to drive all the way down to Ahwatukee to try it out, so when the sign went up in the center near my office I was excited!  The interior is really modern and they have a huge bar, which from what I hear, is very different from the original location, but they are trying to step it up a notch!  You still order at the counter and get a number, which I love, and take out doesn't take that long either.  I have tried the chicken quesadilla and the carne asada quesadilla and loved them both.  The green salsa goes great with the chicken quesadilla, which was a helpful tip from one of the owners.  One of the best parts of the quesadilla experience here is that it is not greasy at all!  They use a white cheese (jack I think) and use just enough to make it cheesy without overwhelming it with grease, plus they cut them up in cute little squares that makes it great for sharing.  They also have good guacamole.  The only downside so far is the beans....they are a bit on the runny side....but with so many other options at reasonable prices...I guess I can overlook this!"}
{"text":"Wow! Is really all we can say. My wife and I came down from Portland Oregon for a weekend of food & fun.  First stop was here.  We LOVED IT! Great service and food.  Best carnitas tacos we've ever had!  Don't miss this place if you are in Phoenix."}
{"text":"If I lived in Phoenix, I'd be a regular. It was 4 p.m. and we hadn't had lunch after a day at IKEA - and we all know how IKEA wipes you out! So, we needed to find something asap that accommodated four different tastes - this fit the bill.   I ordered the  asada, pollo, and pastor street tacos. The asada was my favorite. The beans and rice were tasty too.   The food was flavorful and affordable and the wall art was great; the floor could have been a bit cleaner, but overall, a great find!"}
{"text":"appalling food, unfit for human consumption  food here while cheap, is utterly disgusting, while I am used to spicy food and love mexican food, and dislike the food provided by certain chains, the food here was the worst I have ever come across, the flavors were uniquely revolting, and the food so hot no one in my family was able to really taste the food. While we ordered different items, I do not at all in my right mind recommend the burrito bombero, or in that case anything on the menu. - and the other listing which says los taquitos Mexican grill, is the same place as this one, do not know why it is listed twice"}
{"text":"I'm a BIG fan of Los Taquitos! I've been searching for a nice hole in the wall taqueria since I moved from California in 2009. .   The tacos are superb. You can mix and match meats-carne, pollo, pork etc.  I could have probably eaten about 10 tacos.  On my taco combo place (3 tacos, rice and beans) i chose 2 carne and one marinated pork. Both flavors were excellent. I think I may have preferred the pork slightly over the carne. Both meats had a little bit of a bite, which is nice.  I really liked the taste and texture of the rice. The beans were good, not my favorite refried beans I've had.   Coke products are served out  of the fountain. There is also bottled Coke and Orange Crush (personal favorites) among some other sodas..  The menu is pretty diverse and has all the standard fare-tacos, burritos, tamales, tortas, enchiladas etc.  Overall a great meal at a very reasonable price per dish.  Can't wait to head back and try other items!"}
{"text":"Best tongue tacos in town. They are just nice and fresh, with a great green sauce. It can get really crowded at lunch, but usually they get food out quick and it's worth it."}
{"text":"Eat somewhere else.  Horribly slow service and food isn't worth waiting for!  Oh yeah, and there's hardly any seating either."}
{"text":"Awesome pozole! I was pleasantly surprised that the pozole was so similar to my mother in law's own recipe. Yum yummmmmm yummmmmm! Good pork, lots of hominy, and served with lettuce/cilantro/onions to mix in.The bowl was a great deal for $6. I've also had my fair share of tacos on Taco Tuesday and I have zero complaints there! My personal fave is the carnitas tacos."}
{"text":"Best carne asada street tacos ever. Also, best ever green or red sauce on their enchiladas you have ever tasted. Long live Los Taquitos!!!!"}
{"text":"I've had good burritos and bad burritos. But this one was bad at a different level.   Worst. Veggie. Burrito.   Ever. Do *not* eat here."}
{"text":"One star because 0 Is not an option.  It took 20 minutes to get a cheese quesadilla and 3 burritos, which were wrong. The little \"girl\" behind the counter, Mercedes, was argumentative and rude.  Save your self time and aggravation and go someplace else."}
{"text":"Decent, AZ burro was pretty small, so a lot of overlapping tortilla."}
{"text":"Over the past 4 months, they have hired new people. Unfortunately, the new people are rude. Not to mention the food has gone down in quality. I ordered something off the menu and the lady said \"no we aren't doing that because we are too busy\". Huh?  The owner better fix this because everyone in my office eats there once a week and there will be about 20 regular customers you are going to lose."}
{"text":"I saw this place on the Food Network show \"Diners Drive-ins and Dives\", I had been going to the Chinese restaurant a few doors down and never stopped in until yesterday, and I'm glad I did.   This Family owned Mexican Restaurant has been serving some of the best Mexican food in Phoenix since 1981. Run by five sisters and one brother, they have passed down recipes from their families generations, and serve them up with large portions. Unlike the standard Sonaran style restaurants in the Phoenix area, they have brought flavors from Mexico that will thrill your taste buds. Not too hot but flavorful extraordinaire.  If your in the south east side of Phoenix, you have to try this place, be ready for the wait though, I had a 25 min wait for food, but it is 100% worth it...  Remember to look at the Specials menu, I almost missed one of my favorite dishes chilaquiles, Loved them as a kind and still do, must have with Egg.   Funny it was not in Yelp when I went to write this review..."}
{"text":"Decor is cute that's about the best thing about this place, food has no flavor, like they used no spices while cooking:( Rice and beans were so sad..and staff to focused on each other, save your money."}
{"text":"Delicious burritos! I love the food and so do my friends who actually know authentic Mexican food. The folks behind the counter are delightful. The only downside is the wait if you come after 11:30am - but that's because it's so popular because the food is so yummy. Give it a try."}
{"text":"My husband and I decided to eat here on a recommendation from a friend who visits Phoenix often.  Bottom line - we loved this place!!!! Great food, great prices! Staff was very friendly. We both also loved the decor.  We both ordered street tacos which had tremendous flavor and good portion size with sides of rice and beans.  Would highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Have to say, we went here only because of DDD, not what was expected.  We did not see the show, but saw the reviews here.  There's got to be better mexican food in Phoenix, but maybe we are spoiled coming from Southern California.  It was just OK."}
{"text":"I'd love to give this place a 5, but the food and service are inconsistent. We've gotten amazing taquitos here, and other times they've been burnt to a crisp and old tasting. Love the flavor of the beans, but the consistency is too thin and watery. The service you get will entirely depend on who is working at the counter -- one girl in particular is amazing, the others average, and one is always terrible. The horchata tastes like red hot candies (cloyingly sweet with artificial flavor) so I never bother, but I like both their red and green salsas. Definitely tends to be on the dirty side (floors, tables, etc.)."}
{"text":"Everything that we ordered, including rice and beans tasted like fish.  Even the red chili burrito that was covered is sauce tasted like fish.  They obviously don't clean surfaces or utensils after handling fish, let alone who knows what else.  Disgusting.  Would never go back."}
{"text":"I'm coming back everyday!! I'm a New England native and know really  good fish! This place is clean, the fish is amazing and so are the prices !!!"}
{"text":"So good!  Every time I have ever been here the food has been awesome and the staff are always very friendly. My personal favorite is the shrimp taco plate, I think I know what I'm getting for dinner tonight"}
{"text":"I've been here several times since they opened this location. I love everything here! Tasty carne asada tacos, bean tosadas, al pastor, menudo, chips with pico salsa and guacamole. The food is truly authentic and taste homemade. Felt like I'd find my nana and tio in their kitchen. My new favorite spot for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Been coming here since 2002. Consistently delish. The new renovations are great for the family.   Every time I've come lately they haven't had carrots and jalepenos. I miss them. Bummer."}
{"text":"Enchilada red sauce is tremendous! Tacos can't be beat, especially for $1 during happy hour. Refried beans are fabulous and margarita's are cheap and delicious. Pollo, carne asada and carnitas are all great.  Ambience is not great."}
{"text":"The most authentic Mexican food in the area. Customer service is always good however they do get very busy around the dinner hour and lunch hour. Helpful tip, the tacos are street tacos which means they are very small so order four or five of them."}
{"text":"Street tacos are fantastic!  Nothing fancy for a dining experience but the food makes up for it!"}
{"text":"Los Taquitos is apparently quite successful. I know this before I take one bite of food, because their children are running in and out of the kitchen and around the customers' seating area playing tag and sounding like what I imagine a pack of rabid chimps might sound like. Only people completely unconcerned about where their next paycheck is coming from have the luxury of being as oblivious to their customers as this. The stories I've read on Yelp back me up on this - lines out the door? The food must be stunning.  Guy Fieri certainly seemed to think so, but then again, doesn't he always. Me, not so much. I got the taco/enchilada/tamale combo plate, and nothing on the plate was more complex or interesting than anything I could get at Taco Hell for half the price. The enchilada was bland and boring. The tamale was dry, but at least there was bottled taco sauce to put on it, how nice. The beans and rice tasted like... nothing. Wet porridge and dry porridge? Cutting edge stuff - if you live in a nursing home.   The sole exception to this crap parade was the beef taco, which was extremely tasty. Too bad that even that was ruined by its size (just North of a silver dollar in circumference) and the fact that it had been unceremoniously dumped on top of the enchilada, rendering it too slippery to hold.  So if your idea of a great taco shack experience is eating two tablespoons of great taco meat with a fork surrounded by formica and fail, then you're in luck. For my part, I think I'll chalk this up as another Fieri fiasco. I doubt anyone at Los Taquitos will care - why should they? They've obviously got all the customers they need."}
{"text":"We followed our yelp lead to this awesome place! It is a great lunch place- fresh ingredients and the super low price point! The help was very friendly and despite our long wait we were glad we went! We even went back on taco Tuesday.  We're all tacos are $1 (in retrospect we would skip taco Tuesday as full price is only $1,50 and we wouldn't have to wait one hour for 4 tacos ... Nope I'm not kidding) this is a great place in Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"Nice place with a fun ambiance. The tacos are good. I've had better but I would recommend this place if you are in the area. The best meat was the carnitas. Lots of flavor and juicy. Definitely do the carnitas on whatever you get. The Asada had a nice grill flavor. The Asada could have been slightly juicier but it wasn't dry. The pastor was good. Had a hint of spice and overall pretty good. The Asada and the pastor would tie for my second favorite. The chicken was nothing special and my least favorite. It didn't really have much flavor and was on the drier side. All in all pretty good but if you are willing to drive about 20 minutes there are a number of places that I would choose first. The price was right for the tacos at $1.50 each. You can fit 8 adults at the booths and there was plenty of seating otherwise."}
{"text":"It's Ahwatukee. There are some awesome Mexican restaurants (Los Dos Molinos, Z Tejas if New Mexican works for you), but they come at a price.  This is not where most people would go for authentic Mexican food.  Los Taquitos is just about perfect for what it is.  The food is delicious and the prices are on par with Filibertos, without tasting like Filibertos.  It makes complete sense Food Network featured this restaurant once you take a bite.  Cons: It's in a strip mall between a Safeway and haircut place and a Walgreens and dive bar (Cactus Jacks), service is rushed, and condiments and hot sauce are available only if the restaurant isn't packed (usually isn't) and they're at the stand up front.  Pros: Everything that matters.  Food is authentic and tasty, you can come here anytime for a hangover \"breakfast\" or lunch or dinner, and you can expect that whatever you order off the menu will come exactly as you'd hope (or better).   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The carne asada tacos were great. I had a bean burrito and bean tostada and I thought the beans were a little bland. Also the location off Elliot didn't have sopes or dessert. I'm not sure if the other location has it but I saw it on the online menu. Other than that I think it's a great taco spot and still want to try the enchiladas. Can't go wrong here!"}
{"text":"There are some businesses you really want to root for and hope they do well. Los Taquitos is one of those businesses for me.  The best thing about this location is the pretty ladies that work there.  :)  I've been here twice to lackluster dining experiences.  Today I ordered the special which was a chimichanga and drink for $6.99. Not bad except for the fact I got the wrong chimichanga. I got chicken instead the beef chimichanga I ordered.  I also ordered the rolled tacos which is an order of 3 taquitos for $5.25.  If the food were of gourmet quality I could easily see paying that but for the quality, the amount served should be twice that.  The rolled tacos are OK just way over-priced.  I'd really like to give this place one more try which is something that I never due after two really mediocre experiences.  They do serve beer and wine so it might just be a nice place to relax and have some chips and salsa.  I've only been during lunch when I'm the only person in the restaurant. Maybe the cool crowd hangs here during the evenings. Who knows?  We'll see."}
{"text":"The tacos are delicious! I usually get the fish tacos. The prices are reasonable. My new favorite place for tacos."}
{"text":"Green chili burrito was juicy and delicious.  Place was clean.  Staff was friendly.  It's a typical low-cost Mexican dive, just as you'd expect.  I'll go again."}
{"text":"Good food but not the best service. They need to work on their customer service. I'll eat here again but I wish the girls were nicer"}
{"text":"Great food and cheap prices - $1.00 street tacos for Happy Hour! We always get the chicken and carnitas street tacos. Delicious. The street tacos come with cilantro and onions on them, yum yum. I like the red sauce they have, it's kind of spicy though. Haven't tried anything other than the street tacos because they are just too good"}
{"text":"I went here for a Friday lunch and really enjoyed it. I read that it had been featured on Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives so of course, I wanted to go! The interior is cute. Set up where you can sit and enjoy your lunch but after work you can post up at the bar and sip on something yummy. I wish I had the chance to try one of their margs but alas, I had work to get done at my job. I got the AZ Style burrito meal and also a chicken taco. The chicken taco was free because I checked in on Foursquare. Love Foursquare deals. The tortilla was amazing, super soft and chewy and not hard/stale or thin/transparent. The potatoes were thick cube cut and the pollo was seasoned with something not too spicy. I should have asked for it without onions, they were tiny but I'm not a fan in general. They have an array of salsas to choose from, but the bottles weren't labeled so I was a little hesitant on what I was getting myself into so I stayed clear.  It is certainly a hole in the wall but the food is just fabulous!"}
{"text":"A group of my friends & me went to Los Taquitos needless to say, a total disappointment the food was bland, hardly any seasoned to the meat, and the prices a bit high. Unquestionably first and last."}
{"text":"On holidays and looking for something different for dinner we decided on Mexican. We opted for Los Taquitos because it was close to where we were staying and we found information online that said Guy Fieri had visited one of their sister locations with good reviews. We browsed the menu online before placing our order in the store. The lady who took our order was amazing and soooo patient. This after my going through and taking the cilantro off and adding lettuce and cheese to three out of four of the menu items I ordered. Two of the people in our party ordered burritos (shrimp and green chile pork) and the other two ordered street tacos (carnitas and asada) and between us we tried the tostadas (carnitas and asada). The shrimp burrito was good with a little bit of spice (possibly in the wrap)?, my hubby enjoyed the green chile burrito but wished it had been a tad bit spicier. I had the carnita and asada street tacos which were delicious. The asada was so tender and so savoury, I am a big fan of the carnita but this time I completely favoured the asada. The tostadas were delicious - crisp shell, beans, meat, cheese and lettuce. My mum loved the refried beans, said they were the best she has ever had, the rice equally good. Our only complaint was that the guacamole was a bit bland but the rest of the food more than made up for that. We didn't eat in the restaurant but this place had a funky casual vibe so maybe that is something to try next time!"}
{"text":"Felt like this was a solid, casual mexican restaurant. They have a great variety of vegetarian and non-vegetarian options and I got to try a little of everything my family had.  The positives: the food was good, the price was good for the quantity, the salsas were delicious The not so positives: I've had better horchata, the food was not freshly warm when it came out and ended up getting cold by the middle of the meal!  More on the dishes I tried:   The bombero burrito had a special smokey tasting spicy sauce on top, if you're not a fan of smokey flavors, don't get it. The grilled veggie burrito had spicy potatoes inside along with other veggies, maybe it could use less potatoes though...overall pretty tasty! Chicken and cheese enchilladas: the chicken is not a shredded chicken, so it was not the classic taste for an enchilada, but it was still pretty good. The cheese enchilada was solid.  Hard shell chicken taco: again, the chicken is not shredded, it's cut into smaller pieces and is cooked with spices, but the lack of juiciness in the meat leads to a little less enjoyment of the items that have chicken in them. Otherwise, the taco shell was super crispy and delicious.  Fish burrito: made with tilapia that has a nice char to the pieces of tilapia, the burrito was delicious with rice, lettuce, and tomatoes in it too. overall it was a great choice of my fiance's Horchata: as I mentioned above, it was a little on the watered down side, so nothing great. But I still love having some to cool down the spicy, oniony, garlicky flavors that can be in the food!"}
{"text":"Great food, great prices, great atmosphere....period.  I have gone to several places around town and always return to Los Taquitos. My family has liked it from our first bite.   I have recommended it to severals friends an they have enjoyed their food."}
{"text":"The Dank"}
{"text":"Finally! A place for good tacos! I'm from southern CA and love Baja style tacos and finally found some here in AZ. Homemade refried beans were yummy too and good rice! I had a prickly pear margarita with my meal which was a bonus. It's in a strip mall and it feels fast-foody (you order at the counter) but I didn't mind that. Will definitely be back when I want Mexican food."}
{"text":"I really wish I could give zero stars..so I would visit this place at least twice a week for there amazing carne asada burritos...one Thursday night I arrived about 15 minutes to closing paid for my burrito while waiting I witnessed one of the cooks in the back pick his nose with plastic cloves on in view of the workers in the back and the ladies at the front taking orders and he continues to prepare food...grossed out I confronted the dumb broads at the counter who acted like they didn't know what I was talking about..i asked for my money back and immediately left..i always have my phone in hand this night I left it in my car so I could run in pick up my to go order and leave oh boy how I wish I could of caught this all on camera..never again will I eat at this place..and I advise everyone else to eat here with caution!!!!"}
{"text":"Happened to stumble upon Los Taquitos while my hubby was getting his haircut at the salon next door. I had already eaten, so I grabbed a takeout menu to browse while checking the place out. Interior was very clean and i am a sucker for a place that has a chalkboard menu. (yah, I know) Tried it out about a week later because the menu is a la carte(big plus if you want authentic food that is not suffocated with cheese) and I was not disappointed! Ordered the shrimp burrito and a bowl of pozole. Husband got a green tamale and fish taco. The shrimp burrito had a delicious white sauce that  I couldn't get enough of.  Their pozole is red and comes with fresh cilantro, minced red onion, lettuce, and tortillas on the side. The broth was flavorful and the pork super tender.  It even had just a slight oiliness on the top from the pork fat that I recognize as authentic pozole. Everything was EXCELLENT and came out piping hot .(not on a heated plate!)  I am going back tonight for some more!"}
{"text":"This place has real deal Mexican food and it always tastes amazing!  They forget things with your order here sometimes or forget to put in call in orders but trust me it is a minor inconvenience compared to how good it is and they fix it quickly!  The line out the door everyday at lunch should be your first clue to eat here many times a week as I do when I am in town from California!!!"}
{"text":"So good. Get on here and taco. My work friends and I went here, and everybody loved it. They were very thankful for my Yelp savvy, and visiting this place. Delightful and fresh and good prices."}
{"text":"I'm from NM and have been searching for a good bowl of pozole.  Well I've finally found something really close from a tip by a friend.  It's not really spicy but you can add some of their red sauce.  Only $6 for bowl.  Great deal and great food."}
{"text":"When I'm hungover we crawl to Los Taquitos and I usually get a big bowl of posole to heal my wounds.  It is so damn good.  They give you the necessary extras like red onions chopped, cilantro, limes, and tapatio.  You can either get corn (my preference) or flour tortillas to dip in your soup.  Out of all the things I have ordered, (besides the breakfast burritos) the posole is my absolute favorite and has never let me down."}
{"text":"Ehhh...My husband got tacos, they were pretty good! I got tamales because I am a sucker for homemade tamales, they were the worst tamales I have ever had. They were super dry, no flavor, very little meat. Just plain gross. I will stick to making my own. It was just ok, we would maybe go back for tacos but it was nothing amazing. I think I'm missing the hype."}
{"text":"My co-worker and I stopped in on the recommendation of other co-workers for Taco Tuesday. We arrived shortly after noon and there was a line out the door. We had a debate on sticking it out since we only have 45 minutes but the line appeared to move quickly so we stayed. Our mistake. While the line did move fairly quickly that was about it. We both placed our orders. I ordered 3 carnitas tacos (at $1.00 apiece on Tuesday it's a great deal!) and chips and guacamole. We both placed our orders to go. Time on my receipt was 12:23. Ok- we can do this. We have a small window now but it was doable with a to-go order. Or so we thought! We did not get our order until 1:11. While we waited there was plenty of time to observe. Orders sat ready to be packaged to go for many minutes while the in restaurant guests received their orders first. Typically someone who places a to-go order is in more of a rush than a dine in customer yet they received priority. Talking with other customers it was discovered Tuesday's are normally busy. Heck we even tried to call in our order from the line to speed it up and they declined. The gentleman in front of us left. He returned later and saw us still waiting for food so he left AGAIN! His business was lost twice on one day! There must be a better and more efficient way to handle Taco Tuesday when your business is tacos. Finally 30 min late returning from lunch (thank GOD for an understanding boss), I sat at my desk to eat my tacos and chips/guacamole.  The tacos were really good. The carnitas was tender and had a good flavor. A bit more spice then I was expecting but it wasn't over powering. The onion and cilantro on top helped add to the flavor. Very good tacos. I don't know about worthy of a 45 min wait from order to receiving good but they were good. The chips were nice and warm and lightly salted. The guacamole was decent. Not spectacular but not horrible. I'd like to return on a day other then Tuesday and see if service is quicker and try some other flavors of street tacos. There's room for improvement however it wasn't completely a disaster. The tacos made up for some of it."}
{"text":"Not ooc, but definitely Mexican food as it should be: inexpensive and delicious. Tried all four of their rolled tacos [chicken, steak, two diff types of pork] which were exactly what you'd expect from your prototypical place. There was very friendly service and they were quite prompt.  Luckily we missed out on the lunch rush, as it was Tuesday Taco Day [rolled tacos for $1] when we happened to arrive. The chicken chimi was the hero for the day, far surpassing the four different tacos we tried. Two house salsas available [green and red] that were good but not great. I'd definitely eat here again, but it isn't memorable enough to bring me in from out of the city"}
{"text":"Had the 3 taco (fish) combo.  Great portion,  great price.  Place was packed pre-lunch crowd.  If you are a fan of street tacos this is the place to go to."}
{"text":"Just went there for the first time tonight and had the asada street taco meal. The food was great to put it simply. The rice and beans were definitely good but the highlight was the tacos. The meat was exceptionally good. On top of great food they have an excellent atmosphere and the woman who took my order was really nice and friendly. I will definitely be going again soon"}
{"text":"Love this place.  It is my go to when I have had a hard day.  While the inside is small, the artwork is great and really I mostly get my stuff to go.  Meat:  Carne asada is great, chicken is great, marinated pork is nice and spicy, carnitas are awesome.  Burritos:  Basic but tasted good.  Bombero: Wow, what an experience.  It is spicy enough you don't really want the marinated pork as it's filler, but it is wonderful no matter what you fill it with, the spicy sauce that is poured over it is what maked it.  Tacos: $1 tacos on Tuesdays!! (except they do charge 30 cents extra for flour tortillas instead of corn)  Tastes like what I fell in love with in Rocky Point street vendors.  Enchiladas: Excellent, nothing fancy but made right and is so good.  Will update as I change up my choices."}
{"text":"The Best Breakfast Burrito! Served all Day! Get the Supreme Breakfast Burrito you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"OMG.. they call this a burrito.. the beef was so salty, I couldn't eat it! Don't waste your time!"}
{"text":"Yum, yum, yummy! This place serves amazing Mexican food. Nothing fancy, just high-quality ingredients simply prepared so you can really taste their wonderful flavors. The vegetarian burrito is delicious. Dip it into the yummy salsas, and eat the spicy carrots with fresh lime juice squeezed on top while you wait for your food. This place gets busy at lunch and dinner time, so plan around that if you don't want to wait."}
{"text":"Very excited to have these guys here in Chandler! Their carne is the best I've ever had! I had the carne asada bowl, excellent! Great service, great atmosphere. Already looking forward to my next trip :)"}
{"text":"I went to Los Taquitos. The girl at the counter pocketed the cash and messed my order up.  Not a great experience."}
{"text":"Green Chili Pork burrito was juicy and delicious.  Taco salad with shredded beef was excellent - served in a fresh tasty tortilla bowl."}
{"text":"Ignacia was slow and not ready to start when they opened. She has bad customer service and mannerisms. She put her hat on, put cash in the drawer, and put cups out. All after they opened. Small things that show she doesn't care. Put her in the back, somewhere away from customers. Food is good though."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great service! I had the pollo az burrito meal and it was excellente!"}
{"text":"We stopped by here for the street tacos as the highly recommended by many yelpers.  Overall this place was average. We had both the Pollo tacos and the asada  tacos. They were exactly what you expect. Very straightfoward flavors. were tasty but nothing amazing. The Guacamole was good but again nothing amazing.  Price was about $8 for three small street tacos, no sides,  and was a good lunch portion. Again reasonably priced but not a great deal.  There are other taco shops in the area that I would go to before this one (Santos Lucha Libre)"}
{"text":"I dropped in here 3-4 years ago and had some nice tacos.  Although good, I guess they weren't spectacular enough to bring me back.  I got takeout for 6 people Sunday (this place open later than the superior Burrito Co.).  This was not a good experience, but I perhaps will give them another try some day.  I arrived at the restaurant estimated ready time stated during our phone order.  They are busy.  There was just a single funnel line and I had to stand at the end behind numerous people placing their orders, rather than walk up for the phone order I expected to be ready.  Over 10 minutes later I got to the front -- order not ready and I hear a shout to the kitchen to get the phone order ready.  I pay and wait.  At least another 10 minutes pass and I am motioned back to the counter.  Looking at my notes, I see a couple of identical burrito orders and I have the foresight to ask if there are two of those in the bags.  The woman checks -- there is one.  She shouts back to the kitchen to get another one ready and apologizes.  I resume waiting.  When she calls me back she says all is ready and she threw in something else for my wait.  My destination is 5 minutes from this location.  I drive back to my wating guests.  When the food is all laid out, there is an order of 3 tacos (mine) also missing.  The beans are all cold.  I also had ordered a chile relleno with beans only.  It is good, but not enough, and it's got rice.    I'm sure everyone has had their takeout order messed up.  That's 3 strikes on the same order, though.  Since I didn't get any tacos this time, which is what seems to be the signature item here, I can't comment on those, but the chile relleno, cold beans, and taste I got of a burrito, were merely good.  Maybe I'll drop in again within the next 3 years."}
{"text":"Affordable and great food packed with flavor. Had the lengua bowl and it was amazing!"}
{"text":"Awesome tacos! When you normally think of eating tacos in Arizona you may associate those thoughts with food that you have had in Texas or New Mexico. Not so at this place. The street tacos at Los Taquitos are more like the type that you would expect to get in Mexico. The carne asada is fabulous, and the pastor (marinated pork) is awesome as well. On Tuesdays many of the taco selections are dirt cheap. I'm also a big fan of their pazole. Some of the other menu items seem run of the mill to me though. To sum up, it's all about the tacos!"}
{"text":"Awesome tacos!! Great if you want to have a beer or margarita instead of just a drive-thru street taco which are so prevalent in Phoenix.   $1 Taco Tuesday is a real deal!  I also tried the Pozole: YUMMMM"}
{"text":"I flew into Phoenix on a very early flight--arriving around 8:30am, but with the time change, I was ready for lunch. I was so pleased to find this place, not far from the airport, and open early on a Sunday. I was pleasantly surprised to see how full it was at 9:30am on a Sunday--a good sign! And I definitely wasn't disappointed--the pastor tacos were wonderful. I wish I lived closer...."}
{"text":"We finally had the chance to stop and try Los Taquitos- El Bombadero (I'm sure i butchered that spelling) was by far the best of the four meals we had- but they were all tasty and left us full, satisfied and willing to come back again soon!"}
{"text":"Simply magnificent. Easily the best Mexican food I've had the pleasure of enjoying in the States. I can't stop thinking about the carne asada Torta. The rice and beans are the best I've eaten. Tacos are simple and delicious. The most exciting part about it is that I get to go back and try the famed Bombero Burrito and other, more \"exotic\" things like the lengua and menudo!  You must go!"}
{"text":"These girls sure do know how to make tacos! I love the tacos and the amazing salsas. Best Mexican joint in the valley by far. Not to mention the ladies working here are muy bonitas!"}
{"text":"The food is the reason for the rating.  I've tried almost all of the caucasian-eating food on the menu (i don't do tongue or internal organs).  Everything has been excellent, and the red sauce ties it all together.    The only distraction I had was the service.  Maybe they were too busy, maybe the place is too small for people over 6 feet tall... i'm not sure what it was, but all the employees I've seen are cold, impersonal, and stiff.  It could also be a first-impression thing, because of an incident that happened during my first visit.  I had ordered and paid for my food, then I backed away from the counter so the next group in line could order (remember, this place is too small).  The employee yells out my number for pickup, and when I raised my hand, the cashier hands the tray to me over the heads of shorter customers at the counter.  I didn't mind since I'm a little taller than most, but I felt for the ladies under my tray.  If food is your thing, then you need to try this place.  If service is your thing, then you should keep searching for another place."}
{"text":"DO NOT EAT HERE! Save your money! This place is disgusting.  My wife and I purchased a Carne Asada Burrito Bowl and a Carnitas Burrito Bowl.  In both of them the rice tasted old, the carne was chewy, fatty and bland.  The carnitas was super sweet and it tasted as though there were marshmallows in it.  Then there was some weird chewy purple thing that stopped me mid-chew, it was the texture of soggy newspaper and did I mention it was purple.   WTH was in my food??? I will NOT be eating here again, ever!"}
{"text":"Not bad for airport food for $4.50, breakfast burrito.  Salsa was good and the staff were very friendly."}
{"text":"The tacos are good, not great. The salsas aren't very flavorful. The biggest issue would be the tiny amount of chips you get with chips and salsa or guacamole. Pathetic. They were pricy too for the tiny portions. It's a nice environment though."}
{"text":"This place is my guilty pleasure! My personal favorite is the shrimp burrito but the tacos (carne asada and al pastor) are a close second. You can't argue with authentic, family recipes at great prices!"}
{"text":"Wow the new digs are great and the food stayed awesome! Staff was good. Just a great update to a great place. Love it"}
{"text":"Don't go on Taco Tuesday.  Stood in line for 15 minutes and then waited 30 minutes for our order.  They couldn't handle the volume and were more focused on the phone orders (you could see the orders piling up on the back counter) than the 15 customers standing in front of them waiting for their food."}
{"text":"Love this place!! Everything is good here.  The menudo and street tacos are really good.  Clean and friendly."}
{"text":"I came here first time to try this food cuz of the reviews I got the street taco combo man it was the bomb clean place nice cashier I drove over 10 miles just to try it. I just found a new favorite spot They get a 10 plus"}
{"text":"Been coming to this place for about 3 years and it seems every time we return it gets worse. Today walking into the place the tables were dirty and there was a smell in the place that said \" i need a good cleaning\". I ordered a Carne Asada burrito and when I opened it to add green sauce all I saw was a tablespoon of Carne meat. I took it up and showed the cashier girl. Her response was of bewilderment when she pointed with her pen at the tablespoon of Carne meat. I then explained to her that in a Carne Asada burrito the Carne is the main ingredient not the beans and salsa. They remedied the situation by adding more meat but I should have to go up and show them proper portioning. Another person in the party got nachos with beef. To me nachos mean the chips topped with lots of cheese and whatever else you add as a topping. Well needless to say the nacho chips barely had a tablespoon of cheese on them. Inconsistent food, dirty environment, rude staff and not a positive experience. Many a time I vowed not to return but this was my last visit. Too many places in the area that care about quality of food and customer service. I also worked in the industry so I'm familiar with what a customer wants and expects when they walk into a food esyablishment."}
{"text":"Finally Los Taquitos in Chandler! Had it twice this weekend already. Carne Asada was as good as ever and the Pastor torta was excellent. I'll be grabbing the breakfast burritos on the way to work now!"}
{"text":"Excellent food...nice moist tamales, great carne asada...ordered $45 worth of food and it was all good.  The service is excellent as well.  Very nice people.  Highly recomended.  Its funny but in Arizona, where you would think you would find bomb mexican food, good authentic mexican food is rare.  I love this place...will deffinatly be back!!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the tastiest tacos. Many places claim to have street tacos and subsequently fall flat on implementation. These ladies do not. Tortillas make the taco just as much as the ingredients, and they do that really well also. For the price this is easily a 5 star taco."}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of this place I used to go two or three times a week. Now that they have expanded their restaurant the food does not taste the same the prices have gone up and the burritos have gotten smaller. Very very disappointed I would go as far as to say heartbroken  definitely one of my favorite spots in the valley and I don't know if I'll ever go back."}
{"text":"Second time here. New remodel since I've been here. Looks nice.   With that being said - the food quality has gone way downhill. It's flat out terrible actually. Poor, hard, dry chicken. El pastor isn't shaved - rather small ground pieces soaking in a red sauce. No limes, no guac w/ tacos. And the beans - mushy, unappealing, and under-seasoned. I wouldn't serve those beans to my dog. The place stays busy at lunch (cheap food I'd guess) Streams and streams of people. They must have no clue what Mexican food is. Definitely won't be back. Never. Adios. Believe the other negative reviews - I didn't - I wish I would have.   This is phoenix people. Find a more \"authentic\" spot and you'll be much happier."}
{"text":"Good food!  I learned of Los Taquitos from Guy Fieri's Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives, and had to check it out.  The place is tiny, but it was packed the entire time my friend and I munched down on their tasty bites!  I ordered the Bombarro (?) Burro, as it was made on the show, and its HOT! But so good!  I ordered my husband street tacos to go, and he inhaled them.  Best advise would be to call in your order for pick up, as not much seating available because of the seemingly non-stop flow of customers."}
{"text":"Love this place. I get El Bombero every time I eat here. Authentic Mexican and great for takeout too."}
{"text":"We stopped there after a short hike nearby. All four of us had different choices and we all agreed it was great."}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food. Taco Tuesday is a good way to experience this place. The food and is very good. Friendly staff. Would definitely recommend and I'll be back. Breakfast burritos are delicious too."}
{"text":"My first visit was to the 7000 N 16 St Location, Wed, May 4.  I ate steak burrito with a Sprite. Sooooo yyuuuummmmyyyy. The BEST ever tasted, EVER!!  Clean and comfortable. \"Yesi\" was very hospitable, explained the different menu items for me. I will frequent Los Taquitos."}
{"text":"I went to Los Taqutios last weekend. There was a play at the Ahtawukee Children's Theater that day and after the play, we grabbed lunch. We went at 3:00 P.M. and I was expecting more people to be there. It was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives so I wanted to go. I got a carneasada burrito with no beans. It's not that beans make me gassy, I just don't like them. At the first few bites, it was flavorless. I could barely taste the cheese, the meat was dry, plus the burrito wrap (bread) was the most flavorful thing in the burrito believe it or not. The burrito got better on each bite, but it wasn't the best Mexican meal I've ever had. I enjoyed my burrito. You know that cliche saying \"The first bite's always the best.\" It was the other way around with the burrito. The other people that were with me were happy, except for one. She had a  shrimp taco, a fish taco, carnitas burrito and she said it was a little bland. The other person with me is the only one out of us 3 who really enjoyed his meal beginning to end but, he also gave it 3 stars. The place is a little dirty. There was a piece of tomato    on the seat at the booth we sat at. The service was friendly. What confused me was that on the menu, it said that they have Mr. Pibb but, on the soda machine it said Dr. Pepper so that confused me. We drove home with a full belly and an o.k. meal."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food, cheap and greasy, but authentically good. I had the veggie tacos and loved them.  I will try this again."}
{"text":"I can't get enough of the street tacos! I grew up in the Midwest and when I moved here three years ago a friend brought me here and I always come back! Excellent service!"}
{"text":"Really great, cheap street tacos! I usually get 3 chicken tacos and a side of rice. The tacos are only $1 on Tuesdays, so I end up going there almost every week. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is very good . I would recommend it to anyone . Love the green sauce enchiladas and the carne asada tacos ."}
{"text":"The restraunt was well lit and nicely decorated. There were no people cleaning and bussing the tables so they were dirty unless you wiped them down. There was also food and crumbs on the floor under ever table. The food took forever to come but it was very good once I got it. I ordered the chicken bowl. It was full of chicken but there was not much else in it. Some rice and black beans. It seems to be a little over priced for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"I was sitting on my couch figuring out where to get a good hamburger when Diners, Drive Inns, and Dives came on and there it was Los Taquitos.  Just ten minutes away too.  I drove over to this little hole in the wall and got the Bombero with carnitas.  The sauce on top was...the bomb!  Sweet, spicy, smoky kind of like a mole sauce.  I had the meal with rice and beans which was good to soak up all that heavenly sauce.  I will definitely be going there again."}
{"text":"0 stars for service, but food tasted good, so 2 stars. Took over 25 minutes to get our order. 10 orders past our number, I inquired if our food was ready. After talking to the back, they said 5 more min with no apology. When our food was ready, I asked if there was a reason why ours took so long and she said it was because of our one fish taco. Again, no apology (and fish is the fastest protein to cook on their menu...)"}
{"text":"Average, not the best or worst.  A little salty for my taste."}
{"text":"This place is Awesome. Always a friendly smile to take your order. The food is so good and authentic. Great prices too. Wish there were more locations."}
{"text":"Happenin' little place - cool mural, simple menu, lots of smiling faces and some pretty tasty food.  Can't beat tacos for a buck on Tuesday!  Not really ideal for solo take-out, end up twiddling your thumbs for 15 minutes.  Margaritas next time!"}
{"text":"Really great green Chile pork burritos!!!! Wonderful house made margarita. I'm really picky and enjoyed my meal here!"}
{"text":"Excellent Mexican food! It's dangerous having this new location close to home! The enchiladas, burritos, tostadas and quesadillas are all excellent. You can't go wrong!"}
{"text":"I am from Los Angeles and the burritos and tortes are delicious . They also sell alcohol"}
{"text":"We found Los Taquito's before Triple D did...and we were almost disappointed that it was going to be on the show. We didn't want to find the place so busy at lunch that we couldn't go there....TOO LATE. :) Seems Guy let the cheese out of the taco. It's always busy at lunch. Dinner isn't so bad during week- busy wise. Now the food...my hispanic husband loves the place, as does my son...it's not that I don't...but honestly we eat there so often that I'm getting a little burnt out right now! That's a good thing - if you've never tried it before... YUMMY. Love the nacho's...messy- they are so high! Love the green chili - not hot, flavorful but not hot. My son tried the green sauce on his tacos once and they were so hot they were kicking his butt, so the kind gal that works there gave him a whole plate of cheese to tone it down. It helped a little...but how kind was that. Anyway--- please stay away...or if you have to go...save us a spot for 3! :) e"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food!!! They also have the best margaritas especially the prickly pear! Always friendly staff at both locations love eating there!"}
{"text":"Sucked in by the \"Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives\" exposure, what a disappointment!!  The quality of the food was what you would get at a cafeteria and the prices were steep.  We ordered the veggie burrito, smothered along with a shrimp burrito.  Had one bite of the veggie burrito and just couldn't do it.  The shrimp burrito was tolerable, but nothing I'd order again.  The restaurant was clean and the ambiance was cute, the only two positives I can draw from this visit."}
{"text":"Always great food and service. We love the street tacos and breakfast burritos!"}
{"text":"By far the best carne asada burrito in the valley. The meat is extremely tender and flavorful and the beans they put on them has an amazing smoky flavor . There street tacos are delicious . The service was quick and helpful. The restaurant was packed but the service was still fast ."}
{"text":"2nd location, it's a Triple D spot, so you know it's good if Guy Fieri came by. :) I didn't know this 2nd location opened until i ran into it a couple weeks ago. Just ate there today and the service is friendly as usual, food is great, as usual! Had the street tacos, a fish, shrimp and carne, they were great. Carne asada Quesadilla was great, my husband had the Al Pastor burrito and loved it. Margaritas were great too, we'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"Horrible service and non authentic tasting food. These breakfast burritos may fly in Louisiana but definitely not in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Street tacos were amazing! Fast and friendly service too.  Carnitas were good but asada waz the best.  Will be back thanks!!"}
{"text":"Total let down! We went to the N 16th st. store, FYI, so if you are going to try don't do that one.  Nice modern interior - so no complaints about that - the food was just super underwhelming.  This place is said to be a triple D hit, but I think Guy Fieri may have been a bit off this time.  Chips and salsa were meh, the taco's were not very flavorful (so once again, meh) and my boyfriend burrito was kinda dry and bland.  Everything had to be doused in hot sauce to make kinda ok.  We were so pumped to try this place after all the great reviews.  I recommend don't waste the precious real estate in your stomach on a meal here."}
{"text":"I love this place! Good Mexican food and friendly customer service! Definitely recommend this place. I always like to invite my friends to breakfast to Los Taquitos, it is a bit far for me but the food is so good that I do not mind the drive. I recommend their carne asada quesadilla!"}
{"text":"I arrived at Los Taquitos at 12:02pm and the place had about 12 people sitting at the tables eating and a couple ordering at the register. I ordered the chorizo breakfast burrito and a cheese quesadilla. Simple right? Wondering why it took them 30 mins to make my food. My number was finally called at 12:31pm. I could get faster service at a sitdown restaurant. The chorizo burrito was OK. I give it three out of five stars. It didn't have to much flavor to it. I did enjoy the quesadilla. The cheese was really good and they served it crispy.  I would recommend this place to others maybe try something else on the menu. You can get a better chorizo burrito down the street."}
{"text":"I recently gave them another try.. got another bean with cheese burrito.. gotta give them credit, quite a bit less salty.. my high blood pressure thanks you.. but I could do without the boobs display by what I think ate relatives of the owner.. opened my burrito.. no visible cheese.. altho had cheese flavoring.. a little, cafeteria style slow food.. not impressed again.. sorry but I judge a Mexican food restaurant buy it's  bean burritos.. cheapest thing on the menu and the easiest thing to make.. when this white boy can our do you.. making my own, at home, why should I pay you??"}
{"text":"This was my last taco place and again it was mainly because of the reviews and again, they were wrong. First, I did only try their tacos and only 3 kind, I can not review the whole restaurant, but I figure these are basic foods so if it is a good restaurant, they would get it right. Again I had the carne asada, carnitas, and marianted pork. They actually only use 1 thick tortilla soft shell instead of the two, made it a little drier, different texture, I have had these before and like before, I felt they were inferior to the two thin tortilla. The meat I could not taste because they were covered up in their sauce. I don't know if this was the norm, I definitely did not ask for it. Anyway, when you smother something with sauce, everything usually comes out tasting the same. So they all tasted similar and bleh. I gave it a two star instead of a one was for the service, very fast, food tasted like it too and two the prices were a little less than the other place.   So I think for now I will stick to Sorenos grill in Chandler because it seems like the best around the area. Phoenix is another quest, too far though, maybe some times later."}
{"text":"The best! We have had our fare share of Mexican food being native to the valley. Nothing compares to los!"}
{"text":"Three carne asada street tacos with cheese and the green salsa make me very happy!  Tried other items but I always go back to the tacos so im now in a committed relationship:)"}
{"text":"There burritos look like diarrhea. No exaggeration. It's just full of beans and meat. Don't go here unless you want the shits in the sky."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for years--- we love it. The service is always good, the tacos are amazing  and the new look is fun! This is our usual order: tacos-- adobada, lengua, carnitas, two agua de horchatas (definitely the best!) and a flan. Don't leave without trying the carnitas! The rice and beans with the meal are pretty yummy too.  My only complaint is that they often run out of flan and agua de horchata... But I call before making the trip."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since before the DDD days, and it's been great to see how they've grown as a restaurant. They used to be more of a dive restaurant, but have since cleaned up and expanded to make it an attractive restaurant.   Everything on their menu is incredible. I don't think I've ever been disappointed. My personal favorites are the carne asada tacos or burritos. I have yet to find another place that makes asada as tasty as Los Taquitos. Their chicken burrito enchilada style is also excellent.   About the only negative thing I can think of -- recently their asada burritos have been way overdone on the spicy side to the point where it's overpowering. Hopefully this was a fluke, because their burritos have been perfection for the past decade."}
{"text":"I'm confused...it's called Los Taquitos, but they don't have any Taquitos?!  Super bummed, but everyone else gave great reviews so I order Carnitas street tacos with rice and beans.  Carnitas meat was ok but nothing special.  The beans & rice were flavorless so I tossed them.  There were two containers of sauce on the counter, neither of which were labeled, but the red one had \"7 AM\" written on it so I passed.    I'd heard really good things about this place so I'm disappointed.  Guess if I want my authentic Mexican food I will continue going to Espo's!"}
{"text":"Horrible service, very dissatisfied. The company tries to upsell you on every thing they can get you to pay for. Chicken quesadillas don't come with salsa unless you want to dish out an extra two dollars. The woman working the register was noticeably bored and rude. Cheap meat. Unsatisfactory food. Someone needs to start managing this place or watch the business die."}
{"text":"I am not a fan of american mexican food, good thing they don't serve that fare here. The taquitos take me back to the streets of tijuana without the risk of \"after effects\" :)"}
{"text":"love, love, love the street tacos.  the best are the chicken, marinated pork, and pork.  didn't care at all for the carne asada, though.  did not find the smoky flavor appealing.  my family ate here on a recent phoenix vacation and we loved it so much we came back for dinner the next day!  that's how good this place is.  wife loved the flan, also.  great food and low prices make this place a real winner."}
{"text":"Discovered this place when we were craving mexican food at work one day. My co-worker, who is a native to AZ and has worked by Los Taquitos for the past 5 years, had never been, and always wondered about it as it is located in a strip mall. We were worried and questioned it, but when we got there for lunch, there was a line almost out the door. They get very busy during the lunch rush, but it is well worth it. I have tried a few things, but the Chili rellano burrito is the only thing I order now. You can buy their homemade tortillas as well. My parents always ask me to bring some with when I visit. Definitely worth trying out!"}
{"text":"Disgusting! I had been wanting to try this place for months. When I finally did, I asked what was the most popular, so the girl suggested the smothered burrito. I asked what the difference was between the green and red sauce, is one more hot? She said the only difference was the color! Um, ok? So I tried the red. When I got it, it looked like a burrito in red soup. Completely soggy. But I quickly realized it had to be just so the hard, stale tortilla seemed normal! The \"chicken\" was dry and bland as well. My friend tried the street tacos which were dry and bland as well. And Filabertos has better taquitos than this place! Its like they just used their left overs that day. DONT GO THERE!!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go to recently. I had fish tacos and a prickly pear margarita tonight. My husband had the chicken burrito. Our friends had the carne burrito. Every time we leave more than satisfied. Everything on the menu is delicious!"}
{"text":"The owner saw my review, and took the time to contact me.  I must say two things about this....   1. I honestly think that if more businesses took the time to check out their Yelp pages, then less businesses would have poor reviews.   and   2. If more businesses chose to do something to improve the perception of their business that the reviewer has in the case of poor reviews then more businesses would be flourishing.  That being said, I must praise Los Taquitos for doing both.  I have not had a chance to come in to eat again at the 16th st. location, but will make a point to do so in the near future....so look for another update.  But, if the personality and customer service that I received from the owner I spoke with (Rosie) shines through to the rest of her staff on my next visit, then I have no doubt my update will be a rave review!   Stay tuned........"}
{"text":"I've had this one on the back burner for a while as I am rarely in this area but heard great things.  That said, stopped in after a round of golf for 3 (okay 4) Chicken tacos and was very impressed.  Simple, crisp, ingredients and outstanding flavor.  Everything a taco should be.  In fact, if they had Cerveza on site I could knock out a dozen.  That good.  Bonus was it was Taco Tuesday so only $1 each.  Love it and will return.  Only downside is the small location (but we stopped in for a late lunch around 2:30 so not an issue) and no beer.  I'm truly not an alcoholic but nothing improves a taco like a cold one."}
{"text":"Authentic.  Friendly.  Affordable.    I had street tacos, for a $1 each I got some al pastor & asada... So good.  Plenty of options for salsa etc.    Love it."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying the food here had always been good.  The service,  however,  is hit and miss depending on who's working that day! Sometimes the staff acts like they just don't care. Many times I am the only person in the restaurant and when my food is ready the same person that took my order will yell out my number instead of walking 20 feet and delivering it to my table. Restaurants don't get it sometimes... business is so competitive that they must go the extra mile (or in this case 20feet) for the guest!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped by this place after we saw their owner (I think) on Guy's Big Bite show.  I ordered Carne Asada Burrito and he had Carne Asada Torta. We also ordered two tacos since we read they are famous for it.  Their service and food was okay (ehh). If you are not fan of onions ask your order to be without it (they put gang of onions). Their hot sauce was definately kicking.  However, their meat was extremely well marinted (which is a big plus for both of us). Our overall experience was alright. Nothing to dislike but nothing to rave about.  If you love authentic tacos, this just might be a place for you."}
{"text":"Visiting from California, best Mexican food in AZ. Friendly service, clean and comfortable dining room, and the food tastes home made. Definitely gives the impression they care about the product they are putting out. Thanks for a great experience."}
{"text":"While visiting Phoenix, I couldn't wait to get my hands on some tasty authentic Mexican food.  (I lived in the southwest for almost 10 years and miss the Mexican food the most.)  So since I didn't know where to go, I relied on Yelp reviews and also I saw that Guy Fieri visited this place, so though it was worth a try.   The food was good and the prices were decent for what you got, but in the end I walked away wishing my only chance to get great Mexican had been some place better.  We started off with chips and salsa.  The chips seemed like they were homemade, they were crunchy and warm.  The salsa was great. I could've eaten more than the little cup they provided.  Also I am not used to having to pay for salsa and chips at Mexican restaurants so that was a little off putting. But for $2.50...salsa was good.  We then had a couple of margaritas (regular and prickly pear).  I am not a fan of regular margarita's so I thought that one was okay.  But mine was delicious.  Prickly Pear was another thing you don't see much of on the East Coast, so delighted to have it.  And it tasted great, would have ordered more if I wasn't driving.  For dinner I ordered the Burrito Bombero and my boyfriend ordered the 3 chicken enchiladas.  The burrito was good, and if you like spice, and I mean a lot of spice, then you might love it.  I am a spicy food fanatic, but this was just a bit too much.  I felt like I couldn't enjoy any of the other tastes of the burrito because my mouth was burning too much.  I think if they took the spice down just a tad, it would have been a lot better.  My boyfriend thought his enchiladas were a bit salty.  Not very impressed.  I thought they were just okay as well.  I have definitely had better.  We probably should have gone with the (street) tacos since that seems to be where all the great reviews come from.  If I lived in Phoenix I would give it another chance. However since I don't when I am back I will have to find another place in search of the authentic Mexican food that I miss so much."}
{"text":"Thought it might be glorified fast food when trying for the first time but was pleasantly surprised. The lengua street tacos for $1.75 each were delicious; the meat was moist, flavorful, and plentiful. Filling flavors were well balanced and spiced. My friend enjoyed her carnitas tacos, saying they were succulent and had plenty of meat. The \"pre-made\" house margaritas on the rocks were surprisingly good and $4 during happy hour. They have covered outside seating at picnic tables. You order at the counter, and they bring your order to you. Service is friendly and fast, and the interior is large with plenty of seating. This will be a regular stop."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Los Taquitos. The staff is friendly, the prices are reasonable and the food is tasty. During this particular visit, I tried the chorizo, egg, and potato burrito w/ rice and beans. I'd definitely order it again. I'll be back to try the carne asada tacos as well."}
{"text":"Ordered carne asada torta.  They wrapped it in foil, set it on top of my beans and rice. Then smashed it in real good with a plastic lid. What a mess Hardley any meat and just a few pieces of shredded lettuce. Had they made it with more toppings and didn't smash the foiled sandwich into my beans it would of been good."}
{"text":"Not sure why it has such bad reviews. For airport food, this place is good, and decently priced. I got a veggie burrito bowl with a side of guac and paid about $10. Only complaints are they didn't give me salsa and it was a bit salty for my taste. But again, for airport food, not bad."}
{"text":"For the price, 5 stars. Wonderful inexpensive, fresh and yummy. All tastes authentic with quality ingredients"}
{"text":"The carne asada and carnitas tacos great!   Would definitely go back and try something else next time."}
{"text":"Real Mexican food and ridiculously cheap prices!  The cow tongue and cheek tacos are amazing.  It is like eating the most melt in your mouth pot roast ever.  It may be a but mushy for some.  Carne asade was good.  Pork wasn't as good.  Arizona Burrito was hearty... lots of potatos cheese and steak.  The green sauce was tasty, the red was not.  Minuto was interesting, but I wouldn't get it again.  Just fill up with delicious tacos for under $1.50 each!"}
{"text":"Haven't been here since the remodel....looks great but service and food quality has gone downhill.  Waited over 25 minutes for food.  Several others were complaining about the wait times.....they ran out of menudo after the order was already placed.  When we finally got our food, many of the items were cold including the potatoes, rice and bombero burrito.  The sauce on the bombero burrito tasted like it came from a can, not to mention it tasted like BBQ sauce.  One of the female employees responding to complaints was not customer friendly...more of an attitude and unapologetic.  Hopefully it was just a bad day, nothing permanent."}
{"text":"Tuesdays are bomb af. Carnitas tacos are life and the nachos are not shabby! Love love love the red salsa and basically can't wait till next Tuesday!"}
{"text":"Lots of yelling gong on here! RYAN! RYAN! RYAN! Jesus! Purple haired monster mashing your sandwich and yelling your name, only of you like being abused. $7.50 for  Sierra Nevada, no thank you!"}
{"text":"Best tacos hands down the best in town.... Go get your self some they are busy for a reason. Amazing"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in the Ahwatukee area. For sure.  I love their bean tostadas.  Their green sauce is actually hotter than their red sauce.  When out of town visitors come, this is our go-to place for authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Food is decent but service makes this place a risk.  They often lose orders or screw up the orders.  So, calling ahead to save time often turns into waiting for them to fix or create the order you gave them 20 minutes prior. You'd think a neighborhood restaurant would care enough to get an order right.  Quality also varies greatly for order to order. Try Burrito Company instead."}
{"text":"I want to go ahead and let people know when you order over the phone for pick up make sure you ask them to what location your calling too unfortunately i had a small delay i came to the awatukee location to pick up my order and i was told that my order was not here it was at the Glendale location the person that took my order never mentioned i was calling the Glendale location! So be careful but no worries a awesome girl named Alexa took care of me very well told me not to worry she would call down and let them know what happen. She was very nice and quickly took my order for my tacos for take out very fast !!! Just letting people know to prevent this from happening to you everybody's time is important. Still 5 starts love this place! Tacos are Amazing!!!"}
{"text":"I've tried a lot of items from the menu, and I've never been disappointed.   Favorites: carne asada tacos and shrimp cocktail.   Making the location bigger was a welcome change.   My favorite fast Mexican place in the valley."}
{"text":"I don't understand the plethora of negative reviews of this place.  Stopped here for a quick bite before a flight.  The chicken quesadilla I ordered was cooked fresh to order.  It was served with 2 sides of salsa that were clearly homemade and quite good.  I would gladly stop here again, ignore the negative reviews."}
{"text":"We happened to be passing through Phoenix, and checked it out after hearing it was featured on diners drive ins and dives.  I ordered 3 hard chicken tacos and a chile relleno - food was definitely solid. The chile was very large, and actually a chile, not a poblano.  It was crowded but our group of 9 had no problem getting a few tables together as previous diners left."}
{"text":"I'm basically here every Tuesday for their Taco Tuesday special - $1 tacos! The tacos and salsa are consistently delicious, flavorful, and filling, and the customer service is consistently attentive, efficient, and friendly. I'm always recommending this place to friends and family, and I have them all just as hooked. Great place to hit up when you're \"hangry.\""}
{"text":"If your nearby stop in! It's not like many other Mexican foods. This place gets busy around dinner time so I always call ahead. The green chile burrito is my fav here."}
{"text":"Very rude lady that works at the register. Gave us attitude and seemed annoyed we were even ordering. She even said \"hello\" and \"see you soon\" to what seems like everyone but us. Ordered just a burrito meal but ONLY said no beans. Apparently, no anything either. No sauce, onions, rice. Paid for a full meal barely ate a few bites. What a waste of money."}
{"text":"I had the fish taco and rice....it's was fabulous and really fresh. Loved it."}
{"text":"My family visited Los Taquitos on our vacation in Arizona because we had seen it on DDD.  We're from Texas, so we were used to Tex-Mex style tacos, so this was a little different, but very delicious.  Here's what we ordered:  chicken, beef fajita, shrimp & fish tacos w/ refried beans & rice meals - all were very good  chicken fajita burrito - my daughter ate the entire thing, and LOVED every bite  chicken nachos - covered in chicken, refried beans, cheese and guacamole (we asked for sour cream too), it was sooo good  beef quesadilla - we got this for my youngest daughter, but she ended up liking the nachos best  We would definitely return if we're ever in Phoenix again.  What a  great deal for some great food."}
{"text":"Great family restaurant. Hate the chains.. They have Al Pastor (pork on a spit). Serve breakfast all day! $1 for a large drink. All good"}
{"text":"Real.Street.Tacos: cilantro, onions, lime & hot sauce. Reminds me of taco joints in Chicago. Save the sour cream & cheese for taco-smell.  The downside is the place is usually packed for the lunch rush so go a little early/later. I'd love to see Los make a food truck!"}
{"text":"Delicious and attractive.  Saltier than my preference, but we'll be back anyway: everyone in the family enjoyed what they ordered,"}
{"text":"Solid 4 stars.  Just the kind of taco shop I miss in Seattle. If you like SoCal Mex this is your place.  Delicious Carne Asada and breakfast burritos.  Go for the Bombero style if you like a wet burrito! Homemade Jamaica and horchata too.  Ohh yeah, this place was featured on Diners Dives and Drive throughs if that makes any difference to you."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times for food.  Once for a beer.  Food is quite good (green chili) but their customer service is VERY lack luster, and I'm not picky. The people up front always smile, but it is always one of those f-u smiles.  Just a bad vibe.  They even charged for a water cup once. Not cool."}
{"text":"My friends wanted to go and I was pleasantly surprised when we went.  I have gone back about 6 times so far since last year.  I will continue to go.  Just know that Taco Tuesday's are super busy.  Learned that the hard way during lunch hour.  Well worth the wait though.  The food is really good and super fresh.  I will continue to go."}
{"text":"GO HERE. Seriously, just go. Stop reading this review and go eat some tacos because I don't want this place to shut down. It's surprisingly uncrowded for such a nice little Mexican spot. Granted, it's new, and I hear their other location does pretty well so maybe they just need a little while to get their following in this neighborhood. (Watch, everyone reads my glowing review and pretty soon I won't even be able to get a table).  Their margaritas are perfect, and their $1 tacos from 4-7 pm during the week can't be beat.  The staff is super friendly and the food comes out quickly.  Love their beans, so make sure to get a side of those with your happy hour tacos.  Last Friday my husband and I stopped in, got 2 margaritas, 5 tacos, chips and salsa, and a side of rice and beans for $15.  Such a steal."}
{"text":"This is one of the only places I've found in Chandler that has great authentic Mexican food. Coming from Mexico I really missed my tacos and tortas! This has the authentic charcoal-like flavor you get from a street cart. If I could only find a good elote place now.."}
{"text":"I am totally in love with this place. They have the best Mexican food around! I love their carne asada burritos and tamales. Make sure to try their green and red salsa's my boyfriend and I love it! We will be back again!"}
{"text":"If I could give them less i would. However I guess the one star goes to the guy that was trying his best to not be embarrassed by the cook that was so obnoxiously rude and loud complaining about doing her job. And of course I got exactly what I didn't order after having to wait around to listen to all her crap. She's not really meant to be cooking in public. Poor representation of this establishment if they could even call it that. Worst experience ever in a service based place - will never go to another, yuck"}
{"text":"The service here was inexcusable, look I get it, it's an airport and I bet most of the customers that come through could be rated poorly as well but jeesh man.  I felt like I was being served my meal by someone who would much rather shank me in the bathroom as opposed to serving me a nice plate of tacos.      Outside of that, the line was an absolute mess.  The way food was being served across the line there was cross contamination of ingredients everywhere.  For example, I can't do cheese but there was literally cheese everywhere, in everything.   After walking around the airport twice, this was what I settled on so they will probably be around for a while as there are limited options but seriously, have some pride in your food and service."}
{"text":"I have eaten here a few times.  It's pretty good as far as street tacos go.  Not many places other than Mexico that you can get those...  Today I had the Bombero Burro with chicken.  OMG this was fabulous.  It was pretty spicy - for those that don't like spice - don't get it because you won't be able to eat it.  But if you are a fan of spicy food - this is what to order (with your choice of meat of course).  It is a pretty good sized burro - I couldn't finish it all - and trust me, I tried.  I ordered it a la carte - there is a combo option - but again, it's a huge burro...  This place is nothing fancy but worth a stop in."}
{"text":"Great street taco's! My husband and I  love to try little dive's and this one was worth it, not too far of a drive for a good burrito, we recommend the bombero burrito . Hot, but sweet ...hard to describe, but after the first bite, you want another bite."}
{"text":"Hey, I ate here and it was really good!! Great service and friendly peeps!!"}
{"text":"I would highly recommend this place.  I've never been disappointed except to learn they no longer offer their Tamarindo margarita. Please reconsider.........."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch with the family. We had carnitas and asada tacos, a chicken bowl and an asada burrito. Went back for shrimp tacos that I missed on the menu. Everything was delicious and no on left hungry. Restaurant was very clean and inviting. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Love, love, love Los Taquitos!  Their carne asada burro and their quesadillas are stellar.  What's even better is that their prices are so reasonable.  I am never going to Taco Bell again."}
{"text":"Well it smells delicious but the staff of ladies look like a smile is asking too much and they're annoyed. The cashier with the short hair had attitude out of this world. Then the salsa is NOT IMPRESSIVE. It's just squeeze bottles. And no labels. Then I get my food and it's a tone of beans but my 3 tacos are smaller than usual street tacos for$8.42! I'll try another place next time."}
{"text":"Look forward to every tuesday here my favorite are the pastor tacos and their rice and beans are bomb!"}
{"text":"Tacos, tacos, tacos......how can something so simple be this great? Having seen this place being featured on DDD we had to try it out and it was worth every penny! I have a thing for always trying the \"odd\" menu items so I've tried the tongue tacos and cabeza (head/cheek) burrito and to me there is nothing better on the menu! This place is rather small which makes it perfect if you're there with some friends or a special someone! My friend loves the shrimp ceviche though I havent tried it myself. Go to this place for some great authentic, local and quite tasty food.......probably some of the best the east alley has to offer!"}
{"text":"I really like the pollo burrito. The chicken is great and the salsa is good. Nothing fancy but very tasty and a regular stop for lunch"}
{"text":"Okay so this place is a little confusing. It's like Chipotle and Filiberto's had a baby and this place is the baby's cousin. It's very clean and well decorated. The food tries to be authentic-ish but doesn't quite reach it. I'll say this- their breakfast burritos are bomb. Hot and fresh hits the spot. However when I came to try their bowls (they looked delicious) I wasn't as blown away. The rice was really soggy- like mushy soggy and it just wasn't that flavorful taste-wise. My friend got chicken tacos and she said they were dry. I'm torn- I want to come back for the breakfast burritos but I think I'll skip the other stuff for now.  A couple of pros- their chips were good and they have beer and margaritas there."}
{"text":"Giving a tentative review ~ I bought a chix burrito for my son's lunch, so I'll have to see what he thinks when I pick him up. My impression was not great, but I'll see if he liked it. $6 for a simple chix burrito is way overpriced. One of the reasons was I asked for cheese, which is an extra .50 charge. But that's all it was, just chix and cheese on a flour tortilla. I had them leave everything else off, so I was surprised to get charged  .50 for cheese. The girl who took my order didn't inform me when I placed order but I wondered why it was so much. After receiving my order I asked. If the burrito would have been a good size I probably wouldn't be complaining, but it was only average size. Seriously doubt I'll return since I can get more food for the same price elsewhere. I feel ripped off!"}
{"text":"Excellent street tacos. My favorites were the asada and pollo. My husband got an enchilada and it was also amazing. Very flavorful and fresh tasting. My two year old never really eats much when we have Mexican food, but she loved the rice, beans, and shrimp taco. I really wish they had horchata, but other than that it was really good. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Yeeeeessss supreme burrito was perfect and the atmosphere is really cool. Super quick service"}
{"text":"This place was featured on Diners and Dives, so we had high expectations.  We had 4 types of tacos and a shrimp burrito.  The carne asada tacos were the best ones, but the meat was a bit dry.  The lengua was alright but the pieces were too big.  The shrimp burrito had very few small shrimp in it.   We live in Scottsdale, and I don't think we'll make the trip to eat there again."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food around!  Salsas are amazing and the breakfast burritos are to die for.  Los T is our go to take out spot."}
{"text":"Very cute decor and great tacos! I ordered the carnitas tacos (2) and they were delicious. My son ordered the Carne asana burrito and he enjoyed it. I would definitely come back again and try something else."}
{"text":"Diner, Drive-ins and Dives gave the tacos a top call - but the Chile Rellenos are bar far the best thing on the menu."}
{"text":"I had the luxury of living across the street from Los Taquitios. I stumbled upon it going to the grocery store one day about 3 years ago. I get the same thing almost every time...3 little carne asada tacos. OMG they are heavenly. I don't usually get a taste for beef but when I do I am headed here. The meat is tender and the seasoning is perfect. The rice and beans are great too. My only complaint is they don't give you enough rice and beans on those little plates.  One day I come into to get my usual and I see that Guy from DDD is coming to do a piece on Los Taquitos. I think great. The family works hard and the service is always great, friendly and fast. I come in months later after the show aired and I waited in a line practically out the door. The place was a wreck. However, the food was the same delicious Mexican food I was use to. I still go there regularly although I moved 15 mins away. As a matter of fact I have a taste for some taquitios now. Might be lunch. Anyway I have been back after my not so stellar encounter after the show aired. It appears my favorite Mexican spot is back to what I consider normal. Now a heads up this is a little whole in the wall place. So be prepared. I tend to find these places are the best.  If you are in the area definitely check out Los Taquitos and try my 3 little carne asada tacos. They are the best."}
{"text":"The food here is great, but I was just in there and received that absolute worst customer service. There is no excuse considering the restaurant was empty at the time. The girl at the register was very rude and did not give any sort of customer service, not even a smile. I said thank you for my food and got a cold shoulder, I will not be back in to eat here."}
{"text":"Sometimes the first thing I think of when I wake up is... Is it Taco Tuesday?!   On days when it is, I often hit up Los Taquitos! $1 for pretty damn good street tacos? Can't go wrong.  It's usually pretty packed on Tuesdays but the flavor/value is spot on so it's not a surprise.  On non-Tuesdays I've ordered other menu items like their carne Asada torta which I've always enjoyed and devoured quickly. Burritos are a hit or miss for me here, sometimes they're big and well portioned and sometimes it'll be on the skinnier, skimpier side. Service is typically friendly and energetic.   In a plaza that has some everchanging food spots, they have been around for a while now, just doing it up right with some good flavors and consistency!"}
{"text":"I was very excited when this place opened because many fellow Yelpers stated that their food was so good at the other locations.  In fact, a few Yelpers were so excited that they posted positive reviews of this place before the restaurant opened- not cool!  This review is based on the three times I have been there.  The first time I went I ordered the pastor taco, shrimp taco and a chicken enchilada.  While the tacos were flavorful and not too spicy, the chicken enchilada was kind of a mess.  The entire enchilada needed to be cooked more.  On the second occasion, I had the Super Nachos.  There was nothing super about the Super Nachos except I had a super stomachache after I ate them.  I returned today and decided to go with the tacos again.  As today was Taco Tuesday, Los Taquitos was offering chicken, carnitas and el pastor tacos for just $1.00 a taco.  The chicken taco I ordered was very tasty but the two other tacos were actually kind of nasty.  Today the el pastor taco was incredibly spicy while the other day it was mild..  Consistency is important and hopefully Los Taquitos will figure it out.  It also would be nice if they had more salsas available or some sort of salsa bar to liven the tacos up."}
{"text":"Like everyone else, I saw it on DDD.   I love good mexican food, and this was GOOD. I was really curious about their carnitas that they cook with sweetened condensed milk (or maybe it's evaporated) and I was surprised how tender and flavorful they were.   The carne asada was super good. I don't know what it was marinated in, but it seemed to have way more flavor than I am used to in carne asada, and I mean that in a good way. I loved it. I loved it more than the carnitas that I was looking forward to!   Their horchata is also really good. Rich and creamy with visible spices. Definitely not the typical fountain drink style horchata.   I would go back in a heartbeat and look forward to returning to Phoenix to do so =)"}
{"text":"If you're strolling through the PHX airport looking for a quick bite avoid this spot. It's looks like a solid option because the menu has nice typography and fits the build for fast causal Mexican grill. They have no idea what they're doing however- food is extremely average and isn't prepared with any integrity. Guac was browned, rice and beans dry and the people working behind the counter resemble a stoned high school concession stand. If there's a line do your due diligence and alert the those waiting to take their business elsewhere... us airport food patrons deserve better !"}
{"text":"Not quite the menu as the original but the tacos and the service are hard to beat."}
{"text":"Don't go for the ambiance - go because these are the best tacos in Ahwatukee.  Period."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE  Make sure you get the carne asada tacos with the corn tortillas and red sauce. They are just about the best damn tacos I've ever had anywhere. They are pretty small, even for street taco style, but I don't give a crap. I could pound 9 of those things in one sitting no problem and not have any issues. I also had a carnitas taco, which was good too but the carne asada is hands down the way to go. I also had a carne asada burrito, which was okay, but the flour tortilla was kinda bootsy. Stick with the tacos! Also, the staff here is SUPER friendly and the food comes out in a timely manner.   Here's the kicker... I'm from California and was just in town for biz. I know Mexican food obviously so this stands up to any of the joints around here as well. I ACTUALLY ORDERED 6 TACOS TO GO AND TOOK THEM HOME WITH ME ON THE FLIGHT BACK TO CA. That's right, the tacos are that good. My girlfriend tried them, even a few hours old, and said they were delicious. Of course, getting them right off the grill with the tortillas with a light crisp is the best way to go!"}
{"text":"Terrible.  Rice and beans were hard.  Makes a burrito bowl tough to eat. Barely any food in my tin. I feel like I got the scraps and they didn't want to cook more.   Staff was inattentive.  Eat anywhere else in PDX, just not here."}
{"text":"This is what Mexican food is supposed to be. Not the place for ambiance, just great food......."}
{"text":"Los Taquitos is great!  I love the chilaquiles. Their refried beans and horchata are made in-house, from scratch, and it's amazing."}
{"text":"As a self-proclaimed connoisseur of all things delicious, I felt obliged to let others know about this place...First of all...can you say CARNITAS?! YUM!! Cooked to mouth watering perfection!   We live all the way over in Goodyear and would make the traffic-filled trip out there again, without question. Inexpensive, authentic food, fun atmosphere (with super-cool Day of the Dead murals), great service. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I love this place! It's right down the street from my apartment so I order to go all the time and everything I've tried is so good! Their pasole is fantastic so is their Bombero burrito. I tried the El Pastor taco today and it was the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"Tasty carne asada, tasty fish tacos.    Is there any more to say?   With all the options for cheap Mexican fare, it's not hard to be middling; Los Taquitos has a good thing going with simply seasoned well done fresh street tacos.  Serving sizes are adequate to a little too much, and prices are very reasonable.    Definitely a new lunch go-to."}
{"text":"Soo good and fresh.  The staff was very helpful in our selecton of specials and little bites.  Yummmm!"}
{"text":"Score one for hole-in-the-wall, local's hidden gem places!  This place has consistently good food for amazing prices.    Most of their food is fairly customizable in terms of spicy-ness, which I find awesome.  My poor tummy can't handle spicy anymore, and that's made finding good Mexican food that I can actually eat a bit difficult down here.  Any requests to alter food (no/little salsa, no cheese, etc) have always been happily accomodated.    Their burritos, while not the biggest I've seen (that title goes to either Picante in Berkeley, CA or High Tech Burrito, also in the Bay Area), they're pretty damned tasty.    All of the meats I've had are very good.  Granted, I've not tried the ground beef, but I tend to steer away from that unless I'm having a burger.    If you're in the Ahwatukee area, this place definitely warrants a visit."}
{"text":"4 stars only becuause there is always a line! Lol, which I guess is really a good thing. Have tried their taco Tuesday $1 street tacos, their rice &  bean platters, even the menudo is muy delicioso... I kind of judge a place by how they make their Spanish rice. I grew up on some good stuff, so I know when rice is made good or too overlooked/undercooked. This place does it good   The decor in here is super cute, love the big Mexican skeleton drawing.  Today tried the carnitas quesadilla. Good size portion & the meat was a decent ratio. It's hard to mess up a quesadilla! Call ahead if you are looking for to go."}
{"text":"Thought was supposed to be HOT, but was'nt more like tooo sweet!!! I got the Fireman carnita burrito really was disappointed so far Arizona's Mexican foods is way to BLAND and wife has'nt found any she likes!!! The girl that took my order was nice and polite and the carnita meat tasted good but that's all !!! my 2 star rating is on the high side!!!"}
{"text":"This is an alright place if you haven't experienced some of the much better places in Arizona.  I think it is somewhat overpriced compared to similar restaurants and the food isn't anything to rave about."}
{"text":"Loud, over spiced and unfriendly.  Grissly asada.  Not impressed.  First and last time"}
{"text":"This is a great hole in the wall family owned Mexican restaurant. I have not had a bad thing on the menu. Their street tacos are some of the best. You can choose the type of meat you want in them. You can even get all three in the combo different. The Torta is awesome and the burritos are mouth watering. Service is great. It gets a little cramped waiting for your order because the place is really that small. The prices are good too. Sure there isn't a dollar menu but who needs one when the food is this good. Dollar menus are for places with horrible food. It can get packed around lunch time so be warned. Calling you order in will save on time if you only have an hour for lunch. I have been going here for years and will keep coming back."}
{"text":"This place is Amazing! Came here last night for a late night dinner, I had the Pastor Quesadilla YUM! My husband had their Pastor Torta OMG! The bread just melts in your mouth. (Mouth watering...lol!) now we're here getting some Breakfast!!"}
{"text":"Dropped by for lunch on a Saturday!! Since the weather was great I came to Los Taquitos for outside sitting and great food! I usually get the chicken salad which is amazing!! Today I ordered a bowl of menudo Bc it's Saturday and they have it! The menudo was good definitely did it's job! Still no where close to Nana's menudo.  I also ordered guacamole which was dumb expensive. The Guac was whipped in green mush. It's more like Guac you buy per maded at Sprouts. So don't wast your money. I also think the waitresses should drop the food at your table for you. Great food but the establishment needs to decide if it's a take out restaurant and stay in and dine. Still the food"}
{"text":"Yummy! The chicken on the nachos has a great flavor. I really enjoy them but could use more cheese. I mean cheese is most important on nachos (hence 4 stars not 5) but been twice and will return. Maybe I'll even try something else. Not sure I love good Nachos and best in area so far. Good pricing too."}
{"text":"This is the second location and its AWESOME!!!  They took it up a big step with a nice dining and outdoor patio area plus a BAR! Same great food and low prices, friendly staff as always.  Carne asada, carnitas & fish taco plate is mouth watering.  Cheese Quesadilla with carne asada is as tasty as ever.  Oh they have a flat screen HDTV to watch the games too!!"}
{"text":"Went here for street tacos tonight and they were very good, Nice little place and you can have a beer with your food while catching some sports on the television. I'll eat here again next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"I had the pollo burrito here yesterday.  It's $7.99 with rice and refried beans ($8.68 after tax). I didn't have much of a choice because I was hungry and I didn't have time to look elsewhere.  The burrito was only OK at best.  The rice was too dry and one of the workers had an attitude but the cashier was friendly.  Note to self: Once is enough."}
{"text":"I'm gonna have to be honest, this place is not what it is all hyped up to be. Everybody in Ahwatukee raves about how this place is the best & most authentic mexican food in the valley but they obviously have not ventured out much. I'm giving this place 1 star due to the number of people who ride or die for their food & me being disappointed when I tried it. The menudo is under seasoned, I had to add a lot of salt & crushed red chili to make it some what descent. (We also found an eyelash or eyebrow hair in the menudo) The chicken in the taco was dry, the carne asada tacos are under seasoned & the carnitas tacos were just basic. The carne asada burrito includes dried beef & all you can taste is red onion. The salsas do all the heavy lifting but even then the tomatillo (green) salsa taste only like lime & the red lacks flavor as well. It's sad that this is what people who live in Arizona call authentic. If you live near Ahwatukee & crave tacos, at least try Salazar brothers which isn't far in Tempe, but if you want amazing tacos & willing to get out of Ahwatukee for the real deal I highly recommend Tacos Sahuaro in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Burrito was actually good. Fries ice cold, complained about it and nada. No response from living dead employee. I can't wait until lazy, useless human beings are iced out by efficient robots. Lol.  I actually told the manager and his response was \"you are absolutely correct\". Wow, thanks Genius! Nothing offered or remedy. This guy too well be replaced by programmed robots to ensure customer satisfaction in the near distant future.   So looking forward to better customer service."}
{"text":"Great authentic Mexican food, I went to this place for lunch and breakfast. The menudo was amazing so is there steak the marinate has a very good taste. Tortillas both corn and failure are fresh made to order. Service was fast and professional, I am highly recommending this place."}
{"text":"We've visited more than 10 times now and tried many items on their breakfast and lunch/dinner menus. My favorites are the fresh, fully stacked tostadas and the carne asada street tacos. Marinated meats, homemade frijoles and don't forget to ask for the pickled carrots to accompany your dish."}
{"text":"Love this place!  I have lived in Ahawatukee for many years and have been going to this place for years.  When I think of tacos, I think Los Taquitos.  There carne asada is fresh, well seasoned and flavorful.  Also try their supreme breakfast burrito, it is to die for!  It is high quality and really inexpensive.  It's not a sit down restaurant type of place so you may not want to take a date here.  The drawbacks is the sitting place within the restaurant, you don't have many places to sit and when you order to go, make sure to check your food before you leave.  They have a tendency of missing things in your order or not giving you the things your ordered."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for Mexican food. The street tacos are to die for! It's authentic and the staff is always extremely nice and patient. The breakfast burrito and quesadilla are my number 1 items I get from the menu. It's a small establishment, but I always have a place to sit. I am glad to have found this place and gave it a try!"}
{"text":"The fish and shrimp tacos here are very good! Service was excellent and very friendly. I went around 2pm on a weekday and the resturant was about 1/3 full so I didn't have any trouble getting a table with my friends. This is not a real big place, they have about 10 tables. Everyone had tacos in our group and everyone liked them. I love their hot sauces, they are very good!  I realized when I hit my navigation this place is close to Goodspeed Performance Lab where I hang out alot so I plan to be back often."}
{"text":"Tried and true. Friendly service and great food. One of the few places that offer vegetarian beans in Phoenix. The margaritas are made with real lime instead of gross mixers and during happy hour you can't beat the quality or price!"}
{"text":"Fantastic street tacos. Great Mexican food place. I usually visit their other location on Ray/101 but this is their original location."}
{"text":"I heard about this from DDD, but I wasn't going to hold that against it.  This place is fantastic having delicious food and reasonable prices.  What more could you ask for?  They have the best Chile Reno Burrito I have had in the area. I order it enchilada style since they have great sauce.  The tortilla is soft and fresh made wrapped around a chile reno, rice, and potatoes. It is fantastic.  They have red and green sauce for all their food get extra green sauce, it's spicy and addictive.  The tostadas are really good as well if you want something crunchy to go with your tacos.  The staff are always friendly and the food comes out pretty quick for how busy they always are.  It's a pretty small place so it can fill up at busier times, but you can always get it to go and it's still just as good.  Try - Chile Reno Burrito - Green Sauce - Tostadas - Veggie Tacos - Ask for the habanero Salsa"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Very authentic Mexican food. Whenever I am on that side of town we always stop here. My favorite are the carne asada tacos. They have great carnitas and horchata here too! A bit small so if you are going for lunch get there early because sometimes the line is out the door."}
{"text":"I give it 4 months.  Slow line/ service.  Cool wall murals if your into that..  Good beans but that's all."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent. We ordered carnitas and lengua tacos with our pozole and menudo. Tacos were yummy and the meat was tender and juicy. The pozole and menudo were also incredible. Not greasy and the broth was rich and flavorful.   The one complaint I have is with their cocktails. We ordered two prickly pear cocktails and they arrived when we were almost done with our food. Apparently they make them scratch to order and only one person can make it. I do appreciate they make them to order but it shouldn't take 20 minutes to get your drinks."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast burritos. Place is run by a family and has been since it first opened. They treat you extremely well and the food is off the hook. Also just finished construction, so the place is a lot bigger meow!"}
{"text":"I was excited when I saw that this place offered street tacos.  As a result I ordered 6 total tacos, carne asada, carnitas and pollo.  I would have given this place 3.5 stars after trying the pollo and carnitas tacos.  They are fresh and great tasting.  The carnitas was a bit too salty.    The horchata was a bit too sweet as well, so overall, 3 stars is a good amount."}
{"text":"Man do I miss this place!  After moving out of Arizona, I haven't found anything even close to how great the food is here.  The carne asada is amazing, I've tried it in all of it's forms.  My favorite item on the menu is the bombero burrito.  This is truly the spiciest burrito I've ever had.  It burns, but I just can't stop eating it.  The sauce is delicious.  My other favorite item, is the pozole.  It's so amazing and the big chunks of pork are super tender and flavorful.  The last time I ate there, I had the bombero burrito and the pozole, the spice from the burrito combined with the heat of the soup had me sweating like a mad man, but it was totally worth it.  I'm glad I was able to introduce this place to some of my friends before I moved away, and I'm happy that they were able to expand this location and make it larger as well as open another location on the east side.  Do not pass this place up!"}
{"text":"This location is in a easy to access shopping center with plenty of parking, which is always beneficial. I came her a few years ago, and they have expanded the size of the place significantly, which is a nice change because they used to be pretty cramped, but not anymore! I ordered the nachos for the first time, and wow was it a lot of food. As for the flavor, they are great and highly recomended! They use fresh xhips and layer the ingredients which is a very nice touch. I chose the Asada and Pastor as the meat for them, and it was a nice xombination. Their asada is very smooth and tender, while their Pastor is slightly sweet. All very tasty. I have also had several other menu items and never been dissapointed. Their tacos are my personal fave because they are just the right size and you can order a three-pack of tacos, each being a different kind. In all, I would highly recomend this place and will definitely be back......many many many many more times!"}
{"text":"Poor service when they get busy!!!  Overall, I love this place.  However, I was really frustrated with the service today!  I decided to bring lunch to my kids at school and they specifically requested Los Taquitos!  They could have said, McD's or any other fast food joint, but they didn't!  It was 20 minutes before their lunch hour started.  I thought that would be plenty of time since their school is only 5 minutes away. Luckily, there was only 1 other person in front of me when I got there.  However, after I ordered, they got slammed!  I watched several people get their order before me, while I watched the blonde add stickers to the salsa instead of paying attention to the orders at the window.  I was wondering if she was ignoring mine because it was a TO-GO order.  Regardless, I had to go up to the counter and let her know my order was sitting there.  It took over 20 minutes to get 2 kids meals (2 quesadillas, rice & beans) and I basically missed their lunch hour.  Talk about 2 disaappointed children & 1 disappointed mommy! :("}
{"text":"Stopped in for taco Tuesday.  Love this place. Carnitas, pastor, chicken tacos are $1.  The green chili pork is awesome!  Only downside is that this place gets busy and tables can be hard to find during peak times.  Well worth the wait though!"}
{"text":"Always a great experience here! The $2 Taco Tuesdays are rad and I love the prickly pear margarita. The pazole is a great go to! I can't say enough great things about the staff, the food and the cleanliness of this place. It's one of our top places to visit."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday is just incredible. Their prices otherwise are also super inexpensive. Great atmosphere. We loved the margaritas too. House margs are on special for Taco Tuesday. They were the right mix of sour and salty. We've had a long run of margaritas that are just ALL sour mix so we were pleasantly surprised here!"}
{"text":"We were staying at a hotel nearby and found the reviews for this spot. Boy are we glad that we did! We are constantly on the hunt for great tacos in any city, this was definitely one for our list.  We ate here for dinner both nights we were in town. The majority of the meals ordered were the 3 taco plates. One carne asada, marinated pork, and carnitas, served with yummy rice and beans- the tortillas were very good too. This is definitely the plate to get here. I think that the carne asada ones were the best.  Normally we order all of our food medium spiced, but beware of the red hot sauce that they put on the tacos. My daughter somehow got an extra dose on her tacos and was having a hard time getting through the burn. This somehow justified the obscene amount of Fresca's ordered. :) If you are remotely sensitive to heat, order your sauce on the side."}
{"text":"Great Asada tacos in a very clean restaurant.  The refried beans may be the best I have ever had. Well done! I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Normally I don't write negative reviews but.... Gentleman rang me up then proceeded to make my breakfast burrito without washing hands or changing gloves. I couldn't even eat my burrito. I would think that HMS host would have better sanitation standards or at least good training  in place to insure this very basic practice."}
{"text":"While visiting Arizona some co-workers of mine were recommending places to eat when the name Los Taquitos came up. With Mexican food being one of my favorite types of ethnic eats I knew while in the area I would definitely have to give this place a try and I'm glad I did.  Situated in a safe and standard strip mall sits this spectacular site sure to satisfy your stomach. I walked in to see some very nice art of what appeared to be Santa Muerte or some other skeletons on the wall and placed my order. Per a recommendation from a co-worker I ordered the \"bombero pollo\".  Once my order was ready it was time to head back to my office and consume this.  The bombero pollo was a chicken burrito with some hot sauce and cheese on the outside, I also got beans and rice with it. To start with the entree the hot sauce on the outside really gives this a lot of its flavor. It's fairly hot and I was warned ahead of time, but I'm no chicken, I merely eat chickens, on a burrito. The chicken and other ingridients were good, a little watery. Overall I was very impressed with the bombero pollo as the hot sauce was a great compliment.  The rice and beans left a little to be desired. These tasted worse than the ones I get at my local Mexican restaurant in suburban Chicago. I'm willing to take a stab in the dark and guess they were frozen and thawed out due to the somewhat bunchy and odd consistency of bean dip. That's not to say they were bad, just not ideal or on par with what I've had other places.  Overall, I really liked the Bombero Pollo, the hot sauce gives it a fantastic flavor. I'm a big fan of Mexican food and this place was fantastic and I would highly recommend it if you happen to be in Phoenix looking for some caliente lunch or dinner. Cinco stars for Los Taquitos."}
{"text":"Been coming here since January 2014. The food is amazing but today I ordered food by phone and when I got to the restaurant to pick it up the waitress or the person giving the orders was very rude and nasty.  I asked for forks knives and napkins because it was a big order. She gave me a dirty look and said that the forks and knives and napkins were around the counter. I said no problem and proceeded to finish my take-out order. This goes to show that no matter how good the food is at a restaurant poor customer service will always lose future business. I gave this restaurant a three-star because the food is delicious but as of recently their customer service has deteriorated."}
{"text":"The TACO's here are simply mouth watering, I usually stick with the basics and just get carne asada, but the lady talked me into trying all of them and they're the tacos that are about the size of a silver dollar maybe a little bigger, nonetheless I ended up trying a fish taco, a shrimp taco, and a carnitas, as well as a carne and let me tell you the flavor is powerful, the onions and cilantro are fresh, the salsa has just enough heat to seal the deal and bring the flavor all together, this place is now one of my top five to get tacos from!"}
{"text":"I work close by with  limited time for lunch. I call in my order and they are always pleasant even though I know they are slammed. The decor is nice, it's very clean and service is generally pretty fast. I cannot tell you how good there food is. I generally get the carne asado tacos which are amazing. I have had several items on the menu, I am always pleased. Their salsa is great to. Great place."}
{"text":"Food is really great but the counter help is unusually bad. They put you on hold and then forget about you, frequently get take out orders wrong, generally seem confused all the time and are surly as hell. They're the only bad thing about the place!"}
{"text":"Carnitas burrito is amazing and addictive. Carnitas tacos and fresh a great. Chips and guacamole are delicious. We loved that they had many different salsa for us to pick from!"}
{"text":"We have been going to Los Taquitos for 5 years or so and enjoy their food.  They offer gluten free options and are always willing to accommodate your preferences.  Their flan is really good and well priced although sometimes it can be dry or not have enough carmelized sugar.  My husband loves the street tacos, a real deal on Tuesdays (long wait lines).  They add white potatoes to extend the meat and cheese in some of their dishes if that matters to you."}
{"text":"I was actually looking for a new taco Tuesday spot. Though they had what I was looking for, $1 tacos, I ended up getting the carne asada burro.  It was very good, just big enough to fill me up but not so big that I had leftovers. The meat had beans mixed in with some kind of a smoky chipotle flavor, and bites of red onion and cilantro. I went at lunch time and it was very busy so make sure to give yourself some extra time."}
{"text":"My favorite tacos!!! I always get the Asada tacos with green salsa and spicy carrots. I make sure to call ahead because the place gets crazy busy. It is so good, and I cannot get enough!"}
{"text":"Needed breakfast close to the Hilton...wasn't disappointed. Breakfast quesadilla and chorizo breakfast burrito were both on point. Food was fast and super hot when brought to the table! Perfect with their margarita! Don't judge! We were on staycation!"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday! $1 street tacos that are full of flavor. The happy hour is a little misleading. It's $3 for beers and $4 for the house margarita. If you get a flavor it's regular price (which they did not disclose when offering). The rice was authenticated but the beans were a bit subpar and had a lot of skins/salt. The salsa is fresh made and delicious! Definitely worth adding onto your meal."}
{"text":"in Phoenix for new years, yelped for tacos and found this place. Turns out it had been on the Guy Fierri show but that doesn't always mean great food for me. Anyway, tried the rolled tacos and they were actually superior to all other rolled tacos I've had. I don't know if they put sauce inside, but it tasted like they did. Very good flavor. Howard had the carne asada burrito, also had a very different and spicy, smoky flavor than any other carne asada we've tried, but small for what he likes. Although, the price was like $3.95. There were people standing waiting for tables, but it worked out perfectly and we were able to sit and get served quickly. Would definitely go back. The menu is large and has something for everyone."}
{"text":"Los Taquitos gets an extra star for their habanero salsa.  It made me sweat, it made me cry and I'm in love.  I drank the leftover salsa like a shot, it was that good.  All the little things (slowish service and register issues) have already ironed themselves out.  Expect a delicious, fast meal."}
{"text":"My favorite taco spot, period.  I usually eat 7-8 (street) tacos in a sitting....the carnitas, carne asada, chicken are my favorites in that order.  Rice and beans finish the job nicely.  I brought a coworker from Costa Rica here.  He didn't like the food in ANY of the local restaurants I took him to because none of the meat had the great flavor he was used to...except for this place.  He was horking down 12-15 carne asada tacos in one sitting!  Insanity, but a testament to how good their food is.    Five stars, every time."}
{"text":"We went to Los Taquitos today.  My mom and I had the street tacos and we really liked them. My dad had the bombero burrito and he liked it and he likes spicy food but said he wouldn't order it again. The bombero sauce has a little smoky flavor and neither of us are a fan of the smoky flavor in sauces unless it's barbeque.   My nephew had the chicken enchiladas with the green chili sauce and he liked them.   VERY affordable good food. I would go back. :-)  I believe they are remodeling which they need to do mostly cuz of the order area, soda area, and condiment area.  It is so congested in that area. It was FREEZING in there today, they need to turn the heat on."}
{"text":"I can't believe I didn't find this place sooner. They have great food and not so bad prices. The beans and rice are excellent! Their tacos on Tuesdays are a steal and some of the most delicious street tacos I've had in awhile."}
{"text":"I usually write a more complete review, but I just don't feel like it right now  Overall rating: average (good but not great. Wouldn't go out of my way to eat there)  Food: 3 stars Service: 2 stars. No wow factor or friendly banter. Not rude but not friendly Ambience: 2 stars and set up is poor Prices and quantities: 3 stars  If you're close by try it but I wasn't impressed. Cheese enchilada was bland and cheese not melted at all. I can get that at any Filibertos. Salsas are good and a few varieties. They put a red hot sauce on everything which makes each dish taste pretty much the same. Pastor and carnitas (although they really aren't carnitas - fried) are your best meat choices. Chicken to dry. Like I said...average"}
{"text":"Second time here for taco Tuesday. The main complaint I have about his place is it's a fast food joint and they expect tips. They have a tip jar at the register and the receipt also has a designated line for gratuity. I'm all for tips but they don't serve you and everything is self serve. I don't believe in leaving a tip to place an order which I didn't.   I felt like the employees frown upon it and treat you sub standard if you don't leave a tip. They asked many customers if they wanted carrots and sauce. They didn't even offer either to me. Mater fact, I felt they were very abrupt and dismissive."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh!! What was I thinking. I always check Yelp. This time I didn't and I got a burrito the size of a $2Taco Bell bean cheese for $9!! What the heck!! Don't do it. Go elsewhere. The food tastes good. They just needs help here. Rice and beans go inside the burrito, not on the plate next to it. Last thing. It's called Los Taquitos.... But they don't actually serve Taquitos? This place is lost."}
{"text":"Really good food. Plenty of vegetarian options. The restaurant was clean and decorated nicely. Might be the cleanest restaurant bathroom I've ever been in!"}
{"text":"I was really in the mood for some Mexican food so we went by Los Taquitos. It's very much a hole-in-the-wall place and based on the Yelp reviews, I had high expectations. We walked up to the counter & the cashier was highly distracted. After repeating my order about 4 or 5 times, she finally put it in.  I got the shrimp tacos with rice & beans. My date got three of the street tacos - asada, pollo, & carnitas with rice & beans. He enjoyed them but said they were not spectacular. The shrimp taco had potential to be really good as it had the well-seasoned shrimp, rice, and sour cream, but there were way too many jalapeños in it. I like food that has a kick but this was almost inedible. I did my best to pick them out and added the beans to tone down the heat. I'm not sure if I just got the wrong thing or what but it wasn't too great of an experience."}
{"text":"Must try this place!  My coworkers and I have gone here for years for lunch. The street tacos meal is so tasty. Ask for both green and red salsa!"}
{"text":"I ordered a carne asada burrito, the woman asked me if i said carnitas, i repeated twice CARNE ASAAADDDAAAA slowly so she could understand. She didn't. After waiting about 15 minutes for my food, I received a carnitas burrito. Went back to get the correct order and stood there for another 5 minutes while she kept taking orders. Manager came out, made my carne asada burrito and handed it to me.  So I open up my burrito, take a bite  and I have to actually hold it upside down to pour grease out of it. Not just drops, I'm talking 1 tablespoon at least of oil. It was all over my hands, it was disgusting had to throw it away. The portions of beans and rice are chintzy. Service is bad and slow, and food is not good. Will not eat here again."}
{"text":"If you like rubbery chicken in your tacos and fish tacos with a pound of salt in it then you are gonna fall in love with this place....The beans and rice served with tacos tasted like as if they have been prepared a month ago....Really bad food...I ordered prickly pear margarita (which was very strong) with the shitty food which made my dinner bit tolerable...so, if you wanna eat here, first get drunk with their margarita only then you'll be eat their food."}
{"text":"It's very good Mexican food. But it's not like your typical tasting Mex food. I've been coming here since before they remodeled. Their Carne Asada Is very good. And the rice and beans are phenomenal as well."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place it is so addicting! It is always pretty busy and the space is small but it is sooo worth it. The  Tortas are THE perfect sandwich, their meat is so flavorful and the bun that they use is soft and toasted with mayo, lettuce, tomato, their homemade salsa and onion. My husband and I usually share the chicken Torta, a bowl of their AMAZING pozole, and a couple of Carnitas tacos. Flavorful, affordable, delicious! Enough said."}
{"text":"A carne asada burrito with salsa verde is my standard for comparing different mexican spots. The food is a 4, but I took away a star because the place looks really dirty. There was food on the floor that I had to step over to get to a seat.  The burrito though pretty much hit the spot. The meat had a texture I expect from good quality meat and the tortilla was perfect. To improve the experience, I'd like to see salsa bottles at the tables, and I'd want the green salsa to taste a little greener - some extra cilantro in there would be good but also some extra heat. I also prefer whole beans over re-fried beans."}
{"text":"Super fresh bowls, the asada one was too salty but the red chili beef bowl looked like it had hand cut green peppers and onions!  The menu sports a margarita and beer selection with happy hour specials too."}
{"text":"Service is good and the food...especially the street tacos amazing...Hehe."}
{"text":"I was just actually impressed with this place. We came in and they got super busy, and all of the employees just kept their cool and kept with their fast and friendly service. Their burrito was delicious, my boyfriend get the tacos and looking at those made me drool.. I would definitely recommend it on any chill day you want some legit Mexican food."}
{"text":"Been here twice now and in short, Meh. The food is fine. There isn't really anything to complain about as far as flavor, but the flow within the restaurant is hampered because it is really narrow and the portions are smaller than at comparable places. I consistently leave hungry."}
{"text":"Love this authentic little place. Didn't care for talarpia tacos but the rest of it is amazing."}
{"text":"Not a good value. Burrito bowl mostly chicken, not much else. Rice undercooked and a few hard ones. Sauces nothing special and not labeled. Pico mostly onion, few tomatoes."}
{"text":"Love this place... really good Mexican food.. they always have posole and menudo available! Affordable and they are very helpful and fast... if you need a quick bite to eat you won't go wrong with this place. Their burritos are awesome as well..."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. One of our regular spots, and it never disappoints. They are always fast, and the food is consistently delicious. They have a good happy hour menu, and we're always stuffed whether we come at regular times or during happy hour.   We love the fresh salsas and the option you have to bring them to your table. The chips are good, and the beans on the side are delicious. We've never had them get an order wrong, or run out of food in the back.  Things that we've tried and loved: tacos al pastor, steak tacos, carnitas burrito & tacos, chicken burrito.   Really good value, happy workers, quick service, and delicious food!"}
{"text":"This place is in the lunch rotation. Whenever we decide to go a little further than our usual lunch location radius and  venture into Ahwatukee. It's in a mall (isn't everything anymore) and there's always plenty of parking. You might want to come before noon, though, if you are in a big group and want to sit inside. The place seems to be pretty popular after being featured in dumpsters, divers, and douchebags or whatever that program is called. I don't like going anywhere just because some TV program hyped it up. Might as well eat at McDonald's because you've seen their commercials so many times. Anyway, I've tried most of their street tacos and I'm partial to the marinated pork (Carnitas). Not sure why they have Spanish for most of their menu but instead of Carnitas it's \"marinated pork.\" It is an interesting recipe - includes condensed milk and coca-cola. That's the secret recipe. Well, either the secret's been let out of the bag or it wasn't ever that secret because when I googled Carnitas recipes there were hundreds with  those same two ingredients. Whatever the case, I love that flavor and I'm addicted to it. Is it really the kind of coke you drink or the other kind? Whatever the case, I like it and will keep coming back."}
{"text":"Finally tried their hard shell tacos, and was blown away by the shell.  I would have been happy with a normal hard shell, but Los Taquitos' version seems like it was homemade and freshly deep fried!    Amazing texture with a hint of sweetness.  Can't recommend enough"}
{"text":"As the cheapest hearty breakfast option in C-Terminal, Los Taquitos grabbed my attention. Always down for a classic chorizo and egg, I was in for a less painful total of $7.  Setup is as pictured. Your burrito comes wrapped with egg/meat, cheese, and pico. Pappas/potatoes are actually served on the side, and you have two little cups of salsa.  I liked the overall burrito. Egg being scrambled fresh is always a must, plus the slightly crisp exterior of the tortilla. Not sure if the norm, but they somehow managed to fold my chorizo and egg opposite each other in a yin-yang fold with tortilla, so that was pretty neat.  The potatoes were for oiled and cooked on the flat top. Basically cut like half fries, they were a little oily for me but had a good bite, kind of like a parboil or bake. Both salsas were actually really good - the red one had that spicy bite to it.  I just wanted food for breakfast, nothing great but something that wouldn't break the bank. Los Taquitos did it; no wonder it's the most packed in lower C-Terminal."}
{"text":"I have been going to los taquitos for about 7 years now on 48th and Elliot.  Food is always so good and good portions.  I must say I was very disappointed with my visit to the new location in chandler.  It's down the street from me so was really excited to see it go up, but once there..... Wow they have some work to do.  Staff isn't very friendly.  My order was wrong and after reading other reviews this seams to be the trend at this location.  Some of my favorite food items are gone, but still ok considering everything I order is usually very good.  Prices are going up on items, and food portions are now getting smaller.  I ordered some asada street tacos and they were filled with mostly onion instead of meat.  $1.75 for an onion taco and a sprinkle of meat is kinda outrages.  I get it, the rent needs to be paid for new locations but don't ruin the experience for your regulars that have very gladly kept you in business for many years.  Ill try out the chandler location in a couple weeks to see if it gets any better but for now I'll keep going out of my way to the other location like I have been for years."}
{"text":"What a lovely place! Not the typical self service but stylish place plus nice and helpful people at the counter. And what matters most: very delicious Mexican food at a great price, we loved it!"}
{"text":"This place is very very good.  Outstanding food and service.  Excellent Carne Asada and salsa's.  Like that they have posole on Saturday and Sunday. I've been to all their locations, but this one in Ahwatukee at 48th and Elliot is the best.  Definitely in my top in the entire valley, and that says a lot, as I truly get it when it comes to good Mexican food."}
{"text":"I really want to like this place because I work close by, but I have one thing to say...   I always get the same thing because its awesome,   Green chili burrito enchilada style with green sauce   It is soo good but every time I get it the pork is pink (not my favorite) so finally when ordering I asked for the meat to be well done and explain why... I was told no.....no?.... hmm... I asked over and over why and nobody could give me an answer....   SOOOO my only guess is that its a pre-made frozen burrito that they slap some sauce on....other than that its not bad."}
{"text":"My friend showed me this place. This is why we Yelp because I would have never found this place. Great little Mexican that is about as close to the real thing as you can get. I loved everything I've had but the green chile pork burrito is killer, try it enchilada style."}
{"text":"Whoa, get the breakfast burrito with chorizo!  This place is just up the road from one of our offices in Tempe.  On Taco Tuesday's, you can get street tacos for $1.  The line apparently wraps around the building.  Located in a strip mall, the restaurant itself is very clean and modern.  Awesome paintings and decor throughout.  It took about 10 minute for 2 breakfast burritos to be made and served, but it was well worth the wait.  Upon unwrapping the steamy beast, it just looked like a regular burrito.  Biting into the flour tortilla released a perfect blend of cheese, chorizo, egg, and potatoes that sent the taste buds into a wild Jarabe Tapatio.  The heat from the chorizo lingered long enough to warrant another few bites.  Within three minutes, the burrito vanished into the neglected pits of my stomach.  This place warrants a pit stop if you're cruising into or out of Phoenix."}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, where do i even start. The steak tacos are probably the best tacos i have EVER had. The first bite and i was in love. The meat is full of a delicious, juicy, smokey flavor. Unfortunately i was only in town visiting, i live in California which means that i would have to drive 6 hours to get a hold of these tacos."}
{"text":"The food was just ok. Had a chicken burrito.  The filling was not very much, the portion size was small (mostly tortilla), they gave a bunch of rice & beans, both were under seasoned. On the burrito, the tortilla was hard.  Chicken enchiladas were ok..  Shrimp tacos were good, the shrimp was seasoned well.  :/ was hoping for way more out of this place."}
{"text":"This place has the best carne asada burritos in the world!! Any time we are in Phoenix, it is one of the places I have to go, in fact, I went there twice on my last trip.  The prices are great, cute little place with great, authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"My son comes here for the tacos but I am all about the chile relleno.  I never had one with potatoes inside, but oh my, this was the best!  My only recommendation would be to order it dry, with the sauce on the side.  I am counting the days until I get back to AZ.  The new location is so much closer to us, I plan on trying all of their menu, but....but... that chile relleno is ....calling....me.......! The tacos were very very good though."}
{"text":"Doesn't seem very clean, staff is rude, waited 30 mins for a burrito that wasn't what I ordered. Food was ok."}
{"text":"Went to Taquitos today.    The service was worse than their usual indifferent mediocrity.   Today they told me to wait while they spoke with a vendor rather than taking my order.     Following that they did not even meet the minimum bar of getting my order right. It was nowhere close.  I have previously been to Taquitos and had decidely mediocre service but excellent food.  Unfortunately they could not even meet that standard this time.  Spend your money somewhere where it will be appreciated."}
{"text":"I feel rather pathetic that I don't write more reviews, but I have no choice on this one.  I was looking to try a new Mexican food restaurant and someone had referred me to this place.  I came in (interior is nice/well setup -- I would assume renovated over the last year or so -- sort of reminds me of a modern-style Chipotle) and ordered a Carnitas Burrito with beans and rice.  Upon ordering, I looked up to find an AC vent covered (more like caked) in dirt.  That grossed me out (shockingly, I still placed an order).  While I waited, I noticed another AC vent near the soda machine that was caked in dirt/dust/who knows.  I felt bad and didn't want to embarrass the 18-year olds at the front, so I called once I got into my car to let them know and was rather shocked the owner(s) haven't noticed their vents or any employees.  Hmm...hopefully they take my advice and seriously clean the vents or if it's too late for that, take them off and spray paint them white or BUY a brand new vent.  The food:  The burrito was weak -- only comes with onions and pico (odd because if you get one, say at Chipotle, you can get guac, sour cream, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, salsa, black beans, etc).  Seems a bit odd for $5 not to allow additions.  The carnitas alone were fairly fatty, so not good at all.  The rice was good.  The beans were watery and a bit too salty -- I believe someone else that left a review for Los Taquitos said the same thing.    Overall, not good.  I'm shocked based on the fact that these recipes came from Mexico (owners are apparently from there and brought family recipes to their restaurant via the website).  You get more lettuce, tomatoes, cheese at Taco Bell.  Now, that's pretty sad isn't it?  I won't be back."}
{"text":"Very good food.  One day after having a miserable lunch at Manuel's in Tempe I was able to make up for it by having dinner here.  The food here was much better, right away I knew it was going to be a big improvement, even the chips were good, fresh and tasty.  For an entree I had the chile relleno (what I had tried to have at Manuel's) and was very pleased.  The chile options weren't overly spicy, but they had good flavor.  I will definitely come back when in the area again."}
{"text":"This place is legit! My friend from Yuma has claimed this is the most authentic Mexican food restaurants in phoenix. Story goes a little something like started as a food truck got popular. And was even featured by Guy Ferri (white hair dude on food network). I always order a variety of street tacos. Sometimes my friends will ask someone at the counter what they're favorite thing on the menu is. They've always been awesome suggestions. They were extremely satisfied (surprising bc neither of them are huge on Mexican food). I live this place and dine here regularly. As a matter a fact I'll prob go down for lunch today. 1$ taco Tuesday!!!"}
{"text":"Oh My God! The street tacos, the chilaquiles, the flan, the salsas! This is a great place to get good authentic Mexican food and also some of the \"Americanized\" dishes (sour creme, sauce-covered burritos, cheddar cheese). I stick to the street tacos and chilaquiles but the menu is really large. They have taco Tuesdays ($1 per taco) but beware, it gets busy."}
{"text":"Probably best street tacos I have had in phoenix.  People are overall nice, place is clean and you get a fair portion for the price paid.  Kind of a no non-sense place:  order your food, wait, go to counter to get food, eat and leave.  Only thing that pohibited 5 stars are that the alcohol drink prices are too high."}
{"text":"Excellent! My wife and I went for the happy hour $1 tacos & $3 margaritas and we were not disappointed! Go for the soft shell tacos and order some guac on the side and Enjoy! Staff was friendly and quick and the price was right. Family friendly and has a little patio with about four tables if you like to sit outside. Definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"Could be the worst \"burrito\" ever. The only reason I knew it was a burrito is because that's what I ordered. Frozen lettuce on top. Chicken that looked like it had never been on a live chicken. Good news was there was enough hot sauce to completely douse it. Hope I don't get any food poisoning- I'll be on a plane for a long time. Might not let my dogs eat here."}
{"text":"Awesome family run business! Amazing, fresh & authentic Mexican cuisine. We have been \"regular's\" for 12+ years! Huevos Rancheros is legit!! Shrimp burrito is another fav!!"}
{"text":"I saw this on DD&amp;D a few weeks ago.  It is a little bit of a drive for me, but I decided to take my daughters over there for a Saturday lunch.  Once I walked in I realized I had been here before a few years ago with a friend that lived in the neighborhood.  He really liked the place.    I ordered tacos, chicken, pork and carne asada.   I got an enchillada for the girls.   The girls didn't like the enchilada and the sauce seemed pretty boring and kind of sweet.  The rice was about as plain as could be, but the beens were kind of special.  They were closer to straight pinto beans then refried beans.  The were lightly mashed with plenty of bean chunks in a light sauce.  The bean flavor was strong.  The girls liked the beans mixed with rice and I enjoyed the beans and mexican cheese.  The chicken taquito was the best of the bunch.  The marinated pork took second but was a little dry.  The carne asada brought up the bottom.  It had a bit of a gassy taste and was far behind the great carne asada at El Sol.    The tacos here are small as the name suggests but three of them are plenty for a lunch.    I would like to go back for a Diablo burro and to try the fish tacos.  Overall this is an above average fast food place and the best place I have found for street tacos."}
{"text":"Came here a couple of times for Taco Tuesday. The first time the wait was so long just to get like 5 tacos. The second time, we figured we would order via the phone and then just pick up our order to go. Alexa got our order completely wrong and we still had to wait. The food is good for the most part if you have lots and lots of time to kill to wait for your food. But we probably won't be going there again."}
{"text":"This was a pleasant dining experience. Wanted some Mexican and we found it! Reasonable prices for 2 and it was very TASTY! Very casual and the wall was painted wonderfully with a mural that was very interesting!! Fast walk up service and clean inside! Definately goint to go back!"}
{"text":"Delicious as always! Love the new look, service of friendly staff, and of course the food!"}
{"text":"I've been to this location several times. They are consistently slow to get your food to you. This morning I went in fairly early and there was one couple in front of me. I ordered one burrito to go and sat down. During the course of my 35 minute wait, yes 35 minutes, I overhear complaint after complaint, people getting the wrong order. One guy had waited 50 minutes for 4 burritos and had still not gotten them. The couple in front of me hadn't gotten their food. When i finally asked about my food, another woman came up asking for her money back because they had been there an hour. There were 3 girls working the counter and none of them knew what the hell was going on and there excuse was that \"they had a received a large order and were backed up\". Not my problem or any other patrons problem. Serve the customers who are in your restaurant or you may not have any come back. I love the food but the service would definitely make me not come back.  Long story short, i waited 35 minutes for my food, got home, and it was the wrong burrito. Threw it in the trash because i don't like sour cream. Highly disappointed. Probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Went with my Wife and we ate ordered chicken enchiladas and Taquitos.  I could not finish my enchiladas. They both were so bland tasting we were very disappointed."}
{"text":"I hesitate to give 5 stars because I'd rather reduce the # of customers in front of me rather than increase. I've been coming here since 2010, they just expanded and have a lot more seating. Carne Asada burrito. Ceviche. Nothing bad on the menu."}
{"text":"Food is very good, and you cant beat the price. More diner than restaurant."}
{"text":"Guy Fieri definitely knows his food!  I had the three taco plate- carnitas, fish and pastor- all incredible. They were a bit small but the flavors were big.  The cashier also convinced me to try the imported mexican apple soda. I was skeptical but she told me it was her favorite so I had to get it. When in Rome, right?! It complimented the tacos well and I felt as if I had just stepped over the AZ/Mexico border to get some authentic street tacos."}
{"text":"UM HELLO. Where have I been all this time?!! Tacos here were great! Had lunch here during the week (12pm) and the parking lot was crazy full. I wasn't sure if everyone was at this place or somewhere else.   We ventured in and we quickly realized that the full parking situation was because everyone was in here getting some food! We got in line and started looking over the menu. The line was about 9 people long so we had time to look over it.   They have bowls, tortas, burritos, tacos, a three taco plate that comes with rice and beans, and I also saw that they the have menudo and posole, YUM.   I decided on four chicken tacos and my husband decided on the three chicken taco plate. The plate runs about $7 and each taco individual runs about $1.50. We each got our own drinks and those were, one soft drink and one agua fresca (Jamaica) We spent about $18.   This place was chaotic inside. Finding a table was a challenge as there were a ton of other customers looking for somewhere to sit as well. Luckily, we found one right when someone else was leaving so we sat down quickly.   We waited about 15 minutes for our food and they called it out by number. Our food was nice and hot so we quickly dug in. My chicken tacos were delicious. They were already dressed when I got them (cilantro, onion, and a green salsa) and so if you don't want any of the toppings make sure to let them know.   My husbands beans were really dry so we didn't eat them. The rice was a little bit over cooked so it was a bit soggy. The flavor was good though so we ended up eating it all.   They don't have a salsa bar but I did see red and green salsa bottles on the front counter. The inside of the restaurant is nicely kept and they had several tvs on as well as music. It was very loud on this day as there were a ton of people dining in.   Don't come during lunch time if your in a hurry but do make it out to try the yummy tacos!"}
{"text":"Al Pastor / Chicken / Carnitas Taco Tuesday $1 ea + Tx   Succulent meats slow roasted for hours to accommodate the throngs of pilgrims who flock to this restaurante authentico for a tongue tango amid spice and meat.  They close at 9pm, sharp.  At this time, there is no better place than this.  Beers, wines and Margs available   Wonderful red & green side salsa.  Less selection later on in the evening."}
{"text":"My husband and I were in town from Texas and were hankering for some good tacos. We read a few reviews and decided this was the place. SO glad we trusted most of the other reviewers!   House margaritas - really good! Asada tacos - Delicious! Favorite of the three we tried! Carnitas - a close second.  Pastor - not our favorite pastor (probably because we're HUGE pastor fans). These just fell a little short. Refried beans - FANTASTIC! Friendly staff.  Leaving full and satisfied. Highly recommend! (Sorry we didn't post a before pic!)"}
{"text":"OMG THIS PLACE IS SO GOOD! Been here three times already in three trips to Arizona and I live in California! Sauces are spicy but amazing, all different meats have flavor and their chile rellano burrito is the bomb and then some!! And the food is made fresh! You can customize pretty much anything too! Def try it out and see for yourself!"}
{"text":"Excellent tacos.  Fresh crisp corn tortillas doubled around wonderfully seasoned meats topped with cilantro, red onions, and salsa.  The bombero burro is smothered in almost a bbq meets red chile sauce and filled with the meat of your choice and rice wrapped in a homemade tortilla.  I had a carne asada taco, pastor taco, and a carnitas bombero.  All three were very tasty.  The building is located just north of the Walgreens on the NW corner of the street and they accept all credit cards.  The inside was typical chipole-ish urban decor and super clean.  All of the staff was very nice.  The only thing keeping it from a 5 is the price.  While its definitely affordable, I can remember while in Mexico as a kid I could get 5 of these tiny tacos for a buck.  And yes, all of them were made fresh with fresh tortillas.  But more power to them.  These girls are making excellent tacos and must be making a killing at 1.50 a pop.  That being said what I had was worth coming back for more.  I know I will be back to try everything on the menu at least once.  Heres a quick break down of the menu while its not up on their website: Tacos: Pollo, Carne, Carnitas, Pastor 1.50 Shrimp/Fish 2.25  Quesadillas: Cheese 4.50 Pollo/Chorizo 5 Carne, Carnitas, Pastor 5.25  Tostadas: 2.25-4.75 Tortas: 5.50-5.75 Burritos: 4-6.75 Enchiladas: 2-2.75 Bfast burros: 4-6 Caldos:  Fri and Sat only: Menudo and Pazole 5.95"}
{"text":"Good Mexican food. Not mind blowing, but it's just that."}
{"text":"The $1 Taco Tuesday deal is amazing. Not $1.99 or that BS, but literally $1.00 each for a limited array of tacos: pastor, carnitas, and chicken. I ain't complaining! Our total came to $8.69 including tax for 8 tacos.  The chicken tacos were I think the BEST chicken tacos I have ever had. The al pastor was spicy, saucy, and tender. Carnitas were also excellent but just a tad too salty for my taste.  10/10, would eat here again"}
{"text":"Los Taquitos changed the menu board above their kitchen/order area about 6 weeks ago and it's so confusing you can't figure it out.  And neither can the order takers or kitchen staff because on both of my recent visits I received the wrong orders. The staff is so befuddled they agree the business is in meltdown mode.  Plus...let me mention the quality of the food has dropped considerably.    This long-time patron WON'T be coming back!  I've put up with the dirty, worn, decrepit interior for these years because Ahwatukee lacks a quality mexican food place near my home but I won't tolerate a menu that's incomprehensible and food that's worse than Taco Bell.    To top it all off, the staff has become rude, probably due to frustration over how management has let this business go to ruin."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  I wish it were a little closer to my work, I'd go more often.  The meals are cheap and you get a lot of good quality food.   One time while I was here, one of the customers was asking the waitress about the tacos after he had finished his lunch.  He was interested in ordering them some way that he used to order them, but that they had taken off the menu for some reason.  She told him that they still made them that way if you asked, and he got a little disappointed that he hadn't ordered those for lunch that day.  She ended up giving him a couple of them to go for free because he didn't know they still made them the way he was asking.  Nice service."}
{"text":"In Phoenix for a business meeting and loaded the food network app to find a diners drive ins and dives. This place was first on the list. What a gem to find. Hands down the best tacos I've ever eaten. Taco Tuesday so I got the el pastor. The salsas were awesome and the heat was felt for hours. Just like I like it. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a taco fix. Too bad that they aren't located in my home town because I would be there every day."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my second visit and also the second time I woke up three hours after getting home with my lights and my clothes on. Let's just say the margaritas are made with love. They also have $1 street tacos with flavor. The cashiers are so nice and attentive. Come early because the line can end at the door."}
{"text":"They have great tacos & happy hour prices. $2 tacos, who wouldn't love that, we saw this on DD&D and decided to give it a try, we took family here from out of town & they loved it as well. Small place but good food & friendly service!"}
{"text":"Wow this place is great! We were in the area and it was still pretty early. We arrived at 10:30am and surprisingly there were people already dining in.  The cashier greeted us while we were looking over the menu but she had some attitude going on.. I was split between ordering the menudo and the posole, and she recommended I go with the posole.   We ordered one large posole (comes with your choice of tortilla) two chicken tacos, and one carne asada bowl.   The dining area is pretty big and they have seating outside as well. They yelled out our number and we went to pick up our food. Everything looked and smelled delicious!   The posole was pretty good! I added the toppings they provided and it was amazing. (Cilantro, cabbage, onion) The chicken tacos were so freakin good! The chicken was well seasoned and not at all dry. You do have the option of getting the tacos with everything on top or to just get your tacos plain. I got mine with everything on top. (Salsa, onion, cilantro)   My friend ordered the carne asada bowl and was surprised as too all the meat they had put in it. She did say though, she wishes they hadn't put so much pico de gallo and beans in it, and it needed more rice.   The inside was clean and the wall art is great to look at. The music was \"LIT\" and at times it got kinda hard to hear my friend.   Great food and they also have alcoholic drinks!"}
{"text":"Los Taquitos have great food ! I love the food there  Always fresh , taste great and nice portion and amazing green and smoky red salsas .  The 3 stars is for the 3rd time they made a mistake on my pick up order they gave me wrong food and I found out about that only when I got home I didn't double check because they \"double checked\" I would of give them 2 stars for this kinda service but I really love the food there but after 3 times I just had to leave this review so customers will double check their pick  up orders and the stuff working will actually double check . It's just annoying to get home and find out that you have to drive back again ."}
{"text":"All I can say is OHHHHH-MYYYYY-GOOOSSSHHHHHH!! I've been looking for a spot like this in Chandler!! This is BY FAR theeeeee BEST street tacos I've had around this area. I would HIGHLY recommend Los Taquitos to everyone. The street tacos are PHENOM!"}
{"text":"Had the super nachos and hard shell taco. Nachos were loaded- had extra toppings when we ran out of chips and the tacos were nice with a little heat."}
{"text":"Great place for casual Mexican fare.  Very flavorful and colorful.  The Chile Relleno was very different and totally enjoyable.  Friendly atmosphere and quick service. I have been back a few times to try other items on the menu and I have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had been flying all day and were hungry and craving Mexican food. So we came here. First of all they gave our order to some one else on mistake (get it together people, they weren't even busy) and took sooooo long to remake it. The manager was standing right there as he noticed what was going on and didn't even apologize for the inconvenience. The rice was DISGUSTING and the beans were bland. My burrito tasted like a frozen chicken burrito. I would NOT recommend coming here. This airport has a lot of food options. So go else where!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place, it's one of my favorite Diner Drive In and Dives, and I enjoy stopping anytime I get a chance and am going through the Phoenix area.  The restaurant area has expanded, and it looked cleaner and nicer than ever.  They are doing well.  I normally order the triple taco place with rice and beans, and it never fails to amaze me - the flavors in the meats are cooked in just perfectly.  I had a combo this time of chicken, carne asada, and carnitas - all excellent with the absolute right amount of spice.  Perfectly flavored rice, and just the right amount of cheese in the beans.  There were no tables outside like there have been in the past, and we had our dog with us, so they had no problem letting us taking a table outside, and we put it back when we were done!!  This is the perfect along the freeway fast and delicious stand-by!"}
{"text":"Sucks that this place was how we started our vacation off.  We had an early flight, so by the time we made it to our layover, we were pretty hungry. We didn't have much time so we thought some tacos and burritos would hit the spot. Wrong.  Not only was this place was pricey, you barely get any food. A tiny scoop of rice and beans, and 3 small tacos that looked miserable. I ate 1 taco before the corn tortilla fell apart. I dumped the other 2 and just ate the rice and beans.   It was also super packed and crowded, with barely a place to stand. Don't get your hopes up of finding a chair to sit in.  Luckily we were heading to Texas, where they have the best tacos around, so we could easily forget our experience here."}
{"text":"Awsome place. Guy Fieri never makes mistakes. Love his show and everywhere i go i google places he recommends. Food is very delicious. Fast service and great atmosphere. If you are in Phoenix you must visit this place!"}
{"text":"Well, I'm gonna be honest. The service is good. The food is bad. Sauces taste nasty. meat is not the freshest. The prices are ridiculous. 4 dollars for a bean and chez burrito?????  I'm sorry I would rather have a filbertos in this place.... at least I know that I'm gonna eat bad food. Just bc the \"guy\" shows up 5 years ago doesn't mean you have good food now. Redo the menu and prices. No Beuno."}
{"text":"Very good food and service. The two areas I would encourage them to work on would be:  1.  Attention to detail. In my first two visits so far, both times my burrito was wrong. The first time I asked for no beans, but when I got home I learned there were beans. Today I asked for no beans, add guac. Well the no beans happened but no guac either. These are small things but it's not hard to get right- so I hope they will work on attention to detail.   2.  Guacamole quality. I was very surprised to see such poor quality guac. It had a pudding like consistency and zero flavor. It is such a departure since all the food is flavorful and very good quality. I understand avocados are expensive but you can't serve green applesauce and call it guac. If it's that difficult or expensive I would remove it from the menu."}
{"text":"I love this place. The people who work here really make you feel at home.  I hadn't been there in a while and I forgot what I had ordered last time that was so good, so I accidentally ordered the wrong thing. Instead getting annoyed or giving me any sort of attitude, they asked what I really wanted and said they'd get it right out to me. I really appreciate people who don't make you feel stupid for making a mistake. I will be coming back soon for more of the great food, but above all, the great service."}
{"text":"Not the best airport food, not the worst. If you are hungry, you usually dont have many options. Be nice to your server and use lots of condiments."}
{"text":"One of the better breakfast places I have had at the airport!  I got the breakfast burrito with bacon and it also comes with a side of potatoes.   The wait time was pretty short and the quality was decent. Would come here again."}
{"text":"My 15 yr old insisted this was a good place to check out for authentic Mexican food. I will admit I was impressed. Got the pollo bowl and it was better than Chipotle and I don't find many places better than Chipotle."}
{"text":"Very very good! It is always clean and the staff is always very helpful. I have taken numerous people here and there have ever been any complaints."}
{"text":"30 minutes for 4 PLAIN tacos!!!!!!! Never again. It wasn't even that busy. It was 330!"}
{"text":"I thought the tacos and the cheese enchilada al-a-cart I purchased blasted with flavor. Nice job  The only thing I will say where an opportunity exists is the portions. The tacos are VERY small (2 bites) and the enchilada was 3 bites. I realize portion control but I had 2 tacos and an enchilada and I was still hungry walking out of the place. I'm not the smallest guy weight wise but for the price, I thought it could be a bit more meaningful in terms of portion."}
{"text":"I'm originally from Nogales Az and I've tried many Mexican restaurants here in Phoenix, but they never taste as good as home. Then I found los taquitos and their food is authentic, delicious and for a great price. The atmosphere and music is great! If you're looking for a good Mexican food this is the place to go."}
{"text":"We go to Los Taquitos weekly at a minimum post-workout.  The staff is all very friendly and we're always treated very well.  We usually split a breakfast burrito (no potatoes or meat, with added jalapenos) and a side of rice and beans - more than enough food.  Their margaritas are freshly made and delicious, as well!  I highly recommend!"}
{"text":"If I'm on a diet and someone took me here, there is no doubt I'm going to break that diet.  Avoid this place if you're on a diet!! Their food is so delicious! Tacos del pastor are my favorite."}
{"text":"Tried Los Taquitos for the first time today.  The street tacos were amazing!  We had the carnitas and the pastor tacos - both were delicious.  And the refried beans were light and yummy!  We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Like other Yelpers I recall seeing this place on Triple D and wanted to try but I am a North Phoenix resident who never makes it to the Tuke.  Good thing they took over the old San Gabriel or whatever the hell it was before. I enjoyed the carne asada tacos, good salsa, good rice & beans though I can't say I was really feelin' the value factor as much as I would have liked.  I cleaned the plate and probably could have eaten more, though I did skip breakfast and ended up at Los Taquitos about 2 p.m. :) I'll be seeing you again Los taquitos!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and great atmosphere! Had a great time looking at the cool art on the wall and the food was delicious. My wife and I will come back again!"}
{"text":"This is a great place that often gets passed by because of it's location - I'm typically not drawn to restaurants in strip malls, but this place came highly recommended. I was so impressed with the food, service and prices. It was honestly one of the most delicious and inexpensive Mexican dinners I've had in ages. I had the roasted veggie burrito, hubs had three tacos. Granted we were there during happy hour - but those two entrees with two bees was $15. I will 100 percent be returning, and urge you to check out this local gem."}
{"text":"Carne asada tacos are some of the best I've ever had! Beans and rice were not that great. Next time we will just get tacos. Staff was very friendly and professional."}
{"text":"Want some real Mexican food without hurting your wallet?  You've come to the right place.  But remember: the place is small. And I mean SMALL. To the point where if there were 3 people standing in line, you guys might be elbowing each other or bumping into each other because there are other people trying to reach around to you to grab condiments and refills or wait for THEIR food. I was sharing a small table with some stranger just because there was no space whatsoever. What makes it all worth it is the food.  The Chimichanga is only $5 or $6 and it is huge (in the meat of your choice) and tastes perfect in all of it's special cooked spices.  Come here and then come back again."}
{"text":"Loved it! So Rich and flavorful. Not expensive. I got the burrito in a bowl which is different than a burrito bowl because the burrito in a bowl has pinto beans and no rice. I got take out and ended up adding rice to the bowl when I got back to my room. My fault not theirs. Definitely delicious and worth multiple trips. I will be back"}
{"text":"We go here often because it's right by our house and also because the food is really good and nicely priced. We kind of have our regulars now: I'll always get the carne asada tacos and my wife will order the fish tacos and neither of those (sides included) ever seems to disappoint.   We did venture from our favorites in the beginning and everything we had was still good but we settled on our usuals. The only menu item we didn't really enjoy was the enchiladas. They weren't horrible but definitely not anything we'd order again. It's also pretty tough to make good enchiladas in a short amount of time though (IMO).   Overall, good cheap taco spot with some amazing rice as well!"}
{"text":"Staff are pretty rude, they are rushing through orders not reading the tickets properly-I was charged extra for avocado and cheese, but they were so buck rushing through orders that I didn't get either avocado or cheese. They also put fries and corn into the burrito bowl even though neither are called out on the menu-what's with adding items you don't have listed as ingredients? I don't recommend this place."}
{"text":"Food and service are always good. Margaritas are VERY tasty. It's a favorite of my picky teenager."}
{"text":"Have eaten here twice and had a bad experience both times. The first time I ordered take out and was shorted half of the food I paid for. I called and they were barely apologetic. Not to mention the food I got was below room temperature cold. However, my girlfriend really enjoyed her food so we decided to give it another try. I order her food and checked the receipt after I paid and was overcharged by several dollars. Again, barely apologetic. They did refund me the overcharge but this is the second strike and I've had it with this place."}
{"text":"Everything we ordered was delicious!!! Asada tacos ..  delicious! Pollo ....tacos delicious! Black beans ....delicious! Guacamole ....delicious!  Definitely recommend giving this place a try and I will definitely stop here next time I'm in Phoenix"}
{"text":"Best breakfast burritos in town, hands down! Go for the supreme with green salsa, perfection."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this location for a long time. The latest remodel is beautiful and the addition of the bar and expanded dining area turned the place into a nice eatery and is no longer the dive from the Guy Fieri days.   I judge my food by how good the basics are. With Mexican food, it's beans and rice. At Los Taquitos, the beans and rice are always excellent. They have their recipe nailed down.   This visit though I stuck to the tacos since it was Taco Tuesday. Two fish and two asada all on warm corn tortillas and I was happily full.   Paired with the Pomegranate Margarita, it was the perfect meal, all for under $15."}
{"text":"So pumped to have LosTaquitos in the neighborhood! Best tacos and burritos in Chandler hands down- and the tortas are one of a kind. I love the pastor, carne asada and shrimp!   This will be my new go-to for a quick, delicious homemade meal. 5 stars!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for authentic, fresh Mexican food served up hot and delicious without breaking the bank or taking up hours of your valuable time, Los Taquitos is the place to go! The tacos are to die for! My favorites are pastor, carne asada and shrimp. The tortas are the best I've ever had and the burritos are as good as anywhere in AZ. They also have plenty of beers and margaritas to choose from. The owners (5 sisters) are fun and friendly, the staff is on point and the atmosphere is festive. Viva Los Taquitos!!"}
{"text":"Stay far, far away.   Okay, so here's the backstory, I flew to Philly a few weeks ago from SFO and had a layover here. My flight was at 6am and being the responsible adult that I am, decided to go to a bluegrass festival in the city the day before. My friends and I weren't PLANNING on finishing the boxed wine but hey, these things just happen right? Anyway, I spent the night vomiting my brains out and it's a miracle how I even ended up making it on the plane but that's another story.  ANYWAY, fast forward a few hours later, I wake up in Phoenix and your girl is still hungover but feelin' like some food could help. Oh man, that was some wishful thinking. I ordered the vegetarian burrito bowl and the whole damn thing was SO salty I swear my hangover was coming back with full force and I was gonna vomit on the plane. I also bought a side of guacamole and that was SO salty too. That should be a crime.   I actually was so upset I tried to write a review while I was on the plane but completely forgot to finish it. So here I am almost a month later, better late than never!  Moral of the story: don't come here unless you want to overdose on sodium."}
{"text":"My fav autentico comida Mexicana !!! Hit this place 2x in 3 days! The tacos are awesome !! The pastor is so dang good perfectly seasoned. You just can't go wrong with this place. The folks behind the counter are so friendly! I had the pozole today and that dark red broth brought me back to life. The place is clean and has a good vibe with cool art on the walls. They have picnic tables outside on the patio. Both green and red salsas are tasty and not watered down. They make real margaritas with agave oh dear !!! Salted rim and they have a happy hour that goes until 7pm where the margaritas are $4 instead of $6 Yes !!!  They have a good selection of bottled beers like Pacifico, Modelo, Dos XX and Corona. They even had Corona Premier the Michelob Ultra low carb low calorie equivalent!!! Yes !!! The breakfast burrito was stuffed and at $6 was a really good tasting burrito! This place is good quality and a good value for great tasting food!!"}
{"text":"Great little place in a strip mall. Loved the burritos."}
{"text":"Tex-Mex? Guy Fieri visited and his memento can be found between the men and women's restroom doors, and no longer in the main dining area. Limited beer selection. Food is okay. Large parking space next to a big grocery store. Salty."}
{"text":"Fresh: -pico -ceviche  -enchilada sauce -jalapeños  ...and service.  Hope this place is here to stay for the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I come here with my brother for our bonding dinner time, and man oh man!  Never have I had my order wrong here, they just make everything so wonderfully, and when we get our food it is piping hot!  I love the fact that this is a small place located in the strip mall, and if you don't pay attention, you could miss it.  Its a wonderful place to grab a bite!"}
{"text":"The food wasn't the greatest, however I did like the casual atmosphere. I somewhat enjoyed my taco, but my horchata was absolutely horrible. It was grainy, and lacked authenticity."}
{"text":"My god amazing carnitas street tacos with fluffy tortillas! Nice atmosphere and cute little patio. What a gem! I wish I lived on this side of town just for the tacos! Quick service, pretty typical menu, so yummy!"}
{"text":"Can't really comment on the food but the staff is a bit less than friendly.  Would be nice if they would open up the place for the large crowds that gather early for first flights out. Maybe they don't like money and people."}
{"text":"Its a walk up counter and sit down kinda place. Not what I was expecting but the pork tacos were very good the chicken was just ok for me that is."}
{"text":"What I was thinking on the way to los taquitos:  \"I hate that Guy Fieri.  What a jerk.  First of all, he pronounces his last name all Italian, and I am 100% certain that he pronounced it like a full on american all his life until he made it on Food Network.  Then, he gets to drive around and taste greasy food all day.  Plus, he looks high as a kite sometimes on air, which probably makes the food even better.  Anywhere from 1-4 reasons to be jealous/annoyed with the guy, depending on who you are.\"  Also: \"I wish God would smite Beyonce.  Her songs are the most annoying songs I've ever heard.  If there were a way for her to get smacked into permanent silence, I'd be all for it.\"  And: \"I can't wait to eat at this place.  Street tacos sound delish.  Where is it?  Wait--this looks like a residential neighborhood.  Where the hell am I?\"  Ultimately I find the place and go in.  There's some floozy outside with a huge rack--only pertinent because she ended up being an employee.  Well I guess it isn't really pertinent then, either.  Anyway, I'm *wanting* to like this place.  I long to be able to say that I went to a place today and ate food that tasted like pureed happiness.  I want to give this place five stars and brag right and left that this is the place to be.  But I don't.  The service was good--the girl was nice (bc of an earlier review I was expecting the worst) and she told me the street tacos were the way to go.  I got the three tacos, one chicken, one carnitas, one steak (asada).  Plus rice and beans.  On corn tortillas.  And I got a sexy-looking bottle of coke.  When the food came out, I was devastated.  Where my three tacos should have been, I had three walniut-sized excuses for tacos.  Where my beans covered in mexican cheese should have been, I got beans covered in an afterthought of some white cheese (which isn't what I wanted.  Sue me).  Where my rice should have been there was rice.  1 for 3.  The street tacos all tasted ostensibly the same.  That punk Guy Fieri on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives on Food Network made it sound like I'd wet myself with glee upon eating the carnitas, and the lady making the batch acted like they'd be good enough to keep part of the recipe a secret.  They aren't.  That recipe should be open source for sure, so that maybe someone can come along and improve it.  I certainly could.  Anyway--maybe it was because he was high as a f*&^ing kite but the food did not taste like magic, it tasted like hot sauce.  And I am all for hot sauce--I'll bitchslap a habanero or two, no problem.  But the issue is that whatever I ate, it tasted like only the hot sauce.  I added green sauce--still the same flavor.  I wanted to be wowed, but instead I thought, \"Meh.  I've experienced better.\"  Which is why you see two stars here.  In fact, I don't blame Los Taquitos for doing what they do.  Whatever is fine by me.  But now I kinda wanna slew-foot Guy Fieri just that little bit more for telling me that this place was so good.  If you're gonna tell the world what's delicious, don't smoke out first, because I've been there and eaten a piece of my cat's litter and it tasted pretty decent to me at the time.  Hardly a reliable indicator of a culinary masterpiece.  A couple of disclaimers: I don't hate Guy, I have no idea if he smokes out, I'm not judging him or you, stoner.  But I am judging that very average set of tacos."}
{"text":"Carne asada and shrimp tacos are amazing! Tortas are also very good!"}
{"text":"YUM! Best place I've found so far in phoenix.  This place packs flavor into their tacos. I went with my boyfriend last night and ordered the chicken street tacos. He got tacos al pastor. Both were so frikin good. My mouth was watering. And the green and red sauce they give you really take things to the next level. The tacos are pretty small so my boyfriend had to order some more food to fill him up and he got one of his personal favorites, tamales. He said they were some of the best he ever had. The prices are great too. Very inexpensive for such good quality.  We moved here two weeks ago and this is the one of two places that we have loved. Other places we have tried out lack flavor and seem to love to pile on the cheese and sour cream to make up for it.   Writing this review is making me relive the joy of eating there I might just go back tonight!"}
{"text":"Another winner for Ahwatukee!    This morning I had to run to the grocery store to pick a few things and decided to get some major points with the BF by bringing home a breakfast burrito!  I got there around 8:20 and saw on the door that Los Taquitos doesn't open until 9 on Sunday.  No biggie, I thought.  It should be around 9 by the time I'm done at the store.  So I take my time browsing the grocery aisles to ensure a 9 am departure.  Walk in the door of Los Taquitos at 9:00 exactly and am successful in getting order #1 for the day!  Chorizo and potato for him, tacos for me.  As much as I love the breakfast burritos, I find them a little too heavy for me first thing in the morning.  So I started getting two tacos instead.  Usually, I get one carne asada and one chicken, on corn tortillas, of course!  The meat is delicious, the taco is tasty, and it's a perfect way to indulge in the goodness of Los Taquitos without feeling like I need a nap right after breakfast.  The service is quick and friendly, the place is clean, and the salsa is good (I prefer the green over the red, or both)!  As Guy says \"winner, winner, chicken dinner!\"  Well, I know he isn't the only one that says that . . . but he does work it in quite often!  Ok, and this isn't exactly a chicken dinner . . . but, you get the point, right?  Just go to Los Taquitos! =)"}
{"text":"All I have to say is that this place rocks. It gets crowded and they are always busy but I can't knock down stars for that. There food is on point all the time I never have any complaints aside from just the mass amount of people shoved inside the place.   I've tried as much as I can on the menu and my go to item is the red chili beef, chimi or enchilada style burrito. The green chili pork is amazing as well. The chicken is good too but is grilled and not really marinated that much but I haven't tried it a lot.   The tortas are another goto item for me as well. The carne asada is my favorite. Regardless of what you choose I doubt you'd be disappointed. Awesome place."}
{"text":"Los taquitos is great for a street tacos craving and they also serve alcohol if you need to take the edge off.  The pastor taco is very tasty and the art murals on the way are awesome to observe.  Make sure though if you want tacos ala carte without beans and rice you need to specifically tell them or else the add it on automatically, (womp womp).  Anyway this is a great tacos spot and it's quick!"}
{"text":"I was quite hesitant on whether I wanted to give this restaurant a try because this specific lot is always changing out every year.   I'm glad I did give Los Taquitos a try and I truly hope they are here to stay!   Tacos were very tasty (there was one that was too spicy for my taste but still very flavorful), bright artwork to admire, and I believe I saw that their taco Tuesday special entailed $1 tacos. I definitely want to come try those out with some drinks!"}
{"text":"Do it.  Order anything. It's all good. Reasonably priced. If you can handle hot, order the bombero suace. It's worth it."}
{"text":"This place rocks! I had the shrimp in ranchera sauce and it was great.  The price is right and it's a clean joint. The chile, rice, beans, and tortillas were also great."}
{"text":"Holy frijoles, Los Taquitos is like a lunchtime fiesta! I raced over on my work break to meet my Yelpmigos, the place was packed with wall to wall people. Crunched for time & it being my first visit I didn't order much, quesadilla con jalapenos & a diet coke. The cashier tried to warn me they'd be hot, they must have grown them in the pits of hell because I think they scorched my tongue! My quesadilla was good, hot yes but the peppers were tasty & fresh so I'd order them again! My food came out fast, and everyone's food disappeared just as quick as it appeared! I'll definitely be back, the food is good, the service is friendly and fast, it's also been Guy Ferrari tested and yelper approved!"}
{"text":"Huge negative: I ordered a chicken taco, shrimp taco, and a fish taco and all of their meat was overcooked, extremely tough.  Positives: The beans were good, and rice was okay. The art in the building is beautiful. Service was good."}
{"text":"I met up with a friend for dinner here the other night. It's a little far from me, unfortunately; if this was within a few miles of me, I'd be here a -lot-.    For starters, the place is easy to miss. It's a hole in the wall. It's very small inside, only a few tables; definitely consider takeout.     That said, if it's not busy, don't be afraid to stay. We ate in; when there was a significant lull in the crowd, the girl behind the counter came both to clear our tables and to deliver a second item I ordered a bit later in the evening. I wish I'd been carrying cash, there is a tip jar by the register, and I would have loved to have left something for that.     The food...ah, the food. Great bang for the buck. Have I had better tacos? Yes. Once, handmade by a Mexican immigrant my mother was good friends with, as we joined her for a family dinner. In restaurants? No. This is good Mexican street food, small hand made corn tortillas with flavorful, moist meat on them, and some warm salsa on top. Lovely. They even offer lengua, for those that like it, a very nice touch.     As others have said, the rice is very good; I wasn't actually that fond of the beans though.     Is this place worth going 20 minutes out of your way? Unfortunately, no, hence the 4 star. But is it worth going to if you're already nearby? Yes, very much yes."}
{"text":"Love Los Taquitos. Excellent tacos al pastor. Their burritos are good as is their breakfast. Always playing great music so the atmosphere is relaxed. Recommended for lunch or quick dinner."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place! Being from San Diego we know our Mexican food and this place is great. The Chicken Torta is bomb!"}
{"text":"10 minutes to get a burrito in an airport fast-food Mexican taquiera. Never again. Plus, my bottle of water was nearly $5. Come on man...  NOT recommended"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! I mean everything in the menu is very tasty. The way they cook the carne asada you can really taste the charcoal!! It's authentic mexican food. I can't say enough about this place. Kudos to the ladies in the kitchen who make it happen every day. Sometimes they don't get the recognition they deserve so I want to thank them for their excelent service! The salsa verde is perfect. I mean nothing negative about this place."}
{"text":"The carnitas is amazing. This place is down the street from my office so we go once a week. The shredded beef is great, the pork is perfection. Service is fast and friendly. I just wish there was better parking. Its in the Walgreen's parking lot and its packed. But this place is well worth it."}
{"text":"Tried Los Taquitos today for lunch for the first time based on YELP reviews!  Once again - Thanks YELP!!  The food was excellent, I had the fish tacos, and my lunch date had the carne asada and lengua tacos - all were excellent.  We plan to go back there and experience more of their menu (I'm a sucker for Pozole - looking forward to trying theirs).  The restaurant is a bit cramped during the lunch hour with the people in line to order tripping over the people waiting for their orders and all being elbowed by the people trying to either pick up their food when it's ready or fill their drinks (\"bit cramped\" was an understatement).  Our plan of attack for future visits is to go at an off time, possible for a late lunch, hoping it won't be so packed then."}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favorite Mexican places to visit when I'm back home from school. I usually get a marinated pork burrito with red sauce on top, and it is absolutely delicious. It's spicy and tastes extremely authentic considering that this restaurant is located in Ahwatukee. It's a nice little hole-in-the-wall place that is especially great for pick-up orders."}
{"text":"I was craving street tacos for lunch and Los Taquitos did not disappoint.  I ordered the pollo street taco dinner.  The tortillas are homemade, the chicken was marinated and cooked perfectly.  I also enjoyed the tasty beans and rice.  I would prefer to have someone take my order instead of standing in line, but otherwise had good experience."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorites to eat for Mexican food.  They have an amazing $2 street taco deal on Tuesdays and some options for healthier options like the bowls that come with brown rice and black beans instead of the regular rice and bean options.  The staff is very busy but always friendly and kind.  Plus they have carrot and jalapeños which are my go to."}
{"text":"WOW!! Glad we finally made it to Los Taquitos! We came for our 1st (and certinaly not last) visit to LT and gotta tell ya - there is a good reason there is a buzz around it!  The Carne Asada was very tasty in my street tacos, the carnita and pastor meat were very tasty and tender.  Their \"hot\" sauce in the bottles on the table is a good blend of taste/sweet with a little heat.  Can't wait to go back and try more from the menu!"}
{"text":"I had the 3 taco combo (carnitas, beef, and chicken) with beans and rice and added a fish taco.  Each one had it's own specific flavor and topping.  Everything was extremely fresh.  I think that the fish taco was my favorite.  The rice and beans seemed like they were good and you could tell they didnt come out of a can.  I didnt see any beer, which would have been great with the tacos.  But oh well. The mural itself is worth the trip.  it's really awesome."}
{"text":"Remodel looks great and the food is just as delicious. The hot sauce differentiates this place from every other quick mex joint. Really friendly staff seals the deal for me"}
{"text":"Best Authentic Mexican Food in town around. I would typically travel the ways to Don Ponchos for some bomb.com type of food. I found their replacement. Must try spot. Tacos on point along with their Menudo and burritos. The Pastor has flavor like no other, that alone has me coming back for more."}
{"text":"Big disclaimer about this review.....  I was finishing up my meal when I saw the waitress bring a bottle of red sauce and a bottle of green sauce to the condiment area.  Apparently, they have 4 bottles for the entire restaurant and a couple of customers decided to bring them to their table.  I didn't know that.  Chips/salsa are $2.49 and they charge for pico so I passed on both.  That being said, you're about to read a review for a Mexican food with no pico, no salsa, no red sauce, and no green sauce.    I ordered the \"Choose 3\" meal and got one asada, one carnitas, and one fish taco.  The meal option adds rice and beans.  All 3 were a bit dry (see above).  They just don't naturally come with a lot of wetness.  They have jalapenos and lime in the condiment area, but they are stored uncovered and they were dry as well.  The tacos were a little too bland for my taste, especially the fish taco.  The rice and beans are average.  The total was $7.12 but I did not get a drink.  I'm a \"sauce whore\" at Mexican restaurants so you can take or leave my opinion on the food.  I'm used to having plenty to spread around and it's a bit of a turn-off to have to pay extra for it.  Overall, the place is nice.  The service is friendly.  The food comes fast.  But it seems they need to choose whether they want to be a \"street taco\" kind of place or a regular Mexican restaurant.  If you order a 3-taco set, plus the chips/salsa, plus the pico, plus a drink, you're going to be close to $15 for your meal served on plastic plates.  For that price I'd probably go to more of a sit-down restaurant with a full menu.  I'll give them another try when they have their \"taco Tuesday\" special where you can get them for $1 each.  And hopefully the sauce bottles will be available...."}
{"text":"Delicious. I try not to use that word lightly, but it definitely applies to the food in this place. The seasoning of the meat, the taste and texture of the beans and the rice, the kick of the salsas - everything is the way it should be. The staff is very friendly and the list of offerings is in plain sight, on a chalkboard menu above the counter area. Prices are great! The place is clean and has a very relaxed atmosphere (and the Food Network on the flatscreen at the bar during lunchtime ... very sneaky way of encouraging a big appetite). Nice bar area, and even an outdoor al fresco dining area where you have a view of the Phoenix Mountains. Lots of things to like about this place!"}
{"text":"For airport food, this was quite good!  I smelled the carne asada cooking on the grill when I came out of the jetway and knew this would be my dinner spot.     I had the carne asada tacos which came with beans and rice.   The meat was flavorful and tender and the tortillas were fresh.  The red and green salsas in squeeze bottles available near the utensils were actually quite good.  It was nice that they had little containers for the salsas for anyone who didn't want to unwrap their food and squirt the salsa directly on it.   The beans and rice were standard and fine.     Service was friendly but not super fast so be warned if you don't have a lot of time.   They were very busy and were cooking food as fast as they could.  At least it was clear everything was being made fresh!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times recently, and the food is always excellent. It all tastes really fresh and is seasoned really nicely. The prices are very reasonable as well, so this place easily ousted Los Favoritos or Chipotle as my default burrito joints."}
{"text":"Yes, I'm a fan; 3rd time at this location.  One thing draws me back; POSOLE!!!  I love Posole, and the street tacos are the perfect size to go with the posole.  Only drawback is that I prefer cabbage to lettuce for the posole.  Many people do like lettuce, but save that for the garnish...LOL...The beans are very good, along with the carne asada tacos; they are small, but, are like the ones I remembered in Rocky Point.  Yes, I will be back!!! Posole!!! enough said..."}
{"text":"I don't know how a place like this, that serves the quality of food that it does, and has the seating capacity of 5 is never crowded when I go in.  The tacos here are phenomski! There is no other way to put it, carne asada, cabesa (head), lengua (tounge)-my mouth is watering right now...  This place will give you the shitty-rickity cart flavor of a taco shack taco without the worry"}
{"text":"So my wife orders 2 \"Street tacos\" the menu says they come with cilantro, onion and salsa. So my wife says no cilantro. Well when she got her order the tacos only had onions, no cilantro which is correct but no salsa? So I go and ask the lady taking the orders why the tacos don't have salsa, and she says to me \"the salsa is on the counter over to the side, you can get it yourself \" I say what? But the menu says your street tacos come with 3 toppings and we only deducted 1 of them. Are they not supposed to give me the other 2 toppings? Cause otherwise why is it in the menu that it comes with salsa? Then she finally admits \"the cook was supposed to put the salsa in the kitchen before it was handed to you\" to what I just said Wow! Didn't you just tell me \"we are supposed to get our own?\". Needless to say I am not a big fan or lies and when it's a business providing a service to me it's the worst. Not coming back here or recommending this place to anyone.  #lies #poorservice #nerverreturn #-5stars"}
{"text":"Awesome food!  My boss introduce it to me and it is one of the best Mexican food places I have eaten at.   Definitely one of my go to places to get my Mexican food fix!"}
{"text":"I come here every Tuesday for taco Tuesday.  I love the cheap prices and the margaritas are pretty awesome too.  Carnitas tacos are my fave along with a side of chips and pico."}
{"text":"Excellent little Mexican restaurant!  Great food.  I loved the house Margarita!  Nice and clean, but other than that I wasn't particularly impressed by anything, hence the four stars.  You can tell this place is popular with locals (I'm from Chicago) because there was a big line at lunch time on Tuesday (granted it was \"Taco Tuesday\" with $1 tacos), but everyone was convinced it was worth the wait.  I don't like the pagan semi-devilish paintings on the wall of the skeleton couple.  I would be happy to see them disappear.  Algo más católico, por favor..."}
{"text":"I have been here multiple time! I can't go anymore! The service and food last time I went was just different! I was disrespected and the food came out half the size as normal. I don't eat much but it was for a little kid! If I'm hungry I will have to go to chipotle instead:(! It's a bummer because I work right down the street and I have been here 100 times!!!! Lot a great customer:(!"}
{"text":"Los Taquitos has quite the reputation. I finally made it there for dinner and ordered a carne asada burrito. It was bomb. Extra for cheese and rice in the burrito though. Srsly? Came back a few days later and ordered chilaquiles in the AM. Easily top 3 chilaquiles in the valley. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"We went here for two different meals... One for dinner and one for breakfast on our way out of Phoenix. The veggie bowl was so spicy. I really wanted to like it and I could tell it would have been delicious if not so spicy. The breakfast burrito with egg, potato and cheese was probably one of the best breakfast burritos I've had. My Husband got the supreme breakfast burrito and agreed it was the best burrito he's had!"}
{"text":"Guy Fieri seems to never let us down. We crave this place now, but being that it is a few hundreds miles away makes me want to take another trip to AZ. We came here on a slow night and didn't really get much since we ate a big lunch. Thank goodness we got the tacos because they are arguably the best tacos we have tasted. Carne Asada and Al Pastor tacos hit the spot! Crunchy, juicy and small enough to devour in a few minutes. By my description you can only imagine how much we dream about this place.  There isn't really more to say but to try this place. Food was top notch, service was friendly and the place isn't too pricey. My only regret was not ordering more tacos to take with us home."}
{"text":"I gotta say, I was honestly going to rate this place at three stars until I read Abe S's review and was reminded that Los Taquitos is definitely solid.  He's dead on - although there are better tacos in Phoenix (ie - the McDowell Taco Corridor!), Los Taquitos does a great job and has food that's just...well...good!  I always go with a carne asada taco and a tostada.  The tostada was awesome.  It was literally like six inches tall with lettuce, delicious meat, beans, and cheesy goodness.    The taco was good too, but as I mentioned, there are a few places out there that are tough to beat.  The shop is definitely nice, and it's in a really nice area too which is a rare plus for me.  Everyone was super friendly, and I would definitely go back should I be in the area."}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Their salsa was really great. Husband had their shrimp burrito that comes highly recommended but wasn't thrilled with it. The tacos were yummy though"}
{"text":"Really poor service. Was not impressed at all. Even for an airport restaurant this was a terrible experience. Also they only had one plastic fork and didn't have any limes for our coronas."}
{"text":"Stopped in with my wife for a late dinner.   Bean and cheese burrito was good, but the rest was just so-so and for some reason the servers were not very friendly.  Projecting negative energy creates a negative environment.  We had been there one other time and it was better service-wise, but not very impressive this time around.  If you like friendly personal service, I don't think this place will impress you.  Food is okay, but in my opinion not amazing.  We wont be going back anytime soon."}
{"text":"I went to this place again earlier this week only to find out that they are closed for remodel.  I'll be honest, I cried.  I think they re-open on the 25th.  I am counting down the days."}
{"text":"Delicious! We ordered a mix of pollo, carnitas, and fish tacos and a chicken torta. The food had great flavor and adequate portions. The blood orange margarita was amazingly refreshing! We will be coming back again!"}
{"text":"The other locations are always spot on, but the quality at the airport seems to go down each time I pass through.  This time was the service as well. 3 employees standing around talking with no other customers but me. After a couple of minutes, I finally asked if they were open just to get someone to pay attention."}
{"text":"The tacos are ok ugh I'm disappointed! The carne asada was dry and it was just ok! Moving to the area I was excited to try them but maybe next time! Few hours later, heart burn."}
{"text":"Absoulutely love this place! I get the trainer salad with chicken every time, and it's my favorite salad from anywhere. Their tacos, burritos, and breakfast items are all great, too (not to mention they have the best posole in Phoenix according to New Times). Everything is always fresh and quick, plus it doesn't break the bank like some overhyped street taco places I won't mention. It's as authentic as any little taco shop, but you're guaranteed good service in a clean, enjoyable atmosphere. Be sure to stop by for Taco Tuesday!"}
{"text":"best al pastor ive ever had....great food, cheap prices. friendly service and very clean. loved this place, we were in town for spring training and seem it on DD plus a co worker told me about it. we will def be back when in AZ."}
{"text":"Went there on Sunday @ 5:30 pm. And they were out of a few menu items, Disappointing, so we went back on Tuesday and I had a green chile bowl. Good flavor but the meat was very fatty. Daughter had a chile relleno plate & liked it. Great customer service & cold beer."}
{"text":"Go for Taco Tuesdays, great tacos. There menudo and pesole is very good. A must try!! Also if you like horchata, it taste fresh everytime"}
{"text":"Awesome place.  Small.  Great, inexpensive food.   You should go!"}
{"text":"It's a shame that a well designed Mexican restaurant automatically makes me think that the food isn't going to taste authentic.  Los Taquitos definitely proves that theory wrong.  Every time I'm craving really good pozole this is my go to place.  I found them on Yelp and I'm so glad I did.  The vibe is great - well lit, plenty of options for seating (even a patio).  The service is great too, I think the woman who runs the register and takes your order is the owner.  It's counter service, so don't expect a server.  The food is so good.  I've had the red pozole multiple times and loved it.  Also had their chorizo burrito and tacos.  All yummy.  Great little neighborhood spot and one of the best places to go for pozole in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Stopped here while in Phoenix for the day. Look the environment of the restaurant, really nice paintings throughout. There is limited setting during dinner hours. My partner and I got 3 tacos(asada, pastor, and carnitas) and a Torta de Asada to share. The tacos were good, the pastor lacked some flavor unfortunately. The Torta de Asada was okay, wasn't anything special. Overall was good, would come back for the tacos. :)"}
{"text":"The food is so delicious here. I had a carne asada burrito with a side of rice and beans and a pomegranate margarita. The meat was perfect so flavorful and not fatty or chewy. The ingredients were so fresh and the salsa was spicy and full of flavor. i cant wait to eat here again. \"Mexican food is life.\" Come eat here."}
{"text":"I love coming to Los Taquitos. It's a fun super casual atmosphere. My favorite taqueria style Mexican restaurant in the area. The food is awesome and the margs are strong."}
{"text":"Stop there on the way across the dessert, and it was worth the stop!  Tacos were off the chain, very good and seasoned just right.  I bought the pastor tacos and chicken tacos with a side of taquitos and they were all tasty!  Can't wait to go back and try the burritos!  Will keep you posted"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've been here. I wasn't a big fan of this place. I decided to give it another shot and boy was I pleased. The carne asada tacos still needs a few touches. The carne asada taco has great flavor but a bit on the fatty and tough side. Salsa had a little bit and tortilla was nice and tender. The carnitas taco on the other hand was perfect. Must come back with a bigger appetite.  Love everything about the new location. Decor is on point!"}
{"text":"Not very good. I ordered the daily special, 2 hard tacos with beans. The hard taco shells may have been Old El Paso, I'm not 100% sure but they sure tasted like cheap store-brand shells. Very little meat that was way over-cooked to the point that it lost it's identity. About 2 shreds of lettuce (seriously), 1tsp of cheese (which I swear was a supermarket blend like Mexican Cheese Blend), and 2-3 tomato pieces. Very unappetizing.  The beans has an odd taste of beef tallow. Not the good kind of fat like lard, but an off-putting taste that didn't compliment the beans runny consistency.  My friend ordered the street tacos which looked better. But they said they were nothing special. My other friend had a torta and wouldn't finish it.  Oh, and they lost our order, and other customers that were there as well. I had to remind them of our order and show them our receipt as they had no record of our purchase. Over 20 minutes to get our food.  On the plus side the decor was very mexi-hipster."}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good. I've had quite a few things off the menu and am yet to be disappointed.  It's definitely not the cheapest place to eat but the food is worth it.  I've only been here around lunch time and if you're there during the peak times for lunch, it gets really busy and it's hard to find a place to sit."}
{"text":"So happy to find this local establishment!  The husband and I were wanting something quick and filling after working on house renovations and after a desperate yelp search, I found Los Taquitos with numerous complimentary reviews.  When we arrived, we were underwhelmed by the boxy feel of the interior -- the restaurant is essentially a box with tables around the perimeter and down the middle -- but the place was clean and everything smelled great.  What we DID appreciate was our food.  Really nice flavors, very filling, and fresh.  My husband got a veggie burrito and it was huge.  I ordered the veggie bowl and really liked the hashbrown-style potatoes (and the beans...and rice... and veggies...and sauce...).  Prices are reasonable (about $14 for the two of us) and wait time was pretty short.  If you are ever in Ahwatukee and are craving some Mexican eats, check out Los Taquitos."}
{"text":"Good for quick airport food. We had the burrito. Nice size portions. Salsas were good."}
{"text":"Family run with great service and lunch time lines waiting to order, especially on Taco Tuesdays, this is my go-to place for chili rellanos or a few corn or flour street tacos. Inside there is a long, clean neighborhood bar where one can sit and watch sports on a large screen and feel right at home."}
{"text":"The chile rellano and taquitos were excellent in strip mall ambiance!"}
{"text":"I had their carnitas burrito and it was okay.  I'm not a fan of uncooked onions and should have read the menu better to see that they were in this burrito.  The carnitas was a bit dry but the beans and tortilla were good.  I'll probably try one more time if I'm in the area as the drink menu did look really good."}
{"text":"In the mood for quick and amazing Mexican food? Los Taquitos is the place to go! Weather it be for Street Tacos, a massive Burrito, or tamales, you can expect an awesome meal here.  Meg and I have come to Los Taquitos more times than I can count. The service is always quick and friendly. With their new renovations they now have a wide open and colorful dining area with plenty of tables for groups big and small.  Of the many things we've had, it's a tie between the Street Tacos and the Tamales plate as my favorite. The three street taco plate comes with all the fixings, your choice of taco meat (which can be different for each one), rice and beans. I recommend their Carne Asada which has the perfect flavor to it.  The tamale plate is the closest thing to my Nana's homemade tamales I've found here in the valley. The beef tamales were really fluffy with spicy red chili beef cooked in. The plate comes with two tamales which, like the tacos, can be a mix of their three flavors: Beef, Chicken, or Cheese.   I can go on and on about all the things we've had there because we keep coming back any time we get the chance. The food speaks for itself as some of the best in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Decided to come here after work for an early dinner with Dad.  I'd seen the Diners Drive Ins and Dives segment on their main location in Ahwatukee, read some of the Yelp reviews, and checked out their menu beforehand.  What I wanted was good Mexican food fast and cheap.  Mission accomplished.  Their newest location in central Phoenix is in what I believe used to be part of the space that Coffee Plantation occupied back in the day.  Its in a pretty hidden part of a crowded strip mall on the northwest corner of 16th St & Glendale.  Parking was a chore, but surprisingly the restaurant wasn't busy at all.  I had expected a pretty bare bones Mexican taco stand feel (similar to Tacos Atoyac) when I walked inside, but the place is surprisingly modern.  Much more like a Chipotle than a Tacos Atoyac.  We both got the Carne Asada Burrito meal.  I know their staples are the street tacos, but I was in the mood for something a little more hearty.  The burrito didn't disappoint and came with a side of beans and rice.  Plus two drinks, the total tab was just $18.  We were in and out in about 30 minutes, though its certainly comfortable enough if you want to hang around for awhile, and the outdoor patio is a nice touch.  Staff was friendly too.  Not sure the food was as good as Tacos Atoyac (just a few miles west of here), but then again Tacos Atoyac is way divyer than this place.  For the more affluent north central crowd, Los Taquitos fits in very well with the neighborhood.  Its affordable, comfortable, and fast.  Just be sure to pack your patience when looking for a parking spot around here."}
{"text":"Tasty food. Worth it to go on Tuesdays for $2 tacos. But place gets so crowded. Some things over priced. Girls that work there could work on a smile and good customer service. One restroom available. Located next to Safeway."}
{"text":"Had one not so good experience here, gave  it another try and ever since then it's been on point! Street tacos are excellent. I just wish they were open right now because I want a breakfast burrito"}
{"text":"Fast, efficient service. Food is tasty and reasonably priced. So glad we picked this place for dinner! Cheery and clean decor."}
{"text":"I almost never write reviews but I feel like this experience warrants one. it's 7 am on a Friday morning and no one I've come in contact with this morning at the airport has been particularly cheerful. I've barely gotten a smile out of anyone. this changed with Cortney at Los Taquitos.  she greeted me with a smile and thanked me for waiting.  good customer service goes a long way with me and this girl has it!plus the breakfast burrito was pretty tasty with big chunks of bacon. no skimping here!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy this place! My husband and I have been searching for a great Mexican place since we moved here (2 years ago) and this is it!  I've been 3 or 4 times and have taken out of town guests here as well.    I LOVE the tacos. They are incredible.  Prices are very reasonable.  My husband generally orders a burrito of some sort and the quesadillas are way bigger than my kids can eat.  I have two kids (1 and 3) and I'm glad I don't have to worry they are going to break anything (there's nothing to break..) - plus they do have high chairs!  We found it by looking at the Diners Drive-in's and Dives website. We have yet to be led astray by Guy Fieri!"}
{"text":"Waiting on a flight to Burbank with time to kill, so I decided to have a beer, chips, and guacamole.  All in all, absolutely no complaints.  Cashier was polite and smiled a lot, and the service was quick.  It's located in a great place for people watching.  The guacamole dip tasted fresh and flavorful and chips warm.  What else could you ask for?  The Samuel Adams, well you can never go wrong..."}
{"text":"Garbage. Absolutely tasteless, skimpy on portions, terrible food. Airline terminal food has come a long way...skip this place. Walk to the next terminal."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst customer service I have received. 40 minute wait to get 6 tacos apart from that after 40 minutes of waiting they didn't give us our drinks. We left without our drinks do to the fact that we were already running late."}
{"text":"The food is good, but too pricey for a hole in the wall restaurant. This isn't anything special that you wouldn't find at any other mexican place.   When I was there a man came and bought a $20 dozen tamales - FROZEN! Who in their right mind pays that much for frozen tamales?"}
{"text":"can we have a moment of silence for the carnitas street tacos?  let's pay our respect for the carne asada.   what is the secret ingredient in those beans?? i can't pin point it but those beans are something else.   we wanted to try it all, so naturally, it was the 3 item combo platter: 1 taco, 1 tamale, 1 enchilada.   the friendliest girl told us they were known for street tacos and we should have listened. everything on the plate was great but it was all about that taco.   i thought i knew delicious but it reached a whole 'notha level after eating here.   my recommendation: street taco combo plate w carne asada and DEFINITELY carnitas. then drizzle on some of that green salsa they have. welcome to bliss.  they are a tad inconsistent but it's still really good, some days are just off the charts goods."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I took three carnitas tacos to the face here at 9:30 am Pacific Time, all about five minutes after deplaning at the Phoenix Airport. Dare I say that these were the best tacos that I ever had in my life. Order the perfectly seasoned and shreddy Carnitas tacos, with the salsa verde, rice and beans. Absolutely delicious with authentic corn tortillas, and just needs that add of a side of chips, fresh guacamole and sour cream. Basically I sat in silence at a sticky table in the middle of the airport, eating these tacos and just letting my heart sing. Thank you Los Tacquitos. I will be back for more."}
{"text":"If anything, Los Taquitos gets points for being cheap airport food. I was able to get a breakfast burrito with bacon and French fries for around $7, which is an absolute steal.  Granted, it was kind of greasy and bland, but I can appreciate cheap eats."}
{"text":"Food is always delicious. However the girl who takes the orders is very rude n impatient. I brought my family in to try (they are from out of town) n she kept getting an attitude when they asked questions even.though there was nobody behind us. I know what I like so I just order over the phone n pick up. Rather than dealing with her attitude"}
{"text":"I ate at this place on a trip to Phoenix earlier this month.  It had great reviews and was within walking distance to my hotel.  Wow!  It was really good.  I had the tortilla chips with fresh salsa to start and the Green Chile smothered Pork Burrito meal.  The flavors were delicious and very different from the generic Mexican food we get here in Georgia.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Made out to Phoenix again last month and again, managed to hit up Los Taquitos on our last day there. This time I had a shredded beef chimichanga, and of the three I had while in town (also went to Valle Luna and Filibertos), it was the best. It was also the smallest but that isn't necessarily a bad thing since most Mexican food place have such huge portions. And at $6.99, it was a bargain. The young lady at the counter was friendly and helpful.   I have to get my fill of chimichangas when I am in Arizona because here in Texas, they tend to put all sorts of stuff in them and smother everything in queso and red sauce. i also have to get my fill of green sauce because what we have here isn't as good. What impressed me is that when I bought some green sauce to bring back, both the young lady who took my order plus the lady who was on the Triple D program took the time to make sure that what I bought would retain its freshness and how to properly freeze (then bring to a boil before cooling) it to store what might be left over after a week. I appreciate the extra effort given since they both knew that due to my location I can't be a regular customer."}
{"text":"I came in here with a group of friends the other night after competing in a 24 hour scavenger hunt.  We were all a bit dirty, sweaty, and tired.  But oh so hungry!  We found this place and yelp and expected it to be your traditional mom and pop type mexican cuisine store.  We obviously didn't want to go to any nice sit down place looking the way we did after running around town for 24 hours.  We got into the restaurant and realized how nice it was!  WHOOPS!  But we were also so tired and hungry that we just didn't care at that point.  The motif inside the restaurant is very hip, colorful, and inviting.  They had some sort of hispanic edm type music playing which was definitely a first to my ears! I ended up ordering the carne asada burrito (minus the beans inside the burrito) and a side a rice and beans.   Also with a horchata to drink,  First I must say the horchata is probably the best I've had in town!  If you're ever in the area, it is a MUST! I'm normally not a fan of beans, but I've been trying to increase my whole grains recently so I decided to just attempt to eat a small portion.  I ATE THEM ALL!  They were so good and savoury I just couldn't stop.  By the time I got to my burrito and rice I was almost full.  I took one bite of the burrito and was greeted with such amazing flavors of meat!  Top it off with their salsas and you've got one of the best carne asada burriots I've ever had!  I unfortunately had to put it down because I just couldn't eat anymore.  I ended up saving it until the next day, where it tasted just as good!  I cannot wait to come back and try their other menu items :)"}
{"text":"Double D's taking my order! I love this place, the taste doesn't matter anymore!"}
{"text":"Best AUTHENTIC Mexican food ever!! Very inexpensive. The sisters that work there are really friendly and make you feel like you are coming into there home. Every time I go there I leave with a smile on my face. It really doesn't get any better then this place. Cannot save enough good things about this place. It is a MUST stop to visit."}
{"text":"Wow! The food was fabulous and the restaurant was clean and well decorated. Overall, great ambiance. ( we loved the music and art) This is no dive spot.  It's the real deal at a great price.  We will definitely be going back and taking out of town guests for some authentic Mexican food, Phoenix style."}
{"text":"Saw this place on DDD and knew that when we moved to the area we would have to try it.  Fresh food, quality ingredients and prepared perfectly.   Carnitas street tacos are to die for. Their hot sauce is great.   Service is fast, but don't always expect to get a table. It's been very busy each time we've come."}
{"text":"Husband loved his asada burrito.  Lots of tender meat and perfect spice.  One of his new favorite places for burrito.  Cant go wrong with the street tacos or corn chips and guacamole either.  Go on 1.00$ taco Tuesday and get a great value.  We don't just handout five stars to every place we eat.  This place is good!"}
{"text":"It was packed, the line was quick and anna was are cashier and she was great very helpful we just moved from houston so we are use to Tex Mex...everything was fresh i had the streer tacos they were amazing kinda reminded me of cali mex but better..."}
{"text":"This is a great little neighborhood spot to grab a quick and delicious Mexican bite to eat. Order at the counter and they'll call your number when your food is up. I went for the street tacos...al pastor and chicken. The tacos al pastor were terrific, with a rich, spicy sauce on the tender pork. The chicken also had a spicy marinade; both were double wrapped in perfect little corn tortillas. The salsa bar has 2 types of yummy home made salsa...red and green...as well as some pickled veggies and fresh lime with which to flavor your food. I got 3 tacos, rice and beans and a fountain drink for under $10. Nice."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere!!! The street tacos & tortas are to die for!! We've been back 3 times"}
{"text":"This place is really good. It is nice and clean and has very friendly service. I usually get the street tacos which I really enjoy. I love their homemade green chili sauce. They also offer beer and margaritas. This is the only place I go to get tacos in the Awatukee area."}
{"text":"I don't really see the appeal and the 4-5 star rating, but it was decent food, pretty fresh, but it was a little more expensive than I thought, maybe I ordered the wrong stuff. I will definitely give it a second try and go from there. Definitely has that 'hole in the wall' feel."}
{"text":"Shrimp nachos are the best, refried beans and rice are to die for they don't put any pork in there beans which is a plus. Have been to this place at least 2 times a week. Friendly staff and strong margaritas. This is my go to place. Reasonably priced and large portions"}
{"text":"One of my favorites for Mexican food!   When I moved here from California is was so hard to find a good Mexican place. But when I first came across the Ahwatukee location I knew I would be a returning customer. All the signs were there. The carne asada, pollo and al pastor tacos rocked my world. I also loved their beans and rice and I used to go on my lunch break or after lunch to grab a margarita during happy hour as well! Those are strong and so the job!  I'm a fan!   When I found this location which is much closer to my house , I brought my fiancé and he is now almost a weekly regular!  I'm so impressed with the consistency of the locations . The food is just as amazing in Phoenix. The people that work at both these locations are always friendly.  I've now ventured out to try burritos and , pozole as well as enchiladas! All great! The pozole is one of my faves!!"}
{"text":"Heard good things about Los Taquitos so my wife and I decided to give it a shot. The atmosphere was great (we were here on a weekday for lunch and the place was packed) - very good energy.   I had four tacos with a side of beans and rice. I had a variety of tacos but the beef was by far my favorite - i would do all beef tacos the next time.   My wife had the chicken enchiladas and enjoyed that as well.   If you're looking for a place to dine and have a margarita or two - this place would be a good spot (they have a nice bar setup) with a good tequila list. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"We just recently moved into the area and immediately began scoping out the local eateries.  I love Mexican food and after a quick yelp/google search this place caught my attention.  I wasn't disappointed.  I brought my kids (ages 2-8) with me and we were all happy.  To make matters better, it was Saturday and happened to be happy hour ($1 street tacos).  The street tacos were delicious (and I sampled some of the kids food from the kids menu, the flour tortillas are amazing).  I went again for lunch by myself the other day.  You get the picture.  It was great.  Will definitely be a regular spot for me."}
{"text":"My family and I have been coming here since they opened. We love it but the recent changes have been disappointing. First, they don't have sopes anymore, my daughter's favorite. Second, they no longer play salsa and meringue music. We still come but disappointed. :("}
{"text":"Tac O the Town   This place is full of surprises. During the early lunch hours of the day, I was excited to find that there was the taco shop near me. Upon opening the doors I was welcomed with renovated and modern restaurant.   I ordered four tacos (asada, pastor, carnitas, pollo). Their tacos are typical street style tacos, served with two tortillas, meat, cilantro, onions, and salsa. Their tortillas are freshly made every day. Their flour tortillas are warm and crispy on the outside with buttery goodness on the inside (the corn tortillas are served with the tacos while the flour tortillas are served the burritos). Every single taco there was spectacular. The strongest tacos were the asada and the pastor. When I come back I will be trying the lengua."}
{"text":"With all these great reviews we expected a lot more from this place. The line was long which was another good sign. Prices were good too. We're on a roll here! Then we saw the soda machine. It was dirty and looked to be backed up. Cloudy water filled up the bottom tray and was pouring out the side onto the floor where we had to stand in line. The caution sign was a nice touch.  We ordered the Carne asada burritos which is our barometer for checking out new Mexican restaurants. It came with a side of rice and beans. The food was bland and mediocre at best. The burrito supposedly had Pico inside but I think they forgot to add it or only put a tiny bit. The tortilla was powdery and tore as soon as I took it out of the foil. It's never good when a burrito had to be eaten with fork and knife. Lastly, the Carne asada was not appetizing at all. It tasted burnt and was full of gristle. We'll stick with the Original Burrito Co across the road. Their food has always been excellent!"}
{"text":"This place is legit!  It's solid Mexican fare at reasonable prices and made quickly.  Tuesdays are taco tuesdays apparently so the carnita, pollo asada and pastor tacos are only a dollar a piece.  They were all solid, but my favorite was probably the steak - not a special but reasonably priced and probably the best I've ever had.  We also had the red chile burrito which was very meaty.  It was very good, but a bit too much after a while.    I definitely want to try the bombito one day and the street tacos were awesome.  Parking is kind of hard in that complex, they seem a bit territorial with the spaces along the stores..  The bathrooms were much nicer than I thought they would be so don't avoid going in there like I was doing at first!  :P"}
{"text":"I think I've gained about ten pounds since discovering these street tacos. They are to die for. Customer service is good, it can get a little busy (especially on Taco Tuesday) but they always seem to remember me and make conversation. Will continue to come here until I can find a street taco that's half as good in Chandler."}
{"text":"A good friend of mine brought me here yesterday after raving about the amazing street tacos and salsa. I'm always down for good Mexican food so we hopped in the Mom-mobile and were on our way!   I ordered the Friday special which was 2 hand tacos with choice of rice or beans. You could choose chicken or beef and I asked for one of each and asked for a side of beans as well as I wanted to get the full flavor. My friend had the street tacos pastor, asado, and carnitas style.We also shared chips and salsa with guacamole.  I ended up getting 2 beef tacos and no beans. I didn't want to make a stink about it because I didn't pick the restaurant but when I asked at the counter about the beans, they said they would bring them out and never did. Luckily my baby had beans with his cheese quesadilla so I did get to try them but meh..they were just ok. The spanish rice was under-seasoned and all I could taste was salty chicken broth. The guacamole was pretty tasty though the avocado was overpowered by the salsa that was mixed in to it. The salsa was very tasty. And I was kind of surprised that the chips and the hard shells on the tacos weren't house made or if they were...they've got it down to such a science that they seem store bought.   My friend enjoyed his street tacos but he agreed about the rice being under-seasoned and over-brothed.   The staff at the counter were nice, but they were firmly planted there. No one came by the tables to check on people and even though we chose to sit outside, they didn't move from their spot to let us know our food was ready.   I'll go back to try again if we are in the area because my friend really likes it there and I want to try to get what he's seeing but I can't say I'd go out of my way to go back without him."}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely love this place.  It is just across the street from where we live, so it's very convenient for us.  We love the food.  I definitely recommend trying the Carnitas Burrito chimi style and my husband absolutely loves the Chicken  Burritos az style.  Don't forget the green salsa.  It's amazing.  For the price that your paying, they give you a pretty big portion.  I usually don't get any sides, because the burrito is more than enough to keep me satiated.  They also serve margaritas and cervesas.  It's a nice place to sit down and relax while eating and since it's not in a busy location, there's never a line and always plenty of places to sit.  Don't take that the wrong way.  I wish more people knew about this place.  It's 100x better than Filibertos and more affordable than Chipotle.  Heck, even Guy Fieri dishes out only good things to say about this place.  Check it out."}
{"text":"Items Ordered: (2) Carne Asada Taco Plates w/ Rice & Bowl of Pozole + Sodas    Total Bill:  $26.05  Satisfaction Level: It was better than okay.  Quick Tips:   - Pozole is served Sat/Sun.  We have a lot of favorite tacos places so its really hard to put this up near the top after one visit but this spot did have pozole since it was a Saturday and that's definitely a plus.  The broth could have had a little more spice but the meat was amazing and in large chunks.  Definitely recommend.  The carne asada tacos were good as well.  The meat was tender and still juicy.  Many people mentioned they are small but they are street tacos.  That's how they are suppose to be.  Rice wasn't anything to write home about but the sauces were good.  Overall the food was great, just didn't notice anything that set it apart."}
{"text":"The green chili pork bowl is a MUST try! Go early, as the line can get long after 5:30/6pm."}
{"text":"Since moving nearby two months ago, this has become my go-to grub spot. I've yet to order something I haven't loved and despite eating here several times a week- I don't get tired of it. The place is always clean and or being cleaned, the prices are great, the food is awesome and there is barely any wait to get your food. Its a great place to stop for a snack or a meal anytime. Plus they have amazing breakfast burritos and quesadilla's that are served 24 hours.  Since becoming a patron, I have enjoyed the following items the most: bombero chicken burrito, chicken taco's, pastor burrito, pastor torta, chicken nachos, chilaquiles with red sauce, breakfast quesadilla and burrito with chorizo and green chile pork burrito. They have great red and green salsa in bottles so you are free to use as much or little as you need. They serve alcohol as well, if you prefer your tacos with  beer or wine. Overall, it's a great place with good food that you should definitely check out."}
{"text":"Ok Second time been here and both time I have gotten good service and good food! The street tacos are great along with the quesadillas (only things I have tried so far). The salsa has a roasted pepper flavor but overall good and not too spicy! Definitely coming back for more when I crave Mexican food!"}
{"text":"Los Taquitos is a counter service Mexican restaurant in the Phoenix airport that should be avoided at all costs. I can confidently say that Los Taquitos has been my worst experience eating out in the 365 days, which has a sample size greater than 300.    The one redeeming quality is that the folks working behind the counter were really pleasant.   The food tasted awful. If you get tricked into paying for food, do not eat it. The guacamole had slimy brown spots, the rice was dry, and the bean tacos/burritos or whatever were nothing more than refried beans loaded into tortillas. I tossed the meal after a few bites.  The food took a long time to come out. I almost thought they were making it all from scratch. Nope. If you have that much time, try eating elsewhere; the airport has many options. Heck, there's better restaurants right there in terminal C.   Los Taquitos is not worth it. Save yourself the time and money."}
{"text":"Freshly made and delicious. Also, a good price!"}
{"text":"The lemonade tasted musty so I switched to the tea which was also wonky. My husband said the bowl he ordered was flavorless. My tacos were okay but not great. This is the second time we've been here and not enjoyed it. I'm not sure what we are missing that everyone else likes."}
{"text":"Horrible! It is 30 minutes and we are still waiting for our order. Its not just us, there is a whole bunch of people waiting. They are understaffed and very confused! All we ordered was a burrito bowl but somehow its taking more than 30 minutes."}
{"text":"Let me say that I love their street tacos. The seating here was very limited, and people was always a line waiting to get their food. They were very good about getting people in and out fast to clear out the tables. The good news is they just re-opened after expanding, so there is twice as much seating. It also looks a lot less than a hole in the wall (which is one part that I liked before btw). Now there is still a long line. I don't know if it's because they have a lot more customers than they are used to serving, but we waited today for 40 minutes to get our tacos, and then we just ran out of time and had to get back to work. We asked for our money back and left hungry. No taco is worth waiting 40 minutes for, so I'm still giving this place 3 stars for old time sake. I'll give it another shot once a little more time passes and maybe they get used to serving more people. I will update this review if wait times improve"}
{"text":"For metropolitan Phoenix this is a great joint.  I had the asada burrito bowl which was quite filling.   Lots of people ordered burritos and tacos.  Also they have $1 Taco Tuesday's all day.   Come early this place was packed at 11:30am."}
{"text":"These were some of the best tacos I've had in the states, far better than any hole in the wall taqueria tacos I've ever had in fact.  I don't know if BYOB is acceptable in the area in general, but we went next door to Safeway and grabbed a bottle of (kinda gross cheap) white wine and BYOBed, they gave us a cup to pour it in.  The girl that was working was amazingly friendly and helpful.  They have two or three small tables outside even."}
{"text":"I was very impressed! Everything was great! Everything was gluten free except the flour tortillas (obviously). The red salsa was hot and didn't have any veggies in it. The staff was very helpful and polite! I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"I met my cousin here for lunch, and we were really happy with the meal.  The place is a less than impressive on the interior, dingy booths, long and narrow.  It's terribly crowded up by the counter, not a lot of room to order and pick up your food.  I do question how a place can call itself \"Los Taquitos\" and then not have taquitos on the menu, but I went for the flautas instead.  They were good, but what set the meal apart were the beans.  The most flavorful beans I have ever had.  If you told me these were magical beans, I would have believed it, but I wouldn't have stopped eating them to plant one and see.  Service was quick and friendly and there was plenty of seating, even during the lunch rush.  Looked like a lot of people get orders to go.  I'd like to go back and try a few other items on their menu, if they come with beans of course."}
{"text":"Rude ass bitches, it's not my fault that you can't ring up a simple order and YOU had to redo it multiple times. Don't give me attitude when I double check you rang me up for the right thing since you were having so many problems with my simple order of street tacos and a water bottle. Then when I check my receipt I notice it says the wrong thing so I double check with another worker if that's the correct order and she goes \"that's what it says sweetie\". Beyond annoyed with their service."}
{"text":"Pretty good, but not the best. I compare all Street taco places to a lunch truck in Vegas behind the Walmart on Boulder Highway. That lunch truck had the best tasting tacos EVER! This place was kind of dry and not a great selection of salsa. Typical Mexican fare , little pricey for average quality, but I'd rather go to Polibertos on Baseline and hardy in Tempe. The biggest disappointment was the music selection. IT WAS TERRIBLE AND NOT FAMILY FRIENDLY MUSIC. I was annoyed because I was there with my wife, 11yr and 3yr old daughters, and the music was TOO promiscuous for my taste. Better suited for clubbers. Not family friendly environment when music is blaring about sexual content. AND YOU HAVE TO PAY FOR TORTILLA CHIPS AND SALSA. POLIBERTOS IS FREE SALSA AND TORTILLA CHIPS. MANY OTHER PLACES THAT ARE BETTER, NOT WORTH THE EXTRA DRIVE."}
{"text":"After four years of living in AZ I finally found Mexican food that appeals to me and my husband. Lets just say they changed my husbands view on tacos. He never swayed from eating vegetarian burritos until he got a hold of their carne asada tacos. In the last 4 months we lived in AZ we went there almost every week and brought friends, whom now can't get enough of them too. They are reasonably priced, have great customer service and everything we have eaten so far has been fabulous. If you are looking for great food and you're not concerned with being in a fine dining Mexican restaurant, then look no further.  We miss you Los Taquitos....."}
{"text":"Excellent food at a very reasonable price. I like it spicy but the kids do not and everything here has some kick! I love the tacos here so that's what I usually order. They do not have ground beef tacos at all and that's a shame because that's what kids like so I'm forced to go to other places when I'm not alone or with my wife only. Great margaritas and nice cold beer & wine. Also great for take out."}
{"text":"The food Is the delicious! And the atmosphere is awesome but the overall experience would be a lot better if the girl taking your order was actually nice."}
{"text":"Saw this restaurant's other location on triple d so i had to try it when i went to phoenix.  I was very impressed. I sample a lot of mexican food in so cal and this is excellent.  Loved the bombero burrito with asada and the carnitas as well.  I highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"This restaurant was not my favorite.  We visited this restaurant when we traveled to Arizona this summer for a family reunion.  After seeing it on the Food Network my expectations were a little high.  First of all, the camera angles made me think the restaurant was big when it was about the size of a Subway restaurant.  We almost had to leave because there were no seats available.  There were about 8 of us and we did not want to have to take our food to go.  Fortunately, two tables ended up leaving and we were able to sit down.    I got the three taco meal. I guess I should have realized that \"hot sauce\" meant hot but I was just thinking \"oh it'll be a little spicy\" NO! I took maybe two bites and couldn't finish.  I had to trade food with my niece, I ate her quesadillas which were pretty good and she didn't seem to be phased by the hot tacos.  I definitely was not satisfied when I left, I basically ate off of everyone else's plates.  If I ever return to Phoenix, I probably won't be back here.  There are several restaurants in Atlanta that are Food Network worthy, in my opinion this was not.  The customer service was very good, the ladies were very nice and excited that we mentioned the food network."}
{"text":"The tacos, burritos and bowls were great. The rice and beans were not as impressive. I thought the prickly pear margarita was a bit sweet, but my wife loved it. It is just a syrup added to the house marg. Next time I'll get the house marg."}
{"text":"This meal was quite disappointing. First, the guacamole tasted like store bought, not good. Secondly, the burrito and tacos were just ok. We got the green Chile pork and it was too salty for our taste. The beans and rice were bland and certainly nothing special at all. Oh well."}
{"text":"amazing food just be prepared for a wait on taco Tuesday as the secret is out on this place. Well worth it though!!"}
{"text":"Best customer service, clean restaurant, and great food! We came in for our first time and somehow our order did not make it to the kitchen. As I went up to wait, they realized I was standing there a while and asked what number I was waiting for. Once they realized the kitchen never got the order, we were given a full refund and the our plates of food. That wait time was as long as it took me to write this review. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Just had my first meal at Los Taquitos.  Good stuff.    More on that later but first let me rant about how insulted I am to see \"safe\" Mexican restaurants springing up that cater to squeamish diners.  For example, Mucho Macho Taco, Urban Taco, Phx Burrito House and Gadzooks, these restaurants don't serve Mexican food.  They serve canned Mexican themed food for people who are scared to go authentic.  Now that my gripe is out of the way, let me say first that Los Taquitos IS authentic.  It was my first visit so I tried all the staples that measure a Mexican restaurants authenticity - beans, rice, red chile sauce, lengua (beef tongue) and menudo.  Yes, I ate all of that PLUS a fish taco and all of it was good.  There's a bar with a decent selection of Mexican beers, and lots of different kinds of margaritas.  I saw some liquor bottles but didn't focus long enough to say whether they have a decent selection of tequila or not.  Finally, the other things I liked about Los Taquitos was the decor, clean bathrooms and, you'd think this would be more common, decent music.   All of that adds to an enjoyable experience, and a return visit by me."}
{"text":"We go take out from here during a spring break visit. Love that they had a good veggie burrito -- not just a burrito without the meat, but a legitimate burrito for a vegetarian. Fish tacos were good and worth negotiating over the last one in the box."}
{"text":"My wife and I have driven past this place on countless occasions thinking it was just your typical 'hole-in-the-wall' Mexican restaurant. It's not!!! The food is incredible, especially the tacos al pastor! I lived in Mexico City for two years and have struggled to find good Mexican tacos here in Phoenix. Although the al pastor tacos don't have the slice of pineapple on top like they do in DF, they definitely have everything else. Even the tortillas tasted amazing! My wife got the smothered burrito which was also great.   The atmosphere is nice albeit it was rather crowded when we went on a Friday night. The restaurant is clean, the service fast, and the food inexpensive. We're definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"They did not take my order down correctly. I ordered a burrito and requested all bean vs rice as a side.  They did not specify this on the ticket. When I got a plate full of rice I expressed that I did not want the rice and requested all bean.  Instead of placing the burrito on a new plate that had all being they just didn't even give me my side f***** my burrito in a bag. They're extremely slow so if you're in a hurry trying to get to your next flight I do not recommend this establishment not to mention they can't even get your order correct."}
{"text":"good street style tacos.  combinations work with low prices.  my new neighborhood (new to me) take-out eatery.  weekend nights real busy."}
{"text":"I came here today for lunch, very clean spot, Rosie (cashier) was very helpful. I decided to try the carnitas torta...and I really liked it :) I will come here again!!"}
{"text":"Not very good. A coworker recommended this place because we had some time to kill before our flight. Nothing horribly bad but the carne asada AZ burrito had almost no meat in it. Truly you would find more meat in a Taco Bell hard shell  taco. Salsa's are good and the guacamole was very good. Chips were like you would get out of a bag at 7/11."}
{"text":"I really love when I go to a restaurant and I am able to get a unique flavor that I can't find anywhere else. This love of mine gets harder and harder as I try more Mexican restaurants here in Phoenix. Los Taquitos reassures me that these places still exist though, and they do it with the Bombero. The Bombero's sauce is an enchilada-style kind of sauce with the twist of ketchup tang. It threw me off a little at first because I didn't know exactly what to expect, but as I munched on each bite, and the spiciness of the sauce began to take over, I knew that my taste buds had made a new friend. The al pastor and the chips were also very tasty, but I don't think many people will be blown away with those items like I was with the Bombero.   I also want to add that the staff was extremely friendly during my visit. The cashier walked me through what I should try (recommending the Bombero if I was a fan of heat) and she didn't once seem impatient. That's always a huge plus to me.   I'll definitely be back soon! I already find myself craving that Bombero sauce. You should definitely check Los Taquitos out if you're in the neighborhood. It's solid Mexican food at decent prices. If they add a happy hour, this will definitely be a busy spot! Next up for me, the original location!"}
{"text":"Really aesthetically appealing place near the freeway by my house though the parking is usually super packed since it shares with a few other places nearby. On my most recent visit I grabbed some carne asada and lengua tacos which were really good. I tried both green and red sauces and they didn't wow me in any way but they still provided the extra kick if you like your tacos spicier. I saw that they had some taco tuesday deals and drink specials so I'll definitely be back to take advantage of that."}
{"text":"Should've checked Yelp! Don't eat here  On my way out of town, thought I'd grab a burrito before my flight. The burrito from Los Taquitos was by far the saddest burrito I've ever eaten. For reference i don't eat fast food, but even a burrito from any fast food joint is better than this one.  Pros: the burrito was warm. The salsa was ok (not great, not bad).  Cons: the burrito was very floppy, poorly rolled and it barely contained anything inside the tortilla. Adding to the disappointment, the burrito was served with potatoes on the side. If the potatoes had been inside the burrito, maybe it'd get a 2 star review.  All in all avoid at all costs. This was NOT authentic Mexican food. I'm Mexican, and i would not recommend this place."}
{"text":"Waiting for my flight and was hoping for some decent tacos but no such luck. I ordered the pollo street tacos. I know street tacos are supposed to be small but these were especially tiny.  The tortilla wasn't very fresh. The tacos themselves were lacking of any real ingredients or fresh chicken. Essentially I got what I paid for which was airport food. Over priced, low on flavor and quantity. Wouldn't do it again."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The food is authentic and delicious. I especially crave it when I'm pregnant and guess what? I'm pregnant again and I want me some taquitos (street tacos). You just have to believe me when I say you have to try this place!"}
{"text":"The two of us came here for lunch yesterday and found this taquitos place serving up some really delicious food. Now how did Mr Flavortown find it first?  As disappointing as our trip to The Dump was, coming here was a major plus.   While I was sitting in one of the chairs searching Yelp for lunch, I found my bookmark of Los Taquitos. Thank you, Lord. I promise to stay out of places like TD. Promise.   I vaguely remember an episode on DDD where Mr Flavortown recommended this place. What I do remember was Guy Fieri visiting a Mexican taquitos place that had five sisters making some great food from a family recipe.  I hadn't put it together until I was standing inline next to the spray painted \"Guy Ate Here\" smiling face (photo).  Here's a challenge. I dare anyone to find a place like Los Taquitos serving up as delicious food for the prices that you can find here. My Street a Tacos (see photo of their el pastor, el pollo and carne asada) were only $1.29 each and were outstanding with just the right amount of heat. And, my friend's el pollo burrito meal for only $6.99, which included rice and beans, was equally delicious.   So we enjoyed this trip to Flavortown and yes, Los Taquitos is a Four Star Bomb. Now do you think they'll miss a couple of squirt bottles of their red and green sauce?  Yes, Lord I'll put them back. Ugh.   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"With just a bit better management, this place could be pretty good. I liked the flavoring, freshness and non-greasy quality.  The experience could be excellent if the preparer didn't show her butt crack, she prepared the items individually rather than in batches and if she didn't skimp on quantity of burrito ingredients.  I fly through here weekly so I'll get more chances to try it out."}
{"text":"Not what they used to be before the expansion. We crazed this place when it was a hole in the wall with top notch food. Cheap meat and great decor loses stars.   The service was good and I'm happy that was there. I  the new location is what they used to be."}
{"text":"The pastor tacos pack an amazing punch of flavor and the beans are delicious!   Docked a star because I felt the wait time was a little too long for street tacos..."}
{"text":"Nice casual vibe and great food at this popular Ahwatukee hot spot. Love the friendly service and affordable prices. Their breakfast burritos rule!"}
{"text":"This is always a lunch option for me whenever I'm in Chandler. They are very consistent and I can count on getting some quality tacos when I'm there."}
{"text":"Airport food, grease bomby quesadillas?  Let's do it.  We were on the way to San Diego after running the Phoenix Turkey Trot.  The Carnitas and Pollo Asada Quesadillas were the perfect answer to our stomachs this day.  Perhaps an answer that was too much.  But oh well it was a fun weekend start."}
{"text":"Ok so just eat the green chili pork burrito and it was amazing!  Also took a bite of my wife's asada burrito and equally as great!  My son had beef enchilada and it was good but not as good as the pork or asada.  Regardless great little joint very upbeat and would highly recommend."}
{"text":"Seriously love this place! We decided to stop in here for a quick bite and were very impressed. I ordered street tacos, two carne asada and one carnitas. They were seriously AMAZING. They provide two different types of salsa, red and green. Both amazing, however I enjoyed the red a wee bit more. The horchata is also very tasty and the kids meals are loaded with food. Great place to check out with cool décor."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to try a new place tonight for dinner,  and with all the great reviews here we decided this sounded good.  The place is fast food setup, but it not very fast. When we arrived the place was not busy at 6:30 dinner time.  The girl at the register was very new. She didn't know what some of the menu items were even. My wife ordered 3 chicken tacos,  and she got 3 shrimp tacos instead.  I tried the Carna Asada Taco combo, and a bowl of Passole. That was $23 with one Ice Tea. Not on the cheap side,  that's for sure.    Well after waiting about 15 minutes for our food, and the order being wrong,  my wife was not happy.  I have to say that the food was very simple,  and very traditional Mexican recipes, I found the Carna Asada tacos to be dry and lacking in flavor. The Passole was just homany, and pork in a thin red broth.  That's how the peasants make it.  The refried beans where not over mashed,  like most places make them,   but they put to much water in them to make them cheaper.  The Spanish rice was again very simple,  but good.   IMHO For the money there are lots of better places."}
{"text":"Yum & I want more!! Didn't know that Guy Ferrari had did a piece on them. Glad that I didn't see the episode. Lunch time crowd-get there early. Ordered the Sopes w/carne asada served w/rice & beans. Very tasty. The sopes were yummy & carne asada flavorful. Chips & guacamole was ok-chips could have used a bit of salt."}
{"text":"The veggie street tacos were smothered in refried beans that were more lard than bean and the veggies were so overcooked they would not stay in one piece so I could not pick them up with a fork. Someone in line even asked me what I ordered so she could be sure not to order it. It was really gross. It was not a street taco."}
{"text":"Went for lunch today.... CROWDED. Next time I will call ahead. However, the best part was the fish tacos & the ceviche. I will be back."}
{"text":"This place was amazing, and it HIT THE SPOT! My husband and I stopped there while we were traveling back to Tucson and it was delicious. The food tasted amazing and they served a good amount. My husband loved his dish and so did I. My baby girl also loved the beans and rice and ate it all."}
{"text":"I just love this place. It's my secret place. Their tacos are superb! You also can't beat Taco Tuesday's. They don't compromise on quality. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Back for the second night in a row. Best tacos I've had in a very long time. Very friendly service and excellent margaritas. All priced right!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican food ever. Please open one in Scottsdale... I will eat there at least once a week."}
{"text":"I took my burrito to the counter and told the cashier the potatoes weren't cooked (completely raw) and because I taken a couple of bites I wasn't offered a new \"cooked\" burrito she took it and dumped it in the trash. I can take this place off my list of food network inspired places to visit."}
{"text":"You can't beat the carne asada tacos or the bombero burritos!  Al pastor is the way to go for a different, yet authentic taste of Mexico.  The family-owned vibe is very present and it makes the experience even that much more intimate."}
{"text":"This may be in an airport, but their service has no right to be anywhere. Where is the zero stars? The workers are so slow and they are consistently arguing in front of everyone. When an order is ready for pickup,  they slide the tray over after slamming it on the counter in disgust to actually have to do some work. No wonder one of the trays fell on the floor. Instead of correcting it, they argued and didn't want to clean it up. The whole time I was watching this circus act, I glanced next door to the sandwich place that I should have went to. Too bad I was craving a chicken burrito with almost no chicken. It was more like a refried bean and cheese burrito. All I tasted was tortilla with their watery tasting beans. Absolutely one of the worst places I have ever eaten at, even for airport food standards. I never will come back here. I rather starve on the airplane and pay the ridiculous snack prices onboard. Stay away at all costs! I haven't even ate next door, but I'll recommend that place over this one. (Terminal 4 Gate C, next to gates C1-C9)"}
{"text":"only thing i have to say it about this spot it DAMMMMMM!!!!!! it made me slap the hell out my mama....SMH it taste nice in and fresh this is the spot after a few bottles of remy&pineapple ciroc...."}
{"text":"My family just recently moved over to this side of town. We were looking for a quick bite to eat and found this place. The atmosphere is pleasant and cozy. The menu is simple, which is nice when you are in a crunch.  We each ordered something different and all really enjoyed it. In fact, my husband has been back twice this week.  The fish tacos are awesome, as are the chicken burritos. I can't get enough of the hot sauce either. You aren't going to find a better meal for a quick buck around here."}
{"text":"Pozole is so good and that dish alone is worth the visit! Pollo asado and carne asada bowls are amazing, street tacos are as well. So many good things here and so glad they are now within blocks of my home. Both the Ahwatukee and Chandler locations are great and staff is always very friendly.   House margaritas are great with sugar or salt !"}
{"text":"The food is decent, the women up front tend to be rude , and complain right to you. Kinda unprofessional,  but i am a repeat customer because of the breakfast burritos."}
{"text":"Stop over in the Phoenix international airport and ate at this establishment for a burrito for the fight home.  Ordered the carnitas burrito and I expected shredded pork. But it seems minute refried beans and specks of pork were all I could find.  It was like playing where's waldo with my food.  If you eat here just order the bean burrito and save yourself some money. The only redeeming factor was the service was pleasant and quick. Just skimpy on the meat for the burrito I received.  My family got tacos those seemed better."}
{"text":"Real authentic flavor.  I had the street tacos. Carne asada was my favorite, followed by carnitas. Skip the bland rice. Don't forget the unlimited marinated spicy carrots as a side!"}
{"text":"Came here after Rico's up the street tried to poison me.   Had the breakfast quesadilla. Friggin AWESOME!   great food, good music, and great service."}
{"text":"I ordered one of their bowls and it was really good.  The only reason they don't get 5 stars is because they did not have wine."}
{"text":"First time here.  Was excited because it's less than 1 mile from my house but not at the top of my favorite Mexican restaurants.  I ordered the shrimp burrito because the only fish they offer is tilapia.  Beware, it's spicy!  I don't mind spicy but for those of you who do...  Wasn't crazy about the dressing they used for the burrito.  Rice was nothing special, especially since I found a piece of paper in it.  Retried beans were good.  The place wasn't packed and I thought the wait was longer than normal."}
{"text":"The fish tacos are fabulous as are the beans. This place is authentic, fresh and yummy food, and fast. My husband had the beef burrito and was very impressed. My son had a Horchata and it was so good. I had never tried that drink. We will definitely come back next time we are in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Good little hole in the wall.  The tacos were very good.  I was surprised how spicy they actually were.  Also for as busy as they were at lunch, they got the food out to you pretty quick."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesdays used to cost us $20 at Los Taquitos (family of four). They were doing such good business, they got a little full of themselves. It cost us $37 tonight. The food is good, but not worth that! Last time there!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots! Inexpensive but authentic mexican food. The bombero burrito is worth the drive. One of the spiciest mexican dishes ive had, but not overwhelming spicy. When visitors come to town and want authentic mexican food, we take them to Los Toquitos. Our visitors have all requested to go back anytime they come in town. I highly recommend checking this place out."}
{"text":"Staff and management is incompetent.  Ran out of vegetables. During my visit, multiple people requesting refunds.  Asked for just a bean and cheese burrito.  Bean and cheese burrito is advertised on the menu as just bean and cheese.  Of course, they decided to add additional ingredients, such as rice, etc, even upon verification that the \"just bean and cheese\" was bean and cheese.  Extremely long wait.  Servers and short order cook staff are more concerned with arguing with each other instead of completing customer orders.  Might be a good idea to just call it a wrap and close the business.  Just saying."}
{"text":"Food is okay when they get your order right! I think forced labor gives better customer service but at least the location is convenient."}
{"text":"The search is over, I have found taco heaven. I sampled a chicken, asada, and pork street taco. The pork was a little sweet and smokey, the asada was well seasoned and smoky and the chicken too was a winner, just not as a flavorful. My husband let me taste the Bombero burrito, OMG, was that Mexican barbecue sauce on the burrito? The dining experience was well worth the 30 minute drive. I would sample everything on the menu. Thanks for the suggestion Bill B."}
{"text":"Super fresh tacos and salsa. It's a very family friendly place to boot. Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Our family has been coming here for years. We are use to the front staff and their sass. But today was different. Daisy and the other lady working this morning were very unprofessional. They should not be working in customer service. They weren't apologetic when they forgot to ring in my phone order. They even tried to upcharge me by over $5.   This is the 3rd time we've received horrible service here. And definitely will be our last time. I don't mind sass when ordering our food. But when it's paired with lack of menu knowledge and unapologetic service, i will not come back. Food does not taste good when treated this poorly. Please, daisy and other lady working today, get better training."}
{"text":"Very very good, DEPENDING ON WHAT YOU GET. My 4 stars are for the green chili chicken burrito and their red and green sauce. Absolutely delicious. I've yet to have another one just as delicious. I've also has other items like the carne asada burrito which have all been meh, but that green chili chicken burrito is worth driving all the way from south east Gilbert for.The restaurant is small and a bit rundown. Expect to have to wait for a table, sit outside or take it togo."}
{"text":"The place was clean, the people were friendly and the tacos were awesome.  The best were the carne asada.  I am rarely satisfied but I left feeling like I got great food at a great price.  It was 32 bucks for 20 tacos, two Fantas, and a bottle of water.  Pretty good I'd say."}
{"text":"I've been to Los Taquitos a few times and generally like the food.  Any Mexican eatery that serves Pozole and/or Sopes is worth a shot in my book.  Both of those items are good (if you want \"authentic\" then you'll need to buy a plane ticket).  The tacos are also tasty, and I appreciate that they make their own red and green salsa.  What I can't quite understand is why they serve the esoteric lengua meat, but don't serve the more common chorizo meat.  (Perhaps it's because of the raunchy \"chorizo\" that passes for food north of the border?)  At any rate, my three stars are because of the high price (the \"Guy Fieri tax\"), the forgettable side dishes (an afterthought), and the long wait time (read every other Yelp review)."}
{"text":"Carnitas tacos - amazing. This place is always cold - bring a jacket. Food is excellent. Taco Tuesday..'nuff said."}
{"text":"Tried your location on Elliot and now we're at the one on 16th street. Same great quality of food. Now we wish you had a location on the West side like Surprise. Great service.  And Coke instead of that other stuff!"}
{"text":"Very misleading name.  I expected them to atleast make Taquitos. But no, they have flautas.  Uhhhh not the same.  Carnitas are too salty and they put salsa on my street tacos.  I don't want you to choose the salsa on my taco... Thank you."}
{"text":"The food is good, but the service is terribly slow. 30 minutes for six tacos is ridiculous. So if you want to wait, this is the best place to go. And it's not very busy to wait so long for tacos."}
{"text":"My bf and I are from Cali and had been in Phoenix area for 5 days without Mexican food. I was going through withdrawals. This was the closest place to us so we gave it a try. They had a good variety of food items on the menu. I tried the carne asada nachos (w/o pico). I was not disappointed. I actually could not finish but hated to waste the rest. Plenty of meat, cheese, and beans. They put the sour cream and fresh guacamole on the side.  Chips were also made there, opposed to store bought chips.  Bf had carne asada and carnitas street tacos. I can't comment much on those because he ate them too quickly. We went about 11am, just before lunch rush. As we were leaving, a line was forming and phone orders were nonstop. I recommend."}
{"text":"Cute little restaurant. Cheap prices.  I love the black and white photography too. Food for me was pretty average; it was tasty and hit the spot for sure but it wasn't anything I would crave. That being said, I did wolf down my carne asada tacos with reckless abandon. The meat had a tinge of pink (which I loved) and was tender, nicely marinaded and would have been perfect with just a smidge more salt. Mine came out with out the prerequisite onion and cilantro, so double check for that. Beans and rice that come with meal were so not a generous portion....but it was all good since the rice was a wee bit bland, I suggest beans over rice for sure. Love the pickled carrots, and jalapeños at the salsa bar, but I wished they had salsa that you could dip out instead of the few squeeze bottles.  When I was there, one table had basically all of the salsa bottles, leaving everyone else to either ask if they were finished, wistfully wish they would hurry up and finish or do without.   They do serve drinks, and have a pretty big menu, which is supplemented with brunch specials. Nice spot for an easy quick meal."}
{"text":"An amazing street taco place! There is not a better place for tacos in Ahwatukee, and maybe Phoenix. I've tried most of the meats and every single one has been great.  The rice and beans are also very good. It can be busy at times but they usually go through the line pretty quickly and the employees are all very friendly."}
{"text":"This is my go to place for a really good beef enchilada. The red sauce is always flavorful, and the combo with rice and beans will surely satisfy your cravings. Even the rice and beans are delicious, and remind me of home. I'm never afraid to just order a good ol' bean & cheese burrito. With their salsa verde, it is the perfect choice if you just want something simple. Of course, they do have carne asada, a typical staple for any Mexican food joint, and theirs is pretty darn good. I always get it as a quesadilla, and I'm always happy with the decision. Don't let their old school tables fool you, this place is full of good food!"}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time..They have great food! But I'm done, not coming back. The counter help is so rude, I just decided it's not worth it. This is Arizona and God's Mexican food is on every corner."}
{"text":"Excellent food with quick service! Informal and great prices. The best Taco Tuesday place, tasty vegetarian options."}
{"text":"This place has quickly become my favorite Taco Shop in the East Valley truly authentic amazing Carnitas and Al Pastore highly recommended their individual tacos. With the perfect Mexican beer."}
{"text":"Los Taquitos gets this Mexican (food lover)'s approval, I must say!  We often order takeout from Los Taquitos especially considering how popular it is and crowded it can become inside. We always receive our food quickly and the menu is very affordable.  From tacos and burritos to enchiladas and chile rellenos...we're always down to order from Los Taquitos!"}
{"text":"Nothing special. Truly a dive. Almost a dump. But nice people and ok food. Drove 27 miles to check it out because of the TV show. Wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"Very pleased on my first visit to Los Taquitos!! Very clean, casual, simple menu and GREAT FOOD!! My husband and I both ordered the street taco meal, absolutely delish!! The beans were simple but out of this world flavor! Staff very kind and quick! For 2 dinners and a soda $16!!! Can't wait to go back and try everything else Los Taquitos has to offer!"}
{"text":"They have flower tacos!!!!! I tried just about all of the meats and I would suggest trying one of each as well they are all good. Little disappointed there was no salsa bar."}
{"text":"Horrible service. I asked for a burrito bowl and this is what I got. The worker who gave me this laughed at it.  Sad sad sad"}
{"text":"Great food cool staff and a really cool place to hang out with friends and have a few drinks. Recently went there with my wife and kids and everyone had a great time. Definitely recommend this place to everyone"}
{"text":"Walking up to this place I was kinda nervous... definitely a hole in the wall. Almost like it was a baja fresh at one point but O M G I can't believe the food. We walked in - total noobs to this place and checked the menu while in line.  We sat down for about 5 minutes before we heard our number come up and it was BUSY. Busy as in 5-6 people were ahead of us but we were ordering within 2 minutes.  The food is served on styrofoam plants that are cheap but the food... man I'm glad I found this place. I put this on par with Si Senor and Rosa's Taco Shop but... more casual if you can get more casual without losing clothing.  My favorite was the tacos - the street carne tacos are so well seasoned. And the refried beans - unique taste and very flavorful. And for $6 I got a plate of food that filled me for two meals easy.  I actually didn't see the Diners drive in's thing until we sat down and saw the painted stamp that Guy put on the wall. I had seen this in a few other places in town which was a good sign. I'm positive we will be back here several more times."}
{"text":"Eh.  Used to love this place, but I swear, since the DDD episode aired, it's gone downhill.    Also, maybe with all the new business they're getting, they can get a bigger place? It's a little stressful to eat there, and waiting in line for a take home order makes me feel like I'm at the losing end of a jousting match."}
{"text":"A new location same great flavors plus a patio. Ever want to dine al fresco (not in the summer) and enjoy a great fish burrito or secret off the menu chillie rellno burrito?  Than this new location of Los Taquitos is for you. Affordable quality Mexican food in a fast casual setting. Some times not as fast as you would like but quality can take time.  I love the fish burrito as the grilled Mahi is full of flavor and pairs with pico de gallo and rice, it is a semi healthier option."}
{"text":"This is not just another store front taco shop.  It has quality and variety and value.  I stopped in here on a rare rainy day for lunch and was shocked by the long lines at 11am. The phone was raining with call in orders and the line grew. This was a good sign.  There is the over head menu full of the usual Mexican taco burrito total fare, and s small black board with specials.   I overheard the lady in front of me asking for a veggie burrito $.3.50 (a black board special) and to get it toasted.  I decided to do the exact same and added some chips for $1.    The burrito was great filled with beans, peppers onions and more. The toasting made it quite hot and added a extra crunch to the tortilla I could have lived without.   The hot sauce was still hot from cooking, a decent Smokey spice note and very thin, I really liked it. The chips came in a small paper  tray not much for $1 but they were good and thick.  Despite the crowd seating was decent with many 4 and 2 person tables in the long narrow setup.  There is a small soda fountain with the usual. And a free spiced carrots that were great, mostly spice not vinegar!   I will be going back to try other items.  Casual fast and decent quality."}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos in the valley.  Asada, pastor, shrimp, and fish tacos are amazing, and the made in house corn tortillas just complete the masterpiece.  Nothing more to say than just eat here!"}
{"text":"Carne Asada Quesadilla was pretty tasty and prices are fair for what your getting. They also do breakfast."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Taco Tuesday spot. Tacos are $1.00 and the special includes Al Pastor, Chicken and Carne. Tacos are a regular street taco size and they come with onions and cilantro. Their green and red salsa are both very flavorful. Staff is super friendly and they do a great job of keeping the place clean."}
{"text":"I would definitely go here again, an authentic Mexican restaurant experience, great service and can't wait to get back again."}
{"text":"This place has always been a favorite ever since high school. It's pretty amazing to see the growth of a family owned business. Multiple locations, expansions, airport location...very dope! Did I mention best breakfast burritos and the flautas are tasty too!?!?"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews and driving by the place numerous times decided to stop for lunch .. place was buzzing people coming and going but everything seemed to flow .. ordering was a breeze and food came fast .. I had the prickly pear margarita and pollo Street tacos , my kids had the quesadillas off the kid menu .. we were all pleased with our choices !!  Definitely glad I made the trip !! I will be back to sample the menu again.. probably sooner than later !"}
{"text":"My husband and love Mexican food and wanted to try a new place. We had a friend recommend Los Taquitos and we are so thrilled me went there! This will be a new regular spot for us. El pastor tacos are delicious! Lots of flavor in all of their tacos and they don't cheat you on the amount of meat that's served in their tacos. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place definitely lives up to the hype! Bomb street tacos.  Keep in mind these are more authentic and are small, not oversized American portions. Don't feel guilty buying multiple, that's normal.  The carne asada torta was also divine. I would recommend buying things al la carte rather than a combo. The combos tack on a couple dollars and you just get small portions of rice and beans. Instead, just buy more off the al la carte, it will be tastier and more value."}
{"text":"Had it yesterday.  It was good.   I asked for a carnitas burrito but got a a different burro though in my bag to go.  It was a shredded beef one.   It was good though.  Good thing.   Their chorizo quesadilla was great."}
{"text":"Still the best! So sad they don't have sopes anymore I can't find any as good as they made them but all the food and service is still always great"}
{"text":"Once I find another place with street tacos, I will no longer frequent this place. Everytime I have come, there have been errors in the order. This last one was on taco Tuesday and I was charged full price with no explanation. Poor customer service"}
{"text":"Based on my husband's meal and mine - 5 stars.  The other two in the car said 4.  So I wish 4.5 stars was a choice... Tostada, bean burrito, fish taco, and 3 meat combo platter all excellent.  The beans were a little runny which I like but 2 people thought was strange.  Came here because of D3 (diners, dine ins and dives) and glad we did!  Be prepared to wait a moment to order, and another for the meal to be ready.  And do everyone a favor and wait to order before securing a table...otherwise you are just being annoying."}
{"text":"I have been to many Mexican restaurants but have never had Carne Asada that I liked as much as Los Taquitos. I've been eating there for years. Their Carne street tacos with fresh cilantro and finely chopped red onion is really tasty and something I really must have a couple times a month. Huge breakfast burritos too. The dining room has just been made larger, so there is more eat in seating available. Great place, great food, a real neighbourhood treat!"}
{"text":"Not good. Bland. Disorganized and poor communication. Should have read reviews first. Beware barely palatable food."}
{"text":"Awesome tacos! I'd give five stars if they weren't slow for service. I know they're generally busy, but they did forget to put in my phone order and I had to wait 15 minutes for my food. Other than that, great place, prices aren't too bad, and it's easy access from Elliott and the 10."}
{"text":"Living in Scottsdale and commuting to Chandler for work everyday, I think I have eaten from the nices Latin restaurants (Distrito) to the hole in the ground (yes, not wall) ones.    Los Taquitos has to be my favorite of all from top to bottom.  Walking in, I got the feeling I was in San Luis RC or Rocky point joint.  There's enough seating for a lunch crowd and a few outdoor seats when it gets crowded (or too cold inside).    I ordered the Combo plate which came with three meats, beans, and rice.  I also got a side salsa, and I made a quick grab for the usual red salsa in a bottle.    The three meats were flavorful and distinct.  I liked the beef which had a nice char to it.  The beans were the usual, but the rice was amazing.  It looks normal, but it was buttery, soft, and melted in your mouth.  The side salsa they give you is also a standout.  It was very fresh with a hint of sweetness to it which I'm wondering if it could be a pickled melon?  Hands down it's the place to go when I get a craving for Mexican food in the East Valley."}
{"text":"This is THE place I bring friends from out of town for awesome Mexican food!  Best breakfast burrito in Az.   Best tacos in Az  Best chicken tostada ever!"}
{"text":"After the remodel I'd almost have to say this one is better than the 16th Street one.  Both have best mexican food I've had in all of the Southwest!"}
{"text":"This place is great value. The food is delicious and you cannot beat the price.   I have never dined in I always get to go however the restaurant is always very clean when I come in and the staff have always been very pleasant.   If you are looking for great food not to mention unbeatable value you have found your place."}
{"text":"Just average quality food. I got three carne asada tacos with rice/beans. Tacos were tiny! I was hungry 2 hours later.  I won't return."}
{"text":"Always a delight dining at this Los Taquitos location...great service and consistently good quality food. Everything tastes authentic and homemade. Features a nice little bar area with a television. Can get a bit noisy when it's crowded. When the weather is nice, their patio is a great place to dine."}
{"text":"Everything here is amazing. So authentic and fresh-tasting. The chicken burrito is my favorite!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place a 10 I would! The Carne Asada Street Tacos with beans and rice are delicious! The place was spotless and cozy. The service was fast and friendly. I will be back again and again.  I'm craving those tacos right now"}
{"text":"I ordered a Asada Quesadilla. I got a very small quesadilla. No salsa available. Was not fresh and who knows what kind of meat that was. I don't know, but it tasted awful and certainly wasn't steak. I don't know what qualifies them to be a Mexican restaurant, but I was not impressed. Your best tip will be to skip this place."}
{"text":"First, I always recommend eating outside of security in Phoenix if you think you have time; the terminals are just too crowded. But here I was, eating disappointing Mexican food in the Southwest terminal.   They hadn't restocked the waters so everyone in line had to keep wandering over to the register next door to get water. I ordered a chicken burito. The chicken was quality meat, like really good quality cut which I was thrilled about but the small burrito was mostly refried beans. I could get over the beans except that the burrito is also served with a huge helping of beans and rice as well. First, its hard to eat a plate of beans and rice from a flimsy metal tray while sitting in an airport chair without a table or worse, when standing. Secondly, not to be crass, but I'm not sure I want all my fellow travelers eating huge helpings of beans before getting on a flight. This is just an odd choice."}
{"text":"Here's a first... I've always believed in word of mouth recommendations. But I've never been the recipient of an indirect, long-distance recommendation before. My brother, who lives in California, saw an old episode of DDD that featured Los Taquitos. He texted me saying we should check this place out when he's in town again. So I beat him to the punch and took my girlfriend to the Elliott Road location for dinner last week.  Having not seen the actual DDD episode, I previewed the restaurant's website and was impressed. And when we arrived, I was even more impressed. Los Taquitos is a modern, bright and cheerful fast-casual Mexican restaurant. Their specialty is street tacos and they have Margaritas y Cervezas to complement them! Oh, and burritos, tortas, tamales... I could go on. And the artwork is brilliant!  My girlfriend and I each enjoyed our selections. Hers was in a bowl and I tried a combination of the various taco fillings. There are home made salsas available, but you really won't need them. Everything is fresh and seasoned well. But grab a bunch of limes! You can't go wrong there.  And of course, I had to tease my brother about the fact that we tried his suggestion without him. But, happily, I confirmed that he knew a good thing when he saw it. We will be back! With or without my brother."}
{"text":"I had the Carnitas Burrito and it had no taste. I definitely know good tasting Carnitas and must echo the sentiments of that famous line in the 1988 VP Debate when I say \"You sir are not a good Carnitas Burrito\"."}
{"text":"I used to think America's Taco Shop was the best, but I was wrong.  I found Taco heaven here.  I get take out here about once per month.  I've had the chicken street tacos, carne asada burrito.  You can mix and match anything on the menu and they are cool with it.  I've never dined in but it is a very sleek casual design.  The staff is really friendly and it seems like it's a family-run dining room.  And it's super reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Nice place!! But the fact you have to wait 30 min for your food to be ready its ridiculous, they give priority of taking out orders 1st, food is amazing but service awful"}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday! !! The tacos are amazing, the house margaritas are $4 and the salsa is fresh. I love this hidden gem."}
{"text":"This is a decent Mexican place. They have burritos, enchiladas, taquitos of course, and sometimes breakfast items and soups. I've only been here for lunch, but it's always been good especially for the price. It isn't to die for but it's tasty and hits the spot. Nothing is very spicy."}
{"text":"Happy Hour / Yummy Margarita's 4-7 daily! Need I say more?! I really need to come back for that.   Great food, selection and service. I love the decor! Fun bold colors warmed up by warm wood accents.  First time I had the Trainer Salad, delicious!! Moist chicken loaded on greens and fresh veggies.  Second visit I thought I better try the tacos. 3 Tacos, + guacamole and a drink for under $10. Where else can you get that?   They are hidden in a strip mall but the secret is out, they are busy during the lunch hour so if your in a rush, call in your order."}
{"text":"Amazing tacos. Simple menu, no frills. The asada tacos were some of the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"This is a great new find in our neighborhood. When you first walk in your eyes are excited with all the bright murals beautifully painted throughout the restaurant. From there the menu is very simple and to the point. My family happened to go on taco Tuesday and we were able to only spend $24 for 3 adults. This will for sure be our new taco stop. Make sure to try the carne tacos!"}
{"text":"Get the tacos! They are AMAZING!"}
{"text":"This place is great. I love the Menudo. The last time I was here, I had to ask what was going on with my food 3 different times. Don't F it up for me Los Taquitos!!! I can't end up back at Taco Bell."}
{"text":"its located in a strip mall so i didn't expect much but upon entering their establishment i couldn't be any more wrong. it is a contemporary place with some pretty cool art in there. their chorizo, egg and potato is pretty good but i really like their street taco asadas."}
{"text":"The food here so delicious, to be quite honest the only thing I've been disappointed by is how bland their shrimp tacos are but otherwise their tacos of all different types are delicious, great nachos, chorizo quesadillas and posole. I love this place and since they got their remodel a couple months ago their beautiful shop matches the amazing food!"}
{"text":"Great tacos. Just wish the restaurant was not full of flies!"}
{"text":"A-OK indeed.  I got three carne asada tacos.  The meat was a bit chewy/rubbery, but I did love the toppings and the itty bitty corn tortillas.    Eh, I'll be back.  I think I'd try some other sort of meat next time though."}
{"text":"Thanks Diners, Drive-Ins & Dives, the carne asada rocked my world! Great little place with really good food for a good price!"}
{"text":"Tried them again with the kids last night and have a few new things to say since my last visit.  I had Bombero sauce put onto a carne asada Chimi this time, and it was FABULOUS.  Works better on a chimi than a burrito, I think, because the sauce makes the burrito tortilla \"wet\" and does not have the same soggy effect on the fried shell of the chimi.  The carne asada last night was smokey and awesome.  It has not been this good on my prior visits.  It was pure, smokey goodness this trip.  The chicken hard-shell tacos held together better too....after falling apart last trip.  I wonder if they changed their shell a little?  Anyway, they were delicious.  A word about the \"salad\" too - it is that micro-shredded lettuce and a few tomatoes and a little white Mexican cheese sprinkled on top.  And it was all perfectly fresh and delicious.  The beans again were better than your average refried beans - something about them I can't place for sure, but they are delish.  The staff was great and friendly.  I'm gonna spend more time eating here.  It's pretty darn outstanding...."}
{"text":"Taquitos aren't even on the menu! I was told they are discontinuing them but they made them anyway. Overpriced and not very good. Service was slow...Not a good first impression.  Probably won't be back."}
{"text":"The carne asada street tacos are well seasoned and delicious. Highly recommended.  Workers are quick but too busy to wipe down the tables."}
{"text":"Man, this place is great! I've eaten here at least 20 times and only experienced one off day. Food is delicious, atmosphere is fun, and their margaritas are wonderful. A must-try!"}
{"text":"Amazing Tacos! DO NOT go for Taco Tuesday. The line is terribly long and even if you order take out, it still takes forever. I'd recommend splurging the extra $.75 a taco to go on a not so busy day. The red sauce is very spicy and delicious. The green sauce is a typical green chile sauce. Haven't tried anything but the tacos but I'm sure it's all good. Friendly staff, good service (when they're not inundated on Taco Tuesday)."}
{"text":"Delicious street tacos!  Clean and friendly service with fair prices... Definitely a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"I wish Los Taquitos existed in my town. I visited this spot while on vacation, on my next to last day, and wish I had gone earlier so I could have eaten here multiple times.   This restaurant is located in a smallish strip mall. It has a very casual atmosphere, a walk up counter for ordering and a bunch of booths and tables to eat at. There are colorful murals on the walls, actually pretty cute.   The employees were friendly and helpful, and my co-eater and I both got a combo and a sope. I would say the tacos were the best draw, followed by the enchiladas, then the tamales. The rice and beans were tasty too. The sauce on the enchilada and tamale was delicious. I really wish I was able to try more. This place is on my to-do list for the next time I'm in the area!   I hear they're putting a Los Taquitos outpost in PHX airport. How about one in New York next?!"}
{"text":"Ridiculous. The cashier couldn't understand VERY VERY VERY basic instructions. Veggie Burrito, no beans and no tomatoes. Cashier: \"so you want the rice on the side?\"   How in the world did she take that from what I said. This continues for several minutes as I'm eyeing my watch to catch my flight on time. I asked if I could sub chips instead of my two sides of beans and rice. Quoting their no substitutions policy seemed to be the only thing she had been well trained on. Finally my order makes it to the kitchen. PLOP... that was the sound of a big scoop of beans being dumped on my burrito.  The cooked asked if I wanted it anyway since he didn't put a lot of beans in it. Ya not the point.   5 minutes later I'm running  to my gate. I strongly recommend avoiding this spot. They don't understand service, food quality or sense of urgency considering they are in an airport."}
{"text":"Was in a rush, and found this option. Went for the Carnitas Tortas and it was pretty good for the price and convenience. Their rice and beans were gross though. Everything was served in a tin plate with a plastic lid much like a cafeteria. Nothing special here, but OK if you are in a rush and you need calories."}
{"text":"Affordable? Yes, Tasty? Yes, and Friendly? Yes. I went here with my friend and got a chicken burrito and Mexican Jarritos Apple soda with it. Also if you are brave you need to use Habanaro sauce it is delicious and spikes things up. This place uses fresh ingredients and will be less than $12 . I will return!"}
{"text":"There is NEVER A disappointment when I come here. Vibe is great, service is awesome, food is delicioso ,see what I did there? Lol one of my favorite places in the valley for taco Tuesday."}
{"text":"One bite and I was transported back to the crowded streets of Monterrey.  I could almost smell the exhaust of the vochos and hear the distant conversation of the local policia extorting their prescribed mordida.  Quite simply, this is the taco as the way it was intended by its creators.  The pure and unadulterated classic enjoyed by the Mexican working class.  What Pomo is to pizza, this place is to tacos.  Authentic...absolutely authentic."}
{"text":"I grew up on Mexican food, and I am really picky. I'm from San Diego and I miss miss miss the taco shops I grew up eating at. I had up until this point settled on Fili B's because every taco shop in AZ I have tried has disappointed me. Until Los Taquitos!    I have now eaten at Los Taquitos 3 times! First time I tried Carne Asada tacos and Carnitas tacos, both were really good! The Carnitas tacos were moist and flavorful! WOW! We also had a quesadilla, and it was creamy buttery deliciousness. Have had both items a second time and I am still SOLD! Oh and their Salsa's are really good, too!   I also tried their Pozole, which was a good size portion and very flavorful, a little too salty for my tastes, but I would order it again for my Pozole fix!   If you are looking for a new taco shop...maybe you should find a different one because this one is mine now and I don't want to share! Just Kidding!   Oh and here's an important tip if you like Mexican food...Don't order Tamales at restaurants or taco shops, if you have had a real tamale made at home. They are always too dry and disappointing! And I don't think you can judge a TACO SHOP by an enchilada/tamale...try a taco or burrito...I truly believe that not everything at one restaurant can be great! In my opinion!"}
{"text":"Uneventful veggie burritos and if you're salsa fanatic like me you have to ask for tons of salsa when you get it to go because they only want to give you two to go containers.  I do like the fact that when dining in you have salsa in squirty dispensers and both the red and green are quite good.  Staff is very friendly and more than happy to give you those extra sauces to go.  I have to say the layout of the restaurant is quite uncomfortable."}
{"text":"The $1 tacos are good on Tuesday's but at regular price, I would feel a bit cheated. Wish the carne asada's were part of it. Also, their Horchata is really watered down."}
{"text":"I work right down the street from this restaurant and it's great everytime.  The staff is alwasy so nice.  The food always tastes freash.  i definitely recommend a visit if you're in the mood for Mexican."}
{"text":"Los Taquitos might have earned four stars if it was located in the Midwest, but here it is nothing special. The interior is interesting. This location used to be a Qdoba, and later, a forgettable burger joint. There is plenty of space, and I thought it was interesting how all of their chairs are a little different. It gives the place some color and character.  I enjoyed the street tacos (carne asada and shrimp). I especially liked the carne asada, which paired well with the red salsa. They don't have much of a salsa selection here -- a red and a green -- neither of which is particularly impressive.   What is keeping me from returning is their portion sizes. I ordered the street taco combo and added another taco. I still left pretty hungry. I'm not a big guy (5'9, 172), and I think I'm finished growing outside of what I accomplish in the weight room (25 years old), but I would probably need to spend around $15 here to leave satisfied. That is not ideal with so many quality Mexican restaurants around."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday, AGAIN!!! $1 street tacos. Carnitas, Grilled Chicken, and El Pastor. Pastor is amazing. They also serve beer if you feel so inclined.  Typically you will find at least 2 or 3 people from my office at this place on Tuesday for lunch.  Mexican grub very much authentic and a nice clean environment."}
{"text":"What took me so long   I have driven by Los Taquitos dozens of times and have never stopped in, that is until today.  Los Taquitos takes taco making to the next level. The decor inside Los Taquitos is reminiscent of a Dia del Muerte pageant. Once inside, you know immediately by the incredible aroma that you are in the right place for great tasting Mexican food.   On this visit I  tried each of the three tacos and a chille relleno.  Everything was delicious; the tacos pastor was incredible. The meat in these tacos was tender, flavorful, and practically melted in my mouth. The Carne Asada Taco is stuffed with bubbling, juicy bits of lightly marinated skirt steak, nestled in a warm homemade tortilla, delicious doesn't begin to describe the Carne Asada Taco. However, I couldn't possibly overlook the Al Pastor with its sweet meat, topped with onions and cilantro, so flavorful, moist, and delicious, I could have ate a dozen, and on Taco Tuesday at $1.00 a taco, I just might.  I would highly recommend a stop at Los Taquitos for lunch or dinner.  Nothing fancy; but really delicious food,great service, and wallet friendly pricing."}
{"text":"This is by far the best place to get street tacos in AZ. This place is way better than backyard taco (a lot of people in Mesa think is the best). The tacos al pastor are my personal favorite!"}
{"text":"What took me so long   I have driven by Los Taquitos dozens of times and have never stopped in, that is until today. All I have to say is, what took me so long. Los Taquitos is located in a strip mall, I know there many of those strip mall cafes that don't always work out, but Los Taquitos isn't one of those. Los Taquitos takes taco making to the next level. The decor inside Los Taquitos is reminiscent of a Dia del Muerte pageant. Once inside, you know immediately by the incredible aroma that you are in the right place for great tasting Mexican food.

{"text":"Love this place! I actually prefer not to go on Taco Tuesday (because it gets a bit packed), but wow. I'm no expert in Mexican food, but man, their food is good! A good tip is to order ahead of time by phone and pick it up.  Also, try the flan! It's not the cheap kind (the little circle one that's prepackaged). They don't always have it though, but when they do, I grab some for my husband. lol"}
{"text":"Love this place. The owners are gracious and very attentive. Terrific margaritas and fish tacos! I'll be a customer as long as I live in AZ. My favorite is the carne asada burrito with their pickled jalepenos and a horchata on the side."}
{"text":"Great taco spot! The flavors are incredible. We tried their margaritas for the 1st time. Trust me, you only need one lol. Careful coming on a Tuesday though. It's gets so busy and the wait is kinda long and they run out of a lot of stuff. So get there early. The staff is awesome. Definitely a must try"}
{"text":"Nice place to eat.  The service was quick and friendly.  The food was great.  We went with the family and seemed to be ok.  The dining areas is very small so if it's busy it might be tight to get a table."}
{"text":"5 stars is well deserved. They have the best tacos I have ever had. Customer service is amazing and the food is as well. Love the decor too. I love bringing my friends here too. They all have become Los Taquitos fanatics as well."}
{"text":"This place is horrible.  Twice now, gave it a second chance and still bad.  The staff couldn't give a damn about anything.  Asked my name and said Joe, they said Chuck.  Ok, I don't care about that so give me some decent food.  Asked for no cheese since I'm lactose intolerant so I get chicken street tacos and beans and rice with cheese.  Happened the first time too.  Gave food back to the guy to fix, a minute later a girl brings my food up but calls it a different name of a guy that just left, told her it was mine, she didn't say anything just took it away.  The guy tells her it's mine so she turns to me with a nasty look and gives it to me.  Freakin strange.  Owners, get a clue and stop using airport employees.  Hire your own people who give a shit and pay them what they deserve.  The tacos were spicy but lack any other flavor, the beans like glue, and the rice beyond flavorless.  Will not eat here again."}
{"text":"I had this for Taco Tuesday - where all their tacos are $1, except their Asada. The Pollo was kind of dry, but I normally don't get pollo tacos, so there's no comparison. The Carnitas was amazing and the Pastor was even better. Overall I had 5 tacos and I still wanted more. In addition, we made in time for Happy Hour and got a $4 House Margarita. That was also perfect - sour, strong, and barely taste the tequila. The service was also welcoming, helpful, and sweet. I'll definitely be coming back! Hopefully this will be my new go-to Mexican place."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. 5 star because they know how to make great Mexican food. If you want great atmosphere, this is not your place. Comfortable casual din"}
{"text":"This was a popular spot during the time I was here. It seemed like the whole conference loved this place. I think it was the cheap price and the fast lunch that allured them here. This is definitely a take out or dine in spot, it's fast, and they basically have it set up like a fast food chain. You get in line, go to the counter, order, you get a number if you are eating there, then pick a seat. Seats are limited, so if there's a ton of people there is a chance that you probably won't get a seat.   Now, to the food. I ordered the Pastor Burrito and I got it smothered. Don't follow my footsteps and get it smothered. Get it plain, if you want the sauce, get it on the side because to me it took all the flavor of the pastor in the burrito and the overall taste out of it and you're just eating a burrito drenched in sauce. The overall pastor was good, I wish that I never got it smothered and just got it on the side. On the other hand, the fish tacos were good which I would recommend if that's what you want.  Overall, this place was good. Great place for quick lunches. Nothing exciting or memorable other than the option to smother the sauce all over the burrito. Check it out if you're low on time and want some quick Mexican food."}
{"text":"Read about their delicious tacos so I had to try them. Ordered 2 al pastor & 1 veggie tacos. The veggie was good but was missing the avocado the cashier said came on it and the al pastor was aaaaamazzing. I would highly recommend getting the salsa on the side. I'm like spicy food but WOW my mouth was on fire by the end of my meal. All in all a great place to get some Mexican food."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I am from San Diego where we love guacamole and/or sour cream in our burritos. Tried the carne asada burrito and it had rice, beans, pico and raw jalepeno (w/ seeds). The carne was very tasty, however the rest of the burrito was not. If you prefer a burrito with more complexity and juicy meat this is not for you. With so much rice and beans in the burrito it was filling, but otherwise very forgettable"}
{"text":"Wow what a hidden gem this place is!!! Stopped in with my mom and sister. I ordered a bean tostada, pastor street taco and some chips and salsa. Everything tasted fresh and amazing. Beans were creamy, salsa was a fresh pico de gallo, chips were crispy, and the pastor was succulent and a little hint of spice. My mom ordered the steak fajitas and they were well worth the wait. The meat was tender and flavorful and the onions and peppers were caramelized and perfectly seasoned. The rice had such a great texture and hint of flavor that I loved. My sister had a veggie street taco which I had a bite of and it was surprisingly good. It was beans, peppers, onions, potatoes and avocado. The only negative was the ladies bathroom was in disrepair and a little dirty. However the food and quick service was outstanding. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"For airport food this is pretty hard to beat. We each had Tortas (pollo y carnitas) and both were fantastic-- Authentic Mexican roll, tender meat, and all the right accoutrements. Chips were OK and they have some decent hot sauce (red and green) available. Service was very friendly albeit not super fast as they got pretty busy."}
{"text":"Oh bomberro burrito how I love you so.    Their homemade spicy sauce is the tastiest blend of hot spicy flavor and sweetness that I've ever had.  It's basically ketchup with lots of spice, but wow is it good.  They should package this stuff and sell it!    I order the carne asada, but I'll warn you it isn't the best carne asada I've ever had.  It's above average, but sometimes overcooked.  It lacks sufficient marination and seasoning to be considered among the elite carne asada in the valley, but it's fresh and grilled to order, so you can't complain.  Their fish tacos are above average as well as their other tacos.  Their rice and beans are average as well, but nothing spectacular.  It's a bit over hyped, but I would recommend it just for the bomberro burrito and decent prices."}
{"text":"Updating my review. It seems with the expansion prices increased, customer service & cleanliness decreased. Not a good combo  My to-go orders have been messed up or not even the correct order.   Street tacos are now $1.75, with less meat. The cashiers are rude and don't want to answer questions about the menu. Last time I went in, all the tables were dirty, rice and smeared beans covered the floor. I guess the staff was too busy watching football to clean."}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican places in the valley! The food is delicious and incredibly cheap. The service has always been amazing as well. I've been coming for years, and I hope Los Taquitos never ever closes."}
{"text":"I brought my sister from Pennsylvania here because of yelp and it was definitely a great decision! The lady working suggested we try a bombero burrito since we enjoy spicy foods and it was delicious. We also shared a street taco meal (asada, marinated pork and green Chile chicken). All three were delicious. I am most definitely going to be coming back. :D"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place : (  Hubby had tacos (lengua, asada y pastor) and he said they were the best tacos ever. I did not have any because the extra taco I had ordered for myself... was not actually in my order, so disappointment number one.  Service was OK but not particularly friendly.  2 - We ordered, sat to wait for our number, and people were coming and going... they seem to pay more attention to people with to go orders than to the customers in their dining room, which is a big turn off for me as a customer. Even a person in a neighboring table made conversation and asked what we had ordered, because he thought we were waiting for a while.  Hubby got impatient and went to ask (they were like 10 numbers over our ticket number) and he was told the delay was because of our 'big' order... yeah, 3 tacos, a bowl of menudo and a drink.  Well, the menudo was super hot... (are there any regulations about food temperature?  hehe) and in fact very tasty, but super stingy with the meat, I think they were leftovers and honestly they should have said 'we run out' instead of selling me a bowl of hominy. Well, I would have taken it at a discount, but not for regular price.  So, it would have been great if it was a regular portion, but it was like 90% hominy, 10% pancita, so that is a big no-no in my book.  We don't live anywhere close to this place, so I do not see ourselves coming back. Unless hubby really craves those awesome tacos one of these days."}
{"text":"Gotta love it when fellow Foodies put together tweetups that involve food and drink, even better when that get together happens at a restaurant featured on Diners, Drive-ins & Dives that you've wanted to try out for ages.  Kirti Dwivedi and Susie Timm decided to gather tweeps at the grand opening of Los Taquitos' newest location on 16th and Glendale avenues in Mid-town Phoenix for a nosh and adult beverages. Thirty or so twitter and Facebook users responded to the tweetvite, showed up, queued up and got down to the business of eating.  First up a margarita made with Tres Agaves tequila and freshly squeezed Blood orange juice. I'm a big fan of the tangy sweetness of blood  oranges and am glad to see them used in this upscale taqueria.  The much talked about 'Bombiero' burrito was served up as my entrée, full of slow cooked carnitas, pico de gallo, and rice wrapped in a flour tortilla and bathed in Los Taquitos signature sweet and fiery 'Bombiero' sauce.  I found the pork to be perfectly cooked, tender and juicy, the pico fresh and vibrant but the sauce was a bit overpowering in it's sweetness. I was really looking for this sauce to have a much higher level of heat and spice, but over-all, sweet was the strongest note that I experienced. In my opinion, this sauce would be perfect if the sweetness was dialed down and the heat increased.  Other tweeps at my table enjoyed their carne asada tacos with rice and beans and we all munched on that taco shop staple, chips and salsa/guacamole. I'm looking forward to trying several other dishes including the tacos al pastor and am quite happy that Los Taquitos has opened up on my side of the valley.  If you fancy a bit of up-scale taqueria cuisine, get to one of Los Taquitos' locations and have a go at the menu, you'll certainly not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I ordered take-out last night from Los Taquitos, upon the recommendation of a friend and a few Yelp reviews. I ordered the shrimp fajitas meal  (meals come with rice and beans) and my daughter had the kid's meal with a bean burrito. We also ordered chips and salsa.  15 minutes to pickup, and it was ready when we got there.  The total was $16.75, which I thought was a bit high considering what we ordered.  The inside has an unexpected, modern bar with about five stools. The register lines are right behind those stools. It just seemed odd and out of place. The three women at the registers had their act together, but could improve on friendliness.  So, we paid and were on our way, and I remembered the lady on the phone telling me to remind the person who rings us up that we get a drink with the kid's meal. Indeed, we did need to go back and get the drink cup. I just would prefer that it wasn't my job to remind them of something when they could easily write a note or symbol on the bag to remind themselves.  So, we got home and opened it all up and tried it out. My shrimp fajitas came with the bare minimum...meaning no traditional condiments. Poor assumption on my part, I guess. None-the-less, they tasted pretty good, but nothing special.  Now the chips and salsa - I mean, how can you go wrong? You can go wrong when the salsa is so hot that it burns for your mouth for five minutes after one bite and you end up not eating them and wasting your extra $2.50.  One last issue. I noticed later that they charged me a dollar more than the price on their menu online.  Not sure I'll go back, but if I do, it will be to try the $1 tacos."}
{"text":"The $4 house margarita during happy hour is the strongest, freshest, most flavorful happy hour margarita I have ever had. Food is fresh and flavorful and even when very busy comes out quickly."}
{"text":"As many times as I catch myself coming here, I must be honorable and upgrade to five stars. Plus, I sort of want to go Esther Williams in their menudo. YUM!!!!! I've since had tacos, burritos, menudo and pozole, oh my.....   This is a good neighborhood spot, and it's location is perfect for those dizzy-days-takeout-required kind of suppers. I ordered the beef tacos, and they were respectable and good! This is a clean, no-frills store front, and the service is efficient, which is perfect for that witching hour right after a frenzied work day when I am craving crispy, savory, tacos like a baby to a pacifier."}
{"text":"The only thing I have liked that I've ordered are the burritos, and I love authentic mexican food so I think that says something. Everything else is just ok. Don't look around to closely as everything needs to be cleaned. The floor, around the soda machine, the walls, the roof tiles inside- all dirty. Definitely a dive. Seems to be a bit pricey also. My husband loves the burritos but it always seems like we spend a lot of money and leave hungry."}
{"text":"Let me first say that I spent hours looking for chimichangas in Phoenix at 730pm on a Friday.  Locating the lost City of Dorado may be an easier task, so I jumped for joy when I came across the menu for Los Taquitos.  They service chimis with various fillings, enchilada style upon request.    The restaurant is easy to find from the freeway, and there is plenty of parking.  The walls are full of colorful murals, and the menu is extensive.  The cleanliness was questionable, but it didn't turn off our party from the chimichanga goodness that awaited us.  Orders are taken at the register, and the women we spoke to was helpful and pleasant.  I ordered the shrimp cocktail, my boyfriend ordered the chimi with sauce, guac, and sour cream. We shared the chips and salsa.  The red salsa is full of smokey chipotle deliciousness, but we were unable to secure a bottle of the green salsa.  The pico de gallo was bland, a solid 2/5.  My boyfriend enjoyed his carne asada chimi, but I thought the meat was burnt and could have used more oomph.  My shrimp cocktail was weird.  The shrimp were hot, the sauce was cold, it was a mess.  I don't recommend it. Overall I'd say it is asi-asi."}
{"text":"If you hate flavor, come here! Chicken unseasoned, and overcooked till good and dry... generally flavorless food. Mexican food without cheese, pay $1 extra for that.. pass next time. Manager was friendly at least... only reason for the second star..."}
{"text":"Checked this spot out while in town:  Service could have been better The food is good Large portions  Vegetarian options  Margaritas are good Good"}
{"text":"This place sucks. Broke ass Mexican food at hipster prices. I ate my tacos with a fork because the tortillas were soggy af. Their hot sauce is Tapatio... Yes... 99 cent store Tapatio. They charge $1.75 for a fountain drink and use Styrofoam cups... Wtf. The least they could do is pony up the extra $0.05 a cup to use paper at that price. Basically, F this place. Not coming back. Shocking 500+ people gave this an average 4 stars, but then again if you saw the customers you would understand the bias."}
{"text":"Good street tacos and nice service."}
{"text":"My wife and I love any of their things with the chicken in it. It is amazing. So far everything we have gotten from there is so good. The Arizona Burrito is great, and so are the fajitas."}
{"text":"was extreemly excited to eat here, the food sounded super good and there was even a vegatarian option which made it even better. as i was eating my burrito there was a bug of some sort in it. i am so disgusted i probably won't eat for the rest of the day."}
{"text":"This is one my favorite taco places for sure.  The al pastor tacos are amazing.  The customer service is above average.  We go for taco tuesdays 2-3 times a month and we have never had a bad experience.  Definitely worth giving it a try."}
{"text":"Poorly prepared food and tasteless.  I ordered the chicken tacos.  Chicken was dry and not marinated.  Concession needs to shut down"}
{"text":"I was craving tacos and decided to stop in for lunch during the work week since I'm not far away from Los Taquitos. I had the 3 taco plate with rice and beans. I had the carne asada tacos and everything was very tasty! Service was good and I will be back very soon!!"}
{"text":"Just visited Los Taquitos for the second time recently and was again very pleasantly satisfied with dinner!   My date had 4 street tacos (Carne Asada) on flour tortillas and they were great! I had the Chile Relleno Burrito and it was awesome! Both of the sauces (green/red) are great to add to any dish as well. I couldn't decide on which one I liked better so I just dipped alternating bites into a little I put on my plate.   Four Tacos, Chile Relleno Burrito and two bottled sodas totaled $13! Can't beat that deal!!!   Can't wait to go again! Yum Yum!!!"}
{"text":"I love Los Taquitos! A friend showed it to me at the beginning of 2014 and I've gone about once a week since then. Big fan of the carnitas tacos (ask for some lime and jalapeños to add on) and the AZ burro. Definitely check it out if you're in the area and craving some Mexican food. Also, $1 street tacos on Tuesdays - can't beat that!"}
{"text":"The sheer ignorance to not be able to figure out how to make a burrito that is half carnitas and half carne asada is dumbfounding.   The nice woman at the register asked the line cook or manager (I could not tell) if this was possible,  The response was \"what the hell, I don't have a frigging calculator, just order from the menu.\"  Is it really that hard to put half of the normal meat portion twice on the product?   Wait you say, there should be a difference in price.  Well sir, al the burritos were the same price no matter which meat was chose.   The rest of the reviews here pretty much state  that this is a place that does not expect return visits."}
{"text":"Best deal on Taco Tuesday! $1 select tacos. I always get the carnitas tacos because they have the best flavor around. Was a little disappointed with their pozole though. I wouldn't probably order that again, only for the fact that the broth is really bland. However something to definitely try would be the ceviche. It has a great flavor, and the portion size is huge!"}
{"text":"Not too bad for airport fast food. I recommend the carne asada torta. The salsa that comes with their meals is very good. Slow service."}
{"text":"Stumbled on this place hungry and between rides at 16th street and Glendale. Had a great Chile relano and a fish taco for under $8. Made fresh to order with friendly front end staff. Now i have another fine quick high quality place to stop."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Los Taquitos for many years now , and they never disappoint. I cant even tell anyone who asks me ,  what exactly is my favorite dish on their menu because its all honestly to die for  . Dont even get me started on their margaritas ... yum ! I Recommend anyone who hasnt tried this place to Go !!!! :-)"}
{"text":"We love to get take out at Los Taquitos on a busy week night when we are too tired to cook. They are super fast and dinner for 4 is usually under $20!   I love the street tacos and my husband the ceviche. Son loves the carne asada burrito, daughter the tamales. Seriously something for everyone. There IS some variability in the spicy factor, but we are total regulars. Gotta try it!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite Mexican places around. Really authentic and I personally prefer their burrito with extra meat it's simple, filling and fresh."}
{"text":"Big fan especially when I have a hankerin for burrito. Easy to carry out, we love to eat at home with the dogs. A street taco is sometimes just what the belly wants."}
{"text":"This is our local joint and the place we go when we can't come up with a better idea and/or don't feel much like cooking.  Not to say that we could replicate what they produce or that there are better ideas for dinner, I meant to say 'Los Taquitos is our go to place for great food, friendly service and reasonable prices'.  Typically we get the veggie burro (bean, rices, potatoes, peppers and onions) with a side of bombero sauce (which is super delicious spicy goodness).  Chips and salsa is great as well, with a sometimes spicy serrano and red onion dominated, almost pickled salsa.  They also have a red and green sauce to vary up the bites on your goodies, but I typically roll bombero sauce.  I would probably drink the stuff if they let me.  Family and friends dig into the carne asada burros and street tacos and everyone we've taken here has been very happy with the food.  Check the specials board as it changes on occasion and we've had some great rellenos and tamales at Los Taquitos as well."}
{"text":"Awesome food, never once had a bad experience when it comes to the flavor and taste! Carne asada burrito with cheese and make it enchilada style, it's delicious here!   Probably one of the better places when it comes to the breakfast burritos too. This place is a great little hole in the wall stop if you want some great Mexican food!  Only downfalls, it gets pretty congested in there when it's busy and the bathrooms are a little neglected. But that won't stop me from eating here, usually at least once a week for the last two years.  Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I love the interior wall paintings. Great service, food are super flavorful and so fresh!!! I usually have beef tongue and asadas beef tacos. SO GOOD!!!!"}
{"text":"Newbie to the Elliot / 48th Street area...so on a whim decided to check out Los Taquitos. I played it simple and ordered the #1, which is 3 street tacos with beans and rice. Took it home and mowed, I repeat, MOWED it down! I got one chicken taco and two carne asada and they were equally delicious. The refried beans and rice were fresh and authentic and, lucky for me, served together in a separate container, which made mixing them extremely easy.   My only complaint is that I loathe all varieties of onions, especially finely chopped red onions. So I specifically requested no onions, then I made the mistake of not checking before bolting out the door. Of course, since I got my tacos to go, once I got home I found finely chopped onions on 'em. The kind that would take 3 days to pick out, so I just ate 'em. Still amazing!   There are a lot of cool little local eateries in this area and this one definitely ranks at the top for me. I'll be planning many return trips to sample some of the other things on their menu."}
{"text":"The best food and timely order processing.  Wish they had more space. Priced just right for what you get.  Sauce is in bottles so you can add what you want when you want it."}
{"text":"This review is for Taco Tuesday: $1 tacos for chicken, pastor, or carnitas.  The chicken was a little overly spicy and inconsistent (and I like heat) but the carnitas tacos were perfect.  Served on soft tortillas, rice and beans each cost $1.69 + tax extra.  Would return for the tasty tacos but would call ahead next time and skip the line OR order a ($4) margarita for while i wait for my order."}
{"text":"Very clean and welcoming restaurant.  I ordered the flautas, street tacos, tamales and chips and salsa (pico).  The flautas were a little over cooked for my taste but everything else was pretty good.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Tried the Carne Asada Torta, it was excellent ! Taco's were great and although I cant remember what the kids had, I know they enjoyed it. The family has been back a few times without me since our first visit. Looks like it's going to be one of our regular stops from now on."}
{"text":"So me and the kids stop here on a layover.  I should have read the previous reviews.  You know you are in financial trouble when a cheese quesadilla is $7.39.  My daughter gets street tacos, conveniently made from tortillas the size of a hockey puck.  I have a burrito that is 80% refried beans and tortilla.  Spanish rice is dry and flavorless.  Aforementioned refritos are a watery paste, seemingly acquired from the same taste factory as the rice.  Lady calling the orders as ready appears to have been a voice actor in the upcoming \"Unintelligible Helium Chihuahua Power Rangers\" release.  The tortillas are decent, but everything else was a bust."}
{"text":"The service was very friendly but this is just fast food Mexican.  I think the quality of the food is good but it isn't exceptional.  I found the place perfectly clean.  My daughter loved her tacos and I had the enchiladas that were very good but nothing to write home about.  The pico was very good and the guacamole was average--but you can't expect more given the fast food nature of the place.  Come here for good food at a reasonable price but don't expect this to be Los Dos Molinos."}
{"text":"I was in the mood for some rice and beans and instead of feeding my terrible Panda Express addiction I decided to stroll on over to Los Taquitos.   Now I was there for lunch time so as much as I wanted to plop right down at the bar, that's apparently not socially acceptable. I got a carne asada burrito and a couple tacos.   The tacos were pretty great. Full of meat with onions, cilantro and salsa like they should be. The al pastor was particularly flavorful. The burrito itself was very good, the meat was tender and delicious.   The rice however was bad. It was old and crunchy. Fairly disappointing.  Be warned, even small amounts of people tend to jam up the flow of the restaurant. When I was there there was a single cashier who not only took order but also received them from the window. Be aware if you want to go at peak hours."}
{"text":"Best food around in my opinion. Gets busy around lunch so be prepared. Easy to call in and pick it up."}
{"text":"As so many others, I found this place because of Guy on triple d. The room mate and I made the drive down one afternoon for some lunch hoping that the experience would make the 30 minute drive worth it. I was kind of surprised when we pulled up. From the outside it wasn't quite what I was expecting. The place is located in a strip mall and nothing really makes it stand out from the road...but figured maybe all the awesome was on the inside.   We get inside and there are quite a few people. There aren't too many tables and almost all of them were taken. I grabbed the only one available that someone had been recently sitting at and just cleared some of the mess left on the table away. I stepped up to the counter and placed my order for a chicken chimi. It ended up taking a bit longer than I would have expected, but when the food came out it was pretty good. Let me say this now, I'm comparing this place to the Filabertos and Rudolphos and etc. With that in mind, this place is great. The flavor of the chicken is unlike any you would find at those other locations I mentioned. If you compare it to that of items found at other diamonds in the rough, I think it falls short. It is for that reason I give this place 3 stars. If I lived closer to this place I'd eat here on a regular basis I'm sure since the food is not at all bad and the prices are worth it, however I'm not sure why this place ended up getting a spot on triple d."}
{"text":"BEST BREAKFAST BURRITOS EVER!!! I have been on the quest to find the best breakfast burrito in all of Phoenix, and no restaurant has ever come close!! And I should know because I'm Mexican. I just know these things, OK???"}
{"text":"The best salsa in metro Phoenix! I've been coming here for years. I always order the carne asada burrito but if the the rest of the menu is half as good...you're in for a treat! This place is simply good!"}
{"text":"Tastey, but chicken was a little dry.  The red sauce was very good as were the carne tacos.  Like they serve alcohol and beer."}
{"text":"Stopped at the location based on Triple D recommendation. Tacos are good. I would recommend the food."}
{"text":"This place is a real gem! AMAZING Mexican food at a very good price. Not a sit down place with servers...you order and can eat there or take it home. Very clean and well run with great service.  I had the shrimp burrito, rice and beans and it was amazing. Very flavorful with fresh shrimp and excellent beans and rice. My wife had a salad, also with shrimp and loved her meal.  The street tacos are a great way to start your meal.   This is a must if you want great food at a good price."}
{"text":"I saw the DDD spot a few years ago and wanted to check this place out more for the sisters who own it than the food itself.  After eating there, the food stands on it's own.  In Phoenix, I don't think you can get better carne asada.  If you like breakfast burritos, you haven't had one until you've had their carne asada breakfast burrito with potatoes, eggs and cheese.  Fantastic.  I work around the corner, and eat here at least twice a month for that reason."}
{"text":"Excellent! No complaints! Had a rough day and wanted good food and good libation! Found it all in one place! Going back today! Might try something new but the chicken quesadillas are a winner! I wish the rice had a dash of more seasoning but other than that it was pretty good! My kids are picky eaters and they loved it so that says something! Go head give it a try!"}
{"text":"Los Taquitos is absolutely amazing, I ordered myself a carne asada burrito and the service was prompt,and on time, and the food itself was delicious!  I savored every morsel of food and I had a Coke to drink but again they are prompt and on time and amazing friendly staff! The facility was clean spic and span, it was a gorgeous setting, friendly setting, a very social setting. I would recommend this to any of my friends who love Mexican food."}
{"text":"Freshly remodeled, yippee! Burritos, tacos, and beer my! The food and services is GREAT!"}
{"text":"Let me just preface by saying I HATE leaving bad reviews. I feel bad doing it. However, this place warrants it. I called in my order on taco Tuesday and was informed it would be 30 min before it was ready. No problem, I understand. I put in two orders, but the person on the phone couldn't give me our totals because she was in the back room. Ok again, no harm done. When we got there only one order was ready. One of the women behind the counter was unfriendly the other just seemed disheveled. My 4 taco order was mashed into a tiny paper bag (why not a plate?) 3 tacos in one aluminum foil (?!). The communication about the second order was lacking, but after asking a couple times we were told the unfriendly one would put it together right now. As for the taste- I'd put it at a 2. The tortillas had an strange sour taste, the shrimp was overcooked, and the beans were just odd. I was going to eat them anyway, but I found two pieces of something I can't define in there. Looked like small worms though I'm hoping they're not. Straight to the trash. Tacos were eaten reluctantly. This place ought to shape up because the whole experience was no good."}
{"text":"We have been coming here for many years, and I think since it has gotten bigger it has gone a bit downhill as far as customer service. We almost always modify our orders, and although they have no problem charging us for it, I don't believe they have gotten the order right once in the past two years. If we ask for the food to be redone, it can be another half hour because they don't make a priority for what they screw up. The food is not consistent in quality, either.  The new, larger seating area is nice.  Some of the staff/owners who work the front are nice, and some are downright rude. They rarely clean the tables all day so bring extra napkins.  The restaurant is very close to where we live, but we have recently been discussing that we need to start going somewhere else."}
{"text":"These are the best tacos I've had in The metro area. Even better than the mexican franchise \"el taco tote\".   Their horchata, tamarind and jamaica drinks taste just like the ones in Mexico."}
{"text":"A west valley Mexican favorite of ours, for sure!  They have recently expanded and updated and it looks great.  The asada street tacos are incredible!  Flavorful, juicy, spicy... everything you want a taco to be!"}
{"text":"3 1/2 would be more accurate. Decent food, unhappy wait staff. Been here 3 times and every time no one seems happy to be there. Bummer because they could be a lot more popular. Hash Kitchens going to hurt them when they open."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! The shrimp burrito is out of this world. Rice and beans  cooked perfectly  and flavorful.  Everything I've tried has not disappointed. Prices are fair. Portions are great. Service is friendly enough. Decor is ok but you're not there for the ambience. The food is what sets this place apart."}
{"text":"It was pretty tasty and the prices were good. We called in our order, walked in and payed. Then waited 20 minutes until I asked where was our food. They handed me a bag that was sitting behind them the whole time so our food was now cold and not as fresh. Service is were they lacked."}
{"text":"We received a tip from a local and arrived at 12:30 PM on Taco Tuesday.  What a fiasco!  The food here is terrible. To keep it simple we ordered two enchiladas, one beef, and one cheese. They appeared in a watery sauce with zero flavor, The cheese taste was not discernable, there was almost no cheese surrounded by a light pink tortilla. Easily the worst cheese enchilada ever for me.     The beef enchilada was worse. Almost no meat, certainly not the typical ground picadillo you expect in a beef enchilada. The tortilla was like rubber, it could not be cut with a fork.      The chicken taco (Street) was a tiny piece of corn tortilla covered wth rabbit turd size pieces of overdone chicken.    The chicken bowl was full of rice and black beans, chicken pieces, pico de gallo, cheese, and cilantro and for $8 was a decent meal.    There were not enough seats for everybody so lots of patrons had to stand. It took 20 minutes to pick up our order.    The curse of DDD is alive and well in Phoenix."}
{"text":"I was having a bad Saturday until I stumbled on this gem. It's tough for me to find Mexican I'm impressed with. This place changed all that. I like to gauge Mexican food spots off their salsas and sauces/marinades. If you can pull off a spicy hot but super flavorful sauce/salsa then you're a pretty legit spot. I ordered the Bombero burrito with chicken. I died and went to pepper heaven. It can only be described as the perfect smoky, spicy, almost mole style salsa on a burrito. I dipped every bite in more of the sauce pooled on my plate and when I was done with that, I went back to the register and ordered an entire extra side of the sauce. 10 out of 10 will eat here again. I want to put that salsa on everything."}
{"text":"Street tacos are great, and so are the street nachos.I went with my husband not knowing what to expect and to be honest I almost left it was full on a Sunday afternoon no tables available a lot of people standing. Decided to stay after a few minutes found an empty table place our order and sat down, we received our order about 20 minutes later.It was worth the wait. When you go be aware that you will be there for sometime so enjoy a beer or margarita while you wait"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon Los Taquitos while staying at a hotel nearby, not realizing it was a local favorite. Delicious tacos! Carne asada was super flavorful and the sauce was spicy and delicious. Chips and salsa was good, not great, but it was a great meal none the less. Very cute interior and the staff was friendly too."}
{"text":"This place has the best pastor tacos I've ever had. The food is flavorful and not fatty. The beans are great, too. This is the best place for street tacos!"}
{"text":"Stopped here for the 1st time. Got the asada quesadilla with rice and beans. Food was good and staff was nice. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Carne asada tacos were really, really good.  Also tried pastor and carnitas which were also tasty but on par with other local street tacos.  Final item we had was smothered red chile beef, which was delicious and flavorful, but would have gone great with some beans... I'm a bit miffed they messed up my order and didn't give me the meal, but I guess it's on me for not complaining.  Service was mediocre and a bit slow, so didn't want to bother.  I really wish this place had some desserts instead of a bar.  But overall was good and will go back to try the carne asada again, next time in a burrito."}
{"text":"After seeing this on DDD with Guy Fieri, I had to check it out. It's in a grocery store strip mall, almost hidden from view. Inside, it's a typical hole in the wall fast casual place. You order at the counter and sit down until they call your number.   Although it may not be impressive in appearance or from the outside, the food is absolutely amazing. Some of the best Mexican food I've ever had.  I had their signature Bombero burrito. It had carne asada, beans, and veggies, with a nice hot sauce on the outside. The carne asada was so lean and melted in my mouth. It was extremely spicy, which I love. The tortillas are homemade, and you can certainly taste the quality they put into their product. I also had homemade chips and their excellent salad with my burrito. And it's also served with some of the best refried beans north of the border.  Guy Fieri definitely nailed it by featuring this place on his show!!!"}
{"text":"Great food. Authentic rice and beans. To my latinos out there. You know what I'm talking about. I had the carne asada tacos and they are really good. 5 start cause this place is way better than a chipotle or the \"beto's\" franchises."}
{"text":"Carne Asada tacos were the best I've had.  Shockingly low prices."}
{"text":"Delicious street tacos. $1 Taco Tuesday special. Clean and bright modern space with great murals on the walls."}
{"text":"Dollar street tacos on Taco Tuesday that are highly recommendable. Tuesday gets crazy in here during lunchtime and dinner to 8:30. More flavors used to be offered (like marinated chicken) but now it's limited to chicken, al pastor and carnitas.  Burritos are also very good but avoid chips and salsa as the chips are almost always overcooked and not worth the price. Plenty of parking too and like the Chandler location, both are a short distance from the highway exits."}
{"text":"Yay for $1 taco Tuesdays! These tacos are great. Pastor are the best, my daughters always get the burritos and they are good sized. Place is cute, clean and has beer :)"}
{"text":"On recommendation from food network I came here and had tacos:  carne asada, and marinated pork and carnitas pork.  The tacos were the best ice ever eaten anywhere.  If I could explain the absolute explosion of flavor in my mouth in a word, it would be inappropiate for children... They are that good!   I also got a tamale that was a little dry unfortunately but I'll give them a pass on it.   I have a Arizona carne asada burrito waiting for later.  The girl at the counter said they are even better if you take them home and eat them later.   Outside watching people coming is comical.   Customers walk toward this place with such intent in their step as if the food were about to run out!  They scan to the sides eyeing up other people also making a bee line to the door and you can see them speed up...  I mean it is that good.  I'm from Baltimore and here in Phoenix looking for the best tacos... I beleieve I've scored!"}
{"text":"Great food, nice people and mediocre service. I enjoy this place often!"}
{"text":"This was a delicious simple Mexican short order shop.  I had the az burrito and was surprised at the number of ingredients it had.  My son had the quesadilla.  Horchata had a unique flavor to it the was interesting.  Meal came to $16.  Plus Guy ate here!"}
{"text":"How do you improve on perfection? I don't know, but the last two times I had my fix of a marinated pork burrito it seemed even better than before. It's time to ignore the cramped quarters and give Los Taquitos the five stars it deserves. The marinated pork just might be the single best Mexican dish in this town!"}
{"text":"I heard good things about this place but found it to be BLAH.  We ordered rolled flautas - both chicken and beef - over cooked and not tasty. The cheese enchilada plate was okay. The fish tacos were horrible. The beans and rice were \"meh\". Skip this place and go somewhere else. Disappointing."}
{"text":"We ordered steak tacos and a pork quesadilla. The taco meat was absolutely awesome and tender very juicy and the perfect amount of spiciness to them. Quesadilla very good with a great taste to it."}
{"text":"This is my new lunchtime spot after seeing it on Food channel triple D. this is a second place they have.  Good food nice people."}
{"text":"I don't know if Los Taquitos qualifies as a \"dive\". It's more like a fast food joint for authentic Mexican food. I mean, is in Ahwatukee, in the middle of a suburb, between a Safeway and a Walgreen's. Maybe compared to other restaurants in the area it is a dive I guess.....It's just that to me, a dive is kind of sleazy, maybe not in the best part of town and you feel a little dirty when you get out of there, and that can be good or bad (depending on what good of a time you had) Anyway, went there to try it as is 5 minutes away from me. Like others mentioned, it's a small place. I went Saturday night, people were coming in and out picking their food and some were eating there. I was too hungry to do take out so I ate in. Ordered a chicken hard taco, pork soft taco and carne asada sopes. Food took a while, which surprised me as they weren't really busy, but it was probably because it's made to order. My food was hot and steamy when I got it and it was goooooood!! Should have ordered more, my favorite was the sopes and carne asada. The salsas were flavorful and while I usually prefer red, I liked their green salsa better.  Service was prompt, the young women that worked that night were very nice.  I'm glad they're close to us, as we'll visit often."}
{"text":"Los Taquitos has amazing food. I have had everything from tacos to burritos (regular and breakfast) to the homemade menudo and pozole. Everything is great! Great prices and even greater service. The girls who work the cashier are always willing to help you out with suggestions or even accommodate dietary/ allergy needs."}
{"text":"The tacos were amazing and service was friendly. The street tacos are some of the closest to authentic Mexican tacos that I have found in the valley - and I have spent months in Mexico. I ended up with 6 tasty tacos; sample them all if you can!  Prices and food quality makes this a 5 star place."}
{"text":"Was super frustrated. My husband ordered food at 8:30pm and didn't get it until 9:20pm. Are you kidding me?!?!? Even if the place was packed it should never take that long. People came in after him and placed orders and got their food before him. We had a simple order, beans, 3 carne tacos and a bag of chips. Once he got the food he still didn't get an apology or explanation at all. My husband is not one to cause a scene but I'm beyond upset with this experience."}
{"text":"This was a great hole in the wall Mexican restaurant. The pollo soft tacos I had very good and the emphasis was on the quality of the food, not the presentation    Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"I'm so sad I had to remove this place from our rotation  of weekly take out. For some insane reason they changed their carne asada...they added some seasoning or sauce or some kind of flavor to it and it's  disgusting. I couldn't even eat it. I understand there might be those who like a barbacoa flavor but don't put that crap on my carne asada! I'm so upset."}
{"text":"I have been to both locations in our area (this one and the one on Ray by the 101) both have excellent costumer service. Very friendly ladies at the front who answer all your questions and seem happy to see you there as their customer. The inside of both locations is very nice, hip, modern, and comfortable. The food: carne asada is delicious! I also like that they do not use lard in their beans. Highly recommend and we go about twice a month."}
{"text":"This was my 1st time trying this place out. I'm born and raised in Mexico and was excited to see some of the menu items like Pozole, Menudo or Chiles Rellenos. Since Pozole can be made in so many ways I told the lady at the front desk that it was my 1st time there (she didn't even say welcome or glad you are here) and wanted to try the Pozole before ordering it, if she was able to give me a sample of it in a small cup (the ones they use for the salsas to go)  she said NO, we can't do that. It started off bad, so I decided not to order that and went for the \"safe side\" 5 different tacos (Carne Asada, Chicken, Pastor, Shrimp and Tongue) the only one that was pretty good was the Tongue one (it had the traditional flavor). Salsas are less than o.k. Carne Asada was dry, Shrimp didn't have ANY flavor at all. It didn't come with limes my plate so I needed to ask for that. They need to step up their Customer Service and maybe their flavor profiles. Not coming back, if the tacos weren't good probably pozole wasn't either BUT can't say since they couldn't even give me a sip of it :( sad so sad..."}
{"text":"I loved this place! Good food, casual environment, and nice prices. I had the special and enjoyed every bite. The salsa was nice, and my dad loved his tostada. Great for lunch or a casual dinner."}
{"text":"I needed a lot of food for my companies luncheon, and in a short notice but they pulled it off for me.  I know they'd like a bit of notice normally so I really appreciate what they did for me.  There was a tun of food, and it was fantastic, we had so many compliments, and no complaints from our guys here, and that is saying something.  I didn't see a catering menu online but they can do it.  The food really was wonderful and they gave us all the appropriate utensils, plates, and toppings galore.  Thanks Los Taquitos, we will definitely be ordering from you guys again!"}
{"text":"The remodel is so nice, really digging the modern look.   Been coming for breakfast burritos, and they have not let me down! A little pricey for a breakfast burrito, but very good and worth it.   Wait is also a little frustrating, but again, the burrito is very good."}
{"text":"Love los taquitos....real Mexican food...the rice does not have peas and carrots in it like a lot of the fake places...the Carne Asda and chicken tacos come with the double tortilla....AWESOME!!!!"}
{"text":"I freaking love this place! Their Arizona Burrito with chicken is amazing! My favorite little hole in the wall Mexican restaurant!"}
{"text":"I want to like this place, but three incorrect takeout orders leave me looking for another place close to home.  Asada not chorizo breakfast burritos, burnt chips, no salsa, missing flan (which was delicious when I went back for it the next day). Great pastor street tacos! Check your order before you leave. Especially when it's busy."}
{"text":"Mouthwaaaaatering! You can't go wrong with anything on the menu and they have awesome happy hour deals with $1 tacos- Carnitas, Chicken, and Pastor. Their beans are bomb & their Asada Nachos are great. Good drink specials too if that's your thing!"}
{"text":"Excellent gluten free options.  I enjoyed the street tacos.  The beef adobo was my favorite. Really tasty and good rice &beans. The chicken was good but I preferred the beef. They use tilapia for the fish, so I didn't have any.  The offer an green and red sauce both were spicy.  Excellent price less than $2 per street taco.  I had the combo with beans and rice.  Really cute decor.  The paintings are really colorful and fun.  I didn't have any but they serve margaritas etc   Our server Veronica was well Informed about gluten free options and was very helpful and friendly"}
{"text":"Probably the best Mexican fast-casual restaurant I have found so far in Phoenix. I too think the carne asada tortas (steak sandwich) are great. I also recommend ordering a torta with the refried beans in the sandwich.  They also have great soft tacos with carne asada or marinated pork. You will also find a few exotic plates like lengua (tongue) and barbacoa (beef from the cow's head).  Other pluses ... the two sisters that run the place are absolutely gorgeous. And it has a great atmosphere with Latin music playing in the background (not too loud either).  They will be featured on the Food Network in Diners, Drive-ins and Dives this upcoming season.  The only complaint I have is that their chile rellenos are average at best. Not a five star, but I have yet to rate a Mexican restaurant five stars in the Phoenix area."}
{"text":"We have been here several times and everything has been really good. Service is quick and friendly.  This is one of our \"go to\" places in the neighborhood for lunch and for dinner."}
{"text":"Still awesome after the remodel! Food is as good as ever. Now the seating area is larger and more spacious."}
{"text":"Came back to this place for breakfast and had to add a star to my review. Their breakfast burrito is delicious! So good with pico added in!"}
{"text":"Our food was very fresh and flavorful. I'm a vegetarian; the rest of my family is not. Everyone, including the kids, was happy with their dishes.  Delicious, inexpensive, quick. After a long day of travel, this place was perfect."}
{"text":"This place is amazing.  The food is truly authentic and offers a wide variety of good, home-style Mexican food.  Los Taquitos was featured on Diners, Drive-ins & Dives and is constantly busy.  My favorite dish they offer is the carne asada sopes; I also really enjoy the ceviche. However, they do cook up a mean breakfast burrito."}
{"text":"Well,  what can I say... this place sure has gone downhill. I ate here in the past and it was good. BUT NOT TONIGHT!  Ordered Chips/salsa, Chimichanga, ... all was BLAND and no flavor. Friend ordered: Pollo enchalada w/ beans and rice...same story Bland and old bean and rice.  ONLY THING I HAD THAT WAS GOOD WAS THE CORONA. LOL  I had to look around again to make sure I was in a mexican joint. I will def not be back. Over priced too.  I suggest u go anywhere else but here."}
{"text":"This visit was a long time coming. My husband has came home from work a few times saying he got the BEST street tacos for $1 each on taco Tuesdays for lunch. So as we're starving on a Friday night deciding what is for dinner, what a great time to try those amazing tacos I have been hearing so much about.   Once you walk in, it's a small restaurant with tables, a small bar, and a little patio. You walk up to order and then they call your number when it's ready. So great place for a quick Mexican dinner or take-out. No salsa bar and no sit down service.   When we first walked in, the girl at register Elisa, just stared at us so we began to order and she just said \"ok, what else?\" No welcome, no have you been here before, no how may I help you.... Frankly she had no personality and may have been the most miserable person I have ever met. Cheer up buttercup! My husband was surprised because all the other ladies previously have been very nice to him.   So erasing the first impression the lady at the register gave me, I moved on to the food with a clean slate. I got the 3 street taco combo with 1 carnitas, 1 carne asada, and 1 el pastor. They were all super good! All the meat was very  juicy and flavorful. The El Pastor was my favorite! Very good with so much flavorful. The carnitas was my second favorite. I added sour cream and their green sauce which made it over the top good. The rice and beans were simple but good.   Overall I'm hoping the service is normally better but the food was really good and came out quick. I will be back for more and recommend to others."}
{"text":"This is my go to for Taco Tuesdays! Chicken, Carnitas, or Al Pastor tacos for $1.00 each. I go with 3 Al Pastor tacos w/Mexican Coke for $5.00. Hits the spot!"}
{"text":"It was all right. I really can't say anything, to be honest. It's not quite a 3 star, but it's not even really a 2. Service was nice and the people were nice, but the food was a bit...\"eh.\"  Nothing to write home about. Prices were nice and cheap.  I'll shell out a few more bucks and hit Rosa's. It's more flavorful. While LT has a decent kick, the flavor is a bit ho hum.  The tortillas were nice and fresh...that was the best part of the meal. I had ordered the carne asada burrito. It wasn't spiced as much as I thought it would be. Maybe they were hoping the sauce that was in it would make up for the bland spicing.  The sauce had a small bit of kick and was all right. The carnitas tacos were a bit of a let down...the meat was dry, but the salsa was all right.  If you're looking for fast and easy, this is it. If you want food brought to you and you can relax, I'd suggest going to a sit down restaurant.  This had too much of a fast food feel for my taste."}
{"text":"We very much enjoyed the street tacos, finding the portion to be satisfactory and the ingredients to be fresh.  The burrito bowl was excellent, but lacks lettuce if you like it.  I hold 1 star back because the rice and beans are a bit too heavily salted.  The staff is friendly and the restrooms are clean."}
{"text":"Just left here and I was so impressed I just had to write a review. First their prices are beyond reasonable. I had a blood orange margarita that was excellent. Not too sweet,  not too sour, it was perfect. Chilaquiles was so good. Everything tastes like Nana made it.  Horchata came out of a big agua fresca container dished out with a ladle like it should be. Place is legit. $1 taco tues! Clean and super cute dia de los muertos style decor. Love this place! This will be our new fave for sure."}
{"text":"Have been eating here since Guy Fieri had it on his show, Diners Drive-ins and Dives, but have failed to Review this extraordinary little place, only a mile from my home. Maybe subconsciously I wanted to keep it to myself. Of course, with over 200 Reviews here they do NOT need mine, unless you want to know a secret.  THE SECRET: Having fallen in love with Tacos Pastor (and Mexican Coca Cola) at Asadero Norte De Sonora   (See my Previous Review) three visits ago I asked if they served Tacos Pastor (they are NOT on the menu) and one of the beautiful sisters advised that they did indeed. Oh my word! Nirvana, so close to home (Asadero Norte De Sonora is ten miles away). I knew I would be in trouble.  They are little (The Tacos) here, but have three or four and you will think you are in Heaven. The morsels of Pork are just right spicy and absolutely delicious! Wash them down with Coca Cola from Mexico and call it FABULOUS!   Prior to discovering Tacos Pastor I hade been VERY happy with the Carne Asada Tacos and as good as they are, NOT close to Tacos Pastor!  Do NOT miss this wonderful treat!"}
{"text":"I have been coming to the location on Glendale and 16th for a few years but I was originally introduced from the ahwahatukee (spellcheck ) location! Today I devoured the carne asada burrito, which tasted Fantastic! The spices and flavors of the meat are like no other and the flour tortillas have the natural textures of tortillas from Mexico . The house margarita had natural lemon juice mixed with the house tequila. This must have been one of the strongest margaritas I have had from any Mexican concept establishment and I did not complain one bit !"}
{"text":"Came here because my husband and I were looking for a really good taco shop in the area. We are used to San Diego tacos so we hoped AZ could measure up to CA shops. This place DEFINITELY measured up.   Nice and clean dining area, friendly staff and yummy food. I got the AZ style Carne asada burrito. Which was pretty much guacamole, rice and beans inside the burrito. Didn't make sense but it was deeeeeeelicious.  My hubby had a Carne asada taco and tostada.  They were super yummy! Their happy hour started at 4 pm so we ordered a beer and a house margarita. The margarita was strong and very tasty.   Apparently they have a good taco tuesday, I think $1 tacos or something.  Definitely coming back to check it out."}
{"text":"Didn't get a chance to have there food  But the 3 star is because I called to put in an order and was told it would be 45 minutes to complete the order  WTF  Ridiculous"}
{"text":"Should've checked Yelp.  Worst Mexican food I've had.  I had the carne asada burrito Arizona style.  The burrito was slightly warm.  Cheese was still in shreds and not melted.  The meat was bad and had no flavor.  Overall, it was terrible.  I will never eat here again even though the other options at the airport are bad as well."}
{"text":"I may have had too high of an expectation for this place due to the reviews & recommendations from the hotel. I felt this place was average nothing spatular about it.  I tried the carne asada, chicken & pastor street tacos. They all tasted great, but no better than any other place that serves street tacos. The beans had great flavor, but were so runny I had to eat them with a spoon because a fork made a big mess.  Rice was average.    I have been to several of Guy's stops & must say I have never been impressed & this place was no different.  I actually thought the ladies were rude who took my order & gave me my food.  There was no line when I got there around 1125, but by 1130 the line was out the door.  I noticed almost everyone ordered either soup or a burrito, so maybe I just order the wrong thing. If I lived here I would try it again and get a burrito next time, but I don't so my first impression is all I have.  It's worth a try if you are in the area, but I didn't think it was quite 4 stars."}
{"text":"Usually i'm thrilled with the service and the food here, but last two orders I made-- I got there I was told my pickup would be ready in 40 minutes --I got there at 50 minutes and food still was not ready and they said they were going to start it! I had to leave-- I'm understanding, yet they should be more professional and be honest if they are slammed and can't take phone orders. Very popular establishment, but not worth waiting for an hour for pickup that's promised after 40 min."}
{"text":"Viva Los Taquitos! Go to Los Taq for what they are - a walk-up restaurant with fun atmosphere, limited service and amazing food. Our favorites to grab and go: Chicken or Carne Asada burritos. Eating in: LOVE me some chicken tostada - the best I've had! Carne Torta is to die for either way, as is their Pico de Gallo! I've used Los Taq to cater too (pick up) and was thrilled with the experience. A note for those who are looking for the \"Cheers\" environment: My husband and i are there anywhere from 2-5 times per week. If the ladies at the counter don't know us, we simply take an interest in getting to know them! Nothing will come between me and my tostada!"}
{"text":"My fiance and family went to Los Taquitos the weekend after Thanksgiving this year.  This place is literally down the street from me and for some reason or another, I have never stopped on by.    Meal:  Our group had the chimichanga, ranchero eggs, enchiladas with eggs, and the chiliquetes.  We also added had the chips with salsa.  Taste:   The seasoning was nearly perfect unlike other Mexican places nearby (like the Original Burrito Company), the food was both spicy and tasty.  It seems like too often that places confuse \"spicy hot\" as being tasty and well seasoned, but these places don't have the expertise in making something incredibly hot and delicious . . . but Los Taquitos does have that expertise.  Their salsa, in my humble opinion, is the best I have had to date and its by no means typical.  It appears they take real pride in making their salsa special.  The only dig is that the chips were overcooked.  8 out of 10.  Value:  Portions were more than fair and reasonable.  In fact, I would describe it that if you ate til you were full, you have a some left over for a small snack left over.  4 out of 5.  Service/Cleanliness:  There is no waiter service, just a walk up counter.  The staff was mediocre.  They weren't rude or inept, but they sure weren't friendly.  It was sort of like a robot was taking our order.  7 out of 10.  Atmosphere:  The atmosphere is spot on of what you expect from a nice walk up taco and burrito place.  Nothing fancy, easy going, and great music.  The scenery is going to \"wow\" you but shouldn't district you from the entire experience.  3 out of 5.  Overall:  I have been to a handful of walk up taco and burrito places in the valley and Los Taquitos takes top prize.  This is the perfect place if you want some authentic, simple,  and fast Mexican food for lunch or after a night of drinking!  Its one of those places where you sneak away to treat yourself with an awesome plate of Mexican food.  22 out of 30 points, 3 out of 5 stars."}
{"text":"I can't even tell you how happy I was to see that Los Taquitos was finally opened in terminal 4 at Sky Harbor, so happy! I am a fan of their south Phoenix location.   So I checked out the menu board, didn't see anything that would catch my eye, but I was committed to giving them a try. I ordered a carne asada burrito and asked for extra salsa, even paid for it, order came out to 11 bucks, didn't even get a drink.  My order came out, let's start with the burrito, the tortilla was cold the meat had good flavor, but it was just carne & beans, that's it , no pico de gallo no guac, it was wrapped in a aluminum colored wrapping and came in a container with beans and rice, but the wrapped burrito was placed directly into the beans, so now that's a mess.    The beans were cool and so was the rice, it was like everything was made in a freezer house, oh and the extra salsa I had paid for, I had to ask for and the server gave a little tude because I question its whereabouts.  I was thrilled to see Los Taquitos was coming into the airport, but now that I have been, I can't say I will be back."}
{"text":"How is it possible that I have not written a review for Los Taquitos, it's been one of my favorite lunch spots for about a year now, need to get on the ball! Found out about Los Taquitos like most from Dinners, Drive-ins and Dives! I love me some spicy food, so of course I order the Bombero burrito, it has great favor, and to some it packs heats, but for me its lacking in the heat, I like to have that eyes tearing up, nose running cuz its packing heat experience, but it's a great tasting burrito, its smokey and perfect burrito, just add some hot sauce to it and BAM! got some heat! I also dig their street tacos, delish!  Little heads up if going during lunch, phone your order in, it cuts down on the wait time!"}
{"text":"Upon arriving at this restaurant, I came in with high hopes of great food but was quickly met with utter disappointment. The food was good, but nothing you couldn't get anywhere else. I'm a big fan of Mexican food and have lived around it my whole life. The thing that really bent me out of shape, was the God awful service I received. I was treated as if I was a pile of dirt coming in to buy a burrito, no greeting, no smile, simple questions were answered with disgust. I will never return."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Mexican restaurant's in the valley. Great food and a clean looking renovation.  Just be prepared to wait a while till you get served. The place is set up like a fast food joint but it is deceiving. Even when there are not many people waiting the food can take too long. But, for me, it's worth the wait.  Make sure you get the marinated pork tacos. They are selicious  (seriously delicious). All the meat is cooked amazingly so I can't imagine anything being disappointing. The ceviche was suprisingly fresh and tastey too. 2 words... the green sauce is a great addition to any meal here."}
{"text":"Awesome tacos and breakfast! Everything is full of flavor and spice.  Love this spot!!"}
{"text":"While visiting from LA my wife and I yelped this place and decided to give it a try. I usually judge a Mexican restaurant by it's salsa because there are only so many ways to make tacos. So with that said let me tell you, the red and green salsa were exploding with flavor and just the right amount of heat... The bomb!!!! I had carnitas tacos and the carnitas was probably the best I have ever had! The red salsa complemented the tacos without taking away from the flavor of the meat! I also had a cheese enchilada and the enchilada was just as good as the tacos...very authentic!!!! We have a lot of good taco joints back in Los Angeles but Los Taquitos was soooo good I tried to talk my wife into moving to Pheonix."}
{"text":"Best Al Pastor tacos I have ever had! I have yet to have had a bad meal there. You can tell their refried beans are made from scratch and their green salsa is killer."}
{"text":"Major disappointment for a vegetarians.  When I saw a specific \"veggie\" taco/burrito on the menu, I knew I had to try the place out. Plus the prices were so great, that what could go wrong?  I had one Veggie Street Taco and one Cheese Enchilada with verde sauce. My taco was suppose to be topped with onions, cliantro and salsa - didn't happen. The veggies consisted of onions, bell peppers and potatoes. Who puts regular potatoes in a taco?! My tortilla was dripping in oil, that I couldn't even eat it. The verde sauce on my enchilada was incredibly bland. Everything was meh to me.  Then I saw a sign for Taco Tuesday, $1 tacos! Talk about great price. BUT the real icing on the cake of this experience was that veggie tacos do not qualify for this special.   Overall, definitely won't return due to the lack of vegetarian options."}
{"text":"The manager contacted me to apologize about the problems with my orders.  I'll give them another shot because the food is delicious."}
{"text":"I'm from Oakland so my standard for Mexican food is pretty high.  I was pleased by quality of the tacos, the price, and the fact they had Negro Modelo in the beer selection.  I'm really glad I didn't realize they had flautas until after my meal--but there will be a next time!"}
{"text":"Tucked away in a corner in a small strip, your  typical glass enclosed fast food resto, Los Taquitos offers street tacos. We ordered 2 asada, 2 carnitas, 1 pastor, 1 fish, all street tacos. With drinks, 1 rice n beans, flan, it came to $22.Flavor was average; the sauce tasted the same for all the tacos. The carnitas had a lime flavor instead of the asada which threw me off as I'm used to having lime only with asada tacos. The meat were all soft n juicy. The flan was bland and the texture led me to believe it didn't have enough egg yolks - but it was obviously healthier for you. The asada is worth another try but that's it."}
{"text":"Amazing and delicious food. Probably one of the best Mexican food spots in the valley. The tacos definitely taste like the street tacos I used to get in LA. Great house margaritas. Very decent prices."}
{"text":"First time, it was very delicious! Love the street tacos (asada and carnitas) decoration is great"}
{"text":"I'm all about the local haunt, and this one being literally down the street from me, I had to give it a try.  The one thing that I LOVE about Los Taquitos is that in Arizona (where people mistakenly assume that the Mexican food is good no matter where you go), they are proving that a delicious plate of food doesn't have to come at a premium.  You could go down the street to Macayo's and get a meal for twice the price and half the flavor.  More than price, value is king these days, and Los Taquitos knows the drill.  I tend to judge the quality of a restaurant on the goodness of their machaca, and Los Taquitos does an excellent job for the low price point.  In their burritos, quesadillas and tamales, the meat is flavorful and moist.  I second the vote of others on the rice and beans being tasty - I particularly enjoyed the rice in its fluffy, flavorful goodness.  It didn't taste like an afterthought.  Spring for the side of guacamole - it's a welcome addition to the plate, particularly if you're sopping up the whole mess with a bag of chips.  My husband and I ate like kings and didn't even manage to kill a $20.  That's some real majesty.  We'll be back for seconds, I promise."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, nice people. Steak tacos are amazing!!! This location and the Ahwatukee location surpassed my expectations this week!"}
{"text":"Fantastic Flavor Taco Tuesdays!! ($1 each) --Chicken  --Carnitas (steak) --Pastor (pork) I agree w/other reviewers, Chicken is just okay.  But hey! Get em all!"}
{"text":"Very good food, and the service was fast!  I am a bit disappointed by the size of the meal...for as much as they're charging, I think portion sizes could be more generous."}
{"text":"I was looking forward to eating here but I won't be returning because I wasn't treated with respect. I'm probably at least twice the age and make more $ in one hour than she makes in an entire day, but for some reason the person who took my order felt it was appropriate to condescendingly refer to me as \"hon\" at the end of every single one of her sentences. And I'm visiting from California on vacation. Very disappointing experience!"}
{"text":"First time here.  Tried the Assad and Pastor tacos, very good.  I also had to try the shrimp ceviche tostada, it was also very good.  I will be back to continue to try all on the menu."}
{"text":"I expected more than I received. I checked this place out and made a point to before I went home in Phoenix. I saw this restaurant featured in one the television series so I took their word. I may give it another try if it is within my commute route. It was just ok."}
{"text":"best mexican lunch in town. just be prepared to wait in line."}
{"text":"I really wish the food was better here ... I always want to like it more than I actually do. I always feel that the food is mediocre at best - however, I don't eat pork, so that might change things as it seems like people really like their pork dishes. All that said, I have always found the staff friendly, the restaurant extremely clean, and the food made promptly and correctly.  Still, there is a lot of bad Mexican food around, so for the price, staff, and cleanliness, I keep going back (just have to mentally lower the bar a little)."}
{"text":"I used to really like this place but the consistency of food quality has gone down hill recently. My last two visits I ordered an asada burrtio to go and when I got home it was literally dripping grease. gross..."}
{"text":"High quality ingredients, super prep, crisp & clean decor, all for traditional Mexican tacos, burritos, tamales, and tortas.  Stellar, I would eat there again and again."}
{"text":"One of my family's favorite places to go! The food is always amazing, and there's no wrong way to eat their burritos."}
{"text":"Food is good but bad service. The cashier barked questions and kept sighing when I was ordering. It wasn't busy. I was the only person in line and the airport was slow so there were only 2 people sitting down in the area. I asked if they have Dr. Pepper and instead of answering my question she just put a cup on the counter. Okay. Went over to the drink dispenser and you can choose from tea, lemonade, Pepsi and Mountain Dew. Why not just tell me you don't have coke products so I didn't waste another $4 on something I don't want to drink? So uncomfy."}
{"text":"Excellent huevos rancheros! Had beef lengua there also, awesome food. Located in the Ahwatukee (Phoenix) area. Best Mexican food in the area"}
{"text":"There is no organization behind the counter, no sense of urgency to get food out to people in a hurry. Food is average at best. Got a bean and cheese burrito which was horrible, ice cold, and pretty much all tortilla."}
{"text":"We were by spectrum mall and wanted to grab a bite, my wife found this place not too far down the road and was craving posole- so we tried it out. I wasnt hungry but after seeing someone receiving their breakfast quesadilla, I had to try something. I chose the breakfast torta, scrambles eggs, chorizo beans and avacado- a few of my favorite things. My son got the regular quesadilla and my wife got her posole. We had to pay extra for the chips but the salsa's made it worth it- the green was my favorite but the red was better than most restaurants we visit- we didnt touch the chunky as it seemed to have too many onions for my taste. The Torta bread wasn't very thick, but I am not a big fan of huge bread slices- it was toasted nicely with butter and although I couldnt taste the beans- it had a nice combination of the ingredients. My wife's posole was tasty but didnt have much corn and she left unsatisfied as that is her favorite part, my son had a side of beans he layered on his quesadilla and what he didnt finish I helped out with.   Good food, I would definitely come back, hopefully hungrier so that I could trr the shrimp burrito or enchiladas with an egg on top."}
{"text":"It's better than Taco Bell. But that's about it. Fast food, indifferent service.  Tastes good (not great), and I think it's fresh.  Drinks came about 5 minutes after the food."}
{"text":"Went here for tacos this weekend. The food is amazing!!!! However, the line is not. I waited twenty minutes for eight tacos. Not an exaggeration. Twenty. Minutes. While I can't stand the wait, I still keep coming back because the food can't be beat.  Way to go Los Taquitos!"}
{"text":"Lovely family owned restaurant. This is my second visit in 2 weeks. My daughter introduced me last week and I was highly impressed with the customer service and the food. Green chili tacos, yummy! Unfortunately today was not a good experience. Girl (SHORTEST of all behind the counter with all black hair and braces) offered no hellos as we approached. My daughter greeted her but she struggled with a response. Seemed unhappy to be working yet greeted customers behind us. Customer service brings people back. Makes people talk about your restaurant. Also, my green chile tacos had no green chile sauce on it. I was sadly disappointed! I will think hard about returning."}
{"text":"Really good. It's convenience eating- order at the counter, get your drink, sit at a table. But the food is good and reasonably priced. Plus, they have posole, which I don't find a lot in Arizona. Good stuff."}
{"text":"This place is great! Nothing else to say...simple, reasonably priced, great tasting food!!!"}
{"text":"Same great and a nicely updated dining area. Unfortunately the increased size has increased the wait. As much as I really ike Los taquitos the extended wait (18 min.) Is not worth it.  Hopefully they can work the throughput issue in the kitchen. I will monitor reviews and look for improvement."}
{"text":"This place is a dump.  I ordered a burrito bowl.  It was thrown together very sloppy and was like warm.  The trash cans are overflowing and there is salsa spilled everywhere.  An employee came out and emptied the trash finally yet let all of the spilled salsa.  Talk about lazy.  I advice you go somewhere else to eat at the airport."}
{"text":"Just in from San Diego staying at a hotel near by. Yelped for places to eat close by and found this one which read it was on Diners Drive In's and Dives..I'm a big fan of the show so I considered myself lucky to find one just down the street.  Walked in and the women at the cash register was quick to help me with the menu being I never been there. I asked what's the most popular and she said ..everything. .but if you like spicy. .then you can try the bombero burrito. So I ordered the bombero burrito with Carne asada. The Carne Asada melts in your mouth and the diced raw jalapeños in the burrito was a nice touch too. Beans and rice were great. However,  wasn't a big fan of the sauce on top..spicy I liked,  but not the sweetness.  Oh and the women at the register helping me; was as Hot as the burrito! Gorgeous!!!"}
{"text":"Recently moved near Los Taquitos and stopped by and picked up some tacos and posole for lunch both of which were very good! I'll definitely be back for more of both!"}
{"text":"Worst ever!  No meat in my torta and a angry customer just left complaining loudly about finding stones in his rice. These \"restaurants\" at airports take advantage of hungry and tired travelers."}
{"text":"We came across Los Taquitos at the Taco Festival in Scottsdale a few years back and been going there ever since. The staff is always friendly, the place is clean and the prices cannot be beat!  My favorite is the carne asada tacos (Mexican street tacos) and they are 1.15 a piece, you cannot beat that! Definitely worth a try, you will not be disappointed. :)"}
{"text":"Best menudo from a restaurant, burritos are amazing. . . The entire menu is delicious"}
{"text":"Amazing. Great food. Great service. Yummy. Has become my new favorite place. I can't wait to try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"This was a great place for me to travel too since I have no vehicle and was skeptical since I'm not from the area. The food was ridiculously good but better be sure to ask for no hot sauce because I'm still sweating!! All In all I would come back AUTHENTIC"}
{"text":"I first walked in and there was nobody there, I caught a glimpse of someone in the back. Since I wasn't sure what I wanted, I didn't mind waiting. I settled on carne asada tacos and 1 fish taco. When the girl finally appeared, she took my order and I handed her my credit card. As she swiped it, she started talking to the girl behind me. I signed my reciept, assumed that was it and walked away to wait.  Carne Asada Street Tacos: They were good, the tortillas were nice and hot. Plentiful of meat. But I've had better...from a food truck no less. The green salsa I found was good but not spicy.  Fish Street Taco: The fish was great in flavor, from the little piece that was given to me. I had to remove half the cabbage before taking a bite. It seemed they were making up for the lack of fish with cabbage.  The bar area was really nice, it looked almost like a club. Flat screen was playing golf.  Regardless, I wouldn't be returning here."}
{"text":"Delicious food, great service very clean!  Everything we tried was delicious taste like home made. Will be coming back soon to try more of the menu."}
{"text":"I have a love/hate relationship with Los Taquitos.  I love Los Taquitos so much, it pisses me off.    Lately, i've been craving cheap street tacos and I've been visiting this mofo at least three times a week for the past month now.  Seriously.  There's always this female cashier there and you would think she remembers me, but she doesn't acknowledge me at all.    Let me tell you the story of this weekend.  It all started when I craved cheap street tacos again and headed over to Los Taquitos.  Two girls at the register - one was the regular who didn't acknowledge.  The other takes my order.  I give her my credit card and they have a problem with their credit card machine so they tell me to wait. Five minutes goes by, 10 minutes go by, 15 minutes go by...the two are so frustrated with this register and they are telling other customers that the machine is broken.  I notice that my to-go order is ready and my food is getting cold while I wait.  I am getting annoyed...so annoyed.  I had no cash to pay for my food, just a credit card.  20 minutes go by and I tell them to \"forget it\" and I leave to drive a few blocks to Urban Taco, which I've never been before.  The place is cute and then I order similar to my Los Taquitos order - street tacos.  I wait and I get my check -Holy Hell!  They charged me DOUBLE the price I would of paid at Los Taquitos.    I get to my destination and my mouth is salivating because I am so hungry and already annoyed about the Los Taquitos experience.  I take one bite and I was NOT happy!  It was dry, no flavor, and meh.    Even though I ate all of my food because I was starving, I got more pissed at Los Taquitos because I now crave them more! I hope they fixed their credit card machine and acknowledge me the next time I stop by."}
{"text":"Best damn food ever and the margaritas! Went back for seconds! Guy Fieri loves the place even!"}
{"text":"Aside from the fact that I specifically asked for cheese in my burrito and did not receive it, it was pretty good. The girls working there were super sweet and the service was fast. I got a carne asada burrito and will say that it was tasty. It had a good portion of meat, beans, and rice (except no cheese..arrrgggghhhh HULK SMASSSHHH!!!!!) and the cilantro and onions complimented the burrito.   They could do with a bit less salt on their meat  and perhaps the burritos could be a bit bigger (then again I eat like a 400 pound man so I can't judge small portions.)  I will definitely be returning there again in hopes of getting cheese to go into my burrito. Would recommend this place as a good lunch spot :)"}
{"text":"First time here,very clean, staff was really nice, but didn't know what to order. The girl recommended veggie tacos. I wouldn't have ordered those on my own but her description sounded really good! They were amazing! I'm a meat kinda girl bit would definitely order the veggie tacos again! My daughter got the carnitas tacos which were amazing too! Will definitely recommend and come back again!"}
{"text":"I'm from California where there is a Mexican food joint on every corner and when I first moved to Phoenix a year ago I've been on the hunt for a legit Mexican food place, not a Filiberto's or Macaios :P. Living in Ahwatukee, the only legit places I was able to find up until a month ago was in central/downtown Phoenix (Rosito's and La Canasta). As much as I love those two places, the drive sucks! After all this is Phoenix, there has to be a good place right by me!  Finally, I was advised to go to Los Taquitos from a friend of mine saying they have BOMB carne asada so I had to go see for myself as Elliot Rd is down the street from me (YES!). When I entered this place, it felt like home as it reminded me of one of my favorite places I used to go to back in Cali. It's clean, the staff is very friendly and their salsa is awesome! I personally like the green over the the red but they're both good! You can choose a la carte or a meal plate and they have a breakfast menu to boot! Now was the carne asada BOMB? YES! The carne asada was to die for, it was juicy and cooked just right. The tacos are small-ish but hit the right spot without putting you in a food coma afterwards. I usually have 2 or 3 (if im starving) and I'm in heaven. I go here about once a week for the tacos and I am never dissapointed. The burritos are excellent as well and are medium in size, again they don't serve the super XXXL burritos here which is fine with me because I don't like the food baby feeling I get after eating one of those bad boys! Oh and I forgot to add that the tacos are CHEAP, $1.15 a piece. If you want a 3 tacos plate, its 6 bucks, comes with rice and beans. So for the south phoenix/ahwatukee/chandler peeps, I recommend this place, its delicious, cheap, and clean as well!"}
{"text":"This is the definition of a dive.  It does have some really nice artwork on the wall, and the decorations are quaint.  This isn't the kind of place you go to because it's novel or for any other gimmicky antics.  Nope.  You go here for the down and dirty cheap food that's rather delicious, and you don't mind coming back again and again for.  If Mexican food is your thing then leave your high-brow at home, throw on some low class and have some Los Taquitos, hot and spicy tacos on the cheap.  They don't serve beer but they won't stop you from bringing your own XD"}
{"text":"Los Taquitos is easily the best Mexican food in Ahwatukee. That being said, it's simply decent Mexican food. I ordered a tacos carnitas, al pastor and an AZ style burrito which were all pretty tasty but a tad on the dry side. This place is quite busy during lunch time, so be prepared for the wait."}
{"text":"I go here once a week for lunch because they have the best ceviche in Phoenix. The pastor and carne is also very good!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here today because of Triple D, and was Not very impressed!! We Ordered carnitas and they tasted more like barbaqoa...not traditional fried carnitas. The possole was alright and the tacos were just alright. Nothing to say they were great!!  Definitely not coming back for more!"}
{"text":"The food is very good, but you get so little for what you spend.   Today we went because they had Taco Tuesday (tacos which are normally $1.50 are only $1). Great idea if all of the tacos were $1. I went craving carne asada, which apparently is the only one that is not $1 for Taco Tuesday. While standing there considering what to order instead, two other people came in to get the carne asada tacos for $1. Not good for repeat business. When I asked why I was told it was because beef costs more. Solution: make them all $1.25.   I ended up getting two chicken tacos and one carne asada. We took them back to work and were shocked when we opened the bag and saw how tiny they were. Now I know street tacos are smaller than regular tacos, but these were teeny! If I'd known how small they were I would have ordered more. (As I type this I'm still hungry.)  They were very good, there is no doubt about that, but I probably won't go back."}
{"text":"Opens at 6am. They finally finished opening, turned on the lights at 6:14 to take my order. When I pointed out that this is the second time I've seen this, I got a very passive shrug from Cecile, who never actually addressed my concern.  When ringing me up, I noted that the bottled water was really expensive at $4, and could I please have a cup of water instead. Got a reluctant sigh from Cecile who eventually slid an empty cup my way... No explanation that the water is available next door, had to hunt for it. Her attitude is unnecessary.  Food is fine. Breakfast potatoes were bland."}
{"text":"I live in the neighborhood and have previously loved Los Taquitos but a couple things have changed. There have always been times when the customer service was curt, to say the least, but it's really becoming annoying. Geez people, act like you're glad we're there.   The other thing is the enchiladas.  God knows, I've had lots of them in my lifetime and I think I know a good one when I taste it. It took me awhile to order one because I LOVE the tacos so much but I did order the enchiladas once and it was literally horrible.  Okay, maybe it was just a fluke so after a few visits I decided to try again. Still horrible.  How can everything I've tried there be so good and the enchiladas the worst I've ever had?  I don't get it.  I hope they read this and correct these 2 things because I hate that I don't like it there anymore."}
{"text":"Don't go here if you are in a hurry. The service is not very good and notoriously slow. But the tacos are good. The Jamaica is also good. Margaritas are very good, but very strong. This taco place was one of the only ones I found in Phoenix that I really liked ok. After living in San Diego,  the street tacos there ruined me. But Los Taquitos is ok. I don't think it would be able to compete in San Diego, but in Phoenix, you have to take what you can get. I think I'd give this place a higher rating if 1.) The service was faster and if the people who worked there were nicer, more service-oriented and friendlier. and 2.) If they had salsa instead of just taco sauce. and 3.) If they had rice and beans or if they served free chips and salsa with their meals. Oh, and stay away from the carnitas. It was very dry. The carne asada taco is good, and the el pastor was decent."}
{"text":"Los Taquitos is one of the best taco shops this side of town. Period  A Los Taquitos Haiku:  Two lengua street tacos The carne asada torta with cheese Mexican food heaven"}
{"text":"We ordered a bunch of food to go from here. Good prices but it took longer than we thought it would for the food to be ready.   The tacos are really great! I asked for them mild and they were not spicy at all (good if you don't love spicy food).  The only one they couldn't make less spicy was the pastor.   I liked the chicken taco the best. Overall, all of the tacos are very flavorful. The waitstaff are friendly and the space is a decent size, including a few tab;es outside."}
{"text":"Its okay, not really the street tacos I expected. No salsa bar or mayo cream for the fish and shrimp tacos or guacamole . Service is good. Recommend tortilla fish tacos down the street lol"}
{"text":"What started as a food truck back in the 80s, has now evolved to two successful restaurants in the valley.  Using traditional recipes passed down through generations in Mexico - LT delivers the flavors that reminisce of street tacos in Mexico.  Using ingredients made from scratch, the marinades used for the various meats are outstanding!  Being first timers there, the service staff was very friendly and suggested what menu items we should try - to experience the best they had to offer.  Our number one dish was the #1 (about $6 or $7) - an assortment of three street tacos with chicken, pork, and beef.  All of them had unique and bold flavors - you could taste that the marinade had really absorbed into the meats.  They were served with cotija, pico, and cilantro - adding that truly authentic flavor to the tacos.  We also sampled the fish tacos and burritos.    Why this wonderful little place does not receive four stars or more?  Despite what Guy Fieri said, despite the wonderful flavor of these tacos, everything we ate was lukewarm or less.  From the refried beans to the rice, to the taco meat, and burrito.  It gave us the sense that despite being made from scratch, these wonderful ingredients had been sitting there for a while.  Albeit the flavor and texture of the meats was grand, it did not taste fresh."}
{"text":"Great food and great service at great prices.  People from my office consider this the standard for a quick, cheap, and very tasty lunch.  This is honestly my favorite workday lunch spot.  Mexican food is definitely my Kryptonite, so I feel comfortable recommending this place. :)"}
{"text":"This place has excellent carne asada, either in a taco or or burrito. Fish tacos are delightful and remind me of what I find in beach towns in Cali and Mexico. Their salsa is distinctive and the wall art is not to be missed."}
{"text":"Best taco place ever I refuse to eat anywhere else. The chicken tacos are the best you'll never be disappointed with anything you get on the menu! Family owned and operated, you can feel and taste the love in their cooking"}
{"text":"We stopped in here at the C gate during a slight layover at PHX. I don't make a habit of eating food at airports as it is usually mediocre at best and overpriced. However, we were here for a long time and needed something to get us through. The smells from this place were amazing! The staff was great! They were very helpful, friendly, and actually cared about their job. How refreshing! I opted for the carnitas torta sandwich upon recommendation from a man who was enjoying his at the table nearby. The Mexican bread it comes on is very filling. The meat was tender and flavorful. It came with two different salsas. I tried one on each side, both were equally delicious! One was a red, smoky salsa, the other was a green, verde salsa. The rice was nothing special, but the sandwich was outstanding (for airport food). My whole sandwich with a bottle of water and tax was just over $12. about what you would expect to pay for any meal at an airport. I would come here again if at PHX."}
{"text":"Had never been here but always heard great things about it and it definitely lived up to the hype. Great prices and delicious Mexican food. Love places where you order at the counter then can take your time hanging out - will definitely come back soon!"}
{"text":"I ordered a chorizo quesadilla and a side of chips and guacamole. The quesadilla had some slices of all cheese, and some with all too much chorizo, I don't believe much care was put into making a simple dish. The guacamole was awful. It was watery and runny. It seemed like someone just poorly chopped a tomato, and mixed it with avocado. Absolutely no flavor. If I could give this place less stars I would..."}
{"text":"I HONESTLY Don't know how anyone can complain about this place? The Most legit place in the Phx Area. I drive from Arrowhead just to get it because it's that Good!!!"}
{"text":"Chicas caliente, fresh tasty food and awesome margaritas, per my husband.  Lol. Strong and tasty house margaritas.  I had half, and was buzzed, proceeded to pass the delicious other half to my better half. a My husband commented on feeling his first margarita.  And he can hold his liquor.  Drinks legit!  To legit to quit! Haha. This place is pretty damn good.  The veggie tacos and chili relleno burrito are delicious! The accompanied red and green sauce are hot and flavorful!  Can't wait to come back! Thanks for the suggestion Lalo!"}
{"text":"Best Tacos in Phoenix!  They use high quality ingredients in their delectable menu items. All locations are always very clean"}
{"text":"this place took way too long and got our order wrong, but by the time we got it it was too late to ask for them to switch it and we were gonna be late for our flight. we ordered a chicken burrito and were given a beef burrito, which consisted of a tiny scoop of meat, and our \"side\" of beans and rice was about 2 bites. my friend and I split it and luckily we weren't too hungry, but for $10 we pretty much got a tortilla with some beans."}
{"text":"Went here for taco Tuesday and the carne asada tacos were good. The reason I didn't give them five stars was 1. Their chips were not that great. I think if they went to a better authentic tortilla chip rather than the hard thick ones they had it would make a huge difference. And 2, their guacamole was like a watery green paste squeezed out of a bag that was defrosted a week ago. Place has good potential but some things need to be changed."}
{"text":"Great food.  Tacos were outstanding; actually, all of it was outstanding...tostadas, burritos, rice, beans.  The staff is wonderful...very friendly."}
{"text":"I love Mexican food, and this is one of my favorite places to go. The food is always made fresh and they are always super friendly when you walk in. They don't mind making orders custom and that is a major plus in my book. I recommend if you are ordering takeout that you call ahead. Especially on a Saturday, we wait can get a little bit long. It is definitely worth it though!"}
{"text":"Decor  is great.  Lighting nice.  Food prices very reasonable.  Food was great.  Good tasting.  Comfy."}
{"text":"Worst Mexican food I've ever had and being from San Diego, I've sampled tons. The food is bland and the workers were constantly getting orders wrong."}
{"text":"My boyfriend recently moved to Ahwatukee and we'd been on the lookout for another dive-y Mexican joint to replace our beloved El Bravo in Sunnyslope. After hitting two pizza places on a Monday night, both of which were closed, we made our way over to Los Taquitos. It's a bit easy to miss, tucked between the Safeway and Walgreens on Elliot and 48th st.  Right away, the place showed promise. Total dive-y interior, but without being dirty or unwelcoming. Counter service, formica tables/booths, fluorescent lighting, etc. We ordered and sat down to await our hopefully-tasty dinner.  While this place is no El Bravo, it was very, very tasty. We both ordered the #31, a Chimichanga combo plate (he got the steak and I got the grilled chicken), and fountain drinks. All total, the bill was under $19! I was pleasantly surprised to notice that the chimis were served with sides of sour cream and guac at no extra charge. Tasty guac, too, if not a little salty. Excellent rice and refried beans. So many Mexican places seem to serve the rice as an afterthought, but here it was very flavorful.  The chicken in my chimi was very tasty and cooked well. My bf's steak chimi was very good, the meat had a great grilled taste. Two kinds of bottled salsa on the table, one green and one red. I only tried the green and it wasn't that flavorful really. Just sort of spicy.  We were really glad we finally made it to Los Taquitos and hope to come back soon :)"}
{"text":"I was in Phoenix for business and Yelped good local Mexican cuisine. I stopped by Los Taquitos and it is solid. Tried a few things to sample the menu. I had chicken tacos (both grilled and shredded) and a green chile pork burrito. All three items were excellent. The shredded chicken was amazing. They feature a large street taco selection and the restaurant is a step above local taquerias. It's worth making a trip too. Food is good. Vibe is good and well priced. Go check it out. I will be back."}
{"text":"Ask for chips right away. Food is great and they serve alcohol! However, it takes a long time to get fresh food so order some chips and salsa ( they don't come with the food). They also won't give them to you in advance of your order, so you have to ask. That way you have something to snack on while you wait."}
{"text":"I feel like I come here every Tuesday!  Its cliche, but its for good reason. They have $1 tacos (chicken, pastor, or carnitas). They are served on corn tortillas by default, but you can opt to get the flour tortillas for the regular price of $1.75 a taco (I think).  Regardless if its Tuesday or not, this is a fantastic place. This place surpasses 95% of other taco joints without question. Its in a great location if you are getting your haircut and want food after etc. Its right by the 101.  Customer service is always fantastic. They are young, and you do have to have them repeat your order back sometimes to make sure they got the right thing (its a fast paced environment) here. The lines are always long, for good reason.  The ONLY thing I can say that needs improvement is the seating arrangements and cleanliness. Its a great thing that tons of people come here, but its PACKED around lunch time (12) and after work (6). I literally find myself racing another person trying to find a table as soon as someone gets up - so honestly one thing adds to another. The tables aren't cleaned alot, because the employees don't have enough time to clean them. Maybe integrate a table seating system like Liberty Market in Gilbert for example. They also have limited seating, but do an amazing job getting people in and out....all while still having a line to stand and order in like Los Taquitos!  Regardless, this is an amazing place. I'll forever be back - just wanted to add a tip and perhaps it'll get around to the manager or owner etc.  Food quality 5/5 Restaurant cleanliness 4/5 Customer service 4/5 Value 5/5"}
{"text":"Waited 25 minutes for food and it came out cold. Crap service. Won't bother giving it another try."}
{"text":"This place has excellent food...that is if they give you what you ordered. A couple people who work there, especially the curly haired girl, have bad attitudes that make you feel like your order is a burden to them and shouldnt be working in the service indsutry. I live a couple miles away and religiously stopped on Taco Tuesday for takeout tacos. The first time they screwed up my order, I considered it a small mistake. After the 4th time they gave me the wrong thing, I called them to express my dissatisfaction with their inconsistency. They offered to give me a credit for my order and told me to just mention my name when I came in the next time. When I went back in, they said that I had to have the receipt and that they don't just take names. They finally reluctantly agreed to give it to me, but I know that I will NEVER be coming back! I can find plenty of other taco places with better attitudes and less screwups!"}
{"text":"I ordered the asada street tacos which comes with three tacos, Spanish rice, beans, and two different salsas, one red, one green. The beans were very tasty and the rice was okay. The tacos were super, super, super tiny BUT they ARE \"street tacos\" so I guess I should've known better. The asada was okay. I went straight for the green salsa and poured it all over my food. I really should've tried the salsas first because the green salsa was super spicy. I had to remove what I could from my food with a napkin. My mistake. The customer service could use some help. Cashier had an attitude towards me and her coworkers. Not very professional. For airport food this place was okay. I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Worth a visit. The 4/5 is mostly based on the chips and salsa being $2.50, small in quantity, and not all that great. The Carne Asada burrito was outstanding. The red chile beef enchilada was outstanding. The chorizo breakfast burrito was plentiful but lacked the spice and full flavor that I like out of my chorizo. The marinated pork burrito deep fried and smothered in red sauce was a bit on the sweet side for Mexican cuisine but it was good and, like everything else, big enough to get all the value out of the price paid. We didn't partake in the bar offerings but the margaritas tempted me. We also dropped the ball on looking around before ordering as we missed the specials board for Taco Tuesday at a buck a piece. The value was great and we will be back to try the red chile beef and green chile pork burritos. Glad we finally tried this place after living close by for more than 2 years."}
{"text":"Best burrito I have had since my move to the southwest! Can't wait to try more of their menu. Carne asada was perfectly cooked and the burrito had all of my favorite ingredients. I'm definitely an onion and cilantro only kinda gal, which is what came standard in the burrito. Yummmm!"}
{"text":"This has got to be my favorite place to get breakfast at Sky Harbor. I literally walked all the way from a C Gate to get here and have a breakfast burrito before my last flight.  I get an egg and cheese burrito and add avocado, for 50 cents, it is SO worth the extra cost. The eggs are seasoned well, the pico del gallo is fresh and the papas (potatoes) are so tasty!! It's an amazing combination.  The past three visits to Los Taquitos, the same girl has been working the register and she is the nicest. She offers a lot of suggestions to travelers who have no clue what to get and is so friendly to everyone.  Highly recommend for a breakfast that will leave you full and happy for your next morning flight :)"}
{"text":"Went in here last week and had a great dining experience as always.  I had the green chile chicken burrito which is divine.  About the only thing not super fantastic was the quesadilla my partner had, but still quite tasty.  Overall, a nice dining experience and we will be back!"}
{"text":"What a place the food was delicious and the service was great I had the AZ style burrito and it was delicious"}
{"text":"Good tacos, reasonable prices, fast friendly service, kids allowed, good margaritas, decent Mexican beer selection, ok patio. On top of all that, it's just around the corner from my parents' house. Next time I'll try the award-winning posole."}
{"text":"One of the few places that isn't too overpriced for airport food. However, with that being said there are a few problems with the food.   I ordered the carne asada tacos. The tortillas were good, but the beef was too salty. It also came with rice and retried beans. You can't really mess up retried beans and they did not. The rice was another story. There were quite a few grains of rice that were too hard.  The service was good and the food did come up fairly quickly"}
{"text":"Have been coming here for a few years and I'm rarely disappointed. I appreciate that they have taken their time to grow slowly and maintain the integrity of the food and the original concept. I get the same quality of food whether I'm at the Ahwatukee location or the 16th street location. I'm loving the newly remodeled Ahwatukee location!  It's so much larger, has great character, and some of the artwork has been carried over. My only negative, and it's small, are the prices. They're a little more expensive than I'd like and that means more time between visits but I totally support this place!"}
{"text":"A great hole in the wall place, some of the best Mexican food we've had.  Their breakfast burritos are outstanding, cheap, and ginormous."}
{"text":"Best pastor tacos ever.. everything else I've gotten has been good as well but the pastor tacos and micheladas are out of this country good!"}
{"text":"Come in on Taco Tuesday - all street tacos are only $1! Got 5 carnitas (pork) tacos and a soda for under $7.  Great tasting meat, delicious tortillas and chips, good selection of salsas and other toppings. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I cam here because of the Yelp reviews.  The food was great, but the portion / price ratio was not right.  The fish tacos were so small.  I had to order a 2nd lunch.  The service is slow, but that was due to the line out the door.  This place is real popular for lunch, so be prepared to wait and look for a place to sit like a shark."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food.  Prices are a lil higher than the ____berto's restaurants but the quality is much better.  Can get busy at lunch."}
{"text":"Go here!!!  Excellent hole-in-the-wall Mexican joint.  I've lived in Phoenix for eight years and love Mexican and this is now my favorite option for cheap and tasty Mex.    The meats are at the core of what makes this place special.  They have unique marinades and they cook their meats just right.  The carne asada and carnitas are the showstoppers.    It seems like there's just a little twist to everything they do, like using red onions with the carne asada--atypical, but what a great combo.  They have special salsas for each dish, and you generally don't need to add anything, as the food is packed with balanced flavors.  The burritos and tacos are kick-ass, and the horchata is awesome.  Don't miss this place."}
{"text":"I stopped by here earlier today for a Togo lunch with my wife.  Since it was still morning in Phoenix and would be dinner whenever we arrived at our destination I figured that taking lunch onto the plane would be prudent.  Since we were leaving out of C7 we perused the options near our gate and ultimately settled on Los Taquitos.  Since it is in located in an airport there isn't much to say about it other than the it has a place to order as well as a decent amount of seating.  I decided to head to the restaurant about 35 minutes before our flight giving myself plenty of time.  It took a little less that 10 minutes to get through the line and I ended up ordering two chicken burritos and gave them my name.  Then we stood and waited and waited some more.  While I can't fault the people behind the counter, all of whom were hustling, I saw quite a few people on my flight leave without getting their food.  Thankfully I was in the B boarding group and 27 minutes after ordering received my food.  That is criminal for an airport and it gave me just enough time to get into line at the gate.  So now you are probably wondering whether the food was worth the wait.  I can certainly tell you it was not.  Both of the burritos came with refried beans and some rice on the side.  They were both ok but I think the most disappointing part about my meal was the burrito itself.  While I had ordered a chicken burrito I didn't actually get much chicken in it.  It was more refried bean than anything else and so perhaps they were rationing the chicken to push out more orders?  The only part of the meal that I enjoyed was the green salsa which had a good flavor.  The bottom line for me is that I wouldn't head back here again in the future.  Not only was the wait horrible, especially for an airport, but the food was incredibly disappointing as well."}
{"text":"My family and I went last night for dinner-- the house margarita was small but awesome. The food was adequate but not impressive."}
{"text":"The beef soft tacos were truly outstanding.  I should have just quit right there, because I was really disappointed by the enchilada (bland sauce from a can, hardly any cheese) and tamale (dried out and flavorless).  Beans and rice were just there, nothing special."}
{"text":"Not to pleased. Very bad portion size and for the price I paid I should have gotten more food. Everyone was friendly but just not great food."}
{"text":"Tried Los Taquitos for the first time the other night and really enjoyed it. Definitely fast food Mexican but it was tasty.   I tried the sopas, one chicken one beef, with rice and beans. I've never had sopas before so I wasn't sure what to expect. They were kinda like tostadas but they're not on a hard shell, it's a softer, thicker base if you will. Each one was loaded with meat, beans, lettuce and cheese. They were very filling. Between the two of them and the rice and beans I couldn't finish. The beans were fine, simple refried beans. the rice was just okay. Not bad but I've had better.   The boyfriend ordered soft shell tacos. They were tiny. We've seen this before, there must be a certain region of Mexico that does tiny tacos? I dunno, it's kinda weird. They're like taco sliders. But he said they were good. So order several if you're hungry.  We went on a weeknight and the place was very busy. A constant line at the counter. The best was the guy who came in and asked if the order his wife called in was ready. The girl at the counter said \"what was it?\" and the guy answers condescendingly \"I don't know, give me a hint.\" Why would they know what your wife ordered dude? But they actually handled the guy well considering what a douchebag he was being.  I would go back to Los Taquitos but I don't know if it would be first on my list."}
{"text":"Basic tex-mex food, carne asada is pretty dry although the frijoles were the best I've had in a long time. Rice was good, tasty. Lacks a salsa bar with salsas, chopped onion, cabbage, lettuce, cilantro, hot peppers and so on. It's an OK place for a quick bite but don't expect your true mexican cuisine taste here."}
{"text":"I've only had the tacos on taco Tuesday ($1 a piece) and I really like them, apparently so does the rest of the world as the line can get out of control. I've tried all of the options and I think the adoboda is by far the best. For only a dollar, they are an amazing deal. I normally get 3 to 4 of them and I'm stuffed so 3 is probably the magic number. Here is my only knock on the place. It isn't fast food, which I know it doesn't claim to be but for an order at the counter type place, they take awhile to get you your food. I've been the only one there and it's taken 25 minutes for a few tacos. If it's packed, you might wait longer. I know this is a DDD spot so naturally you get people wanting to try it but I'm not totally sure it lives up to that long of a wait. I much prefer Carolinas when in the mood for a quick taco or burrito."}
{"text":"Los Taquitos is good, you will like it, but it's nothing extraordinary. It's another place I don't quite understand why is on the Food Network. I like their carne asada and the way they season it, I like their beans, pretty wonderful and light, I like their salsa though it has a little too much cilantro for me, and the chorizo is pretty dynamite. The problem is that aside from the carne asada being a little more consistently good, I don't think it's any better than Filibertos. And Filibertos has the advantage of drive-thrus, quick service and basically no waiting in line. I would never discourage anyone from eating here, I totally support Los Taquitos and will eat here a bunch more times without question, I just think it's a little hyped up. Stop by if you're in the area, but don't make it a trek just because it was on TV."}
{"text":"MORONS!  Seriously.  I order a carnitas bowl.  Girls asks, \"chicken, pork or beef?'   I say, *well, carnitas, so I am going with pork?\"   And I don't want tomatoes.  Does it come with pico de gallo?  And she says, \"it comes with red sauce.\"  I said what's that?  She says its pico.  Seriously.  Seriously!?  Moron!    Food is bland. Not worth price or frustration.  Never again."}
{"text":"The tacos are amazing! I had the pastor ones and mooched some guac and bombero sauce from someone else. Just delicious. I thought 3 little tacos wouldn't be enough to fill me but that combined with rice and beans stuffed me up."}
{"text":"I'm Hispanic and grew up eating some of the best Mexican food on the planet. So I'm nervous about Mexican restaurants, yet heard the great reviews so had to try it since it's down the street from my job. It was tasty, for sure. The street tacos were legit. I'm picky about beans, but there's were fresh and delicious, not from a can or reheated. I'm picky about Spanish rice too, and there's is the first I've liked in years. It's plain, but I like it that way. The decor is unique and fun. There will be a wait on Taco Tuesday, at lunch or at dinner, but I think they're worth it."}
{"text":"I came down from Oregon for the UO vs. ASU football game and told my brother we had to stop in.  This place did not disappoint us.  The beans and rice looked bland, but they were not.  I had a fish taco, delish. My brother had the chicken fajfitas, loved them.  I can.t to come back down for Thansgiving and bring my husband to enjoy. Go Ducks!!"}
{"text":"I have never been here before, but I will definitely be back. I got the super nacho & man, it was super. The place was packed, which is always a good sign. We ordered & ran next door to get a mega millions ticket. Unfortunately, I didn't win the $640 million, but I did have a full belly."}
{"text":"I got the bombero burrito. It was a little to spicy for me and the worst part was that it was super dry inside the burrito with dry carne asada and rice. It was the driest burrito I have ever had. Some other people we went with ordered the pastor tacos and liked them. I feel like this is more of a street taco shop, rather than a Mexican restaurant. What they call salsa there was really pico de gallo... So the chips and salsa were not worth it. I would only go here again for some of their tacos because they are cheep... And even then I would probably find a place with more authentic tacos."}
{"text":"Was here for happy hour and had three of the tacos for $1. There was pollo, carnitas, and pastor. And a margarita. For under $10. The margarita was delicious. The tacos were not the best... Very very salty. My friend also said the same thing, very salty. By the third taco, i couldn't eat anymore. Told the cashier that took our order. She said she'll test it but never said anything further to us. Wouldnt recommend it. Just the house margaritas."}
{"text":"Best street tacos in the valley! Their taco Tuesday deals are awesome! Completely worth the 20 minute wait for your tacos! But get there early or there won't be too many different meats to try! Recommend the green salsa for your food as well (that's if you like it spicy)."}
{"text":"Great \"quick service\" Mexican food.  Nothing too fancy, the food here is great.  Line can be long at times, so I always call the order in about 10 minutes before I get there.    Not everything is amazing, but their best items can't be beat.  In my opinion, here are their items, in order of awesomeness:  1) Marinated Pork Burrito 1a) Shrimp Taco (Fish is great too) 2) Bombero Burrito  (very spicy, so watch out)  After those, it's all about personal taste.  Great place, high recommended."}
{"text":"This was my favorite spot for happy hour but they no longer have food specials. Only beer and margaritas for happy hour. So basically food is regular price all day long for. Disappointed especially since they haven't updated their website to reflected the change. Food is excellent but I won't be going on a weekly basis anymore."}
{"text":"A great place for a quick meal in Ahwatukee! (Thanks to Yelper Mark E. for the tip!)  Food: The menu is extensive! I saw so many things I'd like to try, and settled on a Breakfast Burrito \"naked style\" (no tortilla, in a bowl). I had it with chorizo, pico, and their excellent green salsa, and it was delish!   Cost: Very reasonable. One burrito (to go) with no drinks was $6.28 including tax.  Service:  Today they were very crowded. Even so, my order came out promptly. The staff were helpful and friendly.  Atmosphere: This is a small, family owned restaurant in a strip mall. That said, the interior is nicely done, Mexican music is playing, and the staff keeps it very clean!  Overall: A definite repeater! This place is now on my local \"short list\"!"}
{"text":"Let me start with the good. Actually the fantastic and that would be their El Pastor tacos. Omigawd they are soo tasty and $1 each during Happy Hour, 4-7.  Now the really bad.  The tortas. I placed a phone order for two tortas to take back to my office. I ate about 1/3 of my sandwich and threw it out. No kidding it was that bad, and I'm really not a picky eater. It had flavor but soo soggy. The other torta was the same way, threw it out. So... this is a really nice place and I'm sure most of their menu is fine, especially the El Pastor tacos, but stay away from the tortas."}
{"text":"The BEST carnitas tacos in town (and I've done a pretty substantial tour de taco) they are so friendly, have a great atmosphere and $1 tacos all Tuesday and during happy hour can't beat it!"}
{"text":"Great for a quick bite. The food is good although my chicken enchiladas seemed a little dry. I'm not typically a fan of Mexican-style rice, but I thought the rice and refried beans were yummy. My boyfriend and his brother really enjoyed their burritos so I'll have to try those next time."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to any Los Taquitos location.  Overall, not bad...but not great.  I ordered the street tacos (with one asada, one carnitas, and one chicken taco).  The tacos were underwhelming.  The chicken was not tender (perhaps overcooked or sat after cooking).  The carnitas missed the mark as well...the meat was too fatty for my taste.  No complaints about the asada however.    The rice and beans would have been excellent had they been served hot and steamy, instead they were just slightly above luke warm.  To be fair, it was just a soft opening and I'm sure they will improve.  I will be back and will adjust my review after the next visit if I have a better experience."}
{"text":"Burrito was great and the breakfast quesidilla had a nice flavor.  However the customer service was extremely poor.  All I asked for was some salsa for the burrito and she told me it cost extra but I'll bring to you in a few minutes.  There was only three customer in the restaurant at this time.  I ask again, and she say you want the chips...  Finally a lady comes out of the back with the tray of squeeze salsa for burritos etc.  Register lady didn't seem to understand me. She cancels the chips lol."}
{"text":"Loved it! The street tacos are so fresh! We went back two days in a row while visiting Tempe. The restaurant is very clean and up to date. We tried a lot of things on the menu and it was all good."}
{"text":"Our very first visit and this place is awesome! A place to hang out with friends, good food, no, AMAZING food and if you want a spicy  kick to your food, order any burrito \"Bombero\" style!!!! New favorite hangout!"}
{"text":"Decent amount of food for a normal price. Asada Burrito meal without a drink was $9.50. The food was fantastic! My only complaint is that the burritos could be a tad bit bigger. Definitely order the meal if you're hungry, the burrito alone won't be enough."}
{"text":"If you love authentic street tacos, this place is a must try!  Their enchiladas are also awesome and the carne asada is fantastic too.  If you're going for lunch during the week, I would recommend calling in your order.  They are usually very busy during that time."}
{"text":"Back after a hiatus. Service greatly improved! Friendly staff and reasonable wait time for my meal. Went with the Huevos Rancheros. Great breakfast choice. Nice way to get my day started."}
{"text":"Strictly stopped because of the reviews. Got a taco al pastor to go and a burrito de asada to go. The place is a little loud with music. The burrito and taco were good but not the best I've had, no napkins on my to go bag. Overall descent place to eat and/or have a drink. Definitely will try something else next time."}
{"text":"We arrived on a Friday night around 6:40 and promptly took advantage of the happy hour specials. Ordered 3 street tacos, one of each, and a blood orange margarita. The margarita was great, excellent flavor and gave me a nice little buzz. The tacos were delicious... so good that we both went back for another full order at 6:58! The place was doing a solid business which is nice to see in a small place and filled with all types of people - a couple families with small kids, elderly and young people.   Looks great too -  nice open door patio with lights, restaurant is clean, nice bar and tv. Only wish that there was a salsa bar. Service was great and attentive. We will be back for the daily 4pm -7 happy hour for sure."}
{"text":"The food is amazingly delicious and the service is memorable! The restaurant is just shaped a little awkwardly making is difficult to stand in line without bumping into people. Not a huge deal but I always take my food to go because of this. I always get the enchiladas and they are so authentic! I love their rice and horchata too!"}
{"text":"Definitely poor quality and not on par with the other locations. Ordered 3 Assad's tacos and all of the tortillas were completely destroyed and torn apart"}
{"text":"Carne asada tortas are amazing! The down side is that they always get my order wrong. I keep telling them no salsa on my tacos. Their red salsa is kinda hot so I would like to enjoy my meal without exploding later. No matter what I do, they always add the salsa. I put it with it because the food is so damn good. Not that this has anything to do with the food, but the woman who is always up at the register looks like she rolled out of bed and didn't shower. Her bra straps are always showing and it looks really unprofessional. It's kind of gross actually. If she is the first and/or only person the customers are going to see, I think she should at least look more presentable. She is representing the restaurant. Other than that, the food is amazing!"}
{"text":"Mexican food is one of my favorites so every time I get a chance to eat at a Mexican restaurant I have to try the chimichanga.  This is by far is the best one I have found and I've tried a lot of places!  They also have wonderful tasting enchiladas and tacos.  The food tastes super fresh and you can tell they take the time to prepare their food the right way!"}
{"text":"Great place to grab Sunday happy hour from 4 pm to 7 pm (different hours than what has been previously Yelped). House margs are $4 with $3 beers. Fast service and plenty of dining space with no rush to leave."}
{"text":"So we went to Los Taquitos the other night, and were quite disappointed. They switched their menudo so that it's only available on the weekends. The fact that it was available on weekdays was a game changer for awhile. They also had stopped serving breakfast for some reason. The girl at the counter was pointing fingers at the kitchen and acting like she had no clue what was going on. We told her we changed our mind about eating there, and then left. When your business grows it's no excuse to lower your quality. I've been a customer for 10 years, and may never return."}
{"text":"Vegetarians beware!! I ate here and I immediately felt sick afterward.  I had a stomach ache, felt like puking, and had a headache. I ordered a chile relleno, rice and beans. I asked the cashier what the relleno had inside and she said potatoes and cheese. I am not vegan so I went to town on that bad boy. Well, fifteen minutes later I was feeling so sick. I should have stuck with the veggie burrito.  I may never go back though for a second chance. My sickness lasted all afternoon and the next morning. I also had a house margarita and that tasted horrible. I should have known from that.    I should have gone to Aunt Chilada's instead. It's close by and WAY better."}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in quite some time and I don't know why.  The food here is great, the prices are cheap, and the atmosphere is greatly improved since they remodeled the place.    The tamales and tacos are both excellent and I didn't get a chance to try the quesadilla but I couldn't stop staring at the one on the next table.  Taco Tuesday provides $1 street tacos on 4 different varieties (Pastor, carnitas, chicken, and marinated chicken when I was there)."}
{"text":"LOVE this place. Traditional Mexican food, family owned.  Food is awesome, Phoenix Metro Area has lost many of it's family owned Traditional Mexican Restaurants and we were so happy to find Los Taquitos.  Frequent here often.  The pazole soup is one of my favorite dishes, homemade, chunky, just enough spice.  The menu has plenty to choose from & the prices are reasonable.   We ordered at the counter & it wasn't long before they served us a delicious, hot meal.  Atmosphere is very Sonoran Mexico as well.  If you want good Mexican food, Mexico style, go here.  We give this place & frequent it often ...  a double thumbs up."}
{"text":"This place is so delicious! You walk in and you're greeted by a friendly face. Took us a while but we were very satisfied w what we ordered. I got the chile relleno combo w rice and beans and my bf got a Chile verde pork bowl. Y'all !! When I tell y'all the food was delicious, I truly mean it. I was in love, and their habanero salsa is pure fire. I will most definitely be returning to try out more of their tasty food, can't wait !!"}
{"text":"Amazing place to eat! We will def be back! Their tacos and ceviche were beyond what we expected."}
{"text":"Have had all of the street tacos..Good. great Taco Tuesday deal on Carnitaa, Pastor and Chicken $1 each"}
{"text":"Super yummy, and consistent, place for awesome mexican food. No frills, just order what you like and take a seat until they call your number. Their margaritas are also amazing, really strong (i.e. good bang for your buck). Of course I will be back!!"}
{"text":"I found another Mexican joint to add to my rotation! Cute atmosphere, cheap booze, friendly service, and tasty food.   I ordered a chili relleno and grilled veggie burro. The chili relleno was good, definitely unique. It was huge and filled with potatoes and cheese and covered in a delicious sauce. As a vegetarian, I love potatoes in Mexican food. They are filling and tasty and I don't see why more places would use potatoes for their Mexican dishes. They are dirt cheap.The grilled veggie burrito was delicious. Filled with beans, rice, grilled veggies (POTATOES!) it was super good. It was a little dry and I would have liked some hot sauce but all the hot sauce bottles were being used by other tables. (Hint, hint... more hot sauce bottles please!) My husband had the bombero burrito which he said was quite spicy but very tasty.   We will be back!"}
{"text":"My all time favorite place in the world!!!!!!!! If I was to have one last meal before I die it would be drone Los Taquitos. I wish I could eat here for everyday of my life. Their chicken tacos are out of this world. The meat is always seasoned perfectly. The hot sauce is the best I have ever had. The staff is so friendly and are always making you feel welcomed. There is not one thing I would or could say should here change there. 5 STARS well deserved!!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend bright me here, an the food is great! Spot on, Can't go wrong with this place! I wanna try everything on the menu lol!! Tastes fresh, authentic Mexican food!"}
{"text":"I've been on a street taco kick lately..saw the stellar reviews for this place and decided to stop in when I was in the area. I had a veggie taco and an asada taco and they were both good, but nothing over-the-top special. Just another street taco really. Not bad but not 5 stars either. If I was in the area and wanted some tacos I would go again."}
{"text":"First off the only reason I will give this place 1 star is because of Timothy his customer service was fantastic. Other than that it is beyond me how you can find horrible Mexican food in Phoenix Arizona , but if you stop at this establishment you have found it . They have some serious work to do ."}
{"text":"Let's start by saying they don't have taquitos on their menu. When I asked the girl \"you don't have taquitos\" her actual response was \"we have taquitos they just aren't rolled and deep fried\". Kiddos I can't make this stuff up. So I had the taquitos not rolled up and not deep fried better known to the general public as street tacos. Let's just say I should have walked away when she explained taquitos. My uncle used to have a saying he used rarely when he had a terrible meal. He would say \"I would walk a mile to lick a dogs rear before I would eat that again\". My son ate at Matt's Big Breakdast and I should have joined him. Please don't eat here. Everything is terrible."}
{"text":"I had gone to this place right after Guy was there and I ordered the #1 combination 3 tacos server with rice and beans I picked a Carne Asada, Lengua and a Cabeza... I remember not being so blown away I was really disappointed. So fast forward a few years to now and I say I need to give this place another try... I think to my self Guy was ranting about this spot... So I head over for lunch and it's really busy so I get to the counter and order the # 1 all Carne Asada tacos I go find a table and drink my drink my number is called I get my food and look at comment bar there is no salsa so I have to ask... I ask for both she seemed kind of bothered. Let me tell you these are no write home about tacos the salsa on the other hand I could drink both kinds it's really good. So I am not sure if I will be back anytime soon with all the other options out there... DDD just lets me down every time."}
{"text":"really enjoyed this place. got the carne asada bombero burrito and wow, the chipotle sauce was bomb.com. beans and rice were on point. only problem i had was how much tortilla there was compared to inside ingredients. tip: fill up on insides to bulk up burrito"}
{"text":"Food is OK but I have to agree with other comments, and the staff needs to focus more on customers and attention to detail. Both times I have been there they have gotten my order wrong and the people behind the counter were more interested in talking amongst themselves then focusing on their customers. There are alot of choices for GREAT Mexican food in the Phoenix area so I probably will not go back again"}
{"text":"Big fan of pastor tacos here. Good place to visit on Taco Tuesday"}
{"text":"Despite the rating I chose to give this place a shot since it was very busy, and unlike in other reviews the line seemed to be moving at a decent pace. I elected to tryout the Asadé street tacos. They were pretty good! They were surprisingly better than a couple food trucks in Phoenix. I didn't get to sample the beans or rice since I left my leftovers under my seat in the plane like I always do. I guess that's my way of paying it forward to another flight crew!  The facilities were relatively clean for the rush of an airport restaurant. My main complaint was the waiting area was right next to the trash can, so while waiting for my food people were constantly bumping into me to throw their trash items away.   Some accused this place of being slow and not getting their food in time for their flight, but I experienced the opposite despite my indecisiveness on choosing a place to eat. I'll also add that the girl behind he counter was very polite, and even helped with suggestions when I asked what was good. Because the fast pace of a busy airport and the tacos being pretty good I'll give them four stars!"}
{"text":"Stopped here to get the kids some bean and cheese burritos while waiting for my daughters unaccompanied minor flight (that ended up being cancelled). The service was fast and the burritos were delicious. Like, adult delicious, not kid delicious. The tortillas were flaky and yummy, the beans were flavorful, and the cheese tasted fresh. I got a Pollo Burrito Bowl AZ style and it was pretty tiny for the $9 price tag. Even so, it was really good for airport food. The chicken was tender and moist and the bowl itself was seasoned well.   The only downside to this place is the cost, but it's pretty typical for airport food. We paid $27 for two bean and cheese burritos, my burrito bowl, and a liter of water."}
{"text":"I kept forgetting to review Los Taquitos and because it happened to be on tv right now, Guy Fieri reminded me!  I have only been here once based on my husband's sister's recommendation. I decided to order Carne asada, pollo and pastor tacos. I usually don't care for rice and beans so I didn't order the plate. The salsas, esp the red, is flavorful and very hot. The Carne asada was by far the best meat. Tender and flavorful..I still think about it. The pastor was decent and spiced well.. I still prefer a bit of a crisp to them. The chicken was my least favorite. It wasn't bad but it just tasted like chopped white meat chicken. But oh my, the refried beans were probably the best I have had. I actually kept eating it from my husband's plate. When I'm in town, I plan to go here again."}
{"text":"Food was just ok. The meat was overcooked. We stopped by for lunch on a Friday. We had to ask to have a table cleared. Waited over 15min for our order. Also a heads up, be careful of being overcharged for tacos and employees who don't care."}
{"text":"My favorite carne asada streets tacos in Arizona .  So great I eat there every Tuesday . Yep taco Tuesday ."}
{"text":"This restaurant is so awesome!  we had two different kinds of burritos and a kids meal.  we had a little bit of trouble ordering, but I think it was just because it was our first time here.  the restaurant was so clean and neatly decorated.  the staff was so friendly it was a great atmosphere.  the food was amazing and I cannot wait to go back again and again.  I will tell everybody about this restaurant!"}
{"text":"I moved near Los Taquitos about two months ago, and it's funny that I've yet to write a review, considering I eat here at least three times a week.  I really love all the food here, but my favorite is the cheap veggie burrito.  It's the best damn veggie burrito in my sometimes sketchy memory.  Strange enough, and it's no lie, the second best was in Galway, Ireland.    Margaritas are excellent, and can be had for a mere $3 between 4-7.  Mmmmm.  They squeeze limes and use agave nectar for sweetening.  Very tasty.    Also try their chile rellenos if they happen to be at the bottom of the menu when you visit.  I want to go swimming in the sauce they pour over the chile.  Love the breakfast torta, slathered in a generous pour of the green salsa.  Great pico?  Absolutely.    I can't really write enough nice things about this restaurant, and the fact that you have a 20% chance of seeing me there at any given time should testify to my true love.  My only complaint is the styrofoam cups and plastic plates.  I really hate styrofoam.  Get real plates!!!"}
{"text":"Totally not bad for airport food. You get a good amount of food in each order and it seems pretty fresh. While I didn't have too many expectations when coming here, I was happy to try the \"Phoenix style\" aka plus potatoes.   Food came quick and wasn't super expensive, so a positive experience overall."}
{"text":"We love this place!!  Authentic and trendy, with awesome food that is fresh and original.   My favorite is the shrimp burrito - and their tortillas are always fresh!!"}
{"text":"Awesome and authentic. Be sure to get the Habanero salsa - it's super hot and delicious"}
{"text":"Not very flavorful. Tacos were decent, but pretty bland. Chile relleno was disgusting, it had cubed potatoes inside. My Mexican-American wife was disappointed with everything.   Margaritas were mediocre.  Honestly the food at El Rancho market is better."}
{"text":"Come here for Taco Tuesday's!  The Al Pastor taco is my fave, especially with their red salsa. The red salsa is spicy and I love the kick to it, but if you're a person who does not like spicy then I would recommend the green salsa."}
{"text":"So good. Small little joint on the beaten path with excellent food at a great price. Authentic street tacos, burritos and tamales all made fresh. This was my first visit, it was busy at lunch time which I'm told is the norm, but for good reason. You'll have a few minutes in line to figure out what you want to order, take advantage of your time there and be ready to order when it's your turn. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Los Taquitos.   I'm there every Monday and always get some sort of combination of shrimp and chicken street tacos, chips and salsa and a Mexican Coke.  No matter the combination, it is never more than $12.... and would be cheaper if we went for $1 Taco Tuesdays.  The food is flavorful and spicy, and the service is excellent (we're big fans of Jessica)."}
{"text":"Never been to the original location but was happy to see this spot pop up in the \"little-strip-mall-location-that-could\"; just a hop, skip and jump from our home.  I love the modern decor and the patio space. The service was very friendly and the food came out fast. The veggie burrito actually had more on it then I was expecting, it's simple but had lots of flavor for sure. I am still not sure about the salsa, it was different and had a nice bite but might take a bit to get used to.  All in all I am very happy we have a vegan friendly Mexican spot in this area of Cen Pho that has good food and service."}
{"text":"A surprising small place with really good \"bowl\" and enchiladas. Was on food  channel!  Prices very good too!"}
{"text":"I give 4 stars because this is the best airport food I have ever had, and especially for the price. Most airports offer small sizes and everything tastes processed.   At Los Taquitos I watched them make my good food, in a timely manner, and it tastes great. The staff was friendly even during a morning rush also! I had the crane Assad breakfast burrito and it was great. Also, you get to choose between red and green salsa if you choose. I chose green and was pleased with it.  I'd recommend this over the McDonalds you will end up spending the same amount at."}
{"text":"Solid three star airport food -- definitely get the AZ style burrito if you come here. The quesadilla is fine but wouldn't be enough to satisfy anything more than a small appetite. The AZ burrito has potatoes inside the burrito and then comes with a side of rice and beans."}
{"text":"My coworkers go to Los Taquitos for the women, I go to Los Taquitos for the tacos. Specifically, the hard shell tacos. They are literally the best hard shell tacos I have ever had in my entire life. Carne asada, chicken, fish, it doesn't matter, they're all delicious and incredibly flavorful.  There is nothing glamorous at all about this place. Strip mall location, plastic tables and silverware, whole nine yards.  That said, the food really is fantastic and the price is right. I usually get out of there at lunch somewhere between $6-$8 and I aint mad at that.  Just do yourself a favor and don't go during the week their episode airs on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives on the Food Network as the line is out the door."}
{"text":"Love this place and am so glad they opened a mile from my house! Last night I had the green chili pork bowl, man was it delicious but better than that was the happy hour house margarita! Crazy great!  I will be back over and over.  I personally would like it if they opened at 6 am for breakfast then I could go there before golf."}
{"text":"The pastor taco & beans were good but stay away from the salsas & carnitas; too sweet no heat & carnitas were dry...also one of the girls was quite rude don't know if I'll be back ???"}
{"text":"Los Taquitos location C terminal Gate 3.  Counter service - 5 stars. Wonderfully friendly counter girl.  $6 Egg & Chorizo breakfast burrito - 3 stars. Most flour tortilla. Very little egg and chorizo. Average airport fair for the price.  Papas side - 1 star. All we could taste was salt. We both threw them out."}
{"text":"I ordered 3 tacos; carnitas, fish and Al pastor. The carnitas was a little too wet, making for a soggy taco. The fish is grilled, not fried. (I prefer fried myself, but it was still damn good) The Al Pastor was probably the best I've ever had"}
{"text":"Food was delicious!!! But service was bad. It was my first time here & I was ordering for my office. When I got there to pick up our order the lady at the front was not friendly didn't even smile ( there was NO line either). I asked for menus to go and salsa. She stated menus were up front I explained I didn't see any as it was my first time here then the salsa part, I tried to ask what kind she turned her back to me & just threw in some. Then when I get back to the office they only sent 2 items in my bag!!! I ordered for 5 people!!!! At least the girl on the phone when I called was nice and apologized for the error on the food"}
{"text":"Great food. Can't get enough. I've had the tortas a couple of times and they are amazing. The pasole is unbelievable, but it is a large portion. I'd recommend sharing a small order of pasole and a torta. I've had the tacos, but they weren't my favorite."}
{"text":"I'm hopelessly addicted to their carne asada tacos. I have failed to find any better at any other place in town. I am a loyal regular customer now."}
{"text":"We tried Los Taquitos over the weekend.  We had the green chili pork burrito with a shrimp, pollo and asada taco.  The burrito was very tasty, lots of flavor and not too spicy.  Tacos were small (street tacos). They came with beans and rice.  I wanted black beans but don't remember if I ordered them or not but when we got home, we had refried... They were ok... Nothing special.    I would recommend the green chili pork burrito!!"}
{"text":"Eat here regularly and have for years now.  It's definitely the BEST Mexican food in Phoenix.  Newly remodeled, they've increased the seating capacity greatly.  They've also increased the counter space as well, so 2 people can order at once now.  Their AZ Burrito, smothered with Green Chili sauce, is to die for.  I honestly have NEVER had anything on the menu over the years that I didn't like!  GREAT CHOICE!"}
{"text":"Simply put, amazing! Best carnitas I've ever eaten! Street tacos are fantastic. Try the trainer salad if you are watching your carb intake. Don't be put off by the mini-mall locale, this place is legit!"}
{"text":"Went there after seeing DDD and Guy was right, best tacos ever.  Red salsa was hot but yummy.  If we ever come back to AZ, this will be the first place we hit.  Pastor and carne asada tacos were amazing."}
{"text":"Very good service. Fun, casual ambiance. Clean restaurant. All the food was flavorful, down to the rice and beans. They also have Mexican Coke. :)"}
{"text":"I always forget how much I love this little slice of heaven until I walk through the unassuming door and voialla, \"oh yeah, that's right, this place rocks!\" It seems many more folks have found this hidden gem because they were super slammed at lunch today. Service was still friendly and fast! Winning!"}
{"text":"The amazing part about Terminal 4 in Sky Harbor is you get a great sample of the local PHX flavor instead of your everyday McDonald's, Jamba Juice, etc. commonplace in US airports.   I'm a card carrying, verified Los Taquitos addict, and know they've been here for a while. Decided to grab a bite on my way out to Albuquerque this afternoon to see how it compared to their Ahwatukee and Phoenix locations.   If you're going to take anything way from my review, let it be this: This location is absolutely NOTHING like the flagship (if you don't count the food truck) locations.  Sure, the menu looks almost identical: Breakfast Burritos and Tortas, the infamous Street Tacos and Quesadillas.   The food even looks the same.   Yes, I realize this is airport food, but the only thing from a quality control standpoint that tastes the same are the roja y verde salsas.   I went with the 3 Street Tacos Combo and a Large Water Bottle for a total of $12.13.   The tortillas were sad and cold.   The beans were playdoh-esque, cold and the rice had way way WAY too much seasoning.   All of the meats were lukewarm. The Pollo was dry and crumbly, the Carne Asada lacked that vibrant spice we all know LT by, and the Carnitas were also missing that unique spice.   I will say though, the Carnitas was the most moist of the three.   Sad, wilted cilantro and onions were scattered on haphazardly.   What a disappointment. This is one of my favorite taco places in town, and it's a shame they're misrepresenting their product here.   This would have been a one star review if we're going off food quality only; however, the team was really hustling, the gal was taking orders was cheery, and the manager took time to chat with me.   Come on, Los Taquitos family - Take a look at quality control, I know y'all are worlds better than this."}
{"text":"Dear Los Taquitos,   When I saw your \"Coming soon!\" sign pop up in the Whole Foods Plaza, my heart overflowed with joy.  Your Ahwatukee location has captivated my heart and ruled my appetite at the first sign of a Mexi-craving the past two and a half years.   I have inhaled more Carne Asada Street Tacos, psh, any Street Tacos, Bombero Burritos, Tamales and Enchiladas than I care to admit.   Your Airport location is not an accurate representation of who you truly are. All kinds of horrific.    This Chandler location though?  Without a doubt, true to you. Consistent product no matter what you order.   A bigger location means less hectic than the Ahwatukee one (the wait increased due to the expansion in their location strangely enough), and we've dropped in at peak lunch rush hours without much incident.  You're beautiful just the way you are, Los Taquitos.   Please don't ever change.   Fondly,   Meg"}
{"text":"I'm still trying to figure out how I lived seven-ish years in Ahwatukee, and somehow missed out on Los Taquitos!   Came here a few weeks back with Yelpers Monica O., Cheryl B., Shannon E. and Rick N. for a lovely workday lunch.   If it's your first visit, you absolutely MUST try the infamous street tacos.   My first go, I tried the Carne Asada, Pollo, and Fish three taco meal with rice and beans.   They were all delicious, but the Carne Asada was the star. Some of the best I've had in a long time. The spices worked well together, and no tough pieces were to be found.   The Red Salsa they top everything with is nothing short of amazing. It's not blazing hot, but tastes great.   I enjoyed it so much I dragged my Dude back out a Saturday that same week, where we discovered the Carnitas are right up there with the Carne Asada!   Very tender, and it tasted like some type of apple and brown sugar rub was used.   And again for another workday lunch when I got stuck on a client call and missed a vendor provided lunch.  This place is small and gets packed at high noon quickly.  Call it a dive; call it a dump. If you're coming here for ambiance (not delicious tacos), you're doing it wrong!  I look forward to trying other menu offerings at Los Taquitos, but for now, I'm hung up on those amazing street tacos.  Update 9/18: Tried the Bombero Burrito con Pollo. Do not order this if you hate spicy; also, it's massive (see photos) so SHARE. Barely ate half! Was able to sample the Vegetarian tacos, also delicious."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite small restaurant for Mexican food! I have been here 3 times and liked everything I ordered. The chile relleno burrito is great. The Arizona burrito is really a treat with the added pieces of bacon inside the burrito with potato and meat. I went last Friday for a business lunch and had the tacos. They are to die for! Ok!  fellow gringo's don't forget to ask for some limes to squeeze on top of your food. It will really give your food that bam!"}
{"text":"To begin with, I have eaten here a number of times and had good experiences both with the food and the service. But on the most recent visit (on a taco tuesday), I requested a vegetarian taco for the $1 tuesday deal. They said that the vegetarian taco was not included for the tuesday thing, and could not really explain why that would be. it seemed crappy to me that one of the few places that serve vegetarian tacos would not include them on taco tuesday. thanks a lot.  I was disappointed, but after making a quick complaint regarding this, we ordered food and sat down. when our food was ready, I noticed that the tostada I ordered had a good deal of watery substance on the plate under the tostada. I ended up returning it for a refund, and decided not to order anything else. My wife's food was ok, but overall the trip there ended up being a mistake. the manager was not friendly (never smiles. ever.), and was not receiving their guests in a courteous way. and the staff is somewhat inept, if friendly. proficient and friendly customer service is getting harder and harder to find in this town, you really have to wonder at the choices that some of the establishments make for management. are they purposefully picking the stodgiest, unfriendliest, coldest people available?"}
{"text":"The smallest taquitos ever. Ive ate many tacos in mexico and this tacos are way to small"}
{"text":"Visited this place for dinner during a business trip since it was near my hotel. It seems to be a local fast food chain. Solid food, several choice and good price. I had the taco platter with three different meats (lengua, al pastor, and steak) and they were all good. Rice was somewhat bland. I can eat here again but wouldn't go out of my way to go back."}
{"text":"Came on Taco Tuesday for lunch. The line (and wait) was long, but the tacos (pastor, carnitas, and chicken) were excellent and for only a buck - a steal. The free salsas were great too. Overall, a very happy person for $3.25."}
{"text":"Not Mexican at all. Kinda pricy. Way too pricy for the taste. Wouldn't go there again."}
{"text":"I had a layover in Phoenix and was looking for four thinks: a Starbucks mug, a Suns t-shirt, something to eat and a beer.  If you were hoping I could accomplish all four goals at Los Taquitos, I'm sorry to disappoint you.   I ordered an AZ style carne asada burrito and it was the shit! It came complete with rice, beans and two sauces. All of it was outstanding and provided the base I'll need for a night in Vegas. I washed it all down with a tasty Hop Street beer. I couldn't have asked for a better airport stop. Well, unless they had Suns shirts. But alas, they did not."}
{"text":"Taco tuesday.  1.00 street tacos. Pretty good for Phoenix.  They are busy and the food is fresh.  Corn tortillas.  The salsa is a little too scarce. Skip the chips and salsa."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good! I love their tacos de carne asada and lengua! If you love spicy salsa then you need to try the habanero sauce! Their enchiladas were alright...but their sopes are really good! Even the regular red and green salsas are delicious. A mexican food restaurant is NOTHING if they don't have good salsas...so that should tell you something about this place :D Definitely will keep coming!"}
{"text":"Yum! Taco Tuesday $1 but on other days they are $1.75. Great selection -asada, carnita, pastor, lengua, fish - all of them are great Best red menudo in phoenix and it's served everyday Kids menu is great! Reasonable prices"}
{"text":"Customer service was phenomenal and I appreciate all the ladies for their great attitudes.   So I'm a Los Angeles Native and personally, idk why I keep buying mexican food from other states. I tried their carnitas and it just wasn't good for me. Might be good for others but nope. The carne asada is ok but a bit salty. I ended up getting a quesadilla which ran me $11 w/ drink. I wish i just got the cheese quesadilla because it tastes great without any meat.   I don't see myself trying this again but thank you for allowing me to try it on such a busy day."}
{"text":"Could not have been happier that they were open cinco de drinko!  I'm always down for a chile relleño burrito or a bombero burrito.  Plus, any authentic Mexican place KNOWS to have Fanta on the soda machine. They have this on lock.  Great job guys!"}
{"text":"Cool casual place that is clean, newer, and upscale for a quick lunch.  I love their carne asada tacos and that is pretty much why I go here.  They are seasoned heavily just like I love them with corn tortillas.  You order up at the counter and pick up your food but it looks like a service style restaurant because it is so upscale.  There is a bar and I am sure it gets busy in the evening but I live no where close to this so I wouldn't know.  Great little stop."}
{"text":"Wow! I had heard of this place on diners, drive ins and dives. We were in the area so we stopped in. I'm so happy we did. The food was so delicious. I had the beef flautas meal with rice and beans. The husband had a carne asado burrito. We split a carne street taco, best I've ever had. They give you your own hot sauce bottle,  which is great cause I can never have enough. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Delicious food and sauces. The service was a tad slow but not unbearable. We will be back."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly impressed. The food all taste fresh and there were generous portions of protein which I can definitely appreciate. The price was fair as well. I tried three different types of meat and my favorite meat is their red chili beef.   My complaints, when your order is ready, the hostess/cashier stands at the end of the counter and screams out the order number in a very screechy annoying voice which takes away from the ambience. In my opinion, the music type isn't suitable for the style or cuisine of restaurant."}
{"text":"Okay so I'm a mexican woman from socal, so my expectations for mexican food are HIGH as heck. I've tried out every \"5 star\" place on Yelp, and they were trash. From a mexican woc, THIS is AUTHENTIC MEXICAN FOOD ! Their tacos are 12/10 and their rice and beans are amazing! Definitely going back!"}
{"text":"Authentic food. A little pricey but worth it and the quantities are large. Highly recommend the Mexican tacos. The frozen margaritas are strongest I've ever had... Like seriously the must lose money on the amount of tequila they put in those things. Try one but be prepared to need a DD."}
{"text":"We eat at Los Taquitos once  a week! I always get the same thing...3 shrimp street tacos, hold the pico. They are so fresh and full of flavor. The shrimpys have perfect grill marks on them. My husband gets the street tacos, but loads up on the meat ones...pollo, asada, barbacoa and carnitas and he devours them. The verde and red salsas that we pour onto each taco have a kick and great flavor. Don't pass on a Happy Hour margarita while you're there either. For $4.00, you get one of the best margs of your life. They are from scratch and contain zero artificial sweeteners or nasty sweet & sour mix.   My only complaint so far is weak guacamole. It makes me sad to type that, but it's true. The guac is kind of watery and flavorless. If they would improve the guac, this place could take over the world."}
{"text":"Bottom Line:  Grumpy employees, slow service, greasy food and disgustingly dirty.  I was desperately hungry for lunch so decided to get a quesadilla at Lost Taquitos. In hindsight, I would have been just getting some snacks at the local magazine store.  I was able to order quickly but it took a long time for my food to come up which consistence of a steak quesadilla and some hot sauce.  Some vegetables with this would have been awesome.  I think it was supposed to come with pico de gallo.  Also, a smear of guac could have really livened this dish up.  Heck, some lettuce and tomatoes inside the quesadilla would have been good too.  There wasn't anywhere to sit which is probably ok since there are literally inches of dust hanging on the exposed sealing overhead.  I took my greasy quesadilla to go but not before heading past the adjacent restaurant to the soda machine which was Pepsi.  Bleh."}
{"text":"Not too shabby. This place has burritos, tacos, tortas and breakfast options. They are pretty reasonably priced as well. Ordered a Chorizo Torta and it comes with refried beans and Spanish Rice. $8.49 for that was incredibly fair. The Torta bread was soft and allowed the meats and veggies to shine. The bummer was the chorizo because it was carnitas. Oh well didn't realize the mistake until I was In the air over Dallas. The meal was good just be sure to check your order."}
{"text":"Our family ate dinner at Los Taquitos tonight after watching the great review it got on Food Network's program, \"Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives.\"  The review by Guy Fierri was right on point. We had quite a variety from the menu starting with the Shrimp burrito that my youngest pronounced \"Oh, yummy!\" to the delicious red menudo thick with honeycomb tripas and a side of red onions, lime slices, and cilantro. My older daughter stated \"I'm just a menudo kind of girl,\" as she slurped down every last bit from the huge bowl she ordered. There was even  a  hot fresh tortilla to nibble on the side as well as home made pickled hot carrot slivers, jalapenos, and fresh cut lime quarters.  I ordered the Chimichanga dinner made with the succulant pork ala Pastor. The chimi was huge, very crunchy to the last bite, and loaded with fork tender chunks of pork and spices. Hubby had the three enchilada  dinner made with beef. The rice and beans were fairly typical Mexican restraunt fare, but the red and green sauces (which I believe were home made) and the special care that our server gave us more than made up for the so-so sides. And anyway, who cares about sides when the meats were all done with such care and tasted so wonderful? The only thing lacking at Los Taquitos is about 10 more tables as they are going to be so busy!!!!"}
{"text":"Very good.  The bombero burrito was the perfect level of spicy and the service was fast.  I liked the decor as well."}
{"text":"Just moved to this side of town and happy to have found this place. The food is great! I had the asada burrito. The meat was perfect, not that chewy crap. I went on a tuesday for my 1st time and holy cow was it busy. There was limited seating. Had to wait for a table to clear. Will be back!"}
{"text":"Best tacos. Great service good bunch of servers murals are amazing good artwork great for lunch or dinner.  Open late tastes oh so great..  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Was excited to see this restaurant opened a new location close to my house. Came in for happy hour around 5:30pm on a Friday. Not too many people in the place. We ordered 2 house margaritas, shrimp bowl, chips n salsa, and 3 street taco plate. Took almost 20 min to get our food and they forgot our margaritas. So we got those after our food. Food was good but nothing to write home about. I think the prices are a little high for the amount you get. There also needs to be a sign that says where the line begins because there was a lot of confusion amongst costumers of where to go to order. I definitely think the location on Elliott is better but I hope this new location gets better with time."}
{"text":"The quesadillas was ver dry and no flavor.  I ordered the carne asada quesadillas for $8.79.  'You get what you pay for'. The meat was very dry, almost like beef jerky.  If it wasn't for the cheese and the free mild salsa, I would've sent it back.  Don't order the carne asada quesadilla, you're better off with cheese quesadilla."}
{"text":"One of the rare reviews that I'm writing right after eating, and still sitting in the restaurant.  I ordered the Asada Taco plate, three fantastic tacos, good rice and excellent beans.  On top of that I ordered one pollo tamale on the side.  OMG it has been too long since I've had a good tamale.  Even the ice tea is fresh and tasty.  Highly recommend, and definitely worth the drive from south Chandler!"}
{"text":"The food may be good but it's not worth the abusive treatment by the woman placing our order. Sorry we wanted to spend our money here- won't happen again."}
{"text":"I'm from Mexico and you can hardly find a clean and simple taste like this taquitos. There are many places with great food, but many of them with too much condiments,  this concept and the food taste is good. The horchata water has the right cinnamon taste. Tortillas are not good. The pinto beans are \"street beans\" flavor.  The chicken tacos are my favorite. Sometimes the food comes out a bit salty, but overall it's good fast-food. The 2 choice of salsas compliment very well!"}
{"text":"I've only had the \"street\" tacos here and they are delicious and quite authentic! Some say the tacos are small but that is actually normal size in Mexico for \"street\" tacos (in Mexico they just call them tacos), and the price is pretty reasonable. It should take about 4 for a decent meal but I usually end up getting 6 or more just because they are so good. I've tried the carne asada, pastor, carnitas, and chicken tacos and they are all very good, with carne asada being my fave. Each taco consists of your choice of meat on double corn tortillas, topped with fresh onions and cilantro. I like that they keep it simple like it should be. They have bottles of green and red salsa made in-house, and some delicious marinated/pickled carrots, for you to self-serve.  I should note that they literally just increased their prices as of today (Tuesday 5/24/15). I went in for Taco Tuesday expecting to get them at $1 each, but they were increased to $1.25. Regular (non Taco Tuesday) prices went from $1.50 to $1.75 each (excluding seafood). Taco Tuesday applies to chicken, pastor and carnitas but not carne asada nor seafood items."}
{"text":"Looks just like the other location, hope it tastes the same!   Still going with the terrible music - not sure what they are going for by playing all the songs you hoped to never hear again! Food is totally worth it!  Taco Tuesday's are the best deal in town. $1/ea for their awesome tacos. The carnitas are killer, but try them all for that price!"}
{"text":"Hip little Mexican restaurant.  Local place featured on Diners, Drive Inns and Dives years ago.  Located in a little strip mall, it is unassuming from the outside.   The interior has pretty basic seating, but brightly painted 'Day of the Dead' themed murals on the walls which were pretty cool.  Order at the counter, and they call your number when it's ready.  Nothing fancy, but it fits the bill just fine.  'Semi-fast food' joint but with booze :)  I ordered the Carnitas Bowl, along with a Margarita and a beer (what, I was thirsty!) The Carnitas Bowl was flavorful and fresh, and was great washed down with a cold cerveza.  Definitely a great little place to add a quick bite."}
{"text":"Awesome street tacos. You get a fair amount of food for what you are paying for. Not the best guacamole I have had but the tacos make up for it."}
{"text":"Los Taquitos has the best sopes in town!  I first saw them on Diners dine ins and Dives and have been a regular ever since.  When they remodeled last year that made them even better."}
{"text":"This food is amazing. Taste so good!! Always my top spot to eat when I'm near chandler."}
{"text":"Saw this on Triple D and decided to try while in Phoenix for a visit on 3/22/14. First off, the girl who took our order was super nice and very helpful, so good start to the visit. I had the grilled shrimp street tacos.  I was surprised that they do not have cabbage on hand, but other than that the taco's were flavorful and good.  We have a place here in So Cal called Chronic Taco that does them better, but I would still order again.  My son and spouse had carne asada street taco's and they both enjoyed.  Again, tho, they were both able to say that other places we go to are better, but that they were still good.  My spouse also had a carne asada burrito which he enjoyed. Overall, not a beautiful place, but we usually find that to be the case with really good Mexican food.  Go where the food is good, not the décor.  We also went to Roberto's while in Phoenix and we would choose Los Taquito's to go back to again.  Prices were pretty consistent with what we would pay at other places."}
{"text":"Perfect late night meal! Got in just before they closed at 9pm...super clean, modern, and worthy of more than just a quick take out stop.     Didn't see any taquitos on the menu...might have been the evening of beverage sampling that was catching up to me. Ended up with a lengua/carnitas burro and Jeannie chose two street fish tacos....both orders were super tasty!   Need to hit this for lunch, or maybe some menudo for breakfast, one day!"}
{"text":"I wanted to try something new, and didn't want to see my high-school sweetheart on the other corner. Now I'm coming back to review LT, and I see \"update review\". Wait, have I met this one before? Definitely a lot has changed since then and I didn't even recognize it.  The breakfast burrito with carne asada was piping hot, the cheese was properly melted and the potatoes stayed warm down to the last bite. I'd say solid work on everything everything except the carne asada. A few too many pieces of meat were either too chewy or too fatty. Both salsas were fantastic. Red: smoky, balanced chipotle peppers, plenty of heat; Green: much more subtle in heat and flavor, but still worth putting a few splashes of it on parts of your burrito. I only wish they kept the salsas on ice, but having individual bottles to take to your table is also nice. At $4-4.50 for just eggs+potatoes and $6.50ish for eggs+steak, I think the portion size is just a hair too small. Don't get me wrong, it tastes fantastic and it was definitely filling, but other places don't mess around with portions.   I'd say its a solid 4/5. I haven't had as much Tex Mex due to living in NE, so I might be overinflating, but I also think the carne asada could use some work. It all balances."}
{"text":"Al pastor done right! I loved the food at the Ahwatukee location and was excited that they opened a restaurant in Chandler. I was famished and ordered an al pastor burrito combo to go. It was made in only a few short minutes and I was on my way!  The burrito was as good as I remember the al pastor at the Ahwatukee location. The marinated pork was tender with a slight amount of crispness along the edges. The flavor was deep, rich, earthy, with a tropical twist from the addition of pineapple. It was hearty and packed with meat, onions and sauce. The rice and beans were good too, and I was stuffed after eating half my meal. The total was a little less than $10. The order didn't come with any napkins or forks/knives in my to-go bag but since I was going straight home it was OK.  This location has a nicer layout and is newer so it's a definite winner for tasty Mexican food in Chandler."}
{"text":"I was in the search for a good al pastor burrito, and I found just what I was looking for here at Los Taquitos! It was perfectly seasoned, with a slightly tropical twist of pineapple added to the meat and marinade. It was a sizable portion, especially since I ordered it enchilada style, smothered with some deep, rich tasting red chile sauce.  Service was fast and friendly. Unfortunately, the soda fountain was out of order as the Diet Coke fountain only spurted out soda water.   Overall, this is a great choice if you want filling and reasonably priced Mexican food."}
{"text":"Los Taquitos isn't really a place you go to eat eat side since there isn't really room to sit. The food is decently priced but the portions are pretty small compared to filibertos. The only reason I come back and pay more is because the quality is better. The tortillas are amazing as well as the beans. Filibs can't even compete in the area. The staff isn't really friendly but they also aren't rude. They are just in between. I will keep coming back for the flavor that you don't get at most other tiny fast food joints. Based on the many phone orders my friends and I have ordered over the years they usually mess it up in one way or another so be careful."}
{"text":"Never, I mean never come here! To begin with this place rapes you and they got my gf order wrong and gave it to another costumer, what blows my mind was there was 4 workers and they still couldn't make it right! And the manager was looking at his workers and arguing with them and he never looked at us and apologized, we ate our food cause we starving!!!!"}
{"text":"BEST breakfast burrito (Potato, egg and cheese people!) I've had in a very long time :-) Add the carne asada and double yummy. Amazing food and made to order Mexican! This is a great little spot for a quick bite."}
{"text":"Los Taquitos, we have a history.   I have dined LT before all the new locations, before the remodels, before they wee featured on Diners, Drive-In's and Dives with Guy Fieri.  I knew long ago they were special when I had my boyfriend pull over at the circle K because I needed more to drink because my mouth was on fire from their red salsa.  The locations and remodels are so beyond well deserved!  We wanted to get dinner tonight and I was craving Maskadores, my husband is not hooked yet so we chose our safe zone, Los Taquitos. Lucky us, it was Happy Hour! (My favorite time of day, amirite?)  We ordered 3 street tacos each, 2 kid meals, a house margarita and an IPA. BAM!  Dinner is served--- The food is flavorful, the pastor is SO yummy I regret not choosing all 3 tacos 'pastor but I decided to mix it up and order shrimp & fish also.  My only peeve of the night is they don't clarify if you want 'a la carte' or a meal. My husband and I just go for the tacos, rice & beans are extra carbs we can live without (Yea, I said it). So, $40 later, we are content, the service is great during dinner, lunch is hit or miss on service but this has been a long awaited review and I'm sure I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"You are better off eating gum off the airport carpet.   Let's start with the 2 cashiers, one from nocawich and they other from los taquitos (Marie)...conversation as we are ordering: Nocawich: You didn't get in Trouble for your nails? Maria: Fuck them, they can't tell me how to do my nails. Hang on, I'll tell you in a minute.   Next, we were served 2 burrito bowls and both were filled with uncooked, teeth cracking rice. No thanks, those for returned.   And the topper...as we are waiting for our quesadilla, something without rice, one of the cooks is standing there eating his boxed candy next to the actual guy doing his job. Then he loads printer paper, doesn't wash his hands, puts one glove on, and then uses his gloved hand to pour more candy in the ungloved hand to feed himself. Lastly, he places a glove on his ungloved, sugar covered hand and proceeds to prep food.   Well done!"}
{"text":"Awesome lunch prices. Love the tacos, rice and beans, carne asada- it's all good! Yummy horchata!"}
{"text":"I've been going Los Taquitos for over a decade for the delicious food but the last 3 times I've eaten there the service has been atrocious. Tonight I called in an order for my family and it took an hour for them to complete. They offered to pay for my meal but I chose to pay for it myself and have made the decision to never go back. Seems that since they were on Triple D the service has gone down the tubes...."}
{"text":"I wasn't sure what to give Los Taquitos, 3 or 4 stars. Maybe 3.5. I had flautas with rice and beans. Flautas were pretty good, but c'mon, your rice and bean were bluuugh. I poured salsa over it to make it edible. Hubby ordered chili verde and enjoyed it tremendously. Don't bother with the rice and beans."}
{"text":"One of my all time favorites and the closest thing to authentic Mexican food I've seen in a restaurant (and being 100% Mexican American with a mother who is a great cook, I am PICKY about Mexican food). Do yourself a favor and try their lengua tacos. Long story short, though, I've never had a bad meal here!"}
{"text":"This place never fails to satisfy.  I've been here twice, once as it was originally set up and once after the remodel.  The food quality is just as good as it ever was.  What should you get?   Well, how about whatever you want.  It's all good."}
{"text":"I was excited to see Los Taquitos basically in my backyard. I have tried both the grilled fish and al pastor burritos. The grilled fish has good flavor, but was slightly too dry in my opinion. I had to add extra salsa. The al pastor on the other hand was delicious: well-marinated and perfectly cooked. On one occasion, my rice was undercooked. The portions are smaller than most divey, Mexican fast food restaurants. Overall, Los Taquitos is a good choice: not amazing, not bad."}
{"text":"Barely edible. Cold rice, cold beans, carne asada tacos obviously made hours ago, and also cold. Messy condiment station & out of napkins. I get it, you're in an airport so your stuck, but skip this place."}
{"text":"Street tacos to die for.  The Carne Asada is smokey, spicy, and freaking delicious.  The red sauce on the burro was great as well.  All the food was spicy not bland, the beans and rice were wonderful.  Lots of people in the line but it clears in about 10 minutes from line to order to eating.  Definitely worth a try."}
{"text":"Delicious freshly made breakfast tacos on homemade tortillas with excellent salsa to boot!!"}
{"text":"Said they open at 0600. At 0610 I asked if they were open after ignoring the line that had formed and I was told 5 more minutes. At 0620 they had still not opened. I was hoping to catch breakfast before an early flight but I wasted all the time I had in line. At this place."}
{"text":"A local favorite of mine. I especially like the street tacos, the AZ burrito, and breakfast burrito.  Everything seems fresh.  A good value for the money. Good Mexican beer selection."}
{"text":"We were on vacation in the area, and went there 3 times in 5 days. I couldn't get enough of the food here. The chiliquilis were heaven on a plate, with homemade tortillas and house made salsa verde. The portions were extremely generous for the price and the service was fast and friendly. Not a destination to if you want tons of ambiance, but if you want quality, homemade Mexican food, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time tonight. We ordered the carne asada taco meal, super nacho's, a kids meal chicken taco, a cheese quesadilla, and chips with salsa. Everything was great my daughter enjoyed her kids meal and the price was right for the amount of food she received. The taco meal was very filling and the green salsa was really good. I would for sure return here for taco Tuesday or a margarita. The girl behind the counter was very friendly polite. Love the decor and the seating was very open."}
{"text":"This was my first time visit at the Chandler location. They are every bit as good as the Ahwatukee location. I got my standard carne asada burrito Arizona style. Fantastic!!! The salsa was awesome! They need to bottle it and sell it. This is a 5-star review."}
{"text":"I drove from Prescott to try this place.  I was going to be in Phoenix that day and needed to try something other than my usual DDD place, Chino Bandido.  Let me start by saying that I love Guy's suggestions for the most part.  Salsa Brava in Flagstaff is excellent.  Everything Guy described and more.  The same goes for Chino Bandido in Phoenix, it's just as he described.  I tried Roberto's at the gas station that was also highlighted on DDD.  It's slightly better than Los Taquitos.  First off, Los Taquitos had no fountain soda, it was out of order. I ordered the 3 taco plate because the atmosphere was questionable.  The place wasn't as clean as I would like so I wanted to order safe.  My husband ordered the relleno plate.  My taco shells were burnt.  His relleno was soggy.  The only good part was the rice and beans.  I didn't see any chips and salsa on the menu either.  The bathroom was pretty bad too.  The floor was filthy and there was a hole in the wall that was stuffed with t.p. Don't get me wrong, I can slum it for some great authentic food but I don't see the appeal of Los Taquitos.  I felt ripped off and regret going."}
{"text":"I wouldn't go to the extremes reviewing this place. This is just a typical, airport-style burrito place. It's mediocre, yet totally edible. It does taste like Mexican food, it's quite cheap and the portions are generous. If you fly Southwest, they are really close to their gates. And they are pretty fast."}
{"text":"I've never had such horrible service especially in an airport. It took 28 mins to get my food. No space to even wait for it without standing outside the entire premise of the food area. I checked on my order 20 mins in and he said it's \"coming up next\" then 5-6 people who ordered AFTER me were still getting their food in the meantime. People that ordered 15 MINS after me were getting there food plenty before me. The lady who took my order was a snot and didn't seem to care about anything in the world, hardly communicated. Then ending it with them at the end was ridiculous. My first experience here 3 months ago was \"okay\" but definitely not wasting my time there again the next time around."}
{"text":"Decided to go here because it is close to my work and has great reviews. Was extremely happy I picked this place. The service was awesome. So nice and quick. I ordered the pollo bowl. It was so good and filling. It feels a lot healthier than a chipotle bowl. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Very good . . .although, probably not as good as food channel said.  Tacos and chimichanga are fantastic!"}
{"text":"Oh Los Taquitos how you have worked your way into a special place in Mi Corazon!!   I absolutely love this place.  I literally want to move to the area just so I can spend all my hard earned money here.    They are always super friendly and no matter when you come in or how busy they are.  The food is outstanding.  From the breakfast burritos, the Huevos Rancheros are some of the best in the valley.    The Carne Asada burrito is excellent, made with good quality meat and well seasoned.  The tacos, oh the TACOS!!!!    And to top it all off they have a small bar area and a decent happy hour.  Salud!"}
{"text":"Sweet Jesus, yum. Carne Asada Quesdilla with extra cheese. Grab a bottle of their exquisite green hot sauce and you're in heaven. I'd sell my soul to have a lifetime guaranteed supply. Oh, and cheap, too! Oh, their beans are friggin insane..."}
{"text":"Some of the best street tacos in Phoenix.There are several factors here including the price. You can pay upwards of $7 for a street taco in Scottsdale that will be overly complicated and not as good as these which 1/3 the price. The carne asada, carnitas and marinated pork tacos are both flavorful and tender, I suggest using some of the green and red sauce they provide to add flavor with a squeeze of lemon. If you haven't ever tried Lengua (cow tongue) this is the place to try it but I prefer the others mentioned above. The homemade tortillas are always soft yet don't fall apart. Love this place for street tacos."}
{"text":"I've driven by this place everyday for a month waiting for this location to open. Food was just as delicious as the other locations (fish tacos, carnitas taco, carne asada tostada)."}
{"text":"I went to this place because of the reviews. Maybe my expectations were too high. My usual standard that I judge a Mexican restaurant by are its chips/salsa and a beef burrito. I have to say the chips were some of the worse chips I have ever had. They were extremely dry and seemed old. The salsa was more of a pico and again very dry. Mostly chopped tomato and onion. The burrito could not have been more disappointing. The tortilla again seemed old and dry (sorry about the theme here...but dry was the theme of the night) and while I ordered the burrito wet, not only did they not put enough sauce on it, the flavor was mediocre. The beef was actually pretty good, but again...a little dry."}
{"text":"A great little place. Super food, lively service, and fast service for lunch. They also have options for vegetarians which is sometimes hard to find at some Mex restaurants."}
{"text":"MmmMm! I love this place. They have wonderful food. Although if you come here during a lunch or dinner rush be prepared to wait because this place gets super busy and crowded but it's so worth the wait.  I got their tacos and some chips and salsa and guacamole. Omg, so delicious. I can't wait for the chandler location to open so I can try them for lunch when I'm working, yay!! Also I absolutely love the art work they did to the inside, it's very SoCal and makes me feel like I'm back in San Diego. Very very good, I will keep coming back!"}
{"text":"Came here for taco Tuesday last night and had a good meal. Chicken, pork, and one other taco were on special for 1$ a piece. I ended up having steak, fish, and pork. Pork to me was the best and had best flavor. All tacos were pretty small but good. Got chips and salsa as well.  Chips seemed to be homemade. Very good. Salsa was very much like described, more of a pico de Gallo but had good flavor.  Rice was a little plain but good. Would recommend. Very busy on Tuesdays though so call ahead if you can."}
{"text":"(Leaning more towards 3.5 stars rather than 3, but not quite a 4.)  Finally stopped by after their renovations and it looks nice!  They've definitely expanded and they added a ton more seating.  I love that they kept the murals on the walls, cause to be honest, that was the best part of their decor.  Their menu is a little hard to read and that might hold up the line, so guys and ladies of Los Taquitos, if you're reading this,  laminated menus at the start of the line might be a nice touch?  Customer service, once again, wasn't great, but I've lowered my expectations since my last visit.  However, I was pretty taken aback when a very cheery and polite lady handed us our food to go.  I almost wanted to thank her for actually smiling but that probably crosses some sort of line between normal and creepy so I kept my mouth shut.  Food, food, food.  My boyfriend got the burrito bowl, which was a little smaller than expected, but still tasted great.  Was expecting beans and rice on the side, but since you already get beans and rice in the bowl, I guess you don't get more (yes, I'm greedy).  I need to read that menu again.  The tamales with beans and rice were good, tamales a little dry and crumbly and needed some reheating by the time I got home (probably takes us 10 minutes to get home).  I am in love with their red salsa though.  It has a little bit of a kick, and everyone needs a little spice in their life.  Word of advice, don't do takeout.  It's still good, but from my experience, it tastes a ton better fresh.  Plus, soak up the atmosphere - it's a much livelier place than the hole in the wall it was before.  Though I kinda liked that hole in the wall...dammit, nostalgia!"}
{"text":"Los Taquitos is the best. Have been coming here for over 16 years and I just love their food.  Check out their delicious street tacos, bombaro burrito and tostada. This family-owned restaurant makes all of its own suaces (my favorite is the red) and they're so tasty. Also be sure to ask for their spiced carrots and homemade Pico de gallo.   Stop in for Taco Tuesday sometime and you may even find me there chomping down some street tacos.  Highly-recommended!"}
{"text":"My husband lived in Phoenix for a couple years so whenever we come and visit this is a pit stop. As of today we won't be coming back. The food didn't taste the same. The place got remodeled and is hip. But the food just doesn't taste like the authentic Mexican food we used to have. Really dissapointed. Looks like the original owners might no longer be there because the food is different."}
{"text":"Five stars .... Especially on taco Tuesday!!! The food is simply amazing! Authentic, flavorful and yummy!! The only reason it didn't receive five stars was because there is not enough seating during busy times and the service was friendly but slow."}
{"text":"BOLD flavors without apology. I love this place.  I moved to Michigan and missed the Smokey flavor of their tacos and red salsa. Moved back to AZ and had a great meal."}
{"text":"I was at the airport and saw they had a location in the airport.  I usually order a burrito with only rice and beans but I was told at the airport location they only had what was on the menu board.  I guess it's too difficult to just scoop beans and rice in a tortilla."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quick delicious bite.  I got the three street tacos and side of guac all for 6 bucks.  Not alot of seating but folks seem to cycle out.  Definitely enjoyed it.  Wish they had magaritas though."}
{"text":"Just got back from Los Taquitos. Picked up the 3 tacos combo. I got two fish and one shrimp with rice and beans for $6.75 plus tax and I also got a horchata. There are a couple thing I want to address. First off, the horchata was overwhelmingly sweet and grainy and this is because it is sitting in a container with spout on the bottom, so all the sugar and everything settles there and gets poured into the drink. It tasted almost like bubble gum. Easy solution, get a circulating fountain like most mexican restaurants have or even a container and ladle it out so it can be stirred, like I had in Mexico. Ok Food, The tacos I had were really good, I just hate that they are only 3 bites each, I could eat like 10 and I'm a small girl. The street tacos in Mexico are bigger for sure. The shrimp was so tiny, like the smallest salad shrimp and there was 3 on my taco, so that just shows how small they are. The fish is good, but it is chopped up so it looks like chicken and kinda tastes like chicken and doesnt have much flavor on its own. It comes with just lettuce and pico which is fine, I would have preferred cabbage like in Mexico. I was offered one of each sauce. A spicy chipotle and a really spicy green. Both are good, the green a lil better. Rice and beans are good, nothing spectacular. I was a lil disappointed that i didn't get lime and napkins and a fork. I could have easily grabbed it myself but I was in a hurry. I should also mention that the first time I went, my partner did not like the bombero burrito at all because it was drenched in the chipotle sauce, so if yo don't like chipotle I wouldn't recommend it. As for the place itself, it has a good ambience. The counter girl is friendly. The mural on the wall is pretty badass. No table service so expect to wait for a number to be called. Overall it's not a bad spot, probably the only lil mexican taco shop in Tuke. Please take my suggestions about the horchata and putting napkins, silverware and limes in the to go orders and consider upping the size of your tacos, I need more than 3 bites each!"}
{"text":"I would give this place 3.5 stars if I could. The tacos are good, the pico is fresh. The chips are crispy and fresh. However, the space feels a bit cramped. Plus they don't recycle their glass soda bottles. Try the carne asada tacos or the ceviche, my sister thinks it's good. Prices are fair and service is fast."}
{"text":"TACOS TACOS TACOS. FINALLY. The BEST Carne Asada, I have ever had.  I tried the Bombero Burrito - $4.95ish with Green Chile pork inside. SPICY. AWESOME. The burrito is served Enchilada style, with a smoky chipotle sauce on top + cheese. an awesome burrito, and a great value! The real gem at this little place though are the Carne Asada Street Tacos ($1.15 each!) . Perfectly marinated meat, not greasy, high quality, and served on the most delightful little corn tortillas.  I've eaten a lot of BAD Carne Asada in my life, and I'm thrilled to finally find a place that makes it so well! My co-diners had Shrimp Tacos, and a combo plate that had a tamale, enchilada, rice and beans.. both of those were under $7.... they were good, but I'll say again, Carne Asada is the *star* at Los Taquitos. I even had a few more Tacos for dessert. :P   Bright, joyful, warm staff... seats are tiny, and so is the dining room.. but I'd sit on the side of the freeway to eat food from here, if I had to. :) IT IS SO AMAZING."}
{"text":"this is a very good taco place. and they have other stuff besides tacos. they have burritos and quesadillas street size tacos that come in a order of 3 amongst other things. you order from the counter and they call out your number. service and staff are good too. a must try for sure."}
{"text":"Food is Always very Tasty.  I highly recommend you eat any item on the menu.  I especially enjoy the Ceviche.   Breakfast Burritos are just good. It could have been better.   Chicken Torta is Delicious the Bread is very crunchy with a soft center and subtly sweet.  The place is clean. I did not use the restroom so I cannot give a feedback on it.   Kids Cheese quesadilla was very greasy and a bit salty. The rice are a bit bland.  Customer service MUST be improved.   Overall 3 stars . Could have been 5 stars."}
{"text":"Always a favorite. Everything seems fresh and made to order. Always greeted with a smile and the happy hour specials are worth planning for.    In addition to the street tacos, burritos and quesadillas are really good.   Has an outside patio for when the weather is right. Awesome street tacos and homemade pico!"}
{"text":"As stated in an earlier post.....this is truly a little strip mall dive, however the Taco plate was outstanding. and is the closest I have come to Dave's Tacos in Bakersfield, California.  Next time for me a full plate of Tacos only (not that the rice and beans were bad.....just want more Tacos)"}
{"text":"This is a pretty good little Mexican restaurant. My friend and I ordered a variety of food including nachos, tacos, and enchiladas. They were all pretty good but our favorite was the nachos. Nice atmosphere and good service!"}
{"text":"First time ordering take out. Small place with a very nice bar area. Very friendly. This would be a great after work hang out. Ordered the Bambero, AZ Style and Pozole for my family and they loved it. Trust me they are very picky mexican food eaters. Very authentic flavors with just the right spiciness and no greasy mess. Prices are reasonable and proportions are pretty large."}
{"text":"I love this place, their Mexican food is so delicious!!   I come here ever so often for a quick lunch or dinner. Their food is pretty authentic and taste amazing!   They have everything from burros, tacos, Tortas, to menudo. And have a bar as well. They do happy hour and their specials are pretty cool! I don't know if they change it by week, but usually it's $4 margaritas and $1tacos that's all that matters to me. I am sure they have other items on their happy hour menu haha.   Let me just say their refried beans are like heaven! I don't know how they make them, but I can eat these beans FOREVER! I've ordered their Tortas and they are ok. Their tacos are great along with their sopes. Oh and just a side not these girls DO NOT skimp out on that tequila in your $4 margarita!!! The best $4 you will ever spend... Unless you're spending it on ice cream hehe.   Must try!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place while watching Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives. My expectations  were high and I'm glad to say I was not disappointed. We've been in Phoenix for almost 5 months and have been on a mission to find a good taco joint. Not a taco restaurant, but a taco joint and we found it at Los Taquitos.   I ordered the street taco meal: 2 carne asada and 1 chicken. The carne asada was seasoned well, the chicken needed a little more flavor and was a wee bit dry. The rice & beans were good and were not an afterthought. My husband also got the street taco meal, but instead of chicken he got the fish taco. He liked the fish, but said he would get 3 carne asada next time.   The street tacos were a little in the small side, I don't know if there is another type besides street tacos that are a little bigger. We dined in and it would have been nice to have a complimentary basket of chips & salsa while we waited for our meal.  We live about 15 minutes away, but will make the trip again very soon. I'm looking forward to trying the Bombaro."}
{"text":"It's airport food, so I don't expect too much.  I ordered a carnitas quesadilla, which wasn't that great. It was a very measly piece of quesadilla. Fast service, okay food, but not much more."}
{"text":"amazing mexican food in a casual, slightly upscale environment, if that's possible in a strip mall.  very nicely done interior and clean outdoor patio.  they actually have a full bar and a flat screen, so i imagine it would be a fun spot to catch a big soccer match.   the street tacos are fantastic, and the sauces and salsa are delicious.  friendly employees, no problems with service.  this is our local spot for quick, fresh, and delicious mexican."}
{"text":"Always double check your order if getting take out. I have yet to see them get an order right."}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I'm not even that into Mexican. However, I get cravings for this place!   It's that kind of good!!!"}
{"text":"I love this place, come here almost every week. Fast, cheap, casual and delicious. If you are looking for fancy Mexican this is not the place.  Their margaritas are delicious, maybe a bit small."}
{"text":"It's a casual place that's nice and clean inside with amazing tacos! Seating waa comfy. It took about 15 to 20 min to get my order on a Friday night but it was so worth it! I had a taco platter: carne asada, al pastor, and fish. All were delicious. I loved that the fish wasn't fried. The steak for the asada was great quality and juicy. The pastor was pretty flavorful. The rice and beans were also really good. Most taco places can have really good tacos but their rice and beans suck- this place knocked it out of the park everything. Note that the beans are whole pinto. Their salsas were awesome and spicy. Great place to satisfy your Mexican food craving."}
{"text":"Everyone is super friendly.  The food is awesome and the green salsa satisfies my cravings for spicy without making me cry like the wimp i am. I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"I cannot find a better chili relleno anywhere. Believe me, I've been searching for years. And the tacos are amazing, too! They also have great salsa. I would happily eat here every single day. As I write this review, my mouth is watering. The service isn't bad either, just laid back nice people at a counter. The only negative is that they don't sell booze with their spectacular food."}
{"text":"Hands down, my favorite place for Carne Asada anything! New revamped location...super modern but still get that feel of home. Customer service is always good. Food is always aaamazing and very affordable!  Only 2 downsides....1. Im a wimp so I wish they had a milder salsa and 2. they seemed to have changed their cut of meat since their renovations. Still amazing flavor, just not the same."}
{"text":"Service 5 Food 3 Cleanliness 3 Atmosphere 3 Value 4  Pros: Good value Quick Service  Cons: Little Greasy  Was trying to find somewhere close to eat and landed here. I had seen it on DDD before but have learned that doesn't mean great food.. just.. interesting food. I have no real complaints. The service was quick, the prices were low, the food was decent. The whole experience was just above average. With so many other great places in the valley I an unlikely to make a return visit anytime soon.  Onto the food:  Chile Relleno: The sauce was great, the breading held up pretty well. It was slightly undercooked so the pepper was still very stiff. Had to hack away at it with a plastic knife to cut a piece. As usual it was filled with cheese.. and unusually filled with diced potato. This was a new one and I'm not sure what it really added to the dish. Initially I thought maybe just extra filler to cut down on the cheese needed, but there was plenty of cheese. Good but far from the best.  Hard Shell Tacos: This place is known for its street tacos. So just stay away from the hardshells. You'll be glad you did.  Street Tacos: Carne Asada: There was a lot of bold seasoning going on here. Street tacos are notoriously two/three bite'ers so I didn't really get to break it apart. If I went back I think I might get a burrito to really get a good amount of the carne. I sometimes worry when things are so obviously heavy seasoned that they may be covering something up.  Al Pastor: Very strong citrus flavor. Almost like the marinade was made with fresh juice that had been cooked down and condensed. It was very salty and pretty greasy.  Carnitas: Not to bad.. Had a decent flavor but again was a little over salty/greasy.  Rice: Decent  Beans: Really liked these. They were very rich and creamy but still with some whole bean texture. I'm not sure they can taste that good without lard but I suppose its possible. I've never been afraid of lard anyway ;)  Cheese Quesadilla: Flour tortilla filled with mexican white queso. Was decent but nothing to super special.  Green Salsa: Bold, spicy, and very heavy tomatillo flavor.  Red Salsa: I liked this one. It was a good combo of smokey, spicy, and a hint of sweetness. The smokiness I'm sure came from a heavy dose of chipotle."}
{"text":"Oh my gershhh! My taste buds went to heaven today. I hardly ever go far that east but we were going to ikea. My bf wanted Mexican so I searched thankfully came across this place.   It was pretty busy so we took that as a good sign. Menu is easy to read and understand. I got the veggie bowl with no cheese/ my bf got the ceviche tostada, 2 asada tacos, and an AZ style asada burrito. We also got chips and guac.   His food looked amazing especially the tostada. He said everything tasted fresh and was good quality. I loved my veggie bowl. It has the perfect blend of each topping. The chips were good. The guac was ok, just a little bland but I mixed some pico in it and it was good to go. Their bag of carrots that's coke with the food are so so delicious. They're pickled to perfection.   I wish it was closer to where I live or hope they open one closer to me. But until next time I decide to BFE, I'll just dream about it."}
{"text":"Love this Place!! Bomb Street Tacos for cheap!!    Saw this place on Triple D and made my family try!! OF course they loved it! Everytime i hear about this place i get hungry!!! Doesnt matter if i am in food coma or not!  If you haven't tried this place then you are Trippin'!!!!  Go there RIGHT NOW!!!"}
{"text":"I got the vegetarian tacos and they were so good. They had a good variety of vegetables on them and weren't boring at all. I also loved the refried beans here. I'm not usually that into beans but these were so good! Prices were really good as well and I would definitely return."}
{"text":"For a small establishment, this place rocks! I crave their vegetarian burrito and need it regularly. Their salsa is amazing. I have been really happy with all the food I have got. Well done!"}
{"text":"this place is absolutely amazing!!! if i write about all the amazing things here i would never finish. the girls are very nice and friendly, the street taquitos are to die for. i eat like 10 of them because i cant never have enough!!! everuthing from the taste of the meat to the salsa. bomb!!!! enough said!! just try it!!! tuesdays is taco tuesday. tacos for a dollar except the carne asada ones......you can find it on youtube when the food network was there. on dinners drive ins and dives. !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Staff is nice,food came out quick,pozole was good. Didn't really care for the asada but the carnita tacos my wife got where very good. We will come back. I'll try the menudo next time around. Michelada was good also my wife's prickly pear margarita was a bit on the very sweet side. Tortillas where very good on the tacos. All around place is good thank you ."}
{"text":"Best carne asada tacos. They come standard with hot sauce that is very spicy. I love spicy, but the sauce can overwhelm the flavor of the taco. I usually get 1 with and 2 without. They are tiny, but delicious so you will need at least 3!"}
{"text":"Solid 3.5 stars. Got sopes, burritos and tacos. All were requested with asada and were delicious. Refrain from the guacamole- it's basically smashed avocado with a bit of salt- super bland.  Burrito was really good- from the tortilla to the beans. Meat was seasoned perfectly. Sopes were also on point- had sour cream, lettuce and pico de gallo. As far as tacos go- niece had them and loved them."}
{"text":"It's no lie. Soooo good. We are from the greater Los Angeles area and so have had many levels of Mexican food. From Not Really Mexican to Tacos in Mexico. This place was so good that we went BACK UP to the counter and ordered more.  Worth the short drive across Glendale from baseball spring training land..."}
{"text":"The chips and salsa/guacamole are pretty meh, but I love their tacos al pastor, so I keep going back!   I keep meaning to try a torta or a breakfast burrito, but when I can get street tacos for only $1 on Tuesday, why deviate?"}
{"text":"My g-chat status has been set to \"Los Taquitos FTW!\" for about three weeks now. No, not because I am too lazy to change it, because I pretty much eat Los Taquitos every single day.   If you are a follower of mine, you have probably learned by now that I have an obsessive personality, especially when it comes to food. The problem is, it is SO good here I JUST CANNOT STOP.  I cannot eat the a-la-carte Chile Relleno anymore (not vegan), but it is so freaking good and I really wish I could. My friend recently got it in burrito form and I think it was true love.  Dallas G. loves the bean burrito with a little guac on the side. There is something about their beans that make you salivate just thinking about them.  But, here is what just makes my soul sing: The three hard taco combo. I get it with beans (no meat) and no cheese, and add pico. I get all beans with no cheese on the side. I lather that ish up with the green sauce, and suddenly all is right in the world.  The clock just struck 8:30am... guess what that means? That's Right! TACO TIME!"}
{"text":"Delicious and quick Mexican. The quesadilla and street tacos are to die for. Hot sauce is spicy but one of the best I've had. It's not your typical hole in the wall Mexican place. It's clean, decor is trendy, and it's constantly busy. I was there at 3pm on a Wednesday and the place was still packed. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have been eating at Los Taquitos for years and oddly haven't reviewed them.  This is their new location they don't disappoint.  They have SOLID street tacos.   And wait for it, they will do the unthinkable and let you have FLOUR tortillas of you like!!!  Always a great afternoon snack; a bottle of coke and 4 street tacos (I go for pastor, lengua, asada and shrimp)."}
{"text":"4.5 stars.  I had their Bombero Burrito with green chile for the first time today...was SOOOO good.  I disagree with Shaun C.  I love the sauce they have in this burrito...."}
{"text":"My hubby and I go on taco Tuesday. This location is my absolute favorite the girls are friendly and they remember us that's always a plus! The chicken tacos and margaritas are amazing. The other location in Tempe has dry over done chicken and it's nearly impossibly to go on my hour lunch break.  This location is faster and has better food in my opinion :)"}
{"text":"Really good food and nice sized portions. I had the breakfast quesadilla with bacon. The tortilla was crisp and light. My dining partners had the menudo. The meat and hominy were cooked well and the broth was rich and flavorful. The only reason they do not get 5 stars is because the tables were all dirty and we had to ask them to clean the tables. Overall, it was a good meal and I will probably be back"}
{"text":"I'm afraid this is one of those \"I wanted to love it, but...\" reviews.   We had an assortment of tacos and burritos.  They were fine but absolutely nothing special whatsoever.  Yes, they were authentic Mexican tacos (i.e., not Taco Bell) but is that really supposed to be something special in Arizona for cryin' out loud?   It's not like we're in Canada here, people.  I saw the piece on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives where they made a big deal about their variety of salsas and how people came from miles around to buy them.  Seriously?  They had exactly two salsas.  Again, they were fine, but nothing special and nothing at all like what we saw on TV.  We ordered chips and salsa and got a small little french fry tray of chips with no salsa.  I asked the girl at the counter for salsa and she pointed to the same two bottles. Ah, ok.  Woo hoo.  I would happily stop there if I was in the neighborhood but I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to eat there."}
{"text":"Great! Everytime, everything I have eaten here. Good food fast and a smile to boot! Prices good."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Food was very fresh and really delicious! Wish there was one of these on the east coast! My bf and I tried both the Asada and carnitas \"street taco\" and their bowl platters to share. My bf also got a shrimp burrito that was cheesy delicious!"}
{"text":"I have been going to the Ahwatukee location since I was in my early teens and I am 24 now. I love Los Taquitos and now go to the Glendale and 16th st location! I love the food, the service, and the atmosphere. The ladies are always friendly when I visit. I would recommend Los Taquitos to everyone and anyone! I have hooked several family members and friends already on them."}
{"text":"Came here for taco Tuesday with a friend. Carne asada, pastor, and carnitas were $1 each and lengua was 1.50 (although, I did not know this until I bought 4 of them) they were out of pastor so I also ordered carnitas. My favorite tacos of all time are lengua so when I had a bite of these bad boys I was I heaven! Soooo darn good! Carnitas... Not so much, so I'm glad I only ordered the one. The meat was dry and almost tasted like soap! Horchata was delicious but gets a little grainy at the end.   The restaurant itself was spacious with a patio area as well. There's a bar you can sit at. Staff is friendly. Overall very nice and clean! Great salsa and merengue music in the background.  I will definitely come again!"}
{"text":"Rude.  Stupid.  Horrible service and yells back to the customers when they get it wrong.  Don't bother going here.  Waste of money waste of time and horrible experience.  Go lick the toilet, you will be better off."}
{"text":"Wow big swing and a miss. Definitely not up to participate from last time. Meat was all so dry... I won't be back."}
{"text":"Great tacos! We stopped by here when we were moving accross the country because we had seen it on DDD. We were not disapointed! They have very authentic taco's. It's a little place but their taco and taco sauce have huge flavor. I had carne asada and the carnitas taco and both were comparable to what I could get at the better places in southern CA. I also ate a tamale and it was pretty good for a restraunt tamale. If you are in Phoenix and want some mexican food, go here. you can easily find out why if you search for it in youtube."}
{"text":"Overall not terrible food. We ordered a breakfast torta. Was it really a torta? Not exactly, unless you'd consider a soggy hoagie sandwich a torta. The contents of the torta were good, the vessel in which it came was soggy and disintegrated with little more than eye contact. I can't speak to the other breakfast options in the terminal but if you're looking for something hearty that's served hot, you may want to consider this as an option."}
{"text":"Always great food and service! They just remolded so then place is bigger and better than before. It looks really good! I always get the Bombero burrito with carnitas. If you like spicy foods, give the Bombero burrito a try."}
{"text":"The Los taquitos on 16th street is amazing so in re evaluating. It's fast become my favorite. Not sure if the locations are owned by the same people but the bowls are amazing."}
{"text":"Be prepared to wait slow service.  Waited more tban 30 for burrito. Go to  burrito company down the street and in and out in 5 min and they have better food at burrito company."}
{"text":"Small little strip mall Mexican place. Close enough to Guadalupe to make it somewhat authentic. Good prices and certainly a step up from the usual fast food Mexican places around town,"}
{"text":"Would not recommend.  Food was good but I feel the refried beans were cooked from a pot of boiled beans that had burnt.  I like *ahumado* flavor but geez.  Bummer the tacos seemed good but i could not get over the flavor of the beans. Disappointed they would serve that"}
{"text":"Uninspired Tex Mex food served up by an apathetic staff. None of the ingredients here are fresh and it tastes very much like the corporate Sysco food that cafeterias dish out. Probably wouldn't have finished if it wasn't for the copious amounts of hot sauce I applied.   If a Taco Bell and Del Taco burrito taste around the same for about half the price you know there's a problem. There's much much better options at Sky Harbor  *Tip - There's a 4 star rated Los Taquitos  off the airport that came up in my search that made me think this place was good but make sure you get the airport location in your search or your going to be pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"Los Taquitos is another spot we like to visit when we are in Arizona, especially the day we're heading home so we can take leftovers lol - road trip!! Always bring a big size cooler with lots of ice.  Anyways tacos are really good, carne asada & lengua are the best. Tried their chilaquiles they were ok. Their bowls you know I would have liked more if it had a little less of the bean juice, it was just to soggy for me.  The main reason I like to return and it's not on the menu any more but they still make it is for the Bombero Burrito. It's made out of a spicy chipotle sauce, man that sauce is spicy but is really good."}
{"text":"Found this little gem of a quick taco joint via YELP (droid app) when shopping at Ikea.  Located on the SW corner in a little shopping center on Elliot and 48th st...prices are very reasonable and the food was delicious! Cute little street tacos are $1.15 each...order it as a Meal and you get rice and beans too (I forget the price).  Restaurant was clean, restroom was clean, cashier was friendly, food was good & quick, and a line of Car Salesmen starting forming at the peak of the lunch hour (a good sign of good food and food not just sitting around)...  I would totally eat here again when I'm in the area (forget the IKEA cafe, drive over here for a way better meal!)"}
{"text":"The Street tacos were amazing but the rice and beans left something to be desired. When I go back I'd probably skip just get the tacos a la carte."}
{"text":"Horrible customer services! I placed an order through door dash and when it arrived it was wrong. I called the restaurant to let them know that my order was wrong in hopes of getting a refund for only the item that was missing. Instead I got told I can either come pick up the item or keep my order as is. I have been going to los taquitos for years always great food, but the past few times I have ordered from them something has always been wrong with my order. The other times I had the luxury of being able to go back to the restaurant, today I was not able to do that hence why I ordered through a delivery service. I fell this was handled poorly."}
{"text":"They have really yummy carne asada tacos. So good. The rice and beans are just ok though."}
{"text":"Ugh some of the worst steak tacos I've had. And it was a long wait. The beans were eh and I didn't care for the rice.  I wish I'd have opted for pizza or Panera, those would've probably been better options."}
{"text":"I've only had the tacos but they are amazing!!!  This place is nothing like Taco Bell (to the person who said that below)  Love the taco Tuesday:)"}
{"text":"Found a new love! Their lengua tacos are bomb. I like them with no onions  (still hate them) and green salsa. Too die for. The meat is juicy, tender and bursting with flavor. Ate them so fast I burned my tongue."}
{"text":"Top-notch Mexican food from an unassuming storefront in an otherwise generic shopping center.  I was turned on to Los Taquitos by a friend who, despite certain dietary restrictions, will indulge in the tacos here when she needs her street food fix.  Coming from California, I have been mystified and befuddled by the lack of good, cheap Mom-and-Pop Mexican food joints in the Phoenix Metro Area.  It seems that when I have gone out exploring, I have been completely disappointed with bland, underseasoned, cafteria-style Mexican food that seems to be de rigeur in these parts.  This is not the case with Los Taquitos.  The food here is a tremendous value.  You spend no more than you would at any other Mexican food hole-in-the-wall, but the flavor and attention to texture and food preparation is exceptional.  The hard-shell tacos have the proper jaw-rattling crunch, and the meat is well-seasoned and tasty.  They don't require too much hot sauce because they are so savory on their own, but the house-made green and red sauce condiments, add the perfect amount of heat and brightness.  I have also sampled the carne asada burrito, served enchilada-style (i.e., smothered in red simmer sauce), and found it to be spot-on as far as texture and taste.  The flour tortilla is soft and sturdy, whereas the beef is toothsome and appropriately salty and spicy.  I fear that I have been ruined for all other quick-and-dirty Mexican food joints after eating here.  Los Taquitos sets the bar very high for this niche of restaurant, and the service is prompt despite the crowds of loyal patrons that jam-pack themselves into this small little place for a taste of spicy, savory, satisfying Mexican food heaven."}
{"text":"This place is awesome...the staff is great and the good is even better!!! If you want authentic, chronic mexican food this is the place :)"}
{"text":"On our way back home, we decided to grab some lunch at this joint. Seemed convenient enough for a filling meal before the flight. Michelle was cashier. She got a little sassy with us during our interaction as if she wasn't interested in doing this job. That was bit of a turn off.   Don't expect much from this place though. Food is alright, nothing amazing. I got the Carne Asada burrito for $9.79. It's a little pricey but certainly expected for airport food. The burrito is stuffed with steak, beans, salsa, onions and cilantro and served with rice and more beans. It was good enough for the day. again, nothing that stood out.   That's all I have to say about that."}
{"text":"Three words- don't do it. Food was not good, we waited a very long time, and order after order was wrong (including ours). The torta was dry and the rice and beans were probably the worst I have ever had. Even for airport food, this is just bad!"}
{"text":"Great Mexican food at a very reasonable price. Nice lady at the counter had all our food ready in less than 10 mins. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The atmosphere leaves a little bit to be desired but the food is really delicious. You order ahead of time and then bring the food to your table. They have $3 margaritas at happy hour. & I saw Sandra Day O'Connor there so they must be doing something rite!"}
{"text":"I've dined at this facility numerous times and I must say I really do enjoy the food but I will not hesitate to tell everyone how crappy the service is. My most recent experience was the worst, I had simply ordered four tacos and two orders of chips and salsa. Need I say, I called to order for pick up. I arrive and pay for my food, I then wait 30 minutes for such a small order. I see several orders, dine in and take out get there food prior to mine. I ask not only once but three times on the status of my order and how much longer it would take. I got the response \"it's coming up, it's next\" and \"just a few minutes more\" finally I ask one last time and my order was sitting on the counter bagged up with the receipt taped with my name clearly on the tab. The response I got was a little chuckle and a small \"sorry\". No sincere apology whatsoever, really crappy service overall. Really disappointed with the service."}
{"text":"DANGER! If I could, I would send the owner of this \"restaurant\" to jail.  We  ordered the carne asada torta and the chicken bowl. The rice with the torta was overcooked to the point of not being edible. The beans tasted bland and fattening. I asked for jalapenos and they didn't have any. The \"carne asada\" on the torta had so little meat you could barely see it. Half the tiny sandwich meat was fat, no exaggeration. The tomatoe slices were relatively fresh at least. Essentially I could not eat my meal. The chicken bowl rice was also overcooked. The chicken was bland. If I could give the restaurant a negative score, I would. See my other reviews if you want to see if I am too hard on other restaurants (I have given all other reviews 4 or 5 stars).  I should go back and ask for my money back but it is quite obvious the managers and owners of this establishment couldn't care less.  I dare you to respond. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try Los Taquitos even before I knew it had been on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives and I finally got the chance.  The inside it exactly what I expected, nothing fancy, booths and some tables.  I found it a little odd that the counter where you order is so small and the drink lids, napkins, condiments and plasticware are right next to it.  If there had been a line it would have been very awkward.  I ordered a chicken burrito, enchilada style with rice and beans and a drink.  When I went to get my drink they were out of Diet Coke, it came out as just water.  Ok, I thought maybe they had been super busy as it was about 1pm on a weekday.  Lunch rush perhaps.  I took a seat and waited for my number to be called.  The burrito was good, nothing that knocked my socks off but a decent burrito.  The rice was nice and fluffly but the beans just lacked flavor.  They were blah.  Will I come back?  Sure but I will try the tacos next time and hope that they can rearrange that counter a bit."}
{"text":"The breakast burritos are the best thing on the menu.  Don't try to order one on Tuesday though - they only serve tacos on  Tuesdays.    Irritating.  The tacos are good but not as good as their reputation.  Guacamole is great.  Nothing is cheap and the service is marginal.  Just doesn't live up to the hype.  There are better places for fast casual Mexican food."}
{"text":"This place has my favorite street tacos, and at a cheap price. I was craving carne asada tacos and looked for something around my boyfriend's place and discovered Los Taquitos. He'd never been, despite living on this side of town for years, and now he's hooked too along with his best friend. The seafood burrito is really good. The wait isn't too bad, it's usually just a couple minutes, and the staff is friendly.  Funny story - I was talking about some Mexican restaurants with my dad, and he mentioned a place he loves \"near Tempe\" that has the best tacos he's had, and I mentioned my favorite is Los Taquitos, and he exclaimed, \"That's it!\""}
{"text":"Great place for taco Tuesday, I would give them 5 stars but my friend got a piece of hair in her food. From what I could see through there window, the women were not wearing hair nets. They gave her a new plate but didn't say sorry for the hair, and they gave her 3 tacos when she ordered four. Otherwise it was a nice visit. Examine your food before you take a bite."}
{"text":"So I tried Los Taqitos for the first time today after seeing it on Diners Drive Ins and Dives like so many others, and I'm always on the lookout for good Mexican places. So far this is the best one of it's kind that I've found in my 2 years of living in Phoenix. I got the 3 tacos, rice, and beans combo and it was really delicious. I got 2 carne asada and one chicken and although both were good the carne asada takes the cake. The tacos were fairly small but the plate was more than filling. My boyfriend got the carne asada burrito and he said the meat was kind of dry but the meat in my tacos tasted really good so that may just be a matter of personal preference. All in all 4 stars and I'd definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Great food! I was pleasantly surprised to find a taco stand...inside a restaurant! The food tastes authentic just like it came from a truck :)  The only downside is on Taco Tuesday, the asada tacos are not included. Sad face. I've heard other tacos are just as good but have yet to try. Their beans and rice are great!  Clean and hip atmosphere. They have sugar skull paintings on the walls. Oh and they serve alcohol, which might be a plus if you like happy hour and tacos?"}
{"text":"I love their taco Tuesday special!  $1 each for chicken, pastor, or carnitas tacos. Really good salsa. If you're going to go for lunch, get there early or be prepared to wait for a while. Recently remodeled, and it's now about double in size. The bomba burrito is awesome if you like spicy! Also, very good tortas!"}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Ignore the fact that Guy Fieri showed up here and gave it a thumbs up.  The quality of the food here stands on its own and in my opinion, for the best food experience, you go for the restaurant's namesake and stick with the street tacos.  I kind of miss the old hole-in-the-wall feel this place used to have when it was half the size and really ragged around the edges.  Not that I dislike the update and the ample seating, but I miss the old mural on the wall too.  Anyway, on to the food.  Typically, I only get tacos here.  I will say that I've had the enchiladas and chile rellenos here once before.  The enchiladas were fine, a 3 out of 5.  Nothing special.  I was not a fan of the chile rellenos, they were under fried and kind of a soggy mess.  But the tacos redeem this place.  They stand up to very good tacos in LA and are a solid example of the great Mexican in the Valley.  The lengua, I believe, is the single best meat option there is.  Always flavorful, always moist and tender after it's long braising, yet you still get that slight chew from the meat.  It is almost perfect.  I also have a soft spot for the carnitas.  There are better carne asada and al pastor out there, but these iterations are just fine.  They keep it simple (onions and cilantro), as they should.  Thus, the goodness of the meat really shines.  My wife loves the shrimp taco, which I've never had.    The staff is always awesome and I will always come back here so long as the lengua never changes."}
{"text":"I saw this place leaving Safeway and wanted mexican food, I checked my  yelp mobile app. and got really excited when I saw the reviews. I bought a few different burritos and brought them back to work. Bean burrito pretty good. I was really excited about the carne asada burrito, the meat was tough a dry no one actualy actually ate more than two bites. I am a mexican food snob but, no one was really a fan.   It was a tough call between two and three stars but, after the carne asada I just couldn't give it the third."}
{"text":"This place was featured on \"Diners, Drive Ins and Dives,\" so I had to visit when I was in the area. It's run by five sisters (all beautiful). This is not a restaurant or a cafe in the usual sense, although there is limited indoor and outdoor seating. There is no table service, and don't complain about the wait. If you want fast \"Mexican\" food, go to Taco Hell.  This is a hole-in-the wall place in a strip mall that serves great food, according to the people who go there. Most of the lunch crowd were laborers and working types, waiting patiently for big orders of take out. The young woman at the cash register (wearing a tank top declaring, \"boobies rock,\" with a pink breast cancer ribbon logo) is pleasant and efficient. When she bellows out your order number you wonder where the sound came from. She just grins.  I've only eaten here once, I admit, but the marinated pork burrito was to die for. Spicy, just the right amount of heat, with bits of cilantro adding just the right notes."}
{"text":"I live in Portland, so while we have Mexican food here, it is not quite the best Mexican food you'll ever find.  When down in Phoenix on a work trip, I thought, \"I'm pretty close to Mexico, I should have Mexican.\" I picked Los Taquitos because it was pretty close by and the reviews were pretty good.  I was totally happy with my Cheese Enchiladas to go. The girl at the register was nice and the food was good. No complaints."}
{"text":"Win!  We were recommeded to try this place by Mr. Guy Fieri and Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.  Previously we'd had some misses with his recommendations.  Turns out this place is pretty kick ass.  Simple menu items and very affordably priced.  Now you're asking... how does it taste?  Ah. Mazing.  Got gitchya some."}
{"text":"We got an order of their Street tacos: 3 tiny little tacos. Did I say they're tiny? Not what I was expecting, but I'm not from around here! Still, they were very tasty, especially the carne asada (YUM!) and chicken. Carnitas were good, too! And a good price, too!"}
{"text":"I grew up around here and always used to love the tortas when I was little. Venturing out of my favorite, I now order other dishes as well. My favorite, aside from tortas, are the carne asada street tacos. They're the perfect blend of spicy heat, fresh onions and carne asada. One plate never seems like enough! So happy this has had the business to expand over the years!"}
{"text":"Unimpressed, not sure what all the fuss is about for this place. Dry meat, small portions, dirty environment. The trifecta of a poor taco establishment."}
{"text":"I had the AZ burrito with asada and chicken and beef rolled tacos. One plate and one with just the rolled tacos. The asada has good flavor  and goes well with the pico and potatoes on the burrito. Chicken rolled tacos is a little bland and not a lot of flavor. The beef tacos are better choice for flavor. Each order of rolled tacos comes with side of guacamole and sour cream."}
{"text":"Ate there twice it was so good.  Great preparation of meats for street tacos and a fantastic burrito.  Salsa is fresh and has great flavor.  Add some habañero salsa if you want heat.  Price is fantastic and so many great options to choose from.  Will be back any time I'm near Phoenix."}
{"text":"There is a second Los Taquitos, owned by the same family as the original. I have eaten here a bunch of times. I had seen their other location on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and when they opened this one near my house I was thrilled. This one is on 16th Street at Glendale. It's a great street style taco shop and they serve breakfast,lunch and dinner. Their food is all good and authentic. If you are staying close by at the Hilton Squaw Peak and you want to eat some good Mexican food, head on over. I highly recommend the tacos. Check out taco Tuesday, they're only $1 or go for happy hour and get $3 margaritas and Mexican beer. I especially like to go for a late breakfast. The chiliquilles and breakfast quesadilla are great. It's always good."}
{"text":"Airport food rip off! Over priced steam table tacos with no flavor. I guess the only flavor you could add is to drowned it in hot sauce. I can't believe how much of a rip off this was, high price, so little food with no flavor. Meh! I got a better huge meal of Chinese food at Love Field in Dallas."}
{"text":"Absolutely as good as it gets when it comes to awesome \"hole in the wall\" Mexican food. From the outside you wouldn't be tempted to go in, but I heard some very good recommendations, including the fact that a national tv show went there and gave it high praise. Trying it out however, I was BLOWN AWAY. First thing I noticed walking in is that the place was packed. All the booths were filled, and a fairly long line led up to the register. The next thing I noticed was the nice ambiance. Real latin music and a VERY NICE mural on the right side of the restaurant gave the place a nice feel. Check out the mural if you go in, IMHO it is something special (I was surprised that noone who worked there could tell me the name of the artist-I would like to see more of his work). Then there was the food. IMHO, every thing was both high quality-and authentic (no caucasian [I am caucasian] wimp down). Excellent beans and rice, and wonderful main dishes. I particularly liked the chilaquiles for breakfast, and want to try some of their other breakfast fare, which I believe will be amazing. I true Mexican (no caucasian wimp down) food lover, I will be back to this place many times and give it my highest recommendation."}
{"text":"Carne Asada Burrito -- excellent   Margaritas -- surprisingly good   Pico is unbelievably good!   Tacos are great as well!   Besides some order mix ups on to go orders we have been genuinely pleased with the service and food.   Always a good option for last minute dinner."}
{"text":"The food is great and the girls are super friendly but the place is a little messy. You have to clean your own table and theres food on the floors. I still like the food."}
{"text":"Good fast Mexican! Tacos are  especially on. Taco Tuesday! Can't beat the price. We visit a couple times a month. Note: if you are ordering tacos and plan to share with your little one ask for now salsa on the tacos! Made the mistake once and I think my kids still remembers."}
{"text":"Saw this place on triple D earlier this year.  Tried the 3-taco (carne asada) combo...excellent!!!  Will return again soon."}
{"text":"worth going to.  i'm from nogales.  i'm so darn picky, but this place is great.  at least as good as it gets in phoenix for sure.  it's worth the drive when time permits.  i always order the quesadilla with carne asada and add guacamole and beans.  yum.  they have yummy horchata too.  honestly this place and america's taco shop are the only two places i really like in town."}
{"text":"Post ride meal. Veggie burrito every time. Spicy carrots on the side. Good service and good food. Stop In any time for a good one. I usually order the veggie with brown rice, back beans. Comes with grilled veggies and add hot peppers for a little kick. \"Yum\" Good way to put that flat behind me."}
{"text":"Delicious Mexican food spot in Arizona! Guy Fieri (from Food Network) has eaten here! thought that was really cool! I'd definitely be back next time I'm out in AZ! Their tacos are great!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing food! I get the carne asada taco plate OMG so good. The customer service is great as well.  My husband has gotten then chicken enchiladas which he said were just ok. However I love the rice and beans and carne asada.  If you've never been check it out."}
{"text":"This used to be a great place to go but the quality of the food has really declined.  Sadly I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Love love love this place their salsa tastes like my mom's home made. Fast and excellent service and you got to try their margaritas! A plus on my end... always clean :)"}
{"text":"On our way to the Hilton to meet some wonderful friends and play at the pool.  We were a bit hungry.   Wife and son had been here about a year ago and said it was good.  WOW.   A CARNE ASADA BURRITO WITH FLAVOR!  Whomever is in the kitchen, KEEP THEM.  The food was so good I couldn't wait to go back, had to stop on the way out of town.  We want to try the whole menu.  Two days in a row the wait staff were pleasant and happy to be there, like they had a vested interest in the success of the restaurant.  Clean, fun, fantastic food at a reasonable price.  Open one in Oro Valley!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere. Clean bathrooms. The house margarita was STRONG. Only $4. Great value for my $5 veggie burrito also. Can't remember how delicious it was but I ate the entire thing (see aforementioned strong margarita). My husband and his coworkers eat here all the time for a reason."}
{"text":"Graded on a curve for being airport food this place is a 5!! For the price of airport McDonald's you can get a legit Mexican meal.   I had the chorizo breakfast burrito, it was spicy, and REALLY goood! The tortilla was awesome, and the greasy cheese and chorizo was just what daddy needed   As a pilot I have had a lot of airport food, and this is some of the best I've had, regardless of price range"}
{"text":"Never a disappointment! The tortilla can really make or break a burrito and this place tops this list for authentic tortillas! Their red salsa is the perfect blend of spices, it's so delicious I have to put it on every single bite! My favorite thing to order is the AZ style burrito with steak. I have never tasted meat like it before! It's smokey and tender, juicy and flavorful with a hit of spice, just so tasty!"}
{"text":"Best Mexican place ever. Only knock is the wait can be awhile so order in advance! I usually get a few tacos and a pork burrito. Their hot sauce is crazy hot but so worth it and tasty."}
{"text":"I was excited to see Los Taquitos at Sky Harbor Terminal 4 I been going to the location off 16th street for a long time and I am a big fan of their tacos and homemade salsas.  I even saw a sign on the wall last time I was in the 16th st restaurant talking about opening in Terminal 4  This is nothing like the restaurant this is different from top to bottom and disappointing to say the least  The other reviews and pictures are spot on so I won't bother posting more very very disappointed"}
{"text":"What can I say...I showed up as a first timer for a taco Tuesday to-go order. I just finished eating the tacos and they were good enough for me to pull my phone out, post-meal, and write up a Yelp review to express my satisfaction. The pastor tacos were delicious and the carnitas tacos were also a delight. Both the red and green salsa were very tasteful. I hope to be back soon!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time today. Got the 3 Carne Asada street tacos with rice and beans, 3 beef enchiladas with rice and beans and a shredded beef chimichanga.  Loved all of it. Will be going back for sure."}
{"text":"Normally go to phx location, near my work. Seen this was opened near where I live. Definitely needed to stop in always good food!! Tacos burritos and quesadilla are the best. Great wall art as Well! Don't past this place up!"}
{"text":"After enjoying the food at their Tukee location a few times, I wondered if  the same flavors were available at their North Phoenix location. And happily, yes, they are. This is good stuff. There's a certain kick and complexity to the taste that you don't get in even the hearty Mexican drive-thrus like Filiberto's and such. It makes the extra cost seem worth it.  And note that I am comparing this, a relatively nice sit-down-type place, to  Filiberto's. Any comparisons to Garcias or other pre-fab GringoMex outlets aren't fair. To the GringoMex, I mean. LT blows them out of the water.  Anyway, they care about their food and it shows. The decor here is much better than in Tukee, which seems more or less like a taco shop set up in a hall closet. They even have a bar with a happy hour at this location.  The prices are higher than expected, but not extraordinary.  BTW: I think the photogenic nature of the counter help probably helped the place get that shot on Drive-in's Diners and Dives. Just sayin . . ."}
{"text":"Awesome joint. Great street tacos and hot sauce. I love the bottled jarritos too. Try the breakfast burritos. My fav: bacon, eggs, cheese, and beans. Sweet murals too, especially the new dia de Los muertos one. I love that I live so close!"}
{"text":"Doesn't need any help. This place is amazing. A great authentic Mexican joint like only Arizona does them (being in Cleveland I notice this more and more every day). I love the beef enchiladas and quesadillas. It was featured on Diners' Drive-in's, and Dive's and has become a very busy spot that you MUST TRY!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is good, not great. My shrimp taco platter ($8 for 3 tacos (small!) and rice and beans) was tasty. My daughter got just a taco and it was gone in 4 bites (the tacos are small!). Hubby's b/c and chicken burrito was about standard size and good (at least he didn't complain about it). It was nice that they offered black beans as well as refried. Good to have a choice.  Well I've had worse fast food Mexican, I've also had better."}
{"text":"Just...yes. Delicious food. Only been once, and plan to go back and eat the rest of the menu."}
{"text":"A small little gem that's hidden in a corner of a small shopping center.  Good prices- fantastic food!  You can get anything to order, the menu is more like a guideline.  We had the street tacos meal which comes with rice and beans.  Perfect size for lunch and a lighter meal.  The burrito with carne asada was unbelievably tender and flavorful. I recommend trying everything!"}
{"text":"Although decent not the most authentic or best tasting Mexican food restaurant you can choose from in Phoenix. The tortillas are a bit rubbery and the chips and salsa are not memorable. We had the chorizo and eggs plate and the chorizo and eggs burrito. The eggs were overcooked, chorizo was mediocre, the beans and potatoes needed seasoning. Don't think we will return. On the positive side, the rice was decent, they offered sodas in the bottles and we dug the nostalgic black & white photos lining the wall. Hahaha! I know, odd thing to mention but they were quite cool."}
{"text":"Not very night people and the food was just bland. I had a chicken bowl, got charged extra for the lettuce! Would avoid!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite taco place. I'm at the Ahwatukee location just about every taco tuesday. It gets very busy so it's best to order ahead, but they never ever disappoint."}
{"text":"Never disappoints, TRY THE CHICKEN BURRITO and thank me later. I've also heard that they have the best habanero salsa (you've got to ask for it). If i could eat here every day i would."}
{"text":"I want there because of the Phoenix Magazine review of their Pazole.  Let me tell you it is excellent. But, I'm not a fan of the venue. You order and pay at the counter, clean your table and wait for your food order which comes through a pass through window from the kitchen. The counter person puts it on the counter spilling some of the soup into the tray, then you spill more navigating it to your table. I lost a good 3 oz of soup. Bathroom was smelly and dirty. One sink faucet was broken as wall as the urinal. I'll go back but will make sure to do a potty break first and sit at the counter."}
{"text":"Changing my review from a 3 to to five since they have impressed me the last few times I've come in. Service is great, store is clean, food is fresh, made to order and tastes great! Love the tender, melt in your mouth carnitas street tacos. Grilled fish is also delicious. Rice and beans are also very tasty. Come on Tuesdays as most street tacos are $1!"}
{"text":"This place never disappoints. My favorite combo is the 3 street tacos with rice and beans. The beans and rice are authentic and although the rice tastes the same as other Mexican eateries, the beans are on their own level. The carnitas are my favorite taco item as the meat is seasoned and cooked very well. The el pastor and grilled fish options are also delicious. Employees are friendly and the the restaurant is kept well organized."}
{"text":"Awesome burrito place!  The food here is relatively cheap and has pretty good flavor.  The only downside I can about the food is that the burritos are not big compared to other places in town.  Not to say that's a bad thing, if you're trying to each smaller portions, but who does that for Mexican food?  Decor is nice and overall clean.  I'll definitely be back since it's super close to my house."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Amazing staff! Great prices. Kinda slow on taco Tuesday but can't complain for dollar tacos!"}
{"text":"So excited to have Los Taquitos in Chandler! I had my usual Carnitas burrito and their steet tacos. Both taste just like I remember from Ahwatukee. Ran into one of the sisters today too! They are so friendly and really appreciate their customers. The place was clean, and the staff was very friendly as well. Give them a try, you won't be disappointed. Ask for the habanero sauce if you dare! $1 street tacos on Taco Tuesday, I'd start with 8."}
{"text":"Seriously the best street tacos/burritos North of the border. DO NOT spend another $ at Taco Bell, Del Taco, Macayo's, On the Border,Burrito Co.-NOWHERE! Why would you when this gem sits neatly tucked into a local strip mall?! For $5-$8 you can have the most authentic Mexican food around. Family owned, and operated by the \"sisters\" -Watch the Diners Drive ins and Dives Food network show, it ROCKS! Peek through the pick up window and watch everyone feverishly chopping, stewing, and griddle-ing EVERYTHING. Carnitas-Bomb! Carne Asada-Wicked good. Chicken-Superb. Homemade Habanero sauce is on FIRE! So are their other sauces(red or green in your own squirt bottle). Only complaint is layout of the place, when it's busy you'll see. 50%  of the restaurant's seating area are for separate boys/girls restrooms. They need a remodel, but that won't stop me from becoming the Duke here."}
{"text":"Before catching a flight out from PHX to the East Coast, I decided to give this place a try for lunch.  Located in the Southwest Terminal 4 within Phoenix Sky Harbor Airport.  Menu - very easy to understand, not overwhelming.  Staff - could be a little more friendlier in their service to customers.  Just wasn't feeling the love (-1).  Food - ordered the three street tacos - Pollo, Carne Asada, & Carnitas which came with some rice and refried beans. Tacos were extremely and disappointingly small in size (-1).  In each taco, I barely tasted the pollo, carne asada, or carnitas let alone any accompanying seasonings or garnishes.  They were almost tasteless (-1). The rice was too dry and barely greasy, and barely warm.  The refried beans seemed of an okay consistency and texture but was cold (-1).  Personally I wouldn't recommend this place for a quick bite before catching your flight."}
{"text":"This place sucks. Horrible tasteless gooey burrito ! None of the ingredients were chunky. Pollo only no salsa no roasted veggies as claimed. Not even know how to wrap a burrito loose. Stay away there are better places out at this airport."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! You definitely have to try the tacos. My friends and I usually meet up here on taco Tuesdays and it's totally worth it!"}
{"text":"Nothing makes me happier than a set of tacos from this place. The meats are cared after and their margaritas make it so I wouldn't care either way. It's fast-casual and a great place for a quick bite. Their pastor tacos are my favorite."}
{"text":"I was supper hung over on monday and was dying for some posola so I found this place on yelp had pretty good review. Mhmmm I was very pleasantly surprised the posola had amazing flavor with just the perfect spice. The employee are very friendly and the restaurant is super clean and has a unique look. The also have $1 tocos on toco tusday witch most places know charge above a doller. They also have happy hour with $tocos I'm going to have to come back to this place and try them and their menudo witch look amazing too from yelp photos. The only thing I would recommend though is with the suits getting out condiments like onions radishes cilantro lime  like other Mexican restaurants makes it that much better."}
{"text":"What an unreal taco.. Guy Fieri was her for a reason!!!"}
{"text":"Los Taquitos is one of the best options at Terminal 3. You get a decent amount of food for your money. Each entre comes with rice and beans. The food is really good too and comes out quickly. The carne asada street tacos are probably some of the best I've ever had. My only negative is that drinks are on the pricey side."}
{"text":"This definitely one of the best places for Mexican food in the East Valley! The food itself is excellent...I usually get the green chile chicken enchilada plate. The main dish is super flavorful with just the right amount of spice, and the beans are absolutely amazing.   The atmosphere is good, but it gets packed during lunchtime, especially on Tuesdays. Plan ahead, around, or for takeout if you want to eat quickly."}
{"text":"Consistently rude service, dirty! dirty! dirty! But....I can't complain about the food.  It's definitely fast food Mexican style...one of those places you just close your eyes and ears and enjoy the tastes.  tip: don't ask for taquitos...even though the place is called los taquitos, they look at you funny if you don't call them rolled tacos!"}
{"text":"Favorite Taco Tuesday location! $1 street tacos. They don't skimp on the meat or toppings even on taco Tuesday. Lots of chicken, onion, and cilantro. The flavor is wonderful and the salsa add an extra kick. I usually get 3-5 street tacos and then chips and guac. Perfect Tuesday cheap but delicious dinner. Be aware of long line, especially on Tuesdays. Order ahead by calling and pick up in store seems to be the best if you plan to carry out. Fast and friendly staff. Street tacos=no cheese or sour cream, perfect for this dairy allergy foodie. Highly recommend. My go to for Taco Tuesday."}
{"text":"I visited this location for the first time this week. I had previously been to the Elliot rd location and only had the breakfast burritos there.  They were fantastic so I stopped here to pick up dinner for my husband and myself after work.   Service was friendly and time was appropriate for a \"to go\" order.  Street tacos were awesome -had the al pastor and they had great flavor. We also had the super nachos. We didn't add any meat to them but I will do so next time. I also ordered the chile relleno.   No complaints - the only feedback was the that the bin of limes only had two left and they looked a little sad :). It was close to the end of the night so I'm sure that's why it hasn't been refilled.  Overall, the meal was great and we will be returning."}
{"text":"Indeed as bad as people say. It is a chipotle reject that would be out of business were it not captive to the airport."}
{"text":"Meh. Nothing special and a bit on the gross side. Giving it two stars because it's a cute place. Very nice decor but yucky food. I'm a big fan of pastor street tacos so ordered that and the pozole. The pastor was weirdly sweet and the tacos had been fried in some nasty margarine. The pozole tasted like salty dishwater. Do yourself a favor and go to La Frontera instead!  Lacks decor but it's far superior food!"}
{"text":"Fresh made delicious food. Very very very good will come back try something different!!!  Recommend: steak burrito, pork taco and chicken quesadilla."}
{"text":"The BEST veggie burrito ever.  One of the freshest most delicious burritos ever. Something I look forward to eating, every time!!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times before the renovation. I liked the atmosphere and the Chicken Nachos were hella good. I like the burritos but they are too skinny. A great dive for the Breakfast Burrito but not enough for lunch or dinner. Overall they are worth giving a few tries to get a full feel for the menu and environment. #FoodJones"}
{"text":"Love this place !!!my hubby always gets the posole !!  The bombero burrito is to die for !!! Spicey and very large .. beans and rice is always fresh and the bombero sauce is the best!! My favorite thing to do is dip the spicey carrots in the beans !!  Even though we moved we still make the drive"}
{"text":"It's basically like chipotle but you don't pick your own stuff. You order it and they cal you up later.   The food is super average. I would say maybe on par with Chipotle but a tiny bit cheaper.  Other than the Taco Tuesday's for $1 I do t see much reason to go back. Other than to hit the restaurant 2 doors down which has bomb build your own pizza."}
{"text":"I've been here many times and I love the street tacos. But the last couple of times the food has been disgusting. The quality has changed for the worse, from the guacamole to the chicken. There are so many great restaurants popping up around Phoenix and I'd rather try something different."}
{"text":"Saw them on the Food network for having some of the best street taco's so we had to come here! We weren't let down!! They are the best I've ever had. I can't put my finger on it, I think the secret is in the sauce but it might just be some kind of perfect mix that creates magic in my mouth! This is a small little space but when we went it was PACKED! The service was fast, they are cheap and the food is fantastic. I'm glad they're just 10mins away but if they weren't I'd still travel many miles for a taco from here."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of being one of only 30 attendees to the grand opening of Los Taquitos Mexican Grill last night, and I was absolutely impressed!!  The menu features all of your mexican favorites, from street tacos to burritos to quesadillas to a delicious shrimp civiche.  The food is exceptionally priced (think around $5.00 or less for pretty much any item), but is no indication of the excellent quality and delicious flavors that await you in every bite!  The margaritas were absolutely phenomenal, and had I not been the driver, I would have been stuck there for hours just trying all of the different flavors available (such as Blood Orange, Prickly Pear, and Pomegranite).  Their salsa selection was also extensive, ranging from a light, tangy Pico de Gallo, to their uber-spicy jabenero salsa (eat with caution!!).  The location is convenient, the atmosphere was fun and casual (the place is small, but cute), the patio area (although tiny) was nice (and covered), and the owners were all SO friendly. Yes it was the Grand Opening, but I was still impressed that ALL involved made the effort to mingle with each table, introduce themselves, and chit chat throughout the evening.  Overall, I give this place a solid two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This is the place to get fantastic and fast mexican food.  The shrimp tacos and the shrimp burrito are amazing.  Very causal, I usually just get take out and enjoy the food at home since the place is so small."}
{"text":"We are driving across country & looked up places to try from The Food Network. Went here because it was fairly close to our hotel. The food was great, but the people that were working were extremely unpleasant. We are just passing thru, hopefully they are more pleasant at dinner, as they were not this afternoon."}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots inPhoenix to grab a good bite to eat and a good marg. taco tues is one of the best deals around.. They also have items that are not on the menu... So ask about them .. I will get the veggie burrito  add a protein and smother it in green sauce for a special treat"}
{"text":"Checked this joint out because it was featured on Triple D...the street tacos are the bomb!  Carnitas was my favorite. The green sauce is a bit spicy for me but tasty good food!"}
{"text":"We were visiting relatives over Thanksgiving 2010 and staying down the street at the Pointe Hilton.  We're Triple D junkies and look for places Guy has reviewed when we're vacationing.  This is a small strip mall location that is bright, clean and friendly.  The food was very enjoyable, well seasoned, without a lot of frill and reasonably priced.  The salsas were great with good heat.  The carne asada street tacos were perfect and the cheese enchilada was soft, cheesy and tangy.  A couple cold cerveza and flan for dessert, and the bill was around $20.  Will definitely go back next time we're in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Still good street tacos. However they raised their deal taco prices on Taco Tuesday by 30%. In addition, they have raised the prices by over 10% without representation on their menu board. Not cool. There are better taco deals to be had. Unfortunate. They were one of my favorites that I looked forward to telling people about...not anymore."}
{"text":"amazing food!!! best margarita i have ever had...ever!!! the hh prices are insane, you better go for dinner right now!!! bombero burrito and asada tacos are all you need to know!!!"}
{"text":"Great location, awesome decor, and the food consistently is outstanding!!! Keep up the good work!!!"}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and was literally expecting a taquito bar. Kinda misleading! There are no taquitos on the menu, but the menu is fresh and easy! I had tacos. The fish tacos aren't battered like every where else. The carne asada tacos were perfect. They do serve alcohol which is awesome. One other downside, is that parking there is a pain the the butt!"}
{"text":"It was really delicious food. However it seemed pretty pricey for what you got. Mexican food is known to serve too much that's like a trademark attribute of Mexican restaurants. The tacos were TINY and the tostada should be called the tostadita it was so small! My husband and I were still hungry when we left which was sad because the food tasted good and the place is beautiful but the portions were offensive"}
{"text":"Sup par mexican food, with average service, in a grimy establishment.  This place is barely a notch above the crappy filaberto's that infest the phoenix area.    Bland taco meats on walmart quality tortillas, and other cliche combos of meat, beans, & tortillas that is supposed to be \"authentic\" mexican food.  It's not even a bang for the buck as many places serve much better food for less."}
{"text":"Los Taquitos has always been a favorite at work.  Almost every Friday my co-workers and I make a giant order and it always comes out great!  Try the potato, egg, and cheese burrito (served all day).  Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Wonderful food & atmosphere. My favorite thing was how they stacked the napkins.. hard to explain, but once you see it you'll understand. I had ordered 2 fish tacos..then after eating my first one I ordered a third..get the fish taco 10/10."}
{"text":"Solid burritos.  I had the carnitas and they were very, very good.  Staff was very friendly and helpful.  It is in a strip mall, but they have done a nice job with the interior.  I would recommend."}
{"text":"I was in the area for labor day weekend and of course, not being familiar with the area and where to eat. I took out my handy dandy yelp app on my phone to look for a place to eat that got good ratings. Well, I found this place on yelp and reading some of the reviews and the fact the Guy Fiery from food network came here was enough for me to give it a try. It was an exit away from the Arizona Grand Resort where we were staying.   My family and I order the popular 3 taquitos meal but don't be confused and think that these are the crunchy rolled fried \"taquitos\", no.  they're mini tacos and we also ordered the chile relleno.   The taquitos were ok, nothing spectacular and it came with a side of beans and rice which were luke warm and not the satisfying warm/hot home cooked beans and rice.  The chile relleno were definitely very good and should probably be the more \"popular\" item. The filling was nice and cheesy with potato and the sauce had a lot of flavor. Worth ordering!  Not sure what the hype is about but I did like the restaurant wall artwork."}
{"text":"Great little restaurant, great service. Just down the street from the Hilton Resort.  Quality food.  We had a wet carne asana burritos and street tacos.  Very tasty and delicious.  If you are staying at the Hilton and want quality food and service, you won't be disappointed.  Stay away from Aunt Chiladas across the street from Hilton it's horrible."}
{"text":"Food and service are poor. Go some where else. Street tacos must have been ran over Rice and beans are better at Taco Bell."}
{"text":"Great taco shop!! Must get the tacos! Been back a few times and haven't found anything that I wouldn't order again. Great food, fair prices."}
{"text":"I finally got a chance to check out this Diners Drive-In and Dives spot.  I am glad I did as the food was good and they serve posole  on a daily basis.    I got the posole and a shrimp ceviche tostada.  The tostada was great nice and thick to hold up with the ceviche on it and not get soggy fast.  The flavor was great and there was plenty of shrimp.  The posole was good not as spicy as I like but that was fixed with some Tapatio sauce and then it was great.    If you are in the area I recommend this place and I will be back for sure to try the tacos eveyone is raving about in their reviews."}
{"text":"Tasty stuff! I had tacos and menudo, and was not disappointed. Prices seem fair.. especially if you order a daily special-"}
{"text":"I went in hearing great things about the breakfast burrito and it did not disappoint! The eggs bacon and potatoes were cooked perfectly and I never took a bite of it without getting full flavor of the burrito."}
{"text":"3 Taquitos - a little over priced, but excellent.   Bombero Burrito - Spicy! Super good.   Al Pastor Burrito - ask for no beans and add cilantro and onion. Very good.   Overall this place has great food, but not quite as good as a San Diego Taco Shop and the portions are a bit on the small side for the prices."}
{"text":"Let me first say that if it wasn't for the shotty customer service this review would be 5 stars. I absolutely love their breakfast burritos!! They taste just like my mom & Nana's cooking. The unnamed lady at the register (not a newbie!) was just so rude! My 10 year old said \"Good morning, how are you?\" With a huge smile might I add! Lady responds with a sour face and hard tone \"good, how are you?\" I would think that with business being as good as it is and their stellar reputation that this is absolutely unacceptable! So disappointed! Maybe all of of the publicity has gone to her head. After all you are still in the business of food and customer service, maybe a reality check would be good for them. But hey, thanks for the delicious burritos"}
{"text":"Terrible restaurant management. Attempted to order a chicken quesadilla but was told it would take about an hour to make it because the chicken was frozen. We also attempted to order a burrito as a bowl and get the tortilla on the side. We were told the tortilla would be and extra $1. I confirmed that the burrito would cost $8, the salad with no tortilla would also cost $8, but a naked burrito w/ the same tortilla that would make the burrito would cost $9. Terrible customer service and illogical practices."}
{"text":"What's not to like?  Flavorful. Service was quick enough.  Pricing for airport food was reasonable.   Very good carnitas burrito. Carnitas quesadilla was good enough. A bit light on pork.   A great choice in terminal 4."}
{"text":"The fish in the fish taco was grilled, not fried (which is usually how I prefer my fish tacos). And while it was well-cooked (meaning not dry), overall it was a bit too salty for me. But I certainly can't say it was lacking in flavor.  Now the carnitas taco was fantastic. It was delicious. Great texture, great flavor... just a great experience in general. They don't overcomplicate anything. It's the tortilla, the carnitas, and the usual onions, cilantro, and hot sauce. Just enjoy.  Mind you, we came here immediately after having eaten at another restaurant (the fourth restaurant out of five we hit that day), and even on a full stomach, this taco was still that good."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite place to go for tacos! Anybody I have ever taken with me enjoys it just as much as I do. Every time I go I leave completely satisfied- I'd recommend it to any one!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at this location twice while traveling thru.  Last time I ordered a burrito bowl, which wasn't too bad.  This last visit I ordered the 3 street tacos.  I opted for 1 chick and 2 pork (carnitas).  I think the pork had a better flavor.  The beans and rice are nothing outstanding, but good. I added their salsa verde (green) to the pork tacos for added deliciousness.  From what I have seen, this place usually has a line, so be prepared to wait a little bit.  The cashier usually isn't that friendly either."}
{"text":"Stopped in last evening with family. Ordered a quesadilla, smothered bean burrito and a smothered pork burrito, chips, salsa and guacamole. The chips, salsa and guacamole hit the mark. Everything else was below grade and cold. One of the gals (very pleasant) stopped by to see how things were and happily returned the plates to the kitchen to be heated up. Sadly, all that did was kinda warm things up, deform the plastic plates and make the tortillas chewy. Not a good experience."}
{"text":"I am a fan of the Food Network's \"Diners, Drive-INs, and Dives\" and several years ago Guy visited this restaurant.  I made an excellent choice.  I dropped in just before lunch and ordered the street tacos plate.  You have a choice of pork, steak, chicken etc and the only bad thing I can say about this eatery is the cashier.  When she asked which meat I wanted, I asked her which was the most popular and she replied with \"They are all good\".  I'm sure they are, but I wanted to know which was most popular!  I order the steak street tacos and they are excellent and have lots of flavor.  The beans and rice that come with the plate taste good and are not heavy after you eat them.  The dining area is very clean. The tables and chairs can be moved around to accommodate most parties.  There is also additional dining patio, but depending on the time of the year, you might not want to sit out there as it will be too hot.  I'm pretty sure evenings must be really nice to sit out there.  I will be back the next time I'm in Phoenix, hopefully to try other things on the menu, but I really love street tacos overall."}
{"text":"Delicious delicious delicious! I had veggie burrito today and I have to say it was exactly what I was craving because it was so good and very tasty! Go try them out!"}
{"text":"Don't let the location fool you. This place is legit. Some of the best Carne Asada I have ever had!! If you are reading this, just go, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Everything is edible but compared to filibertos it pales in comparison. Their breakfast burritos always need a little salt and plenty of salsa to liven them up."}
{"text":"We visit our son in Phoenix fairly often and when we go up there, we enjoy trying new places to add to our repertoire of ethnic delicacies. Whether, Chinese, Mexican, Greek.  We are open for anything.   I checked out this place on Yelp for reviews and all of them were great.   I was looking forward to finding a \"gem\" of a Mexican restaurant.  We all agreed that the dishes were mediocre.  It wasn't the cleanest place either.  I ordered my usual chicken enchilladas  with green sauce.  Very tasty and a little different.  They marinate the chicken, pork, and beef which makes the chicken, pork and beef a little bit mushy.  The rice was tasty though.  My other half ordered the chille relleno which was also a little bit different from what we are used to.  It was served in a brown sauce with cheese, onions, and diced potatoes.  Pretty tasty. He also had a lengua (tongue) taco. Small but also very tasty. There is no waiter service.  You go up to the counter and order.  I'm not crazy about the plastic plates, but no tipping is a good plus.  We went for lunch about 2.00PM and the place was crowded.  So obviously lots of people enjoy this place.  The menu was plentiful with lots of choices.   I understand the place was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins-and Dives.  I guess you could label this place in the Dive category.  Prices were quite reasonable.  All and all, if you like Mexican Street food, Los Taquitos might fit the bill. I'm not sure if we will return or not.  We will still try other places to finally find Mexican Food Heaven.  Even if nothing is perfect, the journey to get to it is the best part."}
{"text":"This is the kind of place you visit on Tuesdays because street tacos are ONLY $1. Even if it's not Tuesday, the prices are cheap!! I was craving me some tacos on a Tuesday so naturally I stumbled into this place.   I tried their chicken taco, carnitas taco, and al pastor taco. My favorite was easily their al pastor. The meat was seasoned to perfection and the flavors were as an al pastor taco should be. Next favorite was the chicken and last was the carnitas. Normally I'm a huge carnitas fan but they must marinate their carnitas with something that doesn't really tickle my fancy. I still ate it, don't get me wrong but it wasn't my favorite. I ordered my tacos with a side of rice and beans and the total came out to be about $5.30 or something like that. Basically, an amazing deal. I didn't even finish all of my rice and beans because I was so full! Each street taco comes with two little tortillas.   The staff was friendly and the rest of the items on their menu looked great too. They also have a bar where margaritas and beer can be ordered. They have happy hour so I can only imagine they have awesome deals. The inside is much more appealing than the outside so don't judge a book by it's cover! I will definitely be heading back there."}
{"text":"I really like this place! Saw it on Diners Drives Ins and Dives even though I don't really like the show, I still gave it a shot. I'd been craving some better mexican foods because everything I've tasted was... sad. I was pleasantly surprised that this family owned shop was delicious. I love the bombero burrito because the sauce is spicy but still yummy! A lot of hot sauces are just spicy with no yummy.   This has officially become my mex spot. :D"}
{"text":"Rice and beans are ok, but the tacos are amazing!  I think I prefer the Pastor and the Carnitas above all else.    Taco Tuesday's $0.99!"}
{"text":"I love everything about this place! Amazingly friendly staff, delicious food and now they offer margaritas (be still my heart)!!! I love the carne Asada quesedilla and basically anything they offer for breakfast. The enchiladas, street tacos and chilaquiles are seriously delectable as well. They stay busy but they are always efficient and it is WORTH THE WAIT."}
{"text":"Wrong taste of the carnitas. Chicken had little to no flavir. Carne asada inedible....too much grease. Should have chosen the sandwich shop next door."}
{"text":"I come here frequently and get my usual Veggie Burrito for 5 bucks smothered in Green sauce for an extra $1!!! Can't beat the value and their flavors are amazing!!"}
{"text":"Great service!!! Employees are very nice and the food is delicious. It's my third time going and i will definitely go again."}
{"text":"How to Ruin a brand.... been a long time lover of Los Taquitos frequent Ahwatukee location monthly, but whatever this place is in the airport is horrible giving you over salted French fries and calling them papas.. then the breakfast burrito is not much better eggs too hot to eat cold tortilla cheese cold in one bite melted in next.... recommend you pass till you reach your destination"}
{"text":"Disappointing been coming here for 12 plus years.  The last few times have been a bit hit and miss from so-so to amazing as usual. This weekend was Not so great with a 30minute wait and cold food when it was finally received will give one more chance."}
{"text":"Los Taquitos makes the best fish street tacos, period. My mouth waters every time I think about eating them. Sooo flavorful and healthy, too! I love them with plenty of their warm green salsa and some of their spicy carrots as well. Not a bad price, either. You just ca't go wrong."}
{"text":"I'm from LA and this joint has the best \"street taco\" al pastor tacos. And they're only $1 on tuesdays Plus, the staff is cool."}
{"text":"Haven't been here in a few years what a change! . They expanded their restaurant ( much needed) and it is still packed. The food is great! See opps! I ate it sorry lol!! We had shrimp, chicken , and carne asada street tacos and a carnitas tostada, guacamole and chips. If you haven't been here ya gotta go. Great Mexican food and breakfast burritos too !"}
{"text":"This might be my first one star. The food was decent, but the experience far outweighs the food. On a Sunday morning around 11:30am, it took them 35 minutes to get us our food. It was busy, but nothing out of the ordinary. There were plenty of tables open. This is a walk-up and order so it boggles my mind how they weren't prepared.   So, poor experience there and then I just checked my credit card statement and they charged me twice for 2 different amounts, totaling $50. Our total order was $22. Not only did I waste a ton of time waiting for my food, but now I have to call them back to fix this. Maybe it was a one-off, but I can't give them the benefit of doubt with 2 big screw-ups."}
{"text":"AMAZING. Best tacos I've ever eaten. Period. The street tacos are incredibly tasty. We always get a bunch if those and some guac and chips. Never disappointed."}
{"text":"Get the carne asada street tacos with everything on it (onions, cilantro).. the beans and rice... mmmmmm."}
{"text":"Best tacos in the valley.  Love this place, it's not pretentious or overpriced at all.  It is a little bit of a dive but a foodie would love this place"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! They have authentic food, that is both inexpensive and of quality. I was expecting this place to be a hole in the wall since most super authentic places are, but the inside is actually really nice too! They even have a bar."}
{"text":"I wish I tried this place sooner. I've been here 4 weeks in a row now. The street tacos are really tasty, I like to get them with flour tortillas (extra charge for that). The breakfast burrito with chorizo is awesome. I tried the chilaquiles, liked those as well. I plan to be back soon and try other menu items. The modern Mexican decor is fun and cute. Definitely my new favorite go to Mexican food restaurant."}
{"text":"Best tacos in the area, I have been visiting this place over the last 5 years at least. Real good tacos!!! Had that sometimes the wait is too long, especially after they remodeled.  Still worth the wait sometimes."}
{"text":"The burritos are amazing here and their service is impeccable. Even when it is hectic and busy, they all make sure to keep a smile on their faces. I am very impressed with their business and am so excited they are expanding to a chandler location!"}
{"text":"Welcome to CentPho Los Taquitos....  Been wanting to check out Los Taquitos other location for a while, then I saw they opened up at 16th/Glendale.  Went for the street tacos. Had 1 carne asada, 2 carnitas, and one each of the other pork varieties. All were excellent, very fresh, crispy fresh double-tortillas. The hot sauce is delicious, and they brought a squeeze bottle to the table for me which is a big plus. I also tried the Habanero sauce - not too insanely hot at first, but the kind of heat that creeps up. The whole lunch was $8 so I will be back.  BOTTOM LINE: Welcome to PHX, I will be a regular"}
{"text":"As if you all didn't already know that this place is super fantastic...  My favorites are the carne asada tacos and the shrimp tacos.  My husband loves the bombero burrito with carnitas.  Everything is delicious!"}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos I have ever had! And absolutely amazing quality food for a great price. We tried the carnitas, chicken, and fish tacos and all were outstanding. Also really enjoyed their beans and guacamole. We shared an order of the nachos with steak, and they were fantastic but a little soggy towards the bottom. The food was also served very quickly, so we were in and out of the restaurant in no time. Definitely recommend that you try los taquitos if you are in the Phoenix area!"}
{"text":"Food was good, price was right. If you live in the 'Tuk, recommend it I might."}
{"text":"Decent chicken street tacos.  Nothing super special, but above average from what I remember.  It's a tiny little place, but looks really new on the inside."}
{"text":"um... yum! How had I not been here before? I work in the neighborhood and had been meaning to come here for a long time, but never got around to it. I finally went to Los Taquitos and was pleasantly surprised. The line was loooong, but went fairly quickly considering the size (we waited about 20 min in line). I came on a taco tuesday (1$ chicken and al pastor tacos) and had one al pastor taco, one carne asada taco, and a beef tamale. Each item was delicious and fresh tasting. The sauces on the meats were perfect and the salsas were perfectly spiced to complement the food. The tamale had a nice consistency and the meat was tender. I would definitely come here again, but maybe try to come at an off time."}
{"text":"We frequent the Ahwatukee location and we think it's a great little spot to grab a quick bite if you are in the mood for Mexican food. The beans are yummy!"}
{"text":"Grabbed a bite because we needed something quick, but didn't want fast food.  It was excellent!!  I highly recommend this place to everyone."}
{"text":"Best tacos in Ahwatukee!!!!! If you are in the area this spot is def a must. I have tried almost every item in the menu, but hands down to the carnitas or lengua tacos. Yum!"}
{"text":"This is our go-to torta place.  They recently expanded and updated the seating area, providing for more room and better ambiance.  Everything we have gotten here has been delicious, but I recommend the Carne Asada Torta and any of the burritos made into a bowl.  Lovely owners and amazing food."}
{"text":"Taco Tuesday was a great decision. The carnitas and carne asada were both excellent.  I did not care for the chicken. The veggie bowl is surprisingly delicious... I loved the potatoes. If you want a healthy and tasty quick casual alternative to Chipotle, with a much better selection, this is your place."}
{"text":"We were visiting for the weekend and stayed at the Pointe Hilton Squaw Peak. Thought we try this place since it's by the hotel and have good Yelp reviews. This place have excellent service, yummy food, good quality and so economical. We'll be back the next time we're in the area. Thank you :)"}
{"text":"Incredibly good Mexican food!!!!! Visiting from out of town for spring training and ended up eating here twice cuz the food was so delicious!!! Pastor tacos, nachos and rolled tacos were my favorite!!!"}
{"text":"So excited to have discovered this gem! We saw it on a list for Diners, Drive-ins and Dives and figured we'd give it a shot! So happy that we did!! Authentic Mexican food, their beans... seriously just like Mexico! *Happy dance* Loved their chips and salsa,  couldn't get enough of their carnitas!! The bombers sauce is divine, Smokey and just the right amount of heat!  The restaurant was clean and inviting, the atmosphere was relaxed. The staff were beyond professional and made sure we were satisfied and had all that we needed. Super impressed with the sweet young girls who helped us!"}
{"text":"Very good street tacos with some good drink specials as well.  Tucked back in a strip mall but still a pretty cool atmosphere once you get inside."}
{"text":"My 3rd review of a Guy Fiero-visited joint.. 2 here in Phoenix metro and one in Flagstaff.  This is TRULY a little strip mall dive.  Walk up and order, industrial-strength seating (i.e. hard/indestructible), etc.  None of that is a bad thing at all.. just trying to be sure everyone's expectations are set properly.  I wasn't sure if this was a sit-down joint or not, based on all I'd seen/read.  Now I know.  Frankly, I prefer it this way.  The tacos looked mighty good and I HAD to try them.  But I was also lured by the cheese crisp, with carne asada.  $6 for a combo with no steak, only $6.75 with.  Holy cow, there was a TON of steak in this thing, and it was humangous!  But it wasn't what I'd call a cheese crisp, it was really a quesadilla, at least by all of my past Mexican food experiences.  Nonetheless, it was pretty tasty, and a BIG meal by the time you threw in the beans & rice (which were very average).  I also got a chicken taco, on corn tortillas.  The tortillas are tiny, but they load the thing up with a lot of meat and fixins, so at $1.15 (!), they're an awesome deal, and VERY tasty.  On the Brak-o-meter, the taco rates a solid 5 stars, the cheese crisp a good 3.5 stars, and value rates 5.. for a composite average of 4 or thereabouts.  I wouldn't necessarly advise you to drive way across town for this place, but if you're anywhere in the immediate area or passing through, it's definitely worth a bite."}
{"text":"Best burritos and tacos anywhere in the southeast valley. The restaurant itself isn't great but the good is exceptional. I usually get it to go. I especially love the breakfast burritos."}
{"text":"I found this place a few months ago and kick myself for not finding it sooner. I live very close. I had a Carnita burrito and it was sooooo good!! The best I have had so far. I ordered rice and beans also and they wrapped up my burrito in tinfoil so that everything didn't get slopped together when i took it home. Their Margarita's are awesome!!! They are pricy after happy hour is over. I don't care for their guacamole, it really doesn't have any flavor."}
{"text":"Pretty good! I love the carnitas tacos with the red sauce. Taco Tuesday's are great to get a bunch of tacos for super cheap"}
{"text":"Capt and I just had the street tacos, steak carnitas. Absolutely fantastic and worth the walk for the price from B9. Serving size is a little small but price point is good for an airport! Definitely a must try!"}
{"text":"I came here for the first time and ordered The Super Nachos with steak.  Everything was pretty tasty and the steak in the nachos had a great flavor....the Pico was really spicy.  I'll be back, I'm dying to try the fajitas and tacos.  Great for a lunch time break."}
{"text":"Just had the 3 street taco meal. That was great! They were quite busy when I arrived and it was standing room only so I ordered to go. By the time my order was ready the place was only 1/3 full....bad timing on my part, friday@12:30. I got one pollo, one carnitas and one pastor. They were all great. The meal also comes with rice and beans. Im full for $7. There are 7 tables and some outdoor seating so its a small place.  One wall is adorned with some cool murals.  I'm keeping this place on my list for sure."}
{"text":"Awesome tasting food, looking forward to Taco Tuesday $1 Carnitas, Al Pastor and Chicken. Jamaica and Horchata taste really good. Thanks Guys for making something so simple, taste good. Others tend to mess it up a lot. Thumbs up"}
{"text":"Two words, Taco Tuesday!  $1 tacos can't be beat!  Oh and did I say they are also very delicious tacos?!  Because they really are amazing!  Taco Tuesday $1 tacos are chicken (my fav), carnitas and pastor. I also recommend the carne asada and the fish tacos. The prickly pear margarita is also very good!"}
{"text":"289 reviews. Speaks for itself. Reliably delicious and fast. Green chili pork pork burrito is the bomb.com."}
{"text":"I wanted to like this place, I really did. I had a super craving for mexi-food and unfortunately where I live(N. Scottsdale) doesn't have too many authentic options. I have grown up eating mexican food from my own nana's,  & my tia's, prima's, nino's... (you get the idea) so I consider myself an accredited taco critic. I ordered an asada and a fish taco, which also came with rice and beans. The rice was the best part of this meal. The fish was unidentifiable and very mushy, it came grilled(? I'm not even sure). I took maybe two bites and that was it, salsa couldn't even save this. I personally prefer the baja style and would recommend rubio's or basically any other place for fish tacos, unless you like canned tuna fish in a corn tortilla. I'd also like to throw out there I thought their salsa lacked flavor and was watery! Ugh!!! Tragic!!! The carne asada was only slightly better it came out room temperature and had an odd smoky flavor. I'm all for grilling food but I get the feeling this carne had maybe been grilled a day or two before and reheated? However, my boyfriend had an asada burrito and his carne was considerably better. All in all a disappointing experience and I will not be coming back. I am curious as to how this place was chosen to be featured on Food Network?! Hopefully for their sake this was just a bad day for them and they step their taco game up. As for me, my venture for great tacos is aimed further South (:"}
{"text":"Been here twice. Both times the food was good and filling. Tonight there was an issue and the cashier kindly told me it would be a 15 minute wait for any food to make sure I had time to make my flight. I always appreciate honesty. Ordered something o could eat on the go, and it was really good."}
{"text":"Small portions but not overly priced for an airport option. Had a breakfast burrito and it wasn't bad. Pretty light on the stuff inside the tortilla and the potatoes that came with it was a humorously small portion (not sure why they even include it... Looks silly in the big tinfoil bowl."}
{"text":"Excellent fast Mexican Food. Guy Fieri led us, once again, to a great local eatery!"}
{"text":"We have just moved to a new neighborhood and we were driving around looking for Mexican food saw Los Taquitos and decided to try it out.  There were a lot of people inside so we figured it must be good. I had been craving a good torta all day. The prices here are phenomenal!!! The asada torta was DELICIOUS!!! Tender meat and crunchy bread. My boyfriend ordered the street tacos,  he loved them. I recommend this place and we will definitely be coming back,  this may be or new favorite spot."}
{"text":"Very basic menu but packs a lot of flavor. Their breakfast burritos are on point did not get a chance to taste their tacos but if it's anything like the breakfast this place is worth going back for."}
{"text":"Excellent flavors but the food to me is so hard to eat due to the spice level. I never felt this used to be a problem until lately, I got an Al Pastor and Chicken taco and they were just soooo spicy without even adding any of their sauces. They should consider toning it down."}
{"text":"Was in town for work and wanted some good mexican food. Drove past this place and glad I stopped. Awesome place nice clean and good prices. Ordered the Carne asada torta was very good. Also had tacos. Thanks again."}
{"text":"I was glad to have found this place through Yelp! My boyfriend and I were road tripping through Arizona visiting his friends and needed breakfast.   I ordered their Pollo street tacos ($1.29 each!) and a side of refried beans and they were oh so yummy.   The decor is very modern and service was great. Really enjoyed my visit here!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to go have dinner since we had gone to Arizona for the Dodgers spring training for the weekend. We were all craving Mexican food. One of our friends who lives out here recommended this place to us so we googled it to get the address.   We got there and took at look at their menu, it was a hard choice. Everything sounded too good!! But I guess cause we were super hungry. Well we ordered not knowing what to expect.  It didn't take to long to get our food either wit it being kind of busy and only 2 people working the front floor. We sat down took one bite of our food. And let me just tell u! It was beyond bomb!!!! for it being our first time we were impressed. They meat has a delicious taste to it. We would definitely go back when we're out in Arizona."}
{"text":"Staff is rude. You can tell they hate their jobs. Food is ok I guess for the airport. Annoying to try and get a sit so you can actually eat. People just sit and stay and never leave until their plane arrives.   If I had another choice I would take it."}
{"text":"I have got to say, this was one of our favorite meals of our trip. I'm not sure if we were starving but I think the food really was just that good.   Most of us got smothered burritos, but some got enchiladas too. The staff here were friendly and answered all of our questions.   Our food came out very quickly! Their red sauce they use to smother their burritos and enchiladas had such an amazing depth of flavor. It was rich without being too spicy or unbalanced. We had no trouble gobbling everything up and left wishing we had found this place sooner in our trip!"}
{"text":"Sometimes I choose where I want dinner based on what I want to drink. I wanted a prickly pear margarita.  And I got the last one. Boom.  I also wanted a pomegranate margarita but they ran out of margarita mix. :(  Some good eats going on here.  I had the chile rellenos with rice and beans ($7) and it was great.  It was super cheesy and had excellent flavor.  The sauce paired with the poblano pepper led to a sweeter tasting dish which was great.  The rice was fluffy and not overcooked or mushy like other places and the beans had good flavor.  The red sauce they offer is also amazing and has quite the kick.  I also liked the warm flour tortilla served on the side with my chile rellenos.  That prickly pear margarita... strong.  That tequila got the Asian glow going!  The shrimp burrito with rice and beans ($9) was also decent.  Still not as good as my favorite burrito place but it was good.  Los Taquitos is an adorable place featuring some gorgeous art murals on the wall. Mismatched chairs fill up the space and there's plenty of lighting for your Yelp pics. Staff is friendly and the food comes out super hot. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've only had the Street Tacos here, and they are A1! The tortilla shells are fresh and sturdy. The meat melts in your mouth and is well seasoned. I've had the carnitas, asada, pollo and tinga -soooooo good. The horchata is tasty as well.  They top the the street tacos off with chopped red onions and cilantro. I'm not crazy about the amount of red onion that goes on here -it's alot. Especially when compared to the cilantro -very little.  The ambiance is relaxed and the decor is very nice. Service is also great.  Can't wait to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite local places for tacos. Like alot of people I found this after watching them on diners drive ins dives.  It's got a totally different vibe since the remodel and I love it!Food still has the authentic homemade taste you just couldn't call it a dive anymore. The service staff is always friendly and helpful. They did keep the original yellow benches but when they expanded they added quite a few tables in between. One wall now has flat screen tvs, new lighting and modern music. Food wise I like the AL pastor the best then the Carne asada or chicken. Depending on how hungry I am either getting tacos or burritos. It's rare I dont leave here without getting a horchata. It's fun to munch on the pickled veggies while waiting and both homemade salsa have unique flavors. I get my burritos with the spicy bombero sauce but it's not for everybody.... (at least be able to do Chipotle hot salsa if you gonna try this)"}
{"text":"I picked Los Taquitos for an easy lunch after arriving from the Phoenix Airport and was not disappointed.   I ordered fish and shrimp tacos and was very impressed with both. Fresh, tasty, and perfect portion sizes. I also shared an order of chips and guacamole and have to point out that their avocado is fantastic - very clean and \"refreshing\" tasting, something that is often promised but not delivered in guacamole.  I'm only subtracting one point as the restaurant was a bit disorganized. They do a pretty good takeout business here, and while I was planning on dining in, the majority of the tables were occupied by guests waiting for their food (and not eating). This isn't the restaurant's fault necessarily, but worth being aware of if you are planning on dining in."}
{"text":"As for airport food it hit the spot! I am not sure if it was yummy or I was really hungry. I tasted healthy greasy! Not sure how else to explain it. The meat had a little kick, my one suggestion is adding additional lettuce."}
{"text":"Meat on the tacos was very dry not even the sauce or the lemons could bring the taquitos alive. And your pomegranate margarita is far from being pomegranate it is grapefruit."}
{"text":"So let's talk about Taco Tuesdays. $1 per Taco for only the following flavor meat selections:  - Chicken - Carnitas  - Pastor  The chicken is just okay. But the Al Pastor & Carnitas are SO good. Slow cooked to perfection. I only wish the Al Pastor had a bit more pineapple in into balance out that saltiness. I've had a margarita or two here during happy hour. Nothing very notable about them though. Come here for the tacos!"}
{"text":"great tacos, try the al pastor and the lengua.   guy fiere ateb here and loved it."}
{"text":"Excellent experience! The food and service were wonderful, the place was clean, and loved the decor.   My wife had the shrimp burrito bowl; the shrimp were tender and delicious. I had the red chile beef bowl; the flavors all blended perfectly! We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Sometimes I crave one of those taco salads where the bowl is a fried tortilla shell, and this is where I go to find it. It may not be on the menu, but they'll make it for you, and it's amazing! Portion size is also huge. I order mine with chicken and without refried beans. Sometimes beans can make the shell soggy, and I want it perfectly crispy. On the inside you have the chicken, rice, cheese, and lettuce. They also give you sides of sour cream and guac. This is still the best Mexican food in Ahwatukee, and you can expect greatness every time you go!"}
{"text":"Line moves SLOWLY.  If there's no line then the breakfast burrito is worth it, as far as airport food goes.  Decent tortilla, and the accompanying hot sauce has a decent kick.  Otherwise, don't bother."}
{"text":"Quick and friendly service at a great price.  Casual enough to bring the kids and food is great! Try the flan, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Los taquitos could easily be the best Mexican food I've had in Phoenix. Family-owned business that has been featured on the food network. Their food is delicious and their menu is expansive. Price is moderate but we're not talking about a restaurant with a waitress. This place is always packed and nobody ever seems to be unhappy with their meal. WINNER!!"}
{"text":"I just started working graveyard shift at my company and a colleague told me Los Taquitos was very close! Let me just say yesterday was my first day eating there... I ordered Pozole and 2 chicken tamales... And I came right back today! Today I ordered the enchiladas and 2 more of those delicious chicken tamales!!! The pozole was amazing!!! The soup comes with your choice of corn or flour tortillas of chips on the side. Oh and I had to order take out, food was hot and prepared great! Everyone was nice and professional. Very clean establishment. I can tell very fresh ingredients! As far as the pic the enchilada literally rolled / were upside down from my driving so I am not sure how the original presentation was. The enchiladas were half rojo half verde (red/green) which is really nice for an indecisive individual as myself lol! They were pretty good, I've had better, but I overall I would order again. Did I mention the tamales?!?! I put verde on them so flavorful... I must confess I think I am in love with them! Great prices and I hear there is $1 taco Tuesday!  Update: today is 12/17 I have a problem and literally addicted to this place lol! 3rd day in a row!!! Tried lengua taco, best I've had in my life and I have tried many at other places. Asada quesadilla is good... A different seasoning on the meet that I have not had before... Maybe it's chipotle because I usually don't order that flavor but still tasty. And the Horchata is unbelievably awesome!"}
{"text":"Just left... Remodeled the place but did not have staff to accommodate all the people..... Waited from 8:16 until closing 9pm and our food wasn't ready... There were maybe 20 people in the place when it fits like 45. So it was half full.... Would never return! Left and asked for $$$ back. Terrible service! If you value your time save your time and go to Del taco"}
{"text":"I want to give Los Taquitos a better rating because their food is good. However the quality of service (or lack of) needs work. Been here several times but our latest visit might be our last. July 15, a slow Saturday afternoon around 2. Around 2-3 other customers inside. We chose to sit at the small bar area for some margaritas and fish tacos. Four female employees in sight- one cashier, one sweeping, one coming back and forth with supplies and one behind the cashier, playing on her cell phone. We sat at the bar for approximately 15 minutes, with no greeting or acknowledgement whatsoever. I then asked the sweeper if we would be helped. She was kind and hollered out to someone to help us. Another 5 minutes went by, nothing, so we decided to leave. There are so many other eateries in that area so we took our business and money elsewhere."}
{"text":"I can't believe it took me this long to come to Los Taquitos. The street style tacos are really good, maybe a little spicy for some but that's the way I like it. I want to come back and have a margarita and maybe try something new."}
{"text":"Awesome Taco Tuesday deal! Pollo, carnitas and pastor street tacos for $1. And I'm always weary about super cheap tacos but these were excellent! Most definitely will be coming back soon and often!"}
{"text":"We came out here to Arizona for a trip and we saw the reviews for this place were pretty good. We decided to try it since it seemed to be the place for good tacos.  They were pretty good! I got chicken tacos and they were seasoned very well. It had a nice kick to it. The only complaint I had about the tacos was that they were dry. I'm the kind of person who likes to eat their tacos with just cilantro but this definitely needed salsa. The salsa, by the way, was good! It complimented the chicken. I enjoyed it. The service was a bit mediocre. The lady at the register seemed to be rude to me. She was not having it when I couldn't decide what to get. I kinda wanted enchiladas but I wasn't sure. She seemed annoyed so I just went with the tacos to save myself from getting annoyed that she was annoyed lol but the service could have been better. Would I go back? Sure. They were good. I hope to stop by when I go back to Arizona."}
{"text":"Bomb ass tacos!  I could eat here everyday. I'm feeding 3 adults (one pregnant) and a 3 year old for $25 PLUS these tacos are so good, it'll make you wanna slap yo mamma. No more \"make me a sandwich\", it's now \" go get me some tacos\". They need an el mirage chapter, because we've got jack shit out there, and I REALLY LOVE these tacos. Please?"}
{"text":"After seeing this place on Diners Drive-ins and Dives I wanted to check it out and boy am I glad I did. I have been there several times for brunch on the weekends for the chicken-scrambled egg chiliaquiles and a breakfast burrito. Now the fact that you can have a margarita for breakfast on the weekend is great and the food is good. Friendly and fast service makes it better. Totally worth checking out."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a friend and it turned out to be very good. Pictured below is a steak and shrimp quesadilla with pico de gallo, and their two sauces. Quality is excellent, everything is fresh. I'd recommend to anyone in the area or passing through."}
{"text":"Having recently moved to the Phx area, I wanted to find a good Mexican place. Saw an old episode of DDD last night and the food looked so good. I decided to come in since I was in the area. I ordered the tacos. The asada has a really great flavor. It had a nice char taste. My GF ordered the asada chimichanga, and it was so delicious. I think I found the place I was hoping for."}
{"text":"Most authentic mexican food in AZ finnaly! You can feel that the quality of food comes from the fact that the establishment is still famil owned and opperated."}
{"text":"Another quick lunch visit to one of my favorite taco places in the valley. I haven't reviewed this place in more than 5 years so ... Expanded seating area, friendly service, and still really great food. I was craving fish tacos and ordered a trio that did not disappoint. Not your overbattered fish taco here - nope. Fresh delicious grilled fish on their homemade tortillas. Great salsa and beans too. Still a great plate of yum."}
{"text":"This place has the best tacos in town. Same great food as the original location in Ahwatukee but in a bigger and brighter location. I love all their tacos, the meat is always cooked perfectly and each one has it's own unique flavor. It is great that they now have fish tacos as well. The only thing that keeps them from 5 stars is that I wish they would have real plates and glassware for the dine-in customers. So much trash and waste from all the styrofoam and plastic!"}
{"text":"This place has amazing street tacos! Anyone who says different has never been to Mexico and ordered \"taquitos\" from a cart on the street and so they don't know what they are supposed to taste like.   + Yes, they are supposed to be small.  + No, they are not supposed to be crunchy  + No, they are not supposed to have sour cream or cheese on them  + If you think they are dry or need more flavor, that is when you add hot sauce, squeeze some lime on there, or add in some spicy carrots or garnish with cilantro, cabbage or radishes. Just like when you get a hot dog off the street in New York City, you can add toppings to your liking...   However, I believe that the way they serve these tacos here is perfect and they should be eaten as is. I have tried each kind and depending on the type of meat they have it marinated/cooked with different seasonings and topped with a different salsa that compliments the meat perfectly.   The rice and beans that come with the combo plate are also very authentic Mexican home-style cooking. I sampled the flan and I can say that it is definitely homemade though I didn't think it was that good. It is also a big plus that they serve Menudo and Posole all day long, even on weekdays. I have not tried the soup but my hubby says the Menudo is as good as his mom's so that is saying something.   Prices are also very reasonable. And the service was pretty good for an order-at-the-counter type place. The only reason I am not giving the restaurant 5 stars is b/c of the location itself. It is extremely small, to the point that while ordering and getting drinks from soda fountain you are bumping into people. Also, there are not many tables so you will have to wait if you dine in. The place looks like a dump, anyway, so I would recommend just getting your food to go. There are a couple of tables outside but you are right on the sidewalk of the shopping center, facing the parking lot. I wish I could take the food from this place and put it into a nicer location. Then, it would be perfection!"}
{"text":"If I could give this zero stars I would.  My wife, 18-year old son, and I attended for dinner.  Had to wait 30-40 minutes for the food after placing our order as did almost everyone else there.  Scant seating so lots of folks were standing around the counter.  When the food finally arrived, two of our three orders were wrong.  Food was unexceptional and very dry.  No free chips and salsa like every other Mexican restaurant on the planet. I was awoken at 4 am that night in the hotel to the sound of my 18-year old throwing up the Chicken Burrito he had eaten that night at La Taquito and my wife trying to clean it up off the bathroom floor.  The restaurant has Mexican folk art of skeletons.  Probably pictures of their customers who died of old age waiting for their food or died of the resulting food poisoning."}
{"text":"A co-worker brought me back a shrimp cevice tostada for lunch today.  Once again it was DELICIOUS!!"}
{"text":"Love the food. I eat here about once a week and I almost always get something different. taco Tuesdays are crazy busy, but if you go a little later it has calmed down. I especially love the \"Trainer Salad\" with chicken. I will say that sometimes the food isn't consistent from one time to the next even if you order the exact same thing. But that isn't necessarily a bad thing, it just means that it is made fresh and they are humans. However, they can occasionally mess up your order, but will fix it for you no problem. I love that it is family owned and the staff is friendly. Can't wait to go again... next week."}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant several times. It's tucked into the corner of an unassuming strip mall but the food was delicious. I've had a variety of street tacos: asada, pastor, carnitas, fish, and shrimp (what can I say, I love tacos) with a side of rice and beans. All were enjoyable. The food was ready in a reasonable time and the restaurant wasn't too busy. Unfortunately the seating is limited and there are no comfy booths. Also, the ambiance is a little bland. But I will definitely return in the future and recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Visiting from Chicago stopped in at the recommendation of my son who lives down the street. Outstanding carne asada tacos, beans, and rice. Tacos so delicious didn't need salsa or salt. Incredible flavor.  Rice and beans good too. Cleaned my plate. Can't wait to return."}
{"text":"Great tacos! I had the combo plate with shrimp, beef and a pork taco all recommended by the server, they didn't disappoint. I also loved the picked carrots that they served!"}
{"text":"Have been here a couple times and did not know it was the same people with the restaurant in Ahwatukee that was on Diners Drive Ins and Dives.   This location is very nice and contemporary compared to the original location.   This could do very well in North Scottsdale with the decor if it was located somewhere else.  The burritos are very good but if you come here you must have the street tacos and the carne asada in particular.   The Carna Asada is awesome in the burrito or tacos and you can't go wrong, but would recommend trying other items.  I like the fact that you order at the counter and that they call your name. Makes it very informal and casual.   I will definitely come back to this location over and over.    All i can say is great food and very nicely decorated location."}
{"text":"I've never had a problem coming here , my foods always been great . Today I was disappointed ordering a pastor burrito ."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best places to grab a burrito or tacos! Personally, I'm a huge breakfast burrito fan, and Los Taquitos' always hits the spot. My boyfriend always gets some sort of a burrito from there (even though it's not a breakfast one) as well. Their tortillas taste so unique, and that's honestly an important part of a burrito! They have amazing rice and beans, and their red and green sauce is pretty decent as well. 10/10, would eat here 7 days a week if that wasn't extremely fattening."}
{"text":"Great authentic mexican food.  Also they just expanded their restaurant size, so there's plenty of seating for the busy lunch rush."}
{"text":"for a airport restaurant it is pretty decent  we got three tacos per person,   first off the service is friendly but forgetful, after waiting 20 min for our order, i had say wsup to the counter folks and they said they never received my order, slightly annoying, we had to another ten min to get our food  after specifically asking for NO CILANTRO(vile weed!), they loaded me up with cilantro, ewwww. i didnt realize this until i was at the terminal trying to scarf this all down before boarding. so that was not pleasant. on top of this, the tacos are tiny! they tasted decent but i could've ate 6 of those things and then maybe be full, i got the chicken and carne asada for those who would like to know"}
{"text":"This place is definitely a must try! I was craving some posole and this place hit the spot. We also try $1 tacos during happy hour and a beef tamale, all were delicious! I wish they opened earlier, though. They have a breakfast menu but don't open until 9."}
