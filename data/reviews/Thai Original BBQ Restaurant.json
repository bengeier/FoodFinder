{"text":"If you like Thai food, you have to try the original thai bbq. Their pad se ew is to DIE for. Their thai egg rolls are delicious. Basil beef will not let you down (its not on the menu anymore, you have to ask for it!)   Yes, the building is not as fancy as some other places. Yes, i've batted a fly off my plate more than once. Yes, I do NOT go to the bathroom their because I dont even WANT to know what it looks like...   BUT.. the thai food is the best in town. The service rocks. And you can get a $25 gift cert. on Restaurant.com for $2. Can you beat that? I think NOT.  This is the only place my husband and I go for anniversarys, date nights, birthdays.. anything!! I recommend it to everyone I know. If you KNOW good thai food, go here."}
{"text":"Loved the BBQ chicken and fried rice plate!  Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"I've only been at this particular restaurant once and recall the service being quick.  I love their rice, that sweet and sour sauce, Thai ice tea and shrimp.  It's always a delight and very affordable."}
{"text":"I've never eaten at the restaurant but myself and the people I work with always order take out from here, and it's amazing!  The sa-te beef dinner is to die for!  Highly reccommended!"}
{"text":"Yeah...no.  People love this place, but I never really took a particular shining to it.  I'll admit, they have good lunch specials, but it all came to an end when I found a hair on my chicken one day.  And it was sort of baked into the chicken, so I knew it wasn't mine.  I'm all for hole in the walls, but draw the line when someone's elses hair is baked into my food.  The end!"}
{"text":"You walk in there and there is not a single customer in there but a funny pair of Thai Ladies Singing Thai Songs on the radio.  Eventually a pair of gays walks in and looks at you funny.  You can get married across the street.  The plate of Pad See Ew was really big, high, and popping with thousands of crispy cubes of tofu.  As an interesting option they had a big mound of fresh ground pepper on top which I was not sure I was going to like, but I ended up really liking.  It was $9.98 with tax, which is not cheap, but not expensive either....so you might say, it's somewhere between cheap and expensive.  A great place to go if you want to take a whore before you take her to the Sin City hostel and turn her insides into Pad See Ew ;)  They don't serve Alcohol"}
{"text":"Confusing directions- 2 locations- just take Las Vegas south from downtown, you'll see it on the right, but gotta take Wyoming N loop back in. Slightly ghetto location=promising in my book (cheap & good is my goal) surprisingly nice inside, wood panelling, pleasing wood carvings,....7-10 dollar. Dinners, yay! (not a casino- yay!) Smells= good, good sign. Iced coiffed =2 dolla, 'nother good sign...ice coffee=good, depth + cream....best deal in town I think...yum!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall with BASIC flavors of thai food."}
{"text":"Do NOT leave this place without trying the Chicken/Beef Satay or the Shrimp Fried Rice!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful, spicy, delish! Did I forget to mention Spicy! They don't serve beer ? Other than that the place was great."}
{"text":"not in the greatest part of town, it's kind of run down, but what a great lunch deal! for under $10 you can order the L-1, thai bbq chicken. it's a half chicken, with rice and sweet sauce, BIG portions. be prepared to ask for a to go box, and don't forget to ask for extra sauce to go.   there's a couple other locations, one in vegas on maryland, and some in cali too. one on carson street in carson, ca. and one in south redondo beach, but it's called Thai Thani, but has the same menu."}
{"text":"Oh no. I previously gave this place 4 stars based on their Thai BBQ Chicken. I still love that dish but I made the mistake of attempting to order their Pad See Ew. It's a dish with flat rice noodles sauteed in soy sauce with chinese broccoli. I love this dish at Thai restaurants. If it's done well, it's quite addicting. As for this dish...  Way too much pepper! It was more like Pad See EWWWW!  I took my first bite and wanted to spit it out. I guess I should have mixed everything together, but cmon, should I really have to do that? It should have been mixed together for me already. There was no balance of flavors. It was just pepper and a lot of it.  It wasn't too bad after I tossed everything together, but I was still traumatized from the first bite that I was scared with every bite after that.  Not a good dish from there at all. However, their bbq chicken has saved them from total downfall and I probably will attempt to order a different dish from their establishment (just not the Pad See Ew)."}
{"text":"As part of the Thai BBQ chain that features the red script on a yellow background for their sign, this place hold true to form.    This is actually one of their nicer locations.  More roomy than most and I did spot a small stage for what appeared to be karaoke.    The service was prompt and friendly.  He was even messing with me as I joyfully suffered through my Drunken Noodle (Spicy level 10!), it's always a good sign when the server puts the effort in to make a connection with the patrons.    Food wise, I would recommend their Specials: S-1 (BBQ Chicken), S-4 (Honey Duck), or S-10 (Sate Skewers)...all served with a plentiful side of fried rice with shrimp.  Overall great for a causal lunch of dinner!!"}
{"text":"Food was good, but the portions weren't great. Service was fine, but nothing spectacular. 3/5 for me."}
{"text":"Great customer service, delicious meal and I had the chicken dinner (posted a pic) I went with byron D.. His review is on here also :D"}
{"text":"I have eaten at the  W. Flamingo Road location several times recently. Each visit, I tried a different dish. After trying five different dishes I feel it's time  to write a review. Awesome! Each new dish I try is as good as the last. Very clean, usually quiet, comfortable atmosphere. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I first ate at this restaurant in Los Angeles back in the early 90's. The food was so good that after I moved away, I tried and tried to find something similar...including trying different recipes myself. Nothing ever came close. The Satay is out of this world. I was so happy when I found this restaurant in Vegas, that now every time I go thru Vegas I stop there. Must have.!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has become a nuisance to my waistline.  I work downtown and eat here predominately for lunch.  Service has always been attentive, although it can sometimes take a little while to get the check.  I have also ordered delivery from them several times and service has been prompt and accurate. I have yet to experience a below-average dish here.  Favorites include: Pad Thai, Drunken Rice (a slightly different spin on spicy basil fried rice), Beef Jerky and Beef Salad.  The Larb and Curries are also quite good, although not quite on par with my favorites."}
{"text":"We've only been to the 3rd St location in Las Vegas, NV. The parking lot and exterior of the place made us think twice about going into the restaurant. The papaya salad and red curry were okay.  We were disappointed with the seafood combo plate.  There were several shrimps, a couple of small scallops, 2 squid pieces, and 1 mussel mixed in with lots of onions and bell peppers. We were constantly trying to shoo away a fly from our table and food. Also, the bathroom is in a closed-down motel that looks like it's going to collapse. This restaurant should be closed down like that motel."}
{"text":"I rate by the food.  Waiters were sorta busy taking care of other customers.  Maybe we were Asian.  I DON'T KNOW.  But anyways, the food was great.  Curry, BBQ, Fried Stuff chicken wings, pineapple fried rice, mint pork was what i had, and it was great.  I definitely go there again. I just feel that they treat you in the class you look like you are from.  HIgh class, people dressed up all professional gets excellent service.  MIddle or Low class service is like, take care of yourself., call me if you need me that kind of thing."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant in Vegas.  The location and parking leaves a little to be desired, but the food is awesome! Get there early to beat the lunch or dinner crowd because the place fills up quick.  I usually start out with a thai iced tea and then the shrimp pad thai as a main course.  Large servings at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"Definitely...don't judge the book by its cover!  Its a \"hole in the wall\" restaurant located next to a ghetto motel,  but don't let the location full you.  Oh..make sure you use the restroom before dining at this restaurant.  Head over there after the outlets or the Las Vegas Convention Center.  Thai BBQ is the best authentic Thai food I've ever had!  My husband and I went there for dinner and we were 100% satisfied.  Pad see ew with chiclen and sate dinner with beef are a must try.  Authenticity + economically priced = excellent dining experience.    Mention Yelp and you'll receive 10% off your meal...enjoy!"}
{"text":"I agree with most of the first impressions. I know, this place is nestled in a weird area of downtown that even the GPS is lost. Once you navigate your way to this spot I can assure you that you will enjoy the food. I only had the lunch specials and it I was priced well ($6.25) and it was quite flavorful. The bbq chicken was great. Duh!  Hence the name Thai BBQ right?? Great prices on the lunch specials. You can't beat it."}
{"text":"Went here for dinner last Friday for the first time and had the following:  1. Drunken Fried Rice: Exceeded my expectations.  It had just the right amount of spice and the texture was good.  Comes with more than you'd originally expect.  2.  Pad See Ewe: This was good as well.  To be honest, pad see ewe has tasted almost the same everywhere I go, and it wasn't any different here.  Portion was good size.  I would recommend this place to anyone who's craving Thai food in Vegas and doesn't mind making a short drive to the north side of the strip.  I've had better, but this place will definitely cross my mind if I'm in Vegas again looking for Thai food."}
{"text":"Las Vegas local, who enjoyed her dinner here with a few friends. The location definitely is not desirable. It's a little scary on the outside. Plus the restroom is not located in the building as mentioned in other reviews. But our food and service more than made up for it. We had crab rangoon appetizer, angel wings appetizer, beef red curry, pork green curry, bbq duck, bbq chicken, chicken sate, cucumber salad, and shrimp fried rice. All of this with non-alcoholic drinks and tip included for less than $100 (between 6 people). Will definitely return - delicious!"}
{"text":"I usually go to the one in Maryland Pkwy since it's close to my house. And i finally tried the first and original one in town. When we were looking for a parking, my first impression was really bad. The surroundings was really ghetto, i must say. The restaurant owns an abandoned apartment complex which they turned into a parking garage. I got scared for a moment...i went there around 10pm (they close 11pm) there were bums everywhere and the garage looked so haunted. When i got in, the restaurant was okay, not so fancy. I didn't really care. We were greeted by a very nice guy, whom i think was the supervisor or something like that. He chatted with us for a bit telling us how this restaurant has been established for over 20 years now. He gave us really good customer service all in all. Right before we left the place, the crew sang him a happy birthday with a cake. It was really sweet. And whats even sweeter was, he gave us a slice of the cake he was given! Made my night! Definitely going back there again! :)  And as for the food, Beef Sate and BBQ chicken are my all time favorite hands down! I always make sure i order one of those whenever i'm there. Their fried rice are amazing as well! My mom loves the Tofu delight!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent Thai food.  Not my favorite Thai place, but if I'm in the area and craving Thai, this will do just fine."}
{"text":"omgwtfbbq amazing eat!!! highly recommended!!  This reminds me of a pad thai in patong beach, thailand - tasty sake' except it should be 10 baht not $7!!  Great food, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"the only thing that's overstated in this place is the taste of the food they serve. no glamor, no glitz, just great tastin' food at affordable prices. i especially enjoyed the duck curry and the bbq beef jerky with sticky rice. i'd hit it again.  speaking of hittin' it, while leaving the place, we noticed a tall (around 6'4\"ish) man, with heels walk towards the back of the said ghetto hotel on the side, followed by another shorter man - uhm, man. the taller man with heels then stopped, turned around towards the shorter man, and knelt before him. i had some youngin's with me, so we quickly gathered them into the car, and high-tailed out.  but don't let that stop you (if it would) from trying this place."}
{"text":"I can't be sure how \"authentic\" this food is compared with others in the valley.  All I know is there's nothing unsatisfactory on the menu and it's truly a \"family\" establishment and that love is part of the food.  It's simply addictive and causes severe cravings requiring repeat trips.  I fell in love with the food in high school and remain a loyal customer because the food is consistently delicious.  The only bad thing is, I still have not tried everything they offer, as it's very easy to develop favorites early on!  Go there and enjoy!!"}
{"text":"There are supposedly other Thai BBQs in town but this one definitely tops all of them! I love the Tom Yum soup! The spicier the better! If you order a 10 you really do get a 10! Only thing I sort of don't like is their customer service, I have been there a couple of times and only one guy is a good waiter. Last time I went a woman was our server and she was pretty rude! The food is outstanding though! Very worth it! It is not that pricey either!"}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times cause I bought 3 Living Social deals. The food is just ok. The service is pretty good. It's kinda in the ghetto. The restrooms are located in the creepy motel across the parking lot."}
{"text":"Best meal I had in Vegas, hands down (cheapest also!).  I ate alot of expensive, high-end food in Vegas but none of it compared to dinner at Thai BBQ.  I had a feeling about it when I saw the sign over the nondescript hole-in-the wall restaurant.    The Thai BBQ short ribs were mind-meltingly awesome.  ...  Just a moment of silence for the tear I cried at the delicious, marinated-to-hellenback, perfectly charcoal grilled flesh of a peaceful beast I feasted on.  Damn. Suh-Good.   And the drunken noodles with tofu my wife ordered were the best I've had. EVER.  I will give you a 4-alarm \"Itis warning\" however... The food coma came on so fast I barely made it back to the deuce.  Good thing freemont is so  close to this place and good thing I went to Thai BBQ afterward.  Oh, the deuce is a bus... so, its not what you thought I meant."}
{"text":"We saw good reviews about this restaurant on yelp. Made us decide to eat here before leaving for LA.  The dish I ordered was way too salty. I do not know why, but Thai restaurants in general season dishes too salty. Anyway, I did not want to be in the car, being dehydrated for 4-5 hours on the way back to LA. So I asked our waiter to remake it. They remade it with just right amount of salt and it was good."}
{"text":"Wonderful, authentic Tom Yum and Sa te. Light and flavor packed. Great service, fast and friendly. Would visit here often if I lived in Vegas."}
{"text":"Delicious food, good service and reasonable prices. I ordered BBQ chicken with the fried rice and Thai tea. Very pleased with everything."}
{"text":"This is one of the things I miss about working downtown. This Thai BBQ is amazing. The fried rice and chicken saute are fabulous. I love this place."}
{"text":"I normal go to the location of flamingo and jones but this one is closer to my house.  The location is much bigger and has more available sunlight that the jones location so I do like that. The dining area is clean and well kept. I have never been in their bathroom so I cannot comment on that.   I ordered their Thai Beef Jerky with a side of sticky rice. This dish is always good and the dipping sauce is tasty. I also ordered chicken Pad Thai. I asked for medium spice. My pad Thai had no spice at all... Just that slices of bell pepper were added to it... Never ever have I had or seen bell peppers in pad Thai. So I was extremely disappointed that was added because it distinctly changes the chemistry and flavor. That jones and Flamingo location has never put bell peppers in my pad Thai. And there was no lime on my plate so when I asked for lime... I was disappointed to find out they had no limes just lime juice.   Food overall is still good but I prefer the jones and flamingo location."}
{"text":"My family & I usually go to the location on Flamingo & Jones but came to this location instead since we had a big party of about 20 people plus 1 child and 2 babies.   The food was good like it always is. It's family style so you can share everything. They were out of beef satay :( & only had sodas, Thai tea & water available to drink which was a big inconvenience for the babies & my niece since they wanted apple juice.   Also, there was only 1 server the whole time we were there. Luckily there was only 1 other table eating when we arrived. I felt bad for the server for having to take care of such a large party by himself but he did a good job on checking on us and making sure to take away each cleared plate.   The bathrooms are pretty gross. They smelt weird and need some extensive cleaning.   Overall our experience was normal but I'd much rather go to the other location."}
{"text":"My sister and I got take-out from this place not too long ago using a Groupon and it was delicious!! She picked up the food so I can't comment on the restaurant or staff, but the food was wonderful.    We shared the vegetable egg rolls, the BBQ chicken dinner, and BBQ pork spare ribs dinner.  The chicken and pork were incredibly flavorful and cooked perfectly, and it came with tons of shrimp fried rice that's loaded with shrimp.  On the side was their \"house sauce\" which is a sweet-spicy sauce that is HIGHLY addictive and I poured it over everything on my plate :) The portions of the entrees were very generous too -- you could easily get 2 meals out of each entree.  The egg rolls were tasty too but I think they were fried a little long... but yummy nonetheless.  Definitely try this place if you're in the mood for some Thai BBQ food -- you won't be disappointed!! :)"}
{"text":"This place is incredible.  Ordered twice and tried four different things, in order of deliciousness:  - Pineapple fried rice - Drunken noodles - Panang Curry - Pad Thai  The first three are all absolutely amazing.  The Pad Thai was a tiny bit bland.  Overall, this is my new favorite Thai restaurant by a long shot.  Way better than Le Thai especially the curry and the variety."}
{"text":"The chicken satay is always a safe bet.  I don't know what they do to their rice that comes with the satay plate but that crap is effin delicious!"}
{"text":"One of the better hole in the wall places in Vegas.  The sticky rice is a great compliment to the curry dishes.  I'm not a big fan of Thai BBQ, but I hear from most people I know that this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Definition of hole-in-the-wall restaurant! Stopped by for a quick snack, so I can't give a full review...just yet. Had a Thai Tea & the Veggie Egg Rolls. Seriously the BEST egg rolls I've personally had in town! I'll definitely be back!  They have weekday lunch specials for $6.95. Fair prices. Average $7.95-$9.95 (from what I can recall).   If you're looking for great flavors I definitely recommend stopping by. If you're particular about ambiance and service, I'd honestly skip it. The decor is simple. The staff is pleasant, however the service is on the slow side. The bathroom is not in the main building, but across the way in a closed down hotel (I believe). While this didn't bother me, I can see how it could deter others."}
{"text":"Sorry, now that they don't make mee krob, I have no reason to go to this particular Thai restaurant.  For years I have flown into Vegas and I immediately make my sister drive me to Thai Original BBQ for the mee krob.  We even call ahead to make sure they can make it, because sometimes, they don't have all the ingredients.  During my recent visit in January, they said they're not making it anymore because it was too hard to make and not enough people order it.  Mee krob was what set them apart from literally hundreds of other Thai places in the city.  All their other food is just ordinary."}
{"text":"After being a long time customer of the Original Thai BBQ restaurant on Jones, I finally decided to give this place a try as it's 2 blocks closer and with gas prices as high as they are, even a little bit less driving helps. =p  Upon arrival we were greeted immediately, but once seated no one came up to us for about five minutes. Once the waiter came up to us, he seemed as if he was in a hurry and seemed annoyed at us.   As for the food, they do offer more lunch specials than the other locations which is nice. But, the portions seemed a lot smaller. On my second time trying this restaurant, I tried the BBQ duck lunch special. There was more sauce than anything, very small pieces of duck and a few Chinese broccoli here and there.   Also, there was no unlimited Thai Tea refills. That's one of my favorite things about the other location, is unlimited thai tea !!!!   Overall, I probably won't be back. The service was bad both times I went and the food was just alright. The further drive to the other location is fully worth it."}
{"text":"We ordered the chicken curry lunch, thai tea and the drunken noodles. All had fantastic flavor and just the right kick for the spices.  The chicken curry still had all bones in it some of which were cut into little pieces which were annoying. That combined with the dumpy location and average ambience are all that kept it being rated a 5 star."}
{"text":"My girlfriend had takeout from this restaurant and I was impressed by the shrimp fried rice she had.  On 1/27/2011, I drove by after work and got some takeout.  Ordered the Sate chicken and beef.  Came with fried rice.  The food was extremely fresh.  Next time I will take my girlfriend and dine inside.  Staff was really helpful.  The restaurant is on the Flamingo side of the Sunflower Market shopping anchor mall (next to the Game Stop)."}
{"text":"Oh no, don't expect me to give this place a 3 star or higher rating.  I got home late one night and all of my roomies ate already and didn't save me any dinner. I was like a hungry child from a third world country.   Decided to hit up this place cause it's seriously near my house. Got the pad thai and asked for #7 spicy. Nope, not spicy at all. I had to put sriracha on it.   The service was...eh. Girl was confused the whole time. I asked her if there was a minimum on the card and I got a blank stare and she recommended me to get the egg rolls on the menu. Seriously.  Oh yeah, btw no free refills on thai iced tea. I don't even like thai iced tea. Haha."}
{"text":"Great food... really good serving portions and friendly service"}
{"text":"Stopped in on the way back from Pawnstars. Doesn't look like much, but great food. And a heck of a lot cheaper than anything you're going to find further down on the strip."}
{"text":"LOVE IT!! Been looking for a good thai restaurant in Las Vegas and this is the place! everything was awesome. If you're looking for good thai food, this is the place for youuu!"}
{"text":"With the exception of a brunch buffet, this was hands-down the best meal my husband and I had in Las Vegas.  Easy to find, in-n-out, and inexpensive~most places on the Strip are overpriced and not worth it.  We should have found this our first day....  My husband has never had Thai food and our waiter was very patient as to getting his likes and dislikes and choosing a dish that would EASE him into Thai~BBQ Short Ribs.  Perfect choice!  They were delish and left him wondering why he never tried Thai before.  We will definitely return on our next trip."}
{"text":"We ordered the Drunken Noodles w/ chicken and beef Panang curry. Food was great, we'll definitely return the next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"We went here a couple of months ago with my parents. They're not big Thai fans, but we had a Groupon and were able to convince them to join us.   We ordered green curry, dearest crab, won ton soup, kai yang Thai iced tea, and Thai iced coffee. Everything was very good, and my parents admitted that it was good. They're now a little more open to trying Thai food.   The bad news is there are still no paper towels in the restroom."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Thai place. There are a few others that go by the same name, but I believe that this one, and the one on 3rd Street in Downtown, are related. The rest are completely different places.  BBQ Chicken is good and sweet. Beef Skewers with the peanut sauce, Drunken Noodles with extra noodles, and their chicken curries are my favorite dishes."}
{"text":"Low end of Okay. I had crispy honey duck, which is normally one of my favorites, but they took crispy a step to far and made it an overdone, closer to jerky honey duck.  The shrimp fried rice was good, and the flavors were all there, just very underwhelming...you are better off going to Archies.  On a good note, nobody got sick, so that was a nice bonus"}
{"text":"Oh, Thai BBQ, how I love thee!  This place has been satisfying me and other downtown workers, livers and players for years and years.  It don't look like much, really, and unless you're looking for it you can drive by it for years and not see it.  It's odd to get to - coming off of LV Blvd. takes you on a crazy little loop to get to their tiny parking lot.  The dining room is tiny and sectioned due to the fact that it's actually been expanded.  (The first time I went here, in the mid 90s, the dining area had enough room for 4, four-person tables.)  Despite its outward appearance, the BBQ is an absolute delight.  My preferences don't tend toward the spicier side, but there are plenty of non-spicy choices on the menu.  My favorite is the sweet and sour chicken.  Unlike it's 'Chinese' counterpart, the meat in this one is sauteed, not battered and deep fried.  It's cooked with big, fresh chunks of red and green peppers, onions, cucumbers, and pineapples, and tossed with a sauce that has a sweetness and a tang and is completely different than your usual 'sweet and sour sauce.'  Other excellent choices are their BBQ chicken (I mean, it's what they're famous for), their satay, and the chicken with baby corn.  (And who doesn't love baby corn?  Don'tcha feel like a giant eating it?  It's fun!)  Don't miss their Thai iced tea.  Yep, it'll putcha into a diabetic coma, but they make it right.  Take a chance on the neighborhood and stop by here.  There are other locations throughout the city, but this is the original and the best."}
{"text":"We had the BBQ chicken and pad Thai for dinner.  Both dishes were delicious and reasonably priced. Then we decided to get this mango sticky rice for dessert. Honestly, the mango was good, but I personally didn't really get the sticky rice part... AND it was almost $8 - same price as one of the main dishes!!! a bit pricey i must say."}
{"text":"GREAT BBQ FOOD! Pork and chicken BBQ was awesome! It came with fried rice and the BBQ sauce, very tasty!!  They do have different prices for lunch and dinner menu(the bbq dishes) but generally for dinner, the portions are larger and more worth for the price you're paying.  My mate and I probably took out dinner and lunch from this restaurant 3 times within 3 days in Vegas. Good stuff, and I would highly recommend it.   Not too sure about the other food but service was good and it was definitely worth the wait for our hungry stomachs.   Good and well within our budget as a backpacker, costs about 10 - 12 per BBQ dish, enough to feed the both of us. Definitely, this wouldnt be sufficient if it wasnt for the beers we grabbed from the petrol kiosk opp.   Certainly worth a visit and do make sure you order the BBQ Pork/Chicken. Prefer the pork though."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews for Thai BBQ on Rainbow and Flamingo, and the one on Jones and Flamingo, this would did sound better.  That atmosphere was very nice, perhaps a little more upscale than the \"hole in the wall\" Thai restaurant.  The service was good, although the server had me box my left overs even though I was the only customer.  That's ok though, the food is the important thing.  I ordered Thai Iced Tea, Pineapple Fried Rice, and Red Curry with Beef.  The pineapple fried rice was very good.  It wasn't greasy or bland, but had a nice subtle flavor with a hint of smokiness.  It included pieces of shrimp, imitation crab, chicken, tomato, and fresh pineapple.  It was a bit generic, and perhaps not totally authentic in flavor, but I enjoyed it quite a bit.     The red curry with beef was fairly impressive.  It was well prepared with green and red peppers, and with a medium heat, it had a nice spicy flavor, not bland at all.  The curry was soupy, and although I had to ask for white rice with it, I quite enjoyed it.  My only reservation about this dish was that the beef was just a little tough.    The presentation of the food was very well executed.  The atmosphere  was upscale and relaxing. The service is pretty good too.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for a fine Thai dinner with a date or the family.  I will definitely be returning to try more of the dishes here."}
{"text":"It's not that I come here for the Thai food. I just love their BBQ. Its always so tender and juicy and it has that sweet/savory taste I've always been a fan of. Totally recommend at least trying this place once."}
{"text":"After reading the mixed reviews on this little hole in the wall Thai restaurant, I decided to try it myself.  And after experiencing this place for myself, I must say that I have mixed feelings!    I ordered the Thai Iced Tea, Drunken Rice, and Rad Na (spelled differently on the menu).  I'll give my impressions starting from the bad to the good.    The Thai Iced Tea was a bit bland, but it is just Thai Iced Tea.  That's no biggie.  I suggest sticking with a coke, or better yet save your $2 and just get water.  Moving on...  Next up was the Drunken Rice, which I have to admit is a dish that I have not had before.  The Drunken Rice wasn't bad.  It had a decent spicy taste, with various peppers and tomatoes.  I felt like the rice was bit greasy, but maybe this is just the way this dish is prepared.  I didn't taste any superb flavors that made me go \"Wow!\", but this was a nice way to start the meal.  Finally the Rad Na.  I consider Rad Na to be the best dish to try for a first impression of a Thai restaurant.  If a place can make good Rad Na, then to me that means that they take their food seriously.   At Thai BBQ, this is the dish that really gave me mixed feelings about the place.  The gravy sauce was probably the third or fourth best gravy I've had, on par with other above average Thai restaurants in Vegas.  It is hard to find good gravy in Rad Na, and Thai BBQ does a good job of it.  It was flavorful, with a very slight hint of sweetness that I actually really enjoyed.  The pork was nicely prepared, as were the fat noodles.  However, the dish came with American broccoli.  I asked the waitress if they could make it with Chinese broccoli, and she informed me that they don't have Chinese broccoli at Thai BBQ.  In my opinion, this really docked their score.  This dish was really good, but it would have been even better with some fresh Chinese broccoli.  I even told the waitress so, and she smiled and said, \"I know.\"    Unlike some of the other reviews here, I had no issues with the service.  The waitress offered to box my left overs for me, which was very nice of her.  My glass of water was never empty.    With the disappointing lack of Chinese broccoli, I'll be giving this place 3 stars, but I think that if the owner wanted to, they could really step this place up with just a little extra effort.  I don't know what the curry tastes like, but the Rad Na was surprisingly good, which is a good indicator for me.  I'll have to make an effort to try some different dishes!"}
{"text":"I want.  This food.  All the time. It certainly lacks for ambiance in the front yard, but having grown up in Vegas, I have a soft spot for the hobos and druggies of the Northern Strip.  An honest, family-run restaurant with a tremendous lunch special and great food.  I dream of the Chicken with Baby Corn, the Beef Satay, the Thom kha gai, and of course, the famous Thai BBQ chicken.  Ah, man, I just made myself so hungry.  I need to plan another trip home and make that my first and last stop. Go there.  You won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Thai bbq on Flamingo never ceases to impress me. The service is always outstanding---something that for sure can't be said about the jones and maryland pkwy locations. The Wings of Angel are absolutely mouthwatering, and try the crispy duck----mmmm mmm mmm! But no one's pad thai is better than this location's---not greasy or too sweet. Archi's is like a tv dinner compared to this!!! The curry here on Flamingo is spectacular as well. I've heard that pin kaow's was good, but let me tell you, i think the reject chefs that get fired from panda express work at pin kaow. They got NOTHIN' on thai bbq!! The \"authentic\" chefs at Lemongrass at Aria should take classes on how to make authentic thai food from the chefs at thai bbq on flamimgo!"}
{"text":"We came in, and knew exactly what to get... Thai Tea... unlimited refills is absolutely amazing. The Thai tea has unlimited refills because they make the Thai tea themselves. Many restaurants buy them in bottles or large volumes, pre-made.  The service is incredible.  For food, I got the beef satay dinner which comes with a large amount of food for anyone 6 satay sticks and two huge scoops of shrimp fried rice.  The satay beef is extremely flavorful, and you can tell they are authentic by the way they marinated their beef for days. The panang curry is perfect because the beef is not just solid meat pieces, but includes plenty of fat which makes any/all curries delicious!!!  A must try for Thai-lovers!"}
{"text":"This place is tops blooby.  The yummy food and generous servings well made up for the fact that their parking lot had more holes in it than m-theory has strings.  I chowed on the bbq chicken.  It was tender, fleshy, and white - just how i like the ladies.  I quickly forgot about the bathroom, which sits across the street in a motel room straight outta horror flick, when i wrapped my lips around the fatty shrimp, served with my eggy fried rice.   5 stars."}
{"text":"unfortunately, this particular location has been shut down and probably not to reopen :(  this family owned chain has other locations, but this one was my personal favorite."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been on a thai food frenzy lately, so we decided to try this place after getting their groupon deal. The food was great, but I was more impressed with the service. We ordered thai spring rolls and pad thai, which were both really tasty with the perfect amount of spiciness (which we love!). The portions are generous and the prices are average. During our visit, there was only one server running the entire restaurant. He was running back and forth from the kitchen, grabbing drinks, setting tables, seating customers, etc. Some of the other customers in the restaurant were being completely rude, demanding certain tables and constantly calling him over for something. He seemed frazzled and made a few mistakes with us personally, however, I was so amazed and impressed to see him running the entire restaurant himself. I didn't even care about any of the mishaps, because I really appreciated his hard work. When we got up to pay, he profusely apologized for his bad service. We explained to him that we were so happy/impressed with the service we received, which definitely seemed to surprise him. Overall, the food was great and the service was so so so appreciated!"}
{"text":"Yum!  My office orders from here often for lunch.  Their fried rice is my favorite and the Satay is good as well.  I'm not a huge fan of their Pad Thai...I've had better."}
{"text":"When my cousin informed me that her 18th Birthday dinner would be at Thai BBQ, I was surprised.  I associate places called \"Thai BBQ\" with fast food, and an 18th Birthday for us is kind of a big deal.    When I walked in, I was pleasantly.  It was a very clean, nice looking and nicely decorated restaurant.  It was very quiet - not too many customers, but still, quite quaint.  They sectioned off part of the restaurant for our exclusive use.  My aunt pre-ordered trays of food and they laid everything out with plates, etc and we would get food at our leisure (buffet style).  First off, the food was delicious! The Pad Thai was one of the best that I've tried (and I don't usually like the Pad Thai at places) and the Chicken and Beef Barbeque (especially the ones on the skewer) were very very tasty. :] Both had just the right amount of flavor that complimented the food. They definitely know what they're doing.  On top of the good food, they had GREAT service.  The waiters were always on top of things and even cleared your plate as soon as you were finished.  One waiter even asked me if there was something I needed help with or needed just because I was looking around. That kind of attentiveness comes around quite rarely.  PLUS, when all was said and done - you know, cake, presents, the works, they even helped us to carry out the leftover trays and cake to the car. Now THAT is going above and beyond. :]  Overall, I really enjoyed the food and the atmosphere and would love to go back and try it as a regular customer and not just a \"party guest.\" lol. Oh, and there is also a Karaoke set up - although, I don't know if they actually use it. :P I'm down to find out! :D"}
{"text":"Been wanting to check out a Thai place other than Lotus of Siam (you know, just to see what's out there - I could eat LOS daily)  Anyway, the place has character!  It's in a tough area but once you get inside it is very comfortable and quaint.  The server and manager were both so nice and friendly.    Went for an early dinner around 6:00pm and was surprised we were NOT the only people there considering the location (also BTW you can't turn south onto 3rd from Charleston because of some road repairs).  In fact, by the time we left more than half the tables were occupied (on a Tuesday, no conventions in town).  Also saw multiple customers come in for takeout.    BBQ Chicken - this is the house specialty and it was solid, although the only thing that really made it Thai was the sweet-tangy sauce they served it with.  Be sure to eat it all while it's hot - there was a piece of chicken left at the end of the meal which had gotten cold and I ate - defintely better hot!  BBQ Pork -  Also solid and also couldn't tell they were \"Thai\" except for the sauce.  Pineapple fried rice - This was very well executed.  Some places add too much curry spice but this was not the case here.  Drunken Noodle with Shrimp - Extra spicy, \"9/10 Thai Spicy not American Spicy please\" - Even with all that request it was still not superhot.  However, it had a decent amount of heat and the dish was phenomenal.  I enjoyed this dish so much that I placed an extra order to-go for lunch next day \"just a leeeeetle bit more spicy please!\"  I wouldn't make the trip to downtown just to dine here but if in the area I would go back, especially if I was in the mood for BBQ.  Apparently there are two other locations, but a friend told me that this is the best location of the three.  Also, I thought this place super cheap.  The four entrees mentioned above were $45 with tip."}
{"text":"this restaurant, *sigh, our first attempt going to this restaurant resulted in a vehicle collision.  It was supposed the meal before we leave vegas which was supposed to be good and memorable, but the drive back with my torn bumper dangling was so traumatizing...  anyways, this restaurant was referred by our beloved friend Bone who said this place has really good BBQ, of course we took his advice and I took the courage to make our second attempt...   This restaurant is located at the end of the vegas strip and the beginning of the downtown vegas strip.  It's very hidden so becareful and don't run any red lights looking for it.  In an abundance of caution, it's on the left hand side.  This restaurant is very small, the outside looks like a restaurant that doesnt even open anymore...but it does.  The parking lot looked like someone is going to jump out and rob you so becareful.    Once you open the door to the restaurant, it instantly makes you forget how the outside looks and reminds you that you are at a thai restaurant.   The first and last time i was there there were a couple tables with thai family - good sign.  Thai people eating at a thai restaurant cannot be bad.  We ordered the papaya salad, bbq pork ribs, and chicken satay - all very very good.  Alloy mark mark - (very yummy in thai).    The thai tea is refreshing after a rough night in vegas....  was worth the trip and left happily ever after.."}
{"text":"I'm wondering right now why we didn't get BBQ here...  Anyway this place is in a weird location.  A friend was driving there and first he drove through this ghetto looking area and then he turned on this street with no street lights.  By that time I was wondering where he was taking us.  We turned another corner and there it was!  We pulled in and it was pretty dead for dinner time.  It was also a Wednesday night though so maybe it picks up over the weekend.  We had an order of pad thai, spicy fried rice, and a vegetable dish.  The pad thai was OUTSTANDING.  It didn't taste like your normal pad thai dish...it tasted kind of peanutty.  The spicy fried rice was super good also with just the right amount of kick.  The vegetable dish was great also and I'm usually not a fan of vegetables.  The people who work here are super friendly."}
{"text":"My first experience here was great. I called and placed my order and the waitress was very courteous and helpful.  I ordered Spring rolls, pad Thai,drunken noodles with beef, and the garlic short ribs. The total came to 41 dollars and we got home the food was piping hot and delicious. The spring rolls were nice and crisp and came with a sweet sauce to dunk them in. The pad Thai was ok,I have had better but it was chock full of fresh veggies and had a nice flavor. I ordered the drunken noodles with a spicy level of 8 and they were tolerably spicy and oh so good! Loved all the flavors and the hint of fresh basil. The beef was sliced thin and very tender. I would have to say the star of the meal were the BBQ pork ribs. Big, tender, sticky and sweet.  Wow!  The garlic short ribs were good too but next time will just order the pork ribs and drunken noodles."}
{"text":"A must eat here for me whenever I am here:)  If you have read my reviews, I have said that I will always, always, always, be a loyal customer of this establishment.  Whether I am back in Cali or here in LV, this is one of my ultimate comfort food.  S1 and S2 today with thai iced tea.  The staff were friendly.  Service was quick.  This is home baby!"}
{"text":"We chose this little joint as it was close to the chapel that we had chosen to get married at, and also because our first date was at a Thai restaurant back home in Pittsburgh.  Do not let the Aesthetics of this place hold you back from giving it a try.  I mean, yes, their bathroom is not attached and you probably do not want to go in there (as it is outside attached to what seems like an old dirty motel that may not be in operation anymore), but their food and service was great!    Their Pad Thai was not as good as I am used to but it was good... their spring rolls and Crab Rangoon were good, and the Spicy chicken dish that my now husband got was great!  For a laid back couple this place more than met our expectations!  Prices were super cheap too."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for 10+ years.  Always seem to get the beef satai.  Cucumber salad mixture is good but we always steer clear of the peanut sauce dip.  Thai iced tea is easily the best in town with a caffine kick. Free refills make it a steal.  Barbeque chicken is very very good.    Always busy but service is fairly quick."}
{"text":"I'm a fan only because I come from Los Angeles and really MISS TBBQ out there.  I drive about 20mi to eat here, just to get my fix.  It's not exactly the same, but will do.  LOVE the S2 ribs dinner and the pad thai."}
{"text":"Wanted to try out Archi but forgot the exact location and the name, my friend bought me to this place. Since it had a decent looking from the outside, I decided to give it a try. Came here, ordered the spicy seafood soup, it was delicious. Definitely recommend it to anyone. Followed by the house specials crispy duck and shrimp cake. The rice on the side was O-H-M-Y-G-O-D it tasted soooooo goood thingy, but the main dish was mehhhhh probably not gonna order them again."}
{"text":"I usually go to Archies but they close on Mondays.  So I decided to try this place.  They had nice interior decoration.  I had Pad-see-ew with Tofu.  The dish was overly saucy and the noodle were softer than what I'm used to.   It tasted like it was cooked with too much salt and MSG.  I also had Tom yum soup which was pretty good.  Service was decent."}
{"text":"This was a pleasant surprise. We had to take a leap of faith to believe that our journey through the ghetto wasteland portion of The Strip would end well, as so many Yelpers insisted it would. The low point of this terrifying journey occurred when we saw Thai BBQ from the outside.  Fortunately, the inside looked much nicer and, most importantly, the food was great. We were starving, thanks to a complex disruption to our daily eating cycle caused by gorging at the buffet in the Paris casino the day before, and so we over-ordered.   We weren't particularly adventurous in our ordering because pretty everything looked great to our empty stomachs. For starters, we ordered chicken sate with peanut sauce, which was great (and not really a starter), though to me it's hard to go wrong with chicken on a stick with a spicy peanut sauce. For entrees, we ordered pad thai with shrimp (yeah, I know) and the Hawaiian curry with chicken. What made it \"Hawaiian\" was the small pieces of pineapple sprinkled about the dish. Both were great if not inspired.  Long story short, if you're brave enough to leave the comfort of the tourist army in The Strip and you can set foot inside the building that looks like it might collapse at any moment, then you will be justly rewarded."}
{"text":"Yet another great experience I went here with my friend Tracie another fellow yelper.  Great food as usual I got the BBQ Chicken lunch special which came with their delicious fried rice.  I also ordered the crab rangoons which i must say were a little disappointing, I didn't taste the cream cheese or crab so I wont be ordering those again. Of course the BBQ chicken was o so tender and flavorful as always, with that sweet special side sauce and to wash down this wonderful meal I had their thai tea which was yummy.  I do recommend this place if your a fan of good quality food for a good price!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing! I went there for my young stepmom's 25th bday for dinner. Everyone agreed on Thai food for her dinner so we decided to check it out. The location was kinda ghetto across Olympic Garden & Boston Pizza & near all the wedding chapels & old school motels. If you have to use their bathroom, you have to ask them for a key & walk outside the restaurant & across the parking lot. It's cute inside the restaurant. It kinda gives you that feeling like you're in Thailand. The service was very fast & friendly. The waitresses were pretty cute. There were so many things on the menu that we wanted to try & we had a big group so we shared the dishes. Everything was really delicious. I thought that they made the best papaya salad. It was made perfect. The sates was the bomb! Pretty much everything there was good."}
{"text":"YUM!! We ordered the pad-thai and BBQ Chicken lunch special, duck over rice lunch special and seafood soup. It was GOOD!! I liked the pad-thai and the soup but the BBQ Chicken wasn't as good as my friend had raved. Perhaps they over-cooked it this time and it was a bit on the dry side. A definite pleasant surprise find in Vegas...a bit off the strip on the ghetto side of Vegas (~10 minute drive)."}
{"text":"The BBQ Chicken is great here.  They serve is with a simple type of fried rice, and give you a great sweet sauce for it.  It's simple, fast, and really good."}
{"text":"Surprised to see that this place was pretty empty when I came in on a Saturday evening (I think this place caters mostly to the weekday lunchtime crowd) though it could be attributed to the fact that the inside is much larger than what the storefront suggests.    Atmosphere was pretty ambient and soft, and food was pretty average for Thai food.  The spicy catfish, chicken and garlic chicken were too sweet for Thai food and not as spicy as some other places (definitely a more Americanized version of Thai).  Still, a solid choice for Thai.  Service was quick and the waitress was really friendly (came in every ten minutes to check in on my party).    In all, I would still prefer some other Thai choices that are in the immediate vicinity, but would definitely come here for the lunch specials."}
{"text":"I had to double check the directions from the GPS because it led me to some abandoned motel in an area that is not quite downtown, but far away from the fancy strip. I turned the corner, and there was this little shack looking place that stood out. There were cars parked all around it during the lunch hour. I walked in and was quickly seated since it was a little before 12.   Thai BBQ is one of those local secret places that tourist usually won't frequent unless they have a rental or just randomly stumble upon it.  As someone stated before, if you like Thai food, then you will have to like the Pad Thai. I did not like the Pad Thai here. It wasn't because it did not taste well. I just don't like my Pad Thai tasting salty with the abundance of tofu in it. Perhaps I might change my mind the next time around.  I also ordered a Cashew Nut Chicken which appeared to be more of a vegetarian dish, then a chicken dish. Fortunately I ordered some steam rice on the side to fill me up. Otherwise I would've walked away upset and hungry. Oh yea, steam rice costs extra since lunch specials do not run on the weekends. Yea thats LV for you.  I have had better places in the OC as far as Thai Food goes. But for LV this place is good enough, and excellent according to the locals."}
{"text":"Located next to the Sunflower grocery store, it's a nice Thai restaurant with plenty of booths and atmosphere, but the only vital thing lacking was air conditioning and a friendly smile.   Wanted the hubby to try the Beef and Chicken Satay that I had last week here, a bit pricey for satay in my opinion.  Not too crazy about the cucumber salad,  peanut sauce good and so was the Thai ice tea.  Glad I got take out! Saw some girls eating here and they asked for a portable fan to be turned on?  Huh? How about turning on the AC?   Just missed the lunch specials which would be worth the price."}
{"text":"Man, this review comes one year and one restaurant closing too late.  I can kind of see why this Thai Original BBQ closed down though, it was really in a 'questionable' part of town right in between The Strip and Downtown Las Vegas, and right next to a shady (and I mean Eminem Slim Shady) motel/apartment complex.  Although if I remember correctly this was the first location for this restaurant.  So original, yes.  But the surroundings do not atone for the food at Thai Original BBQ.  It truly was near authentic, tastefully done.  Once you got past the funky parking lot (potholes included), and the quirky little restaurant building, your taste buds were in for a treat.    Many traditional Thai dishes can be found at Thai Original BBQ, and the menu is vast but not overwhelming.  Newbies to Thai food will find something familiar to eat, and more experienced diners will find some hidden, lesser known gems.  For our meal we stuck with the more familiar fare this time around.  *Spicy Beef Salad - Slices of marinated beef, cucumbers, carrots, red onions, cilantro, fresh green chilies, and lime juice  *Chicken Pad Thai - Noodles stir-fried with bean sprouts, and scrambled egg in a mild-spicy sauce topped with green onions, and ground peanuts  The Spicy Beef Salad was excellent, cold, crisp veggies, hot, juicy beef, and the sensory taste explosion of sweet, tart, and salty from the dressing.  Umami bomb!  I practically ate the entire thing by myself and almost didn't get around to sharing.  The Chicken Pad Thai was great as well, noodles were cooked just right, chicken was sliced thinly and moist, the sauce overall complemented the dish perfectly.  I don't like Pad Thai that is too sweet, and this one from Thai Original BBQ was very spot on for me.  With a squeeze of lime, I was consumed by eating.  Carbs?  What carbs?  Servings were pretty generous.  But watch your heat level!  We stuck on the low end of the spectrum, a 2 or 3, but were still hit with a nice punch of chili.  Nothing my gut can't handle though.    Since the restaurant was a bit out of the way for us (and we didn't like wandering there after the sun went down) we hardly got to visit.  Unfortunate for us because the food at this That Original BBQ was exceptional.  I guess if anything, we can go to their other location on W. Flamingo Rd., which funny enough is closer to our neck of the woods!    For some good eats, Thai this place!  Ok, ok, bad pun."}
{"text":"In this area of town there are not a lot of great places to eat unless you go to a casino.  But here in the heart of the Arts district is a tasty Thai place that is easy to get to and has delicious food.    The outside of the place might look a little scary...but inside the decor is well thought and is clean and well done.  I ate of the lunch menu, and my only beef was the portions.  I coulda finished off another plate of the Chicken Curry i ordered.  so good!.    One thing i noted was they never asked me how hot i wanted my food.  so it came out with no real heat.  so if you like your food spicy, make sure to mention it when you order!"}
{"text":"Got the BBQ Chicken dish suggested by the waitress.  Every single part of the meal was overcooked.  The chicken was dry, the \"shrimp\" fried rice was mush with two overcooked shrimp in it."}
{"text":"This review is about two years over due and docked one point from what I would have originally given.  I like Original Thai a lot.  It is one of my favorite Thai restaurants.  I have always loved the chicken satay lunch though I usually try something different.  I think I will go back to it after todays lunch.  Today I ordered the beef panang.  I have had it before and it was better then.  Today the beef was fatty and greasy.  The rice was dry and slightly crunchy.  I was not impressed.  From now on if I go for lunch, it is chicken satay or nothing.  I wish they had some of the noodle dishes on their lunch menu.  Then I could get the pad woon sen.  I had that once for dinner and it was great.  I still like Original Thai but I am going to stick with the simple and what I know from now on.  I've already tried many items from the menu.  I'll be more adventurous at another place."}
{"text":"Yelp has let me down on this one!!!!  I guess I might be asking for too much when I want decent thai food when I'm in Vegas.  Service was PISS POOR.  Went in, sat down fast.  Waited more than 5 minutes to order (AFTER they took order from other tables who came in after us).  Got thai ice tea quickly after order.  Waited decent time for food after other tables got their food who came in after us, but by then the waiters don't say anything to us for the rest of the night.  I guess that is ok, I don't want to talk to waiters who aren't nice to it's patrons.  Ordered Pad See Ew with pork, Beef Jerky, and Rainbow Trout Dinner.  Pad See Ew was decent, but pork was extremely dry.  Beef Jerky was extremely dried by the deep fry with LOTS of fat attached to it.  The sauce for the jerky was very tart from the lime and makes you do a \"bitter beer face\".  Rainbow Trout was burnt black on outside and very dry on inside.  I do not see how this place gets regulars, but I guess people here do not know how authentic thai really tastes.  If you want authentic thai, look elsewhere!!  Oh yeah...the \"Yelp special\" of 10% off if you mention you saw them on Yelp DOESN\"T GET HONORED!!!!  I said it like three times and she didn't know what the hell I was saying.  Let's just say their tip INCLUDED the 10% they didn't honor.  This was generous too for the crap we got from the poor service and bad food."}
{"text":"Very good and authentic tasting Thai food matched with a clean and inviting atmosphere and fast friendly service. The sate, pad thai and barbecue chicken plated with flavorful shrimp fried rice are instant favourites. This Original Thai BBQ location is now one of our regular places to go to for good dining, my only wish is that the thai iced tea had bottomless refills like the Decatur location offers."}
{"text":"Location Go down the strip, pass Stratosphere, make a left and a couple rights somewhere and you're there! It's the smallest Thai restaurant I've been to right next to a very beat down motel. At least they have a big sign to make it an easy find.  Ambience The surroundings may look beat down, but the inside isn't too bad. Looks newly painted (maybe I was just hungry and everything was a blur) with a lot of wood panels and bamboo deco. Walkways are kinda small. Lighting is average, neither dim nor bright. When I went here with my two buddies at 8pm on a Friday, there were 10 people here so it was pretty quiet. Tables are small, but I'm pretty sure they'd allow groups to link tables.  Service Decent. They do their job.  Price The most expensive item here that I remember is $15.  Food The three of us shared a pad thai, bbq chicken with white rice, and thai tea coffee. It was the most flavorful pad thai I've ever had. Just the right amount of seasoning. Their bbq chicken was good for what it was. I'm biased against ordering this dish at restaurants cuz I can make it myself at home so I didn't enjoy it as much as my friends did. Thai tea coffee was definitely tastea. Too bad the caffeine content was not strong enough for the events that followed that night!  Last Words Get the pad thai and thai tea coffee! Lunch specials are supposed to be pretty cheap ($7 plates) so try to go then."}
{"text":"My husband and I usually order take-out once a month from Thai BBQ. It is a pretty decent thai restraunt where you can get a good deal for your money. We've tried a lot of items from the menu such as the drunken rice (awesome), all of the curries, tom kha and all of the lunch specials. The only thing I am not crazy about are their noodles, but other than that the food is solid and well priced!"}
{"text":"This little gem was one of the best parts of our trip to Vegas. We noticed it when visiting the wedding chapel to look over our pictures and knew immediately it was a place to hit on the way back to the strip. I had the drunken noodles with tofu, which was just the right amount of spicy, and was very flavorful, unlike a lot of noodle dishes I've had in Thai places. We had the wontons for an appetizer, and they were phenomenal with the sweet sauce that came with them. I had a little taste of the short ribs the husband ordered, and although I'm not really a meat eater, I was ready to dive face-first into his plate of barbecuey heaven. I'll be longing for this place until I hit the West again."}
{"text":"Ordered take out for the wife and I. We ordered Tom Kha Gai soup, chili beef, and ginger chicken.  The soup is always tasty wherever we get it.  It has a nice tartness and richness to it. Lots of good flavor.   The chili beef had a lot if flavor.  I would recommend it.  Spicy and great taste.  The ginger chicken was also good.  A lot of ginger though.  My wife loves ginger and absolutely loved this dish. I like ginger and didn't really care for it.   Overall a good experience."}
{"text":"The food is okay and the owners are friendly.  I love the random fixes of Downtown buildings, they dont have a bathroom so you have to go across the parking lot."}
{"text":"Are you kidding me, from the grease soaked walls to the greasy inedible food, to the roaches that crawled across our table......THUMBS DOWN!  After about 20 minutes into our meal and roach crawled across our table not to mention the few we saw on the walls. This place was so dirty, I needed a shower when we got home. DISGUSTING, DEPLORABLE, GREASY FOOD!"}
{"text":"I came here during First Friday while we were waiting to meet up with one of Jon's friends. I had the veggie egg rolls to start. I liked that they had the clear rice noodles in them. I should have stuck to my veggie theme for my whole meal but I had ordered Hawaiian Chicken Curry. I'm very picky when it comes to chicken if it has that weird stinky chicken smell I'm turned off! I admit when I cook chicken it will sometimes have that same weird taste. I personally don't know what causes it or how to prevent it. I couldn't eat it anymore and the rice was a little soggy for my taste so I just set it aside.  I thought the seating was kind of unique but I didn't like the fact that the bathroom was located outside. The bathroom was a mess and there was hardly any toilet paper. It's probably not possible to add a bathroom to their restaurant but they can control the cleanliness. They can have this locked so only customers can use it. Then have someone do bathroom duty every three hours at least."}
{"text":"Don't bother ordering online at http://thaioriginalbbqlv.com   It looks like it is available and even sends you a receipt.  YOU WILL NOT GET YOUR FOOD.  the 3rd street is closed and Flamingo said \"we don't have online ordering,\" even though it looks legitimate."}
{"text":"I have had delicious food twice and my family raves about it. A huge bonus is that almost everything on the menu is under $10."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem in Vegas.  They have great lunch specials for about $7.  My favorite is the bbq chicken, the sauce is amazing and their shrimp fried rice is fabulous.  My husband gets the garlic pepper pork and loves it every time.  I have yet to order anything here that I didnt like.  Dont be fooled by the similar places though, they are not the same.  We tried the other Thai BBq's and they are not as good.  We always drive to this one even though it is like an hour round trip from our house."}
{"text":"This place is one of the only redeeming places to eat by where I live. Their pad thai is amazing and their pinapple fried rice is super yummy. Their curry is hot and their rangoons are sweet and awesome. Their crispy duck dinner was a little dry and very crispy, but pretty good for here. They now deliver, which is great if it is a million degrees outside and you are as lazy as I am. If you are vegitarian and looking for a good lunch or dinner spot, this is it! Super nice people and really cute inside. If I liked thai food more, I would go here more :)"}
{"text":"I am a fan of Thai BBQ and was pleasantly surprised that they had one in Vegas.  Though this particular location is franchised, the food is pretty much the same.  I was only caught off guard when they charge for extra sweet sauce.  The sweet sauce is in a pre-packaged container so that was how I found out this location was a little different.

{"text":"This place is a diamond in the rough.  And it's probably best to stay that way.  They don't seem to be hurting for business and it keeps the masses away.  The four of us went here for dinner on a cold rainy night, but it was bright inside the restaurant from the light glinting off of our pearly whites we were smiling so big. $60 bucks gave us two appetizers and 4 entrees, with drinks and food leftover to go!  It was all very good and flavorful, portions were filling, and a great number of options on the menu.  This will be a regular spot in Vegas when I visit.  I'm really excited about this little gem.  Don't get me wrong, I wouldn't go for a late night run in this neighborhood, I didn't even want to risk using the bathroom located in the abandoned hotel sharing the parking lot.  But I will definitely drive here for an awesome tasty meal!"}
{"text":"The place is OK.  Maybe it's just a thai thing, but it IRKS the bejezus out of me when they ask if you want steamed rice and don't tell you that THEY CHARGE for it.  My fault for not asking, but this place and Prommares(sp) pull that quick one.  Both the panang chicken and combo chowmein were just OK.  There are better places for panang in my opinion, namely Thai Basil and Krung of Siam."}
{"text":"Maybe they changed cooks but the last time I went there was the first time I was ever disappointed.  Everything just seemed to lack flavor.  So sad....."}
{"text":"This small owner operated restaurant has received many favorable reviews on yelp and urbanspoon so we were very optimistic.  Ann ordered the Pad Thai which was pretty good, but my order of BBQ chicken, aka kai yang, was amazing.  I received half of a chicken that was cooked until it was lightly crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside with a BBQ flavor that was not overwhelming.  My plate also included a large portion of shrimp fried rice that was both moist and flavorful.  Service throughout was excellent.    We returned the following evening to allow Ann to order the BBQ chicken while I tried another of the house specialties, BBQ ribs.  We also enjoyed a Thai cucumber salad.  My wife's chicken was as good as the night before. The ribs were tasty, but too tough.  Our server on both nights was excellent."}
{"text":"On our last trip in May, we dined twice at their Flamingo location so, in spite of its seedy location, I maintained high expectations.  We each ordered the BBQ chicken that comes with shrimp fried rice. The plating was not as nice as at the other location.  Though the food was tasty, the chicken was obviously reheated and overdone.  On being presented with our check, net of my restaurant.com certificate, of only $5, I pointed out the $10 error to our server.  Our waitress initially did not understand, but upon taking the bill to the cashier we could hear them erupt into giggles which continued in spurts as other staff members were told."}
{"text":"************************** * TERRIBLE SERVICE * ************************** They charge for extra bbq sauce.  The one that comes with the meal is  tiny.  *** Charging for extra sauce is ridiculous especially for a BBQ place.  The Thai lady who works there was very moody and rude.  First visit The waitress did not seem to want to be there; she gave us an attidute to the normal things asked for like napkins and refills.  We had such a bad experience I did not want to tip.  At the end I felt bad thinking maybe she had a bad day and left a normal tip.  We decided that we would never dine-in again.  Second visit Wanting to bypass the terrible service we decided to order out.  Upon arriving to pick up the order we received the same attitude.  Having paid the bill I asked for extra BBQ sauce.  She immediately threw a fit, stormed back to the kitchen and brought back some sauce to which I happily paid for because they charge for extra sauce. Guess what? - The To-Go order didn't even have sauce to begin with!  WTH?  She should have known that she did not give us any sauce and she charged us extra for the ones I asked for.  Of course this was verified at home.  ********************************* * I WILL NEVER VISIT AGAIN * *********************************"}
{"text":"Let me put it this way... today was my first time here for lunch & i am going back tonight for dinner. None of the workers here really speaks english, NOT A PROBLEM! the Thai bbq chicken is the BEST i have ever ever had! Tonight i am going to try the Garlic short ribs, i cant wait. When we pulled up, i was extremely hesitant because the resteraunt is not aesthetically pleasing, kinda looks like a broke back shack, but for this place LOOKS ARE DECEIVING! GO GET SOME"}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of chain places. But Thai BBQ reminds me of Carson Ca. I never realized there were so many here. There are some Thai places who pass of BBQ chicken from a roast oven. This place it's definitely fire kissed.  You have your typical Thai dishes here. MeeKrob, pad thai, currys. I usually order a bbq chicken which comes with this great sauce, chicken satay, pineapple fried rice, mint and beef, steamed ric, and definitely Thai Iced tea. The staff is friendly and give me a constant reminder that I'm a growing boy and I need to eat!"}
{"text":"I first walked into this restaurant skeptical. My favorite Thai place has been Kung Fu for over 15 years, and I haven't been too impressed by any others in town. I got a Groupon for this restaurant, it was near my home, so I decided to give it a shot; I am so glad I did.  This is a small and quaint spot, with a welcoming decorum. The staff is pleasant and welcoming. In addition to the surface beauty, the food was phenomenal. All items on the menu are priced reasonably, and there is so much to choose from. As a fan of Thai cuisine for most of my life, having grown up with a Thai family, I was a little concerned over the way a couple of items on the menu were described as being served. But my concern was immediately erased once I ate all my favorite dishes. Everything was perfect. The Chicken Sate was tender and moist, the Tom Kha Gaiwas unbelievable full of flavor and a mighty serving to boot. And my ultimate deciding factor dish, Chicken Pad Kapow, blew me away! A friend of mine, who is a Vegetarian, enjoyed the Tofu Pad Thai and kept remarking on how great it was (he is notorious for his complaints about Vegetarian dishes I might add). So overall, I will say this is on the ranks of my highly recommended establishments for, not just good Thai food, but overall great food.   The only reason I did not give it a 5 star rating is the fact that I was not given steamed rice with my dish, and that the shrimp I requested in my Tom Kha Gai was replaced with chicken. The chicken was good, but I would've much preferred the Shrimp I had requested."}
{"text":"I always go to this place! I absolutely love it. The servers are always very friendly. Plus, the food is amazing!  I either get the chicken curry or the bbq chicken. I recently tried the pineapple curry.. and as a request, they even did half chicken & half shrimp for me.  I've tried the crispy duck but wasn't really impressed, but everything else is pretty delicious. The curry is mild, well to me anyway. It has a very tiny kick to it. I wish sometimes that they would give us an option on the spicy level.  The servers are always nice.. they're not super attentive like what you would come across in a neighborhood restaurant (Applebee's, Chili's, TGIF, etc). But that's to be expected at pretty much any Asian restaurants.   The only reason I'm docking off a star is because I would like the option of determining how hot & spicy the dishes should be. (Other Thai restaurants do this)"}
{"text":"You can't be a local in Las Vegas and not give Thai \"Original\" BBQ five stars!  These guys are the OG's of thai food in Vegas. Im sure that, if they do, they will go down in sincity history.  Before all the other newcomers like Le Thai and Pin Kaow, there was that ol' dinky lil' shacky restaurant with that mysterious Thai gift shop that I've never seen open, along with the freaky boarded up Motel on the same property which introduced Vegas and Non-Thai folk alike to dishes like Pad-Thai and the well known S-1.  I don't have to go on giving my review on any particular dish simply because of the fact that every thing on the menu is incomparable.  In fact, every thai restaurant should use Thai Original as the measure to how good the quality of food they're serving.  Thai Original, Thai Reputable, Thai Delectable, Thai Historical.. Thai Mammer Jammer! (just as foxy as can be!)"}
{"text":"Weekday lunch specials are always a bargain, and this was no exception at Thai BBQ on W. Flamingo.  From the outside, Thai BBQ looks like a fast food joint.  But you'll be surprised with the nice sit down restaurant feel inside.    There are about 14 choices under the Lunch Special menu, with only one of them being vegetarian.  I went for the L-12 Beef Panang Lunch Special \"Chunks of tender beef cooked in curry and coconut milk, served with steamed rice.\" ($6.50).  I was more excited about the curry and coconut milk than the beef part.  The sauce was definitely tasty on the white rice, but the beef was a bit heavy.  It made for great leftovers (with a bit of peanut sauce) says the Husband.  Whereas he chose the L-14 BBQ Pork Sate Lunch Special \"Marinated pork grilled on a bamboo skewer, served with peanut sauce, cucumber sauce, and fried rice.\" ($6.50).  He usually goes for the Beef Sate, but it's not offered here during the lunch special.  Nonetheless, we both really like it and I found myself nibbling more his protein than mine.  The cucumber sauce is more like a a cucumber salad with red onions and jalapeno slices in a vinaigrette.   I really liked their version of the Thai Ice Tea ($1.95). It was strongly brewed and sweet!  Yum!   Service was great. There were a handful of customers and the waiter was attentive and friendly.  Definitely no problems there.  Sidenote: They could definitely update their bathroom though.  However, I do appreciate the Charmin toilet paper they use!"}
{"text":"Disappointed...with the reviews, I had high expectations.. maybe they were short staffed?? I don't know.. Came here this past Saturday night around 7...with a party of 3..the place wasn't too busy..but the service was horrible!!!! It took almost 10 minutes after we were seated before someone came to help or acknowledge us..and from there the waiting just grew.. our first dish, pad thai- came out 10 minutes before the rest of the meal, and the dish was bad..the noodles were broken and the flavor was bland and dry...10 minutes later, came out our garlic ribs w fried rice and our papaya salad.. The papaya salad and the garlic ribs were just okay... then another 5 minutes later came out our pad see eww with beef and that was a big disappointment.. it was way too sweet for me, it tasted like I was eating a sugar glazed dessert.. after our meal came, we requested boxes and our check..another 10 minutes flew  by again and we had to flag them down for service... what a big disappointment.."}
{"text":"Since I work Downtown, I order from Thai BBQ every now and then. I would say this place is above-average as a \"hole in the wall\" takeout spot.  There are better Thai restaurants for a sit-down meal, but for delivery or quick takeout, this is the best in the area.  I've never tried their Pad Thai, so I can't comment (weird, because that's usually my go-to dish). The Drunken Noodles are very good; this is what I normally order. I really like their spring rolls, both the meat and veggie versions. The chicken Satay was excellent too, the one time I ordered it.  I haven't ever had a bad meal from this restaurant. The quality is consistent. I haven't sampled very much of their menu, but everything I have tried has been spot on. I wouldn't recommend Thai BBQ to the Thai food elitist types out there, but it's a great little place to pick up some dinner on your way out of the ghetto."}
{"text":"A hidden gem in the sequined world known as Sin City.This treasure lies hidden on the outskirts of Naked City. That alone congeres up images of some exotic clandestine opium den ,plucked from the pages of a pulp fiction novel.      Two  different presentations  of BBQ Duck.  Both  under $10.... Amazing not only in the fact that there are two which are both delicious ....the fact they they both come in at around  $10. Worth the trip alone.   And Remember Tipping is not a city in China."}
{"text":"I have been dining here since 2003 and I have to say every time I come sit down and take that first bite, I ask myself why don't I eat here more often! It is soooooo yummy!!! The location isn't the most fancy and neither is the restaurant but that doesn't bother me. I prefer good tasting quality food over a fancy atmosphere. I don't understand the negative ratings on here unless it is because they were expecting a fancy place or a better part of town. I will continue to come here in spite of the neighborhood because the food is just out of this world. I have been here at lunch time which seems to be their busiest time and I have been here late at night which is when it is very slow and we will normally have the place all to ourselves. At all times I have noticed police officers frequent this eatery....as well as some local TV news anchors and prominent attorneys.     Some of our favorites dishes that are AMAZING are the Spicy Beef Salad, Drunken Noodles, their famous Thai BBQ chicken, mint chicken and my all time favorite: chicken curry! Just amazing!! I always try a new dish when we go in along with our favorites and I have never been disappointed! If you like Thai Tea that is awesome too. We can never figure out how such a small compact kitchen can crank out such amazing food in such a short amount of time. We have never had to wait for any long length of time for anything. I would suggest going here for lunch time. The busier they are the fresher and more delicious the food seems to be. A must try if you like Thai food!"}
{"text":"Some people may look at this place and choose not to go in. Well, PLEASE DO. My husband and I eat a lot of Thai food, and this place is wonderful! They have a great menu choice, with some good authentic Thai. It's a great place to go with a group of people and order numerous dishes so you all can share. I think I tried 6 different dishes, and each was very good. You can choose how spicy you want your dishes incase you have heartburn issues. The prices are very reasonable, and the staff is very attentive. If you like Thai, don't miss out on this place!!!"}
{"text":"I first fell in love with Thai food in Seattle.  There was a little restaurant by the apartments I used to live in and would only order Chicken Penang Curry.  Since I was craving for some, I decided to come here.  Their Chicken Penang Curry wasn't as great as the one I had in Seattle but it's good enough.  It had the sweetness and spiciness I wanted.  The only downfall to this restaurant is that you have to pay $1.25 for rice when most other Thai places will give it freely and no charge.  Maybe the economy is affecting them that they have to charge for it."}
{"text":"I'll admit that I'm not a sophisticate well versed connoisseur of Thai cuisine.  Whenever, I order Thai I always order the same thing:  Chick Satay and Shrimp Pad Thai.  So that's what I order there.  It was the best version of those dishes I've had the pleasure of enjoying.  The neighborhood, I'm sure is not what it used to be, but the food certainly is.  Worth the trip!"}
{"text":"OK, I must stay loyal to Thai BBQ chain because they introduced me to the pleasures of Thai food. BUT I must say, this particular location really let me down. I've been to this location a number of times, and for my first review for them I'm disappointed to report that the staff here really needs to get their stuff together! I found a much better Thai food restaurant and will no longer be going the Thai BBQ, unless I'm extremely desperate for Thai food. WHY? Because on final bon voyage visit to Thai BBQ, I experienced the worst service and delivery.   The hostess that was there that night was unbelievably rude, for example, we arrived at 9pm and they close at 10pm, so when she greeted us she looked at her watch and rolled her eyes. Not to mention the mean mug we saw when we first walked in. Then to follow, literally two minutes after we sat down, she came up to us and asked us if we were ready to order, she didn't even ask if we wanted something to drink first. As we waited for our meal we glanced over at her and noticed that 1) she never smiled (looked extremely angry) and 2) Was talking on the phone while she sat other guest. This had to have been the worst hostess in the world!! OK so got our meal and felt extremely uncomfortable every time the waitress came by- which wasn't a whole lot and finally time to leave- we decided to be nice and leave a tip of $1 even though we felt she really didn't deserve it. Meal was less than $20. As we walked out to our car we glanced back and noticed the waitress mad-dogging us as we left! NO JOKE! She had the blinds open and was staring us down. Then she followed us outside, stood there, and gave us a look of death! I'M NOT KIDDING. ON TOP OF THAT she came out a second time as we were in the car pulling out, and started pointing and yelling something that we couldn't understand. At that point we were burning rubber out of the parking lot! We understand that leaving a dollar might have been insulting to her, but we figured it was better than nothing given her crappy attitude and poor delivery. Had we known we would be harassed out of the parking lot that night by an ornery waitress we mightve brought some protection.   I don't want to end on a negative note because like I said, I started out with Thai BBQ, as far as meals go I suggest the BEEF SATE (comes with a delicious peanut sauce that is to DIE for, Marinated sliced beef or chicken, in a mixture of Thai spices and coconut milk grilled and served on bamboo skewers with cucumber salad.) I've had the Chicken Sate but it wasn't as good as the beef. I'm huge on curry, and the Yellow chicken curry is good except I'm not a huge fan of simply adding sliced green peppers in the curry to make it spicy. At the very least try a side of their fried rice- DELICIOUS! and so sweet- you'll love it!"}
{"text":"Every time the Husband & I are in town, we make sure to pay this place a visit. I was pretty impressed that this tiny little establishment is able to seat 100 people. Just a quick note, do not judge this place by its location and the fact that it's right across a broken-down motel because if you want a lot of really, REALLY good & authentic Thai food, this is the spot!"}
{"text":"My first and last time eating at Thai Original BBQ.  Oooooh, how dramatic!  I bet you can't wait to see what disaster I incurred!   Well, none.  I got the right food that I ordered, it was close enough to being available at the time promised, and the service and price were fine.     No, the reason I won't be back is that compared to all of the other quality Thai offerings Vegas has to offer, it simply wasn't good enough.  I will be the first to admit that Thai BBQ is suffering the affect of being the ~21st Thai restaurant I've tried here in Las Vegas, many of which are outstanding in every aspect.  I can't help but compare any new Thai restaurant to class acts such as Weera Thai or Prommares, neither of which is exceptionally far from this location of Thai BBQ.   All that being said, let's get to it:  I called in my order of a Chili Chicken lunch special because it seemed closest to what I normally order when I get Thai and also because of the lovely photo uploaded of the same dish in the photos here.  No seriously, look at this beautiful dish:  http://s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com/bphoto/IBxLi-C_it0Rm-m6N0TQDg/l.jpg     I was told it'd be ready in 15 minutes and I arrived probably a few minutes beyond that.  Upon entering it took a few minutes for the solitary server to get my order.  It wasn't an extremely long wait and she did seem very busy waiting actual tables so it didn't bother me.  If she was on her phone using snapchat or tumblr or sextor or whatever new app the kids use nowadays, I'd be a little more bothered by this.    Got back to my office and was a little disappointed in a few things.  1) That pic I posted above?  Mine looked nothing like that.  The chicken was chopped up sloppily and not beautifully ground up as you see above.  It was like going to Wendy's and expecting to get that 99 cent burger that can barely fit in Wendy's mouth on the commercial, only to receive one that your pet hamster can gobble in one bite.  2) No eggroll.   As a matter of fact, there was nothing but the chicken dish and the rice.  Now nothing extra was promised or advertised, but it seems pretty customary for most Thai restaurants to provide SOMETHING with the lunch special besides the discount.  If anything it adds a little value that I could have used after being charged $2 for my brown rice upgrade.     The food that WAS provided, tasted okay, but not great.  The rice seemed a little mushier than I prefer, and as I mentioned before the chicken was pretty haphazardly chopped up.     Sorry Thai BBQ, that ultimately winds up being worth 2 stars.  If you'd have gotten to me a year ago, you probably would have eeked out a 3.  Where's Doc Brown when you need him?"}
{"text":"This is our 2nd time here...again we were left satisfied!  We ordered the pork larb, Thai BBQ chicken and Thai ribs that come with shrimp fried rice.  Loved the chile lime larb---taste was fresh and clean.  Chicken was juicy and flavorful, pork looked yummy but I did not taste it.  Price for everything was about 31.00 and only downside is they charge for more rice---at 1.95 that's steep to me for just plain rice.  Other than that I feel prices here are good.  Restaurant is clean but service is a bit slow but pleasant.  Will def be back because the food is really tasty!"}
{"text":"I'm so disappointed!  This is my second visit to Thai Original BBQ.  We ordered Shrimp Pad Thai and Beef with Broccoli, both were very, VERY salty.  MSG?  I'm assuming so, as I had a horrible headache for the rest of the night.  My Pad Thai wasn't very flavorful and the Beef with Broccoli looked so gross I didn't even want to taste it.  We ended up tossing it all and having cereal instead.   Sadly, I won't be back.  If you need me, I'll be at Archie's or Pin Kaow.  Where the service is just as friendly but the food is beyond amazing."}
{"text":"This joint might be the shit, but I'll never know.  I am confident in my formula for a good thai place: a grungy, ghetto-fied exterior with a clean and tidy interior packed with actual thai folk.  Excited by the nasty, dirty exterior of the building and its sketchy location, I was disappointed to find the inside to be less than spotless.  I was quickly, if nonchalantly, greeted and seated with a menu, among about 2-3 other full tables.  After sitting over 10 minutes with nary a glass of water or a peep out of the staff, I had hope that the approaching server was on the way to take my order.  Alas, my hopes were dashed when the server went to the table that was already busy enjoying their meal and proceeded to take a To-Go order from them, so that it could be ready when they left.  Seeing that the other two tables hadn't received food yet, and had been there long enough to deplete their thai teas completely, I was very upset to know that I would be sitting starving, waiting for my food to be cooked AFTER these folks who were already eating their food had their To-Go order cooked.    Uh uh.  I left the menu I'd nearly memorized by this point and my non-existent glass of water on the table and skeedaddled."}
{"text":"Very friendly service that accommodated all requests with a smile (extra napkins etc)... Servings were generous and could've fed 2 people honestly... Felt bad about wasting what we couldn't eat but didn't want to take it back to the hotel room with no microwave or fridge -shrugs-  parking/bathroom took away 1 star :("}
{"text":"Wow, what a pleasant surprise!  My filipino friend has lived in Vegas for over 10 years, and introduced me to this marvel-admidst-scum.  Don't let the condemned hotels and two homeless men scare you away.  The restaurant is IMMACULATE; very clean and comfortable.  The food is amazing, even better than San Francisco in my opinion (born and raised in the Bay Area, so that means something.)  I ordered the Beef Panang, we shared the Coconut Chicken Soup, and he had the Chicken Satay.  All wonderful!  Only thing I was depressed about, is the restaurants lack of duck and mab curries.  If you are looking for Thai, this place is worth the cab- of course, you should always have a rental car in Vegas, they're cheap- so you have no excuse for not trying this place.  The only thing I couldn't figure out, is why the waiter kept walking into a room at the condemned motel!"}
{"text":"Pros: Very tasty and good selection.  Cons: bad ventiation (the place was smoky from their BBQing) and small portions.  Your best bet is for take out."}
{"text":"Must try the Beef skewers...  ...dipped in Peanut sauce. Ridiculously good! Salads were good here. Other items were just okay - Pad Thai, fried rice. Didn't like the drunken noodles.  Prices cheap during lunch special time. Not crowded."}
{"text":"It's been a minute since I moved out of Vegas, but this place is so good I feltl obligated to write about it.  Everything I've ever ordered has been spot on and the service is always fast and friendly whether they're busy or not.  (They're usually very busy...)  It's a simple place with traditional Thai food on the menu, but they are known for their barbecue chicken.  I've had that and the BBQ ribs several times as well as some of their soups, the fried rice and almost every shrimp dish on the menu.  All fantastic at great prices."}
{"text":"Been to other locations in town but my first time here - outside doesn't look promising, but the inside looks much better than the rest. Its decorated with dark woods and statues, the type of place I wouldn't mind a sit down meal. I came because of a $20 for $10 groupon, and the woman at the register was super sweet. A lot of times places kind of give you a little sneer when you break out the groupon or restaurant.com but she was just as pleasant and smiley.   I did a to go order of ala carte garlic short ribs, honey duck and spicy beef salad w Thai tea. I'm really not a fan of this chain's shrimp fried rice so I never get the house specials. Total for everything was about $28 cheap!  Friends had highly recommended the spicy beef salad, but I wasn't that impressed. When I saw slices of beef in the description, I assumed a piece of beef sliced like most other Thai beef salads I've had. This was thinly sliced then cooked, basically what they'd put in their noodle or rice dishes. Cooked with julienned carrots and served over a few romaine lettuce leaves w cucumbers, onions, chilis, lime juice and cilantro. I got 5 out of 10 spicy and it had just enough heat for me.   The garlic shirt ribs are probably my fav dish there. Its a generous portion of little pork ribs fried super crispy and dredged in a sweet soy sauce. It reminds me of Hawaii style Korean chicken. Yum! Ribs are mostly meat, a lot of boneless chunks and not too fatty which is a plus.  Honey duck was also disappointing, but at least reasonably priced. A half (small) duck for $8. It says roasted but I'm pretty positive it was fried. It was really crispy like the ribs but meat was pretty dried out. Had no seasoning or taste on its own, but served with a sweet honey sauce on the side.   It was a ton of food and with 2 ppl sharing we still had a lot left over. This is the best of the original Thai BBQ chain in Vegas, and I'd definitely come back (because I bought 2 groupons!)"}
{"text":"i love thai bbq. been eating at the ones in LA since i was a kid... not as good as LA, but it is pretty much the same. I get the chicken and rice...   It comes with their classic sweet & sour sauce & red rice. its the shit! i also get the beef bbq. super good... dip it in the same sauce... i think you can get it as a combo with the two meats.  highly recommended."}
{"text":"Ok so by now you all must know how much I really dig Thai BBQ!   Does not hurt that it is located super close to my house either, lol.   This time I decided to order delivery rather than dine in, yeah one of those lazy days, wanted to enjoy my bed with some good grub..wink...   Delivery service fantastic!   I kid you not, my food showed up at my door in 15 minutes and piping hot off of the grill!   I thought the portion was good when you dine in, wow tons of food loaded to the top!   What I got...   BBQ Chicken & shrimp fried rice   Pork Pad Thai   Crab rangoon appetizer   OK so I had enough food to last me a couple of meals, mmmm yummy.   As always they never let me down!   Dine in, take out or delivery is great either way!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!   *Delivery $15 minimum food purchase."}
{"text":"I eat a lot of Thai food and I think the food here is excellent.  The prices are extremely reasonable.  If you are going for lunch, they have plenty of great specials.  The cons of this place are the small dining room and sometimes slow service (due to the busy lunch hour).  I recommend trying their spicy drunken noodles."}
{"text":"The lunch specials during the weekdays are a nice bargain.  And what makes it even better is the selections offered, which should offer something interesting for everyone.  My favorite is probably their BBQ Chicken, and is juicy and sweet. I can probably eat 2 or 3 plates of these while I watch a DVD :p  I usually try a curry dish at Thai restaurants, but have not been here enough times yet to give that a try, but they look really good.  I tried the sate dish (pork) served with fried rice, and with the peanut dipping sauce was just plain good eats!  Their service was good, even when the restaurant is busy.  But I suggests going early to beat the lunch crowd rush.  Looking forward to going back again, now that they have $10 for $20 Dinners Groupon promotions today. http://gr.pn/hCCId1   Service:  4.5/5 Food:  4/5 Price:  4/5 Location:  Not close enough for out-of-town visitors relying on taxi for transportations, but great for locals working/living in the SW."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and every time I leave thinking, meh. Honestly, the only reason I gave this place another try is because I got the Groupon. It's just ok. Edible, but not exciting.  This was my first trying the Hawaiian curry. Horribly oversweetened and a weirdly thick consistency. It was like drink whipping cream. We had the BBQ ribs, which weren't anything special. The only saving grace was the Pad Thai, but even that wasn't spectacularl. Definitely better Thai in town. The ribs came with the shrimp fried rice, which I found to be the worst thing we ate.  Just eh."}
