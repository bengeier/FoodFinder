{"text":"First, let's not forget that they just opened and there will be growing pains. With that said, the facility is nice, they've done a good job with the space they have to work with. The staff so far is friendly and location is great. We needed it in downtown Monroe.  Moving on to the food. I've had several pizzas and a couple biscuits for breakfast. They do sell beer and wine.   The biscuits are about half the size of a Bojangles or the Palace and basically twice as expensive. Yes, they have an assortment of \"toppings\" beyond the basics. That's nice. They need to pay attention to their menu though and put what you order on your biscuit. And don't think your popping in before work and doing a grab and go. 5 or 10 minutes or longer, if there's a line, just to get a biscuit. You would think breakfast items would be fast and furious. When I was in this Saturday there were 8 people working, myself and one other person and it still took awhile. Maybe they wanna do everything to order. Keep that in mind.   The pizzas are...pizzas. Wide assortment of toppings, but EXPENSIVE. I ordered a 12 inch small with three toppings and it was $20 plus change.  Certainly not catering to the masses and that's fine, but don't think this is the place to order pizzas for the kid's sleepover.   We'll see how things progress. Glad to have another spot downtown. This is an alternative I guess to having a small Mello Mushroom type pizzeria."}
{"text":"Last night I bought a large pizza with onion, green pepper, sausage and bacon. It was great! The combination of a great sauce and incredibly fresh ingredients made for a wonderful flavor. I believe there was a recent menu price reduction. I payed $21 and thought that was good value for such a high quality pizza that was huge in size. Looking forward to next visit to try other menu items such as subs and wings."}
{"text":"Seriously excited about this place! We went last night and ordered wings, Pizza, and cheesecake.  My whole family unanimously agreed that it was the best place to eat for wings and Pizza hands down. We will actually crave their food which makes us so happy in the land of mediocre chain food restaurants in Indian trial and Monroe. We have to go into Charlotte to get a good pizza which is more trouble than it's worth.  Wings were the best we ever had!  We will be back ...with friends. YUM!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"What a joke! I called in a to go order 30 minutes later when I arrived they were just putting my pizza in the oven. They said it would be an additional 20 minutes. I will never go back."}
{"text":"A great family establishment in downtown Monroe!  The staff was super friendly and very helpful. The pizza was amazing!  The crust was cooked to perfection and was heaven!  I am looking forward to going back for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I had an opportunity to try the new pizza place in town.  I ordered a cheese pizza, bruschetta and a Coke Zero.  The folks working there seemed nice and it didn't take long to get my food.  The cheese pizza was cooked well and I had no issues. The bruschetta was really fresh tasting along with the greens that were on the plate.  One issue I had was the bar code label still on the dish. I'm sure it was pretty clean but others might have sent it back. I know it's a crazy first week, just check your dishes.  I was surprised they didn't have my favorite local brew on tap from the downtown brewery.  Prices were ok, just a little higher than average.  I would suggest giving the place a try."}
{"text":"Im reviewing the pizza menu, not breakfast as I've not eaten breakfast here yet.  We came on the third day, wanting to give them a few days to work out the kinks.  Upon entry, the restsurant feels and looks trendy.  It was Sunday afternoon, and folks aren't used to something being open, so there werent many people and we were immediately waited on.  Having said that, there was a somewhat steady flow of people, which as a local who had been dying for Sunday options,  made me happy.  We chose the bruchetta and the 12 in. pizza with extra cheese (has 5 kinds of cheese).  We had one soda and one water.  I was not a fan of the .50 charge for a water cup, especially since Monroe water is not great. I'd rather pay a dollar for a bottle of water, frankly. The sodas are one size for $2, but you get refills.  Our Bruchetta appetizer ($7)arrived within 10 minutes and was tasty.  My partner liked the bread better than I did.  I felt like the delicious flavor of the bruchetta deserved better than what appeared to be a toasted standard hoagie roll. They garnish with some fresh greens that were quite tasty and we sent none back!  Our pizza arrived shortly after the bruchetta and was hot and visually appealing. I found it to be tasty with a nice crust that was not too thick or thin.  It is not your standard flour pizza crust.  It needs to be said that this artisan pizza, NOT traditional italian. As a result, the sauce was somewhat bland without traditional italian kick, but the cheese was plentiful and makes up for it.  Overall, I'd say this is definitely worth trying.  Pricewise, they are a little steep for the majority of locals withn a  3 mile radius, but 2 people (us) left full for $26."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! They have great meatball subs, pizza, garlic knots, and Stromboli! They have tons of others things, but that's what we have tried. We haven't gotten there early enough to get biscuits yet, but they look AMAZING. Everyone is super nice and helpful. They are open until 10 which rocks.. especially here in Monroe!"}
{"text":"Came upon this on Friday night. Tables were full and there was a line. Could be a good sign. People were friendly but seemed to move slow. We ordered two sandwiches and had to wait about 30 minutes. Food was okay. Had the avocado bacon and tomato jam sandwich. Bread overwhelmed the contents. Need to add more. Flavor was okay. Hopefully they will work through their newness. Tables were not being cleaned off fast enough. They need to have staff pay attention to the tables."}
{"text":"Pizza is AMAZING but it takes a while to get your food and a little pricey. I don't mind paying for good food and it is very good so I can overlook the price. But if you have the time, order the pizza. You won't regret it!!"}
{"text":"So excited to have choices in downtown Monroe! Crust and Jam offers a variety of new options. So far I've only had the Stromboli, meatballs and one of their specialty pizzas. I was not disappointed!  The flavors are amazing! Some of the best meatballs I've ever had! The sauce has the perfect blend of spices. The pizza has a nice thin and perfectly chewy Crust.  We will definitely be repeat customers! Can't wait to try the biscuit options next!  The service was also great! We sat outside and we were asked several times if we needed anything else and our table was cleared as our plates emptied!"}
{"text":"First visit here for wife and I.  Sunday at 12:00.  There seemed to be one guy waiting all the tables.  He informed us that lunch would probably take longer than usual because their oven was acting up. I commend him for being up front and told us what was going on.   Because he was professional and polite, we did not mind the wait at all.   I had an italian sausage sandwich which was very good and tasty.  Would highly recommend Crust and Jam!!"}
{"text":"First let me say not only was my salad amazingly fresh. It was a very generous portion and inexpensive. The service was friendly. My friend had a cheese steak and fries and she said it was delicious. I recommend you give it a try."}
{"text":"The breakfast is subpar. Reminds me of a school cafeteria. Very basic, all plastic utensils. I hope the pizza makes up for the breakfast."}
{"text":"Let me start by gushing over the adorable name! \"Crust & Jam\" ?! Ah, I love it!   Cute, clean italian influenced restaurant located in the sleepy downtown Monroe area.   My family & I were playing trivia at Southern Range, a brewery located in monroe. They don't serve food but the restaurants in the area deliver food. How neat is that?!   We choose to order from crust & jam, & I'm sure glad we did. The lady that delivered the food was so nice & accommodating. She brought us Togo containers as make shift plates and made conversation about the \"hotter\" wings we ordered.  Those wings are the main reason I decided to write this review. We really enjoy extremely spicy food so we went with the spiciest choice they had, \"hotter\". Normally the hottest flavors restaurants offer are never hot enough but Crust & Jam did not disappoint! The wings brought tears to our eyes, literally.  4 stars because the pizza was really greasy & the caprese salad was pretty mediocre.  I'll be sure to order from this place again if I'm at the brewery!"}
{"text":"We came here in the middle of the afternoon on a Thursday and there weren't many people there.  It was only us n this small and new restaurant. We ordered the pizza and it was really good. The service was great also."}
{"text":"We are here for the very first time for lunch during the weekday. It was awesome!! Pizza special for weekday lunch was great price! (2 slices w/ drink for $8 or a slice and salads w/ drink for $8!) The atmosphere is cute and fun! We sat outside on the sidewalk! Loved that! Pizza wasn't greasy and crust was awesome! (I'm picky about crust!) Chef even gave us a slice of cheesecake and oh my word! SO GOOD! This place is a breath of fresh air for Monroe! You must try!! We can't wait to come back for dinner and beers!"}
{"text":"I'm So happy to Finally have a Real Pizza place in MONROE, Nc..And this is REAL Pizza!!! The Crust is Sooo GOOD!! Cooked to perfection, the tomato sauce is so fresh and they will literally make your pizza with anything you can imagine..We had pepperoni, ham, mushrooms & green peppers..Again everything was so fresh and tasted great!  The service was just as great as the food..From the second we walked in we felt welcome and we never had to ask for anything..Our glasses were continuously filled our food came out without much wait whatsoever..please go out and support our local businesses, you won't be sorry..This is going to be a weekly stop for us either to eat-in or to call and carry-out.."}
{"text":"I want to say first off that I am all about supporting local small businesses but I feel the need to share this feedback in hopes that this establishment may make a couple of changes. My husband and I ordered 1 large pizza, one small pizza, a bruschetta appetizer and a sweet tea. I like to think of myself as an intelligent person but we totally misunderstood the menu. It appeared that on a small pizza 2 toppings were included and on a large 3. Because why on earth would anyone pay 12 for a small and 16 for a large if all you get is sauce and cheese?! When we got the bill we were a bit surprised that the total was $50. Upon looking at the check we discovered that each topping on the small was $2 and $3 for a large. So with 2 toppings on each pizza we ended up paying $16 for a small pizza and $22 for a large. Had the pizza been out of this world delicious that price may have been easier to swallow but it was just average. I felt like it was overwhelmed with cheese on a little thin crust which make the whole pizza soggy. We took the leftovers home to our son and he couldn't eat it due to the sogginess and extreme amount of cheese. I feel as if the menu should be more clear about the price of toppings. Instead of just stating \"S/2 and L/3\" there should be a $ sign next to the number so there is no confusion. We were even told by an employee that other people had thought the same thing and said that it should be more clear. She even gave us a tip on how to order next time to get a better deal. Unfortunately we can not afford for there to be a next time. It would have been nice for her to tell us that when we placed our order! On a more positive note the bruschetta and sweet tea were very good."}
{"text":"Incredible food here... we drove an hour to get here on recommendation because they have the best gluten free dough on the planet."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying: I *wanted* to like this place. Monroe needs great local food joints. And a breakfast place that has fantastic biscuits -- sign us up! The experience was extremely underwhelming however.   The floor appeared to have not been mopped between closing last night and opening this morning. Shoes audibly stuck to the floor when walking.   The water we requested was unfiltered. Locals will know that unfiltered tap water here has a rather unpleasant aftertaste.   Service was slow.   My husband ordered a side of scrambled eggs. They were served more runny than my grits. He asked for them to be cooked some more, which they did oblige us on. However, when they were served again, the waitress explained they had been runny because the chef was a \"gourmet\" chef. I agree that most folks overcook their scrambled eggs, but this was undercooked significantly. And we both felt as if we were being told as though our taste in eggs was wrong.   With that being said, there were some significant bright spots I should mention. We really enjoyed the pimento cheese grits. And while my husband and I didn't love our biscuits, they were decent and home made. The flavor profiles available were inventive and good. And the meat was prepared excellently.   All in all though, the positives did not outweigh the negatives and we will probably not return."}
{"text":"GREAT PLACE! I just moved to downtown Monroe and went to Crust&Jam for breakfast this morning and had the most amazing bisect breakfast sandwich! Service was also amazing!!"}
{"text":"We collectively rated the cheesy bread 9.  Pizza 7.5.   That s high for us as picky pizza people."}
{"text":"Some friends and I were in Monroe and were to we HAD to go here. It's a cute restaurant with very welcoming friendly staff. We were all starving and this hit the spot! The garlic knots were so good that we almost ordered several more rounds. Thankfully we didn't because our entrees were huge and absolutely amazing!! Among us, we had 1 sub, 2 strombolis, and one enormous incredible pizza. We all enjoyed every single bite (our table went totally quiet while we ate- total focus on our food!) And we all took home leftovers. I 10000% recommend their food! They also have a wine and beer list that looks good and the cheesecake sounded amazing if any if us had had any room left!"}
{"text":"There area a few reasons why I am giving this place 5 stars. .. We came in for the first time not know what to expect.  Apparently they had been overwhelmed earlier by large groups and we're out of some ingredients.  Not once did I see a lack of customer service.  In fact the gentleman who served us and also helped to serve and wait on us, I was more impressed with.  I watched him help an elderly women and provide her something cool to drink.  I watched him interact with some others as well that I won't discuss, but left me more impressed.  The stromboli I had was very good and an eclectic menu.  I had pineapple, honey and figs and it was very interesting!  I would add some heat to it next time and n maybe some goat cheese for an additional zing.  The place itself is quaint, music pleasant and eclectic.  I am here scouting for additional store locations and property investments and this experience, let me in a good place.  I didn't know what to expect from a small rural town, but I'm leaving on a positive note for 4th of July weekend and will be back, to look more."}
{"text":"AWESOME customer service here, y'all. The food is good, the beer/wine list is more diverse than most local spots, and they deliver within walking distance! But seriously, come for the excellent service, stay for the veggie pizza and caprese salad. A hit for downtown Monroe!"}
{"text":"We finally got to try it out tonight. We got the mozzarella sticks and a small pepperoni pizza. Both were delicious! The mozzarella sticks came out in a bowl, on a bed of greens with the marinara sauce in the center. They were hot, crispy and fresh. Really good flavor.  The pizza was really good. Artisan style, unique crust, I liked the pizza sauce as it wasn't too much/overpowering. Our waiter was very friendly, checked on us frequently, overall did a great job. All together it was around $21 for 2 people plus tip. Not a bad price at all. We can't wait till the chef opens his next restaurant!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed lunch at Crust and Jam today. I had the veggie sandwich on a tomato basil wrap. The veggies were fresh and the balsamic glaze was really tasty. I can't wait to stop by for a biscuit at breakfast time. The selection looks great."}
{"text":"Our other plan for a meal in Monroe fell through, and since we aren't in this area often, we simply looked for something nearby - Crust and Jam was the choice (it was walking distance, and open, so sometimes these things work out).  Luckily they were awesomely friendly, and seemed happy to have us. Of course, it could be that no one else was there, but whatever the case, it was a nice thing, as all too often, the staff at a restaurant don't seem to care much.  When it comes to food, there were unfortunately no biscuits, despite being hinted at in the name (the \"jam\" part) and listed on the window. But still, they did have pizza (that \"crust\" part), so we decided to take that route instead.  Their garlic knots are a bit different - they are more like garlic rolls, but a decent amount of butter and a solid amount of garlic make them a passable starter. And the pizza followed along in no time. Unlike other places, you can even order half-and-half specialty pizzas, which is a nice trick.  We followed up with some of their donuts, which were a tasty finish, though the dough itself was better than some of the toppings (the icing itself was a bit thick).  Certainly a nice treat in downtown Monroe - and that's not just because they were the only place open, either."}
{"text":"3.5 is the RATING I'M GIVING today. I've been wanting to go give this place a try for a few weeks now.  I went for breakfast at 8:45 or so Saturday morning, there was no line.  I ordered a byob that's build your own biscuit not bring your own beer.  I went with jalapeño bacon and sausage, egg and cheddar cheese, I also tried the Brown Betty biscuits, plain biscuits with cinnamon sugar butter over them. Place your order at counter and take a seat, took me no more than 5 mins to receive my food, this was again with no line when I went, everything is made to order.  The egg on my biscuit was scrambled I expected it to be fried, I enjoy both so it wasn't an issue, fried would be a nice option and I'm sure if you asked they could accommodate you.  So first the savory biscuit, it was good overall but the biscuit itself was a bit dry and crumbly for my liking, although it did not fall apart while I was eating it.  All of the ingredients were fresh and hot, so hot in fact I couldn't take a bite for a minute or two.  The standout for me was the jalapeño bacon, it was slightly spicy and you could actually pick up the jalapeño flavor. I believe they use jimmy dean sausage which is ok but lacked flavor, I feel neese's is a much better local product.  Overall the biscuit is about 2/3 size of your typical fast food biscuit but packed with more fillings.  It was loaded with bacon and the egg and sausage both hung over the biscuit which is nice.  Ok second the Brown Betty biscuits, you get two biscuits served open face style with the cinnamon sugar buttery mixture. I could only eat one of these because I also had my savory biscuit listed above but they were very good, the sweet topping helped to hide the dry biscuit and was very delicious.  I did not get to try the cheese grits but I saw them and they looked good, I will try those next time.  I'm giving it 3.5  because while the food was good there is room for improvement, but I love the location, the decor is nice inside, service was great!  I don't know if the biscuits will change at all but I will be back to see and I look forward to trying the pizza and I will leave a separate review for that."}
{"text":"First I called. Friendly voice stated what the specials are. So I came down and had the house salad that was big and the pork n pepper sandwich. I'm definitely coming back for some wings."}
{"text":"Food is delicious and staff is very friendly but the cost is outrageous. My husband and I ate here and ordered 1 soda, bruschetta, 12 wings and a small pizza to share. The bill was almost $40 and that's without the tip. We can't afford to eat that expensive. Sorry"}
{"text":"I got a pepperoni pizza, and my friend got a salad...her salad looked food, and mine was pretty average. We waited an hour and a half for our meals and the service was pretty poor. This was after we had to wait 10 for a table to be cleaned off to sit at. Good food and nice staff but definitely needs more people and attention. I was on lunch from jury duty and by the time the food came, I only got to eat 1 slice and had to go back hungry ....also it was $16 for a pepp. pizza and drink... which is crazzzy to me! Thats like more then uptown Charlotte prices! But overall, decent food and clean place!"}
{"text":"Food choices are good but add ons are a bit expensive most pizza and Stromboli's  come plain, if you want to add lettuce or tomato it is an additional dollar each? At least some options are usually free or a certain number are included at other establishments. A small pepperoni pizza runs $15? I was also disappointed that they would not split my wing order into 2 flavors. Not very accommodating from a customer perspective. We got a salad, a small cheese pizza with no toppings and a cheese Stromboli with 2 veggie toppings with 2 drinks and a water and it was 42.00 before tip for a family of 3 (including one under 10yrs old). Decent portions and high quality ingredients were definitely used  Food was extremely delicious and satisfying. But prices were a bit high especially for the area. I am sure we will be back but it will be planned, and not sporadic, wish nothing but the best food and service was great."}
{"text":"While the staff is friendly, we have never received our food - a meatball sandwich and a ABLT sub - after a 30+ minute wait. There was still no estimated time for our food by the time we decided to leave."}
{"text":"Very nice staff, yummy cheesy grits, wish we could have rated the lovely biscuit menu, but we were late.  Maybe next time.  Pizza menu is huge, seems like you could find anything you wanted."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! Artichoke and olive salad was large and fresh. Meatballs were heavenly and wonderful with tomato basil chips. Jalapeño bacon on hoagie was spicy and flavorful. Service was fast and friendly."}
