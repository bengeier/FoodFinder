{"text":"If you're originally from Vegas, you might like it but if you come from a city where a large Vietnamese resides. This pho isn't good. Too much sodium in the soup. Really nothing about this place besides it being open late."}
{"text":"Horrible service.  Very disorganized and dirty.  We ordered pho and it took 35 minutes to bring the food."}
{"text":"If I could give them 0 stars I would. Service was awful, the pho soup wasn't even hot. Flavoring was plain. Don't waste your time or money here!"}
{"text":"The service is bad. I waited for 45 minutes with my family, and they forgot to place my order."}
{"text":"Best pho tai and egg rolls in Las Vegas. Service is decent but food is excellent, and that's all that matters."}
{"text":"Walking into the restaurant, my mom and I exchange a few words. \"Gee, it's dirty\". But a little grime never scared us off before. In fact, it's often joked that it's a good thing. The rest of our relatives are already there awaiting us, and so we quickly order our food, which arrives quickly via Hispanic servers who can say \"Pho Tai\" better than Hubby can.

My Pho' Tai Sach (rare steak with tripe pho') is average. What can I say, it's Vegas. The broth is a bit on the oily side but had a good flavor, and the noodles and meat are alright. My hubby liked his Pho' Dac Biet. 

My aunt suggested we order their Pho' Xao Thap Cam, which basically translates to \"assorted fried pho'\". This was a very interesting dish. The pho' noodles are fried to create a crunchy, chewy pancake layer on which an assortment of seafood, meats, and vegetables are placed on, and the whole thing is topped off with a sweet gravy reminiscent of Thai rad nah gravy. It wasn't out of this world, but it was pretty good. 

My cousin's verdict on his Bun Bo Hue (Hue beef noodle soup): good. 

I didn't think the Che Suong Sa Hot Luu (a Vietnamese dessert of agar and tapioca in coconut milk) was very good, as it was sparse on pretty much everything, but Hubby liked his Ca Phe Sua Da (Vietnamese Iced Coffee), which I noticed came out already in the glass.

Pho' So 1 means \"Pho' Number 1\", but I'd have to disagree when I think of all the pho' restaurants I've eaten at in SoCal. But because the food and prices are ok, this restaurant will be my go to Vietnamese restaurant for now in Vegas until we try out a few other ones there in the city. 

Lots of photos and full review on my blog."}
{"text":"My husband and I come here when we want our Pho fix... The prices are reasonable and the wait staff are very helpful. The atmosphere is casual and the place is clean. Most important tho.... The food is delicious!!"}
{"text":"When it comes to Pho in Vegas...look no further. You will not find any better Pho even on the strip."}
{"text":"Came at 10:15 PM, my wife ordered a chicken and rice dish and I ordered a soup. Her food came in 5 minutes and I waited for the next 30 minutes thinking that it will come the next minute. Finally went up to the counter where they have the debit machine and found out they forgot it. Never got an apology from neither the waiter nor the person who billed me and adding insult to injury, they had an \"eat our crap and get lost\" attitude."}
{"text":"Huge portions , service is great, overall perfect place to eat when you're hung over in Vegas"}
{"text":"Pho So 1 is located in Las Vegas' Chinatown district where there is gang load of Pho, Korean BBQ, and Japanese joints.  How did we pick this one?  We didn't really, it was based on a recommendation.  Recommendations are always good.

It's not the cleanest Pho joint but it's good enough.  Service is pretty friendly and fast so no complaints there.  The pho is a little less than 7 bucks and they only offer one size (about the size of a small/medium when compared to the ones in SF).  The rare steak and flank pho was good.  The broth was flavorful and had a good amount of noodles.  The meat was fattier than my liking but it was fine. 

It's nice to get away from the hustle and bustle of the strip and try something else besides the food that is offered on the strip.  The cab ride cost a little over $20 round trip but was worth it.  The strip food good can get boring after a while."}
{"text":"I typically order #10 whenever I go here for their special combo pho. First time I had this, I was amazed by the amount of meat they put in here. The broth-noodle proportion was just right on the spot with the extra meat, you can never go wrong. (:

I do love the fact that they are open until 3:00 am every night!"}
{"text":"Pho so 1 use to be my favorite place for vietnamese food, I remember coming here every week for years and years. I have to admit the food here still taste great but the service is aweful. They have a sign that says\" please wait to be seated\" so i would stand next to the sign for like 10 freaken mins while everyone and there mom would just cut me lolz DU MA! Anywayse once you are seated, it takes another 10 mins for them to come get your order lolz.  I understand that sometimes its BUSY, but not freaken every time haha. Anywayse the food here is still great but it's not worth the wait ."}
{"text":"Food are okay!! Staff are okay!! i hope that the staff are more attentive!! Everytime we come back their customer service is improving!"}
{"text":"pho was just okay

I was surprised the bun bo hue had actual pork blood in it...most restaurants take this out so it doesn't freak out the non-Viet crowd"}
{"text":"Heard this is some of the best local phó in vegas. 

Its location was in a not to crowded place plenty of parking unlike the rest of the phó places down the street in the little saigon shopping center.

upon entering the restaurant the smell phó broth and marinated beef hit you. The sound of clattering plates and glass cups chattering fills your ears. A sign of a good restaurant if you ask me. 

I ordered the pho dac biet with added meatball. The soup came less than 10 mins. Deff a good bowl of pho, i have no complaints."}
{"text":"Delicious and fresh, always keeping an eye out for good Vietnamese food! A few different Knox of spring rolls, even one you can make at your own table. Bun was delicious too.. Picture is of what was left, nothing!"}
{"text":"After cruising the strip of Las Vegas, we were famished and ready for dinner. To beat the chilly and cold air of the night, my brother suggested pho. Being a person who's always looking for a good soup concoction to satisfy my hunger, I did not object.
As we entered, a server greeted us and brought us to a table. We stuck with the basic Vietnamese favorites and ordered pho, egg and shrimp rolls. The fried egg rolls came with plenty of vegetables which is always a plus especially the daikon, carrots and cucumbers. The vinegar sauce which I usually enjoy was very tasty as well. When our pho were served, it came with plenty of bean sprouts, mints and limes as well. The broth was very tasty and full of flavor but was warm instead of piping hot. The meat in my pho did not really cook well as a result of the warm broth. Nevertheless, I finished my pho with much gusto. Service wasn't as great but okay. I remember my brother asking for more napkins but his request was not given until about 10-15 minutes later after he asked.

My experience with this restaurant was pretty pleasurable and I think I'll be back again when given the chance."}
{"text":"Wow. What bad customer service! Not even a hello when we came in. Nobody had a smile on his or her face,  from waiter to owner/cashier. The ph was less than decent. My cousin could not finish his bowl. When we paid,  the change was thrown onto the counter instead of handing it to us."}
{"text":"My name is Gavin. I am a pho-a-holic. Let my share my story. 

I am a weekly regular here at Pho So1 for a reason! Having tried many pho places in LV, I keep coming back to this one for one thing...THE SOUP. This is the hands down best pho in Vegas. No questions. It's food crack, really. I just can't get enough. The broth has mystical powers and calls to me at strange times, begging for my return. The noodles and meat mingle in the bath of harmonious flavor and never fail to make me mmmmmmmm. Always order the Dac Biet #10 if you're really hungry or 14 if you're just normal. Tender brisket, delicious flank, melty chewy tendon and tripe if you want it. It's heaven in a bowl, baby. It'll cure what ails ya. Thank you Pho So1, for making me an addict.

Only words of wisdom, avoid the lunch rush on the weekend especially and order quickly.. Some days they get crazy busy and service suffers. Still, I love em to death."}
{"text":"The waitress or server was very rude and impatience. I would not eat here again. They also forget some of my order."}
{"text":"The lady at the bar acts like she is doing you a favor by being there.
Very rude when I went to pay the bill.
For the first 15 minutes I was there she was on the phone talking loudly not conducive to a relaxing meal.
The soup was greasy for beef pho.  For $10.00 it was not appetizing at all.
I will not go back.  This is the first and only poor review I have written."}
{"text":"The service is 4 stars and the food is 3 stars.
Came here twice after after a couple of nights of drinking and each time I had the Pho Ga, chicken noodle soup. Even though I had been drinking, I can still tell you that the Pho Ga was pretty good. The broth was not greasy and there was a generous amount of chicken that was given was not dry.  I am giving the staff 4 stars because I can't imagine how many drunk people come in to this restaurant and just give them a hard time. DRUNKS! No I was not one them. I am a happy drunk. It says a lot if I can say that there Pho Ga is comparable to the Pho Ga in the SF. The prices for their dishes are average, not too pricey. I also thought this restaurant was pretty clean. Good place to have a late night dinner after a night of partying, even though it's a way from the strip, but I suppose that can be appealing for some people."}
{"text":"Pho so 1 is my go to place for my crazy pho cravings! I am always willing to drive out of my way to come here. I get off work late and they are open even later. The staff is great and on point. I have never had a bad experience and I will continue to come here. I am usually always the only white person there and I love it."}
{"text":"This place Phokin stinks... Bad odor in the restaurant.  Service is bad! Staff makes you feel  pressured to get out. Food was not great... I'll  never  come back"}
{"text":"Pretty decent pho and service is nice and attentive.  There is an absurd amount of MSG in their ingredients.  I've gone 2 times and both times have gotten severe headaches.  I don't have the same issue at other pho restaurants.  This place would be amazing without the MSG."}
{"text":"Been here several times in the past.  Whenever we come to visit Las Vegas from Los Angeles, we would go here for lunch.   However, we recently tried their Pho and it is not the same. They either lost the original cook or changed their recipe because it tasted terrible. I am Viet, in an LA area, I know good Pho when I taste it. Must find a new Pho place in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Pho is the perfect breakfast for the morning after.  Love the fact that they open at 9:00 a.m.  In fact, I suspect they open earlier than that, because when we arrived at 9:00 a.m., there were 2-3 tables of families already eating."}
{"text":"1.   server walked  when we were still talking to her. 
2.   it took over 30 mins to get  the soup after order.
3.   After we done, we went to pay,  the  owner refuse  to show  the bill,  after 15 mins conversation  with the owner. finally  we got  our bill, and we found out the owner secretly over charged us $10. AND THE OWNER SAID: ITS NOT MY BAD, ITS MACHINES PROBLEM. 

THERES A LOT OF PHO RESTAURANTS IN CALGARY, 
DO NOT COME TO THIS ONE."}
{"text":"I should have walked out upon seeing a roach in the woman's bathroom but I was with a large party and didn't have that type of influence on them.  So I went ahead and placed my order, the vegetable pho.  The pho tasted okay.  I've had better, I've had worse.  My rating for the pho is 3 stars.  

The table next to use ordered something that required them to bbq at their table.  This restaurant has absolutely no ventilation system that gives them the right to allow bbq-ing at your table.  The smoke was trapped in the restaurant making your eyes hurt and difficult to breath.  When I mentioned this to the cashier, he acknowledged the lack of ventilation and apologized.  I got the impression that they are aware of  this issue but aren't interested in making any changes.  

After factoring in the roach and the lack of ventilation, they are down to 1 star.  Would give a 0 star if that was possible."}
{"text":"Very good food. Even better service. Clean, quick and good. We took a taxi from the strip, it was raining, we couldn't get a cab back. We were stuck there. The manager noticed we were just kind of stranded, standing in front of the restaurant. She came and asked if she could help. We told her the situation, she herself tried calling us a taxi to no avail. She had a bus boy give us a ride at that point. What amazing costumer service that was! Thank you!!"}
{"text":"For the most part the food is good. Service needs a lot of work besides that fact it has the best Pho in town. We sat down today and no greeting from any waiters or waitresses. The waitress gave us napkins along with a used one that has lipstick marks all over it. Don't see language as a barrier since they all can speak and understand English pretty good. We still come back for food but don't bother saying thank you cause they won't acknowledge it."}
{"text":"Great food but one of their servers is really rude from the start to beginning. I had forgotten to ask for cooked bean sprout and was afraid because of the first impression so I decided to ask one of his coworkers. He came by to our table and asked if we were the one who asked for the cooked bean sprout and then told us he got yelled at for it thank you and gave us a  two thumbs up and proceeded to leave the table. We ended up not getting the cooked bean sprouts and didnt want to ask. The guy is about 5'5 skinny dark brown hair
 with bangs swept to the right. The coworker was lovely she had a piercing on her right short hair and average height."}
{"text":"Best pho in Vegas! I have been coming here since I was a kid and their eggrolls are by far the best. Always fresh and hot and not small skinny ones like you get at most pho restaurants. 

The pho is always good and the broth is the best I've had. The pork chops are yummy as well, but you have to have the eggrolls! I highly recommend this place for a good bowl oh pho, even late at night since they're open really late. Perfect late night snack!"}
{"text":"Fast service, best pho around area. Don't even bother with Jenni Pho, service there is really slow."}
{"text":"This place is not going to impress you by it's looks.  It stands on it's food alone.  If you want something that'll make you cry because of how good it is, and at the same time make you scream because of how spicy hot it is (if you decide to be a hero and eat the chili) this place is for you.  They also have non-screaming dishes.

I've been visiting and ordering delivery from this place for about a year now.  It's among a bunch of other Vietnamese restaurants, but I choose this place always because they're close and super consistent and really good.

My favorite is the 15a which is the seafood pho.  It's always really good and way more than I can finish if I get the extra large, and I can eat a ton of food.

They always over estimate how long the food will take.  They usually say it'll be an hour and it's at my door in 30 minutes which makes me really happy.  Also, when you're at the restaurant the food is on the table in like 10 minutes.  It's always super fast.

Go here because it's tasty and you will love it."}
{"text":"I don't know what it was but when I ordered and my food brought to me everything was good but as I continued with my meal I became more and more unimpressed, and kinda grossed out...the flavour just was not for me."}
{"text":"It was very busy when I visited this place during lunch time. Pho soup was too salty to finish the whole thing. Vermicelli was OK, but I didn't  care for their sour sauce. It was a bit too sour for me. Spring rolls are good except for the fact that the peanut sauce was too watery for my taste. The price is reasonable. The service was not impressive."}
{"text":"Great Pho!  As a credible Pho expert recently explained to me, this is one of the two best places for Pho in Vegas.  Said Pho expert also explained that Pho is typically a breakfast item in Vietnam, so it's warm and filling, but not super heavy such that the rest of the day is shot, i.e., nap time!  That's particularly ideal for lunch time during the work week.  (Napping under your desk while boss passes by = bad news bears!) 

Apparently, this place uses less cinnamon and ginger in the Pho, so it's less \"spicy.\"  That's fine by me, as I am not a fan of really spicy dishes.  (I spend more time drinking water than enjoying the food.)  Nonetheless, I still threw in a couple slices of  jalapeños into the soup for a slight kick.     

The portion sizes are hearty, and the ingredients are really fresh.  My fav is the rare beef and flank steak, although I've heard the brisket is also good.   

Also, try the fried rolls (ch giò) -- they're delicious!"}
{"text":"This is a cool spot to come to when its late and you craving some pho.... But today was a bad nasty experience. ... We came in as usual but this time we came in with a friend recommending the place and well we ordered our food came then i saw it. A snail on my plate in my food alive !!!!!! That was nasty and all they dis was remove the plate and broght me back a side dish ..... I wasnt satified at all and i actually liked this spot but after this.... Yeah good bye"}
{"text":"WORSE bowl of pho in Vegas. I ordered the rare beef pho. It came out lukewarm, so the broth wasn't hot enough to lightly cook the rare beef like it was supposed to. The blood from the rare meat started to run and coagulate, and made my broth so unappetizing that I lost my appetite.

This wasn't a one time thing. Last time there a few months ago, although all four people in my party ordered different kinds of pho, all bowls were bathwater temp.

I asked the supervisor at cash register about the lukewarm pho. He said the kitchen didn't put enough hot broth and next time to ask the server to take my bowl back for more broth. This is just sheer laziness...

The reason pho broth isn't hot is because they didn't heat up the noodles first, and didn't put enough broth to bring all other items to temperature. If the name of your restaurant literally means \"Number 1 Pho\", they should make sure that every single pho bowl that goes out of the kitchen is steaming hot, every single time, instead of relying on customers to ask them to heat it up a bit.

The only reason we go here is because of the DIY grill (#80, they bring out everything and you cook the meat at your table). 

The staff is non-Asian but they know the menu and the wide variety of sauces well, so I was impressed with that."}
{"text":"Shitty service.. Just want to call it how it is... First they got me sitting here in the coldest part of the restaurant... Then their tea taste like fuckin perfume... But u wanna know what really pissed me off? the fact that they gave me cold pho.. Like are u fucking kidding me?? It's already 34 degrees outside.. 

Not to mention my girlfriend ordered crispy noodle thing.. & didn't even get her food til after my other girlfriend was done with her pho.. Talk about bullshit... In the end It gave us a good laugh tho.. lol"}
{"text":"I went to a new pho place last night and it was great!  Pho So 1 is great and to be truthfully honest I don't remember everything we had but I do remember that everything we did have was excellent!! We had some regular pho and a couple dishes that we shared (one was like a garlic beef dish and one was beef and vegetables and beef over yellow noodles).  Overall it was a great experience and I will definately go again!!"}
{"text":"YUM!!!  Love #39 and #2.  Place needs better air conditioning."}
{"text":"Best place for pho.we are regulars here! We like tocome very late at night after work. They are very friendly, have great prices, and delicious food."}
{"text":"Love me some spring rolls there. Great place to take a date for an ice breaker while trying to make the rolls. Lol"}
{"text":"This place used to be amazing but maybe they have new owners now, it has gone down hill! I ordered a pick up of rare beef satay an I agree with some of the previous posts that the older lady that gave me my order was miserable. When I got home I noticed they didn't include any of the satay spices and the broth was bland. Also, the meat (in the past pink and fresh) was a dark brown color, yuck. 
When I phoned to inform them of their mistake on leaving out the spices the lady argued with me and then hung up on me! Seemed like as soon as she got my money I didn't matter anymore. What kind of customer service is that?
I will not be back!"}
{"text":"This place is best for Pho and Bo Nuong Vi or Grilled Beef. I have been eating in this establishing for 21 years. The food is very consistent, sumptuous portion and mouth-watering flavor. The servers are very nice and their foods come out real quick. Everyday is a Pho day and every night is Grilled Beef night. You can tell by the lines of people during lunch rush hour or dinner rush hour. For appetizer, I had eggroll. The eggroll is really authentic with all the exotic spice that should come with it. The stuffing is moist and yummy. I could tell there is a lot of pork and some exotic ingredient. For main course, I had Pho. I recall whenever I finished a bowl of Pho at Pho So 1, there was always some meat left. This means they really put lots of meat to enhance the flavor and the taste and at the same time fulfill our stomach. It is the best place for Vietnamese food and the best bang for the buck in my opinion."}
{"text":"My place to go for the best pho!
Great atmosphere super friendly staff. The owner was very nice noticing my beer taste and recommended his Golden Monkey which was great!
They have great selection in beers! Come try them out!"}
{"text":"best pho in town :) i've tried pho kim long and pho saigon 8 but i always come back here! egg rolls, spring rolls, beef salad, pho, mi/hu tieu (flat noodle/egg noodle soup), french coffee, soda chanh (lemonade), and thit bo nuong (the beef you grill at your table) is all very very good. not as good as home cooking though :/"}
{"text":"This place has faster and better service than Pho Kinh Do and Nem Nuong. They provide a good portion of meat in their beef noodle soup compared to other restaurants. The place is quite packed but they have enough staff that you can get faster service than other Pho places. 

Recommend: Rib eye Pho yummm!!"}
{"text":"First of all, this place is filthy. So filthy that one would wish for the lighting you would find in an opium den of stygian ambience. The oil is so thick in the air and on the furnishings that (excuse me if you've heard this one before...) Exxon Valdez: the Sequel could happen at any moment if someone were to create a flicker or spark.

The food is mediocre (rough rib-eye, oily soup and vegetables anachronistic to our age), the prices fair (that's where the one star comes from) and the service non-existent. Okay, that was a hyperbole, as they brought me food and took my order prior, but nonetheless, I felt like I was in a certain Ralph Ellison novel minus the violent urge to stuff a waitstaff in my chimney. Seriously, I was treated like a negro during the antebellum South. Alas, I resist the urge to play the race card here, as I am black, and felt they treated everyone with the same disservice and surly attitudes.

This place is, how do you say, you know, not Sunni, but..."}
{"text":"This is the worst phõ I have ever eaten ,don't know if this is a particular busy day before the new year but the broth is tasteless ,the meat portion is reasonable but overall deserve a one star."}
{"text":"Tried their rice vermicelli (chicken) with spring rolls for the first time tonight.  The food was excellent - best I've had in a long time.  The meat had a nice flavour and spiciness to it that was very enjoyable.  The peanuts were chopped nicely (not crumbs like at some other places).   Everything tasted really delicious.  Will definitely be back.  The only reason i didn't give a 5 star rating is because this is the only thing I've tried there so want more experiences there before I give a 5."}
{"text":"Spent the past weekend in Vegas and had to stop off to get some Pho. I remember visiting this location a few years back and that the food was reall to do. However, when I visited this time it was just wasn't to my expectation. We were seated fairly promptly, received our waters and then eventually got to order food. The waiter delivered our water and once I finished it it took a while before I was recognized and I had to ask the waiter directly for more. 

I ended up ordering the Pho Dac Biet Xe Lua and it just seemed like the meat was pre packed and thrown on. We ate, finished up and say there for a minute before going to the register to pay. Overall the experience just wasn't very appealing. Perhaps next time I visit it will be different."}
{"text":"As for Vietnamese Noodle Houses, this one only one I've ever been to that beats my mom's homemade Pho. Definitely worth the trek off the strip,  if you can make it in right before one as that's when the Pho tastes best. (OPEN til 3AM too!)

Vietnamese iced coffee for $3 is superb.

It can get super smokey if a lot of people have ordered bbq food at their table.

Otherwise a great place for a quick bite in Las Vegas Chinatown. I will be back here on my next Vegas trip."}
{"text":"What I love about this place is the reasonable price for the food. Vermicelli tends to be a hit or miss, but the Pho is amazing and tastes very good. The portions are great and staff are friendly. What I don't like about this place is the service :( ... The awful food/utensils kart that makes a loud noise as it carries the food around the large restaurant... Not to mention that the staff won't take away the dishes that are you done with so it just sits there. Overall good Pho but the place feels under staffed :("}
{"text":"This is the main place I go for authentic vietnamese. The people are nice and pretty fast service sometime when they are not slam.  The food is very good at a very reasonable price. Its a very relaxing atmosphere restaurant."}
{"text":"Never been disappointed here.  I flip flop back and forth between the pho (soup) and vermicelli noodle dishes.  The pho is offered in 3 sizes to suit your hunger appetite, not always offered at other Vietnamese restaurants.  The service is always fast and never a problem finding a seat."}
{"text":"Very bad service. Had hair in the pho, and messed up our orders. The pho itself was not good. My family used to come here every time they visit Vegas but this was my first (and last!) time and I am not the least bit impressed. Will not be coming back. You can give it a try if you want to eat in an old and dirty restaurant where the food isn't good and your requests are outright ignored."}
{"text":"I like to get pho here after drinking. Whether take out or eat in, it's good. It's good when I'm sober as well. The one problem I've noticed is the peanut sauce for the spring rolls always seems watered down."}
{"text":"This is the best place to go for pho and to make your own spring rolls. This is my husband & I's favorite place to get pho when we are craving it and my family didn't make it home made. The broth is on point, there is plenty of noodles and lots of meat! They never skimp out on pho. I don't know any other place where you can make your own spring roll other than home, so this place is so far the best. Fresh meat, vegetables, vermicelli noodles, and rice paper to put in hot water. Cool experience if you've never tried. 

++ they give you free hot tea"}
{"text":"I will never come back to this restaurant again. The worst service I've ever experienced.  Watch out for being overcharged on your bill."}
{"text":"Worst restaurant I've ever been to. I'd recommend you go to the other nearby pho restaurants if you want decent food and service, because they lack both. For starters, I'm Vietnamese so I've been to numerous pho shops, but this is the first time there wasn't a vegetarian menu (a lot of Vietnamese people are Buddhist and follow a vegetarian diet, that's why there is always a separate menu). I would've left, but I was accompanied by 3 others that were hangry because we've been on the road for 8 hours. I politely asked if there was any way of taking meat out of a dish, and the most condescending and snobbish attitude came from our waiter. We finally settled that I could have stir fried veggies and tofu with rice, which I was thankful for. My friend ordered hot tea and got tap water with a lime slice in it.. in a plastic cup. What even? When we got our food, everything tasted terrible and not even mediocre at best. None of us finished our food. 

They didn't tell us to pay up front so when we asked for a check, we got attitude for it and then directed to the front counter. At the front counter was another rude man-child that had an equally condescending and snobbish attitude, if not worst than the waiter. He said he genuinely wanted to know about our experience. I perked up at this because I thought he was the only sincere person attending to us that night, but when we asked about why the tea was not tea, he (rudely) said it was because it was a free service, which I've never heard of- rather than giving us water with a lime slice in it when we order tea, why don't you just give us tea? We then asked why the waiter never came back to check up on us after giving us our food, then he prided himself in saying that he was an \"asshole\" like the waiter and that I should work here too, implying that I was also an asshole. 

TL;DR all of the employees need an attitude change or to find a different place to work that doesn't involve customer service, and work on making your pho taste better and not so watered down (in my case, you don't need to compensate tofu, rice, and veggies with 10lbs of salt)."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday night at around 10 pm and we were surprised to find this place jumping with activity. You sign your party in at the podium in front and wait to be seated, which only took around 5 minutes as they were cleaning off tables. We informed the server that it was our first time there and he didn't really say too much, so we ordered some jasmine tea and Vietnamese egg rolls as we were still deciding what we wanted for main dishes. The egg rolls come on a plate full of different greens and some julienne carrots.  As earlier stated, the place was jumping and our server was kind of running around, so we asked the guy who brought out the rolls how to eat them incorporating the greens. He said that you more or less make egg roll wraps, using the assorted greens and some provided sweet n sour sauce. My wife loved the taste of the wrap, but I preferred the egg roll just as it was with the sauce and some chili oil. After around 20 minutes or so, our server returned to take our order. Once again we mentioned that it was our first time, and he then proceeded to give us some suggestions from the menu. I ordered the #10 pho, which was a noodle soup with different types of beef. My wife ordered the #29, an udon noodle soup with pork and shrimp. I also ordered another side of noodles and a side order of grilled pork. After a short wait, we were served big bowls of piping hot noodle soup, along with our sides. In one word....YUM!! The soups were outstanding and the grilled pork was excellent!  The soups were accompanied by a plate of bean spouts, lime, thinly sliced jalapeños, and a few fresh herbs. I would highly recommend this place to anyone looking for some inexpensive authentic Vietnamese pho. I only give it a 4 because it is a bit loud, the service was a tad slow, and the jasmine tea was unsweetened (expected it to be honey sweetened like other places).  Other than that, it's cheap, open until 3am, and it's delicious!! Happy dining everyone!!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pho restaurant! MY FAVORITE. It doesn't matter if you get pho, egg rolls, pork chops, vermicelli bowls, or whatever else here because it's all delicious. Your order is taken without much of a wait after you're seated, and the food comes out hot really quickly. Customer service isn't top notch, but then again, you're in Chinatown... What else did you expect?"}
{"text":"i give 3 stars not because of the food, which i think it's really good.
but because of the lady server they have.
she's so rude not only once but everytime i go there.
the last time i went there i ordered a salad (i dont remember the name, but is really good) it has raw meat that is only cooked with the acidity of the ingredients they put in it (like a tartare). the lady told me i wouldnt like it, because white people dont like it!! i said, well i had it before and i like it, even if i dont like it i would pay for it. when my order came SHE GAVE ME ANOTHER SALAD, and told me i would like it better!
what is wrong with her? she's rude to us all the time!
on the other hand the bussers are really friendly! 
the pho, excellent!
and number 53 is soooooooo good!"}
{"text":"I always go here when I visit Las Vegas and the Pho is always good but the last time my waiter was ruder than usual but what do you expect in Chinatown. I'd go here again of course but I'll have to try other places since their are many in that location."}
{"text":"I  came here for dinner on 5/26 with my guy and came back the following week on a Monday. I normally get the same things every time I come here.I got a number #54 on the 5/26 visit and the guy got a large Pho tai. As usual, the food was excellent and the service was...eh..ok i guess. Its getting better though I guess. What I don't like that they do here quite often is that the Pho comes out right away while the other food takes a little longer. So I ended up waiting while the guy ate his Pho(so it doesn't get cold). The same thing happened the following visit, except I ordered Pho and he got the #54. I knew this was going to happen so I asked for an extra bowl so we could both eat while we waited for his order..and sure enough, we waited..and waited. By the time he got his food, I was already almost done w my soup. 

Regardless of the needed improvement in service,I still believe that this place offers the best Pho in town...and a number 54. I've been loyal to this place for years and will remain loyal to it unless the food becomes horrible and the service gets worse. Until then, I will be coming back!"}
{"text":"WORSE service. The ladies were rude and they didn't even bother offering water or anything. Put a basket full of spoons right beside my food and started cleaning them in front of me while I was eating. It was unbelievable because she could've just done that on the other free tableS. When I was paying for my food, she didn't even look at me in the eyes nor thanked me. Not coming back here EVER."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Bbq Vietnamese style (beef, shrimp and squid). 5 stars for service. We are greeted at the door by the owner and got our drinks within 2 mins. 
It was the very good experience that we can made the bbq rolls by ourself and the sauce is awesome. 
The waiters are very friendly and always ask if we need something more. 
I will come back for Vietnamese foods with my friends and family whenever we are back to Vegas. :)"}
{"text":"I used to go there every week but every time I go there there is bubble on the soup it looks like they didn't rinse enough the dishes and my girlfriend had cockroach legs in her mouth when she ate spring roll.
it was a disaster they said we don't have to pay but no apologize.
the other day I had a diarrhea right after I ate pho. 
since then, we don't go there unless it's past mid night bc all the other pho places are closed. I'm sorry but no more cockroach."}
{"text":"when I head out to Vegas I get the urge of eating some Asian after hitting up greasy buffet for few days idk I guess call me Asian because I'm feeling some Asian food.

Anyways this use to be my go to viet place whenever I'm feeling some pho and rice plates been hitting this place up back and forth for over 10 years and one thing I realize about this place is they're starting to skimp on the portion size and its get smaller while the price gets more expensive.
I ordered a pork chop with egg loaf on rice 
they didn't have any more egg loaf and decided to still charge me regular price without it. 


1. service sucks balls

2. food is mediocre but is decent for being in Vegas 

3. kinda pricy and portion is small as heck. 

4. crowded if you don't go early
conclusion...


sad to see how this place start skimping on portion when they got bigger. 

take word of advice don't skimp on Asian they know the portion size"}
{"text":"This place is always busy. The service is pretty fast but they dont have good service. I ordered combination Pho as I always get. It tasted ok but after I finished I got so thirsty. i think they use MSG. I think they use MSG more than other Pho restaurant. 
I will not come back here since there are many other Pho restaurant near by."}
{"text":"It was definitely authentic to the food I ate traveling in Vietnam. The Pho was spot on. The spring rolls were pretty close to how I remember them but then again no two spring rolls are cooked the same in Vietnam. The Vietnamese coffee was great, it even included the slow percolator. By the time I finished the large bowl of pho the coffee was finished percolating. Delicious!"}
{"text":"For Rice and Vermicelli bowl dishes, pretty good! Generous portion sizes. However their Pho is on the salty side. The salt overpowered  the other flavors in the broth, which was unfortunate."}
{"text":"This is the worst vietnamese restaurant    I've been to. When I first entered, there was about 4 different people that came up to me and asked if I was ready to order in a spam of 5 mins. It was my first time here so i was still looking at the menu. I felt so pressured to order and when I ordered an appetizer the old lady was like, is that all? I said this is just an appetizer and she walked away with a mean face without saying a word. After getting the food it was cold and wasn't even close to being as good as any other vietnamese restaurant. Bad service and bad food, i would pass."}
{"text":"Well two days later and I am still sick from food poisoning.  I came from all the positive reviews  as I have just moved from Hawaii. It was the last meal I have had in three days.  I had #12 with added beef balls.  All my sides looked recycled and soup had a strong lime taste.  Needless to say I will not be back."}
{"text":"Mister Tien is a great host. We had a very good meal, The vegetables were the best. We certainly go back when we are in Vegas.. We recommendid it to our friends
Bert de bles from Holland"}
{"text":"Been here a good amount of times for me not to return. The broth is never hot enough in the pho and the floor is always dirty with food. Pretty gross. 

If this was in Orange County, they'll be out of business cause they can't compete with the big doggies."}
{"text":"Inconsistent. I eat here quite often but I have to admit their food are very inconsistent. Whenever I go here, I just have to hope I get a good chef today. Soemtimes your pho will be pack with flavor and meat, but on some days, it will be lacking. Their egg rolls are amazing though and their grilled pork is delicious. I also love to get the spicy chicken with rice but its VERY inconsistent too."}
{"text":"Probably the best pho place I've had in vegas, but not the best I've ever had, I reserve that for the city of santa ana in ca. The portion size is good, but I wish they offered larger pho portions. I usually order extra noodles in which they bring a small kids bowl filled with noodles and broth that you can add to your bowl when you have room. Service is quick but like most asian restaurants, you need to be aggressive to get the servers attention."}
{"text":"Pho So 1 is okay. The pho soup is good, but they don't give you enough meat. The spring rolls are a rip off. $4.00 dollars for 2 spring rolls is robbery! The pho is decent but Pho So 1 is raising its prices. Sometimes though Pho So 1 is hit or miss. Sometimes you get great pho, and sometimes you get what seems like leftover pho from the last night. The one great thing here is the Vietnamese BBQ . It's called (Bo-Nuong-Yi). If you are willing to spend like 30-40 dollars for each person to get full, the Vietnamese BBQ is the bomb!"}
{"text":"First time to eat at this restaurant 1/25.11@ 11:55pm. Food is good, but what a turn off when the owner/ manager let guests with a  dog eat on the plate and run around the restaurant.."}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot more often than I used to, and I'm not sure if it's because I never appreciated food as much as I do now, but it's degraded.

I always order #44 - the beef with soft or crispy rice noodle - and it's normally very good and filling, but they changed the method of cooking for the noodle. Before, ordering soft noodle would yield a sort of fried pancake that was softened by the sauce poured over the entire dish, but now it's actually just soft rice noodle. Hoping I could find the same consistency in the noodle, I previously opted for the crispy choice, but that's actually just a cluster of fried noodles.

The spring rolls are still good - my brother's favorite - and the rice dishes are delicious, but the overall quality of ingredients and the amount of ingredients used has degraded quite a bit.

I would recommend this place to a friend looking for a pho restaurant outside of Chinatown, especially since it's not as busy as it used to be. Usually, it's a good place for a reasonably-priced quick, casual lunch with friends."}
{"text":"I made a mistake with previous review , I just ordered something I was not familiar with , my fault . This is my favorite Vietnamese restaurant , very tasty food"}
{"text":"Always yummy food and prompt service. The theatre of people watching late night in this jount is priceless. Better than a show on the Strip."}
{"text":"We've coming to this place since 2004, and although food is always great, service sometimes is inconsistent. The owners know us and we get great treatment from them, but some of the waiters that are new have left a lot to desire. Another aspect they need to improve is cleanliness, specially in the restrooms. However, as long as they keep having the best Vietnamese food in town, we'll keep coming back!!!"}
{"text":"This place is really hit and miss. Unfortunately I have had enough misses that I will not be eating here any longer. 
The last time I ate here and had a vermicelli bowl I found that the chicken in my dinner had the texture and taste of being over microwaved. I guess the red flag would have been my dinner arriving about 2 minutes after I had ordered. Obviously if you come here out of the lunch/dinner rush hours they reheat pre made dishes. Yuck. 
There are many other more consistently delicious Vietnamese places around here to patronize so I will no longer be spending my money at Pho So 1."}
{"text":"Food is good, however when we got in, most tables aren't clean, there is no service at all, we need to go to the front desk to drop our orders. Ps: the washroom is gross"}
{"text":"good place to go out for late dinner.  Open till 3:00 AM.  Price little bit expensive than what I usually pay for Com thit nuong."}
{"text":"I don't do reviews but after what happened yesterday I had to do this. I ate here for many years and they seem to get worse as time gone by. Anyway all 5 of us order pho xe Lua and we all had diarrhea!! Within 10 minutes after the meal.  We think the soup was not hot enough which led to the meat not being fully cooked! Definitely not coming back anymore nor recommended!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is just OK.  They actually messed up on our order, but that's all right.  The place isn't too clean either, with the floor being unswept and food all over, but this is usually typically in Vietnamese restaurants.

The hours of the restaurant is a selling point.  This place is open until 3am.  Perfect place to go after the club.

Pho Ga (chicken noodle soup) at 2am!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I decided to try a new pho place in Vegas....or at least a different place than where we normally go but a name we were familiar with. 

Pho So 1 has a location in California located on Victory and Sepulveda blvd; and never have their quality ever disappointed me after many years of patronage.
So for the first time last night, we decided to switch gears and try Pho So 1 in Las Vegas from our usual Pho Kim Long.

Our expectations were that of what we were familiar with and accustomed to.
The place had all the right smells and the look typical of a Pho joint, I felt that this was going to be good.

My girlfriend ordered the grilled pork vermicelli and I ordered the pork chop and shredded pork with omelette dish.
Food arrived quick as it always usually does but already we were offput by the smell. There was something strange and we had noticed that in the menu as the menu items are different from their location in CA.
There was this smell coming from the food that just didn't seem right, which then led to the taste, then ultimately to how we felt after dinner.

I want to say that the pork items were probably bad for as I'm writing this review right now-my stomach is still feeling uneasy. My girlfriend felt the same way.

Her grilled pork vermicelli kinda had a lemongrass-like taste to it which we couldn't confirm if it was one of the ingredients used to flavor the pork, and as for mine it tasted something similar but more of pork that was spoiling. If you have ever left meat out or smelled spoiling meat then that is the picture in trying to paint for you in terms of taste and smell, it was not good and why I'm giving it a 1 star rating based solely on this experience.

We ended up eating what we could that wasn't meat, but by then we had felt that the meal was tainted and decided to just stop.
We still paid for our meal but it was truly not worth it as we would've been better off having McDonald's for dinner.

Ultimately it was my fault for wanting to venture out of the normal and breaking redundancy by going to a new place.
But had I not, I would've never had this experience to prove that once you've tried the best to just forget the rest.

I'll still go to Pho So 1 being that it's the CA location. But while in Vegas...I'll be going to its competitor."}
{"text":"We came here twice in the span of 4 days...  quite tasty and decently priced.  Sunday lunch was not too full but on Tuesday at noon- the place was packed!  We tried the pork chop combo plate, spring rolls, chicken with rice, and pork and shrimp udon bowl.    Everyone enjoyed the food including the kids.  The broth for my udon bowl was so good- never thought I'd be eating udon noodles in a pho place but just goes to show- anything goes in Vegas!  The service was meh... but as long as the food is good- we'll be back!"}
{"text":"OMG!!! I'll never go back to this place....just have a big fat fly in my bun Bo hue.  I showed it to them, they replaced it but no apology at all and even have a nerve to laugh at my boyfriend when he mentioned about the freaking fly and still charged us the full price...This place used to be one of our favorite restaurant in Vegas but that's it no more...and good luck to whoever is still their customer.  Mayb someday you could find a roach in your dish and they may charge extra for that too !!!!! I rate one star since yelp don't let me leave it blank!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has the best Pho in town, cheap hot and always good. I grab the #10 its the combination with tripe,tendon, rare flank, beef and sone other shit i forgot but its bomb!!!!"}
{"text":"I would give this place no stars if possible. Walked in and sat down at the only table available that was of course next to the kitchen. It was a Sunday and the only reason we came here was because pho kim was closed. No one said hello, offered tea or nothing everyone here is just miserable and it shows. Only one lady was kind and helpful. 

We ordered a rice and porkchop dish which was bland and basically just slapped on the plate. I'm not one to diss or give bad ratings but the service I received here today was the WORST SERVICE I'VE EVER RECEIVED IN MY LIFE. 

While we were at our table 3 people up and left. They would just offer to pay whatever appetizers they ordered. They take forever to make the food. They are very obviously under-staffed and money hungry! I bet they have one man back in that kitchen and they are probably on his ass with a whip. 

The tables were all dirty they gave us two super filthy and old cups of water which need to most definitely be discarded. And the cherry on top was when we finished our food and finally someone came out with our appetizer wings, which tasted like a dirty freezer. In all honesty, I will NOT be returning here. And it is a shame that they have such terrible service when they are located in such prime location."}
{"text":"very generous meat portions in pho soup dishes. everything was tasty. it was definitely an amazing meal to eat on a cold and rainy day. most places i eat pho at are more than $10 for a bowl with not as much meat so i was pleasantly surprised."}
{"text":"(All my life before 2016) My family and I use to come straight here from Los Angeles to start off our Las Vegas vacation. The pho use to be so big and fulfilling. Even though they were always busy, the waiters would always find a way to make a table for customers and take your order. This was before 2016....

(2016) We arrive here during a lunch rush at 1 pm. All tables were pact and super busy. We come in and we see all the waiters running around like a bunch of headless chickens. We sat ourselves at an empty table and we're ready to order. No one came by to take our order. I had to get up and go to the cashier to find a waiter to come take our order. We ordered and after a couple minutes, our pho came out. The pho was small and cold!! The rare meat they put in the pho didn't even cook and change color due to the temperature of the soup. We asked the waiter to give us a new bowl and he recommended he just microwave the bowl. All the noodles were not cooked and he meat impossible to eat. All our dishes were inedible. The only nice thing I can say about them was how fast and accurate they took our money for the bill.

They have lost a long loyal customer due to there terrible service and lousy food. Please be warned before coming here."}
{"text":"I don't know about this place. I have been here twice now, and both times nothing really \"stood out\". The staff I've encountered have all been quite surly, so don't be surprised if they roll their eyes at you when you ask for something besides tea. Though I will say they are efficient and are fast to bring you tea and menus, as well as take your order sheet.

The food came out fast (like 5 minutes after ordering fast). My pho had a very strange smell to it, almost like remnants of dish soap. The beef in it was also not rare as advertised. It was very tough and grey, which made me think that it had been microwaved. My brother got the Curry Shrimp on Rice. The shrimp were the tiniest shrimp I've ever seen in my life. Like the size of a fingernail small. They charge $12 for basically a bunch of rice and 6 tiny shrimp. Not impressed to say the least! 

I will say the place is clean and the older lady who is the cashier is very nice. But I just don't know if that is enough to bring me back here. Maybe I will give it one more chance, but for now I'm undecided."}
{"text":"Cheap  and good pho! 

They have a good pho! Authentic taste, really good broth, and large portions!

And their Bun Ga Nuong and Charbroiled Pork.. Yums!"}
{"text":"Accidentally stumbled upon this place because the other Pho restuarant we were suppose to go to last night was out of business and this one was just around the corner. Good thing that we found this place, this was one of the best Pho restuarants we've eaten at in Vegas so far . I notice their menu is more extensive than others, like 7 course of beef. I don't see that at other Pho restuarants or haven't stumble upon another one just like it. You know a restuarant is good when you have guest waiting for a table. I usually do the thirst test after eating at a certain restuarant to see if they use a lot of MSG. After eating at this place I was not thirsty at all, I guess they really cook their broth from scratch than with the help of MSG to flavor it. Their pho was really tasty and delicious and they give a lot of meat. I have to come back to try their 7 course of beef, seems like every other table had ordered it and it smell so good but the one bad thing is that your clothes and hair end up smelling greasy afterward. This restaurant is a definite must try."}
{"text":"Last time I was in vegas, we came here three out of the four days we were there. Pho is a pretty amazing creation. Also, most of the restos on the strip are overpriced and not very tasty (i gagged from the fishiness of the fish taco at china poblano, despite loving fish sauce!!)  pho so 1 also carries the super bowl, which is huge, and in normal circumstances I would attempt it, but all i do in vegas is drink and eat so my appetite was never normal when i visited. Their pork chops are also very tasty. They also have this salty plum carbonated drink that was very refreshing."}
{"text":"This pho really hits the spot.

For my boyfriend specifically, we drive all the way from Henderson to eat here.  There's a large population of Laotians in the area and it helps him feel at home when he can understand what people are saying.  If the local Laos eat here... I will too.

Last time we got a chicken and rice dish with lemongrass (I know that's pretty vague).  It was good, more lemongrassy than I prefer, but again, it brought my boyfriend back and that's all the reason for me to like this place."}
{"text":"If i could give a zero i would i came home after heating here and within 4 hours I vomitting my guts out and on the toilet thanks for the food poisoning. Frig. Not only That!! The service SUCKED! I GOT MY FOOD BEFORE A GLASS OF WATER... they made me get my own booster seats and the bus boy was the one who finally served us he was the only decent kid there. Extremely understaffed for this size resteraunt. Dissapointed"}
{"text":"We were referred here by friends and now is the only place we go for Pho. The service and food has been fantastic on each visit and the prices are quite friendly as well. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place used to serve a fair quantity of quality food. Not the quantity is very very small and the price has gone up. Service is bad. Find a new place"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Crowded place because of delicious PHO!!! Definitely a MUST if you are in town."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite Pho restaurant in the city, nothing else even comes close or compares. My family and I have been coming here for about 10 years and with the exception of small price increases and new additions to the menu, the food remains the same. There's a reason why this place is almost always crowded, the food here is consistently great!

I usually get the pho special combo. (#10) or the vermicelli with charbroiled beef and egg rolls (#56). The pho is always delicious and portions are huge so I can never finish an entire bowl. The egg rolls are also delicious, hot and crispy served with fresh wet lettuce for wrapping. Occasionally I will order something other than pho, and those dishes are alright, but everyone comes here for the pho. 

Now if they only started to serve Banh Mi (Vietnamese sandwiches), that would be heaven!"}
{"text":"Their staff may not all be perky but they have quick staff, delicious soup base and reasonable prices!

my number 1 pho place to go to in vegas!"}
{"text":"This is a review of my vegan experience at this restaurant. Was frustrated with the lack of vegan reviews for the area on Yelp, so I'm adding mine. Note that I am ok with shared oil/kitchens. I also don't usually check if the beer is vegan.

Pros:
Cheap!
Vegan options!
Pretty tasty!
Open till 10pm, so good option after picking people up at the airport

Cons:
Not extremely tasty!

(I'd really give this place a 3.5, but I'm rounding up because of how frustrated I am with the lack of good cheap vegan meals in Calgary.)"}
{"text":"Food is good & cheap. I come here all the time & the best part is that it's open late ! Service was excellent !"}
{"text":"Love the food !!!' Best food in Vegas ! Been to many places but this one is number 1 l, came back twice day after day"}
{"text":"Pork vermicelli is light fresh and flavorful. This place has great food! Simple atmosphere, family friendly, and affordable!"}
{"text":"We order pho with trip and beef tendons but all we got was pho. The spring roll were pre-made and tasted dry and old. It use to be good. Won't be going back."}
{"text":"My only stop when I am craving Pho. When my family comes to town this is our dinner stop without a doubt! Spring rolls are good too."}
{"text":"This place could easily be a 4 or maybe even a 5 with some better service. I'm Vietnamese so I know service in Viet joints is generally bad to fair but this place is really popular and they just can't keep up on busy times. That having been said the food is really, really good. The pho is solid but you go here for the nuong vi which is beef shrimp or squid marinated in lemongrass then cooked at your table."}
{"text":"Let me preface my review by saying this:  I learned to make pho broth in culinary school, so my first introduction to this broth spoiled me on the rest.  However, I'm in Vegas on vacation and am coming down with a cold, so any pho is good pho.

Appearance: we had breakfast at Pho So 1 at around 9:30 on a Tuesday morning.  Jadira is right, there is no host station when you walk in, so you just walk in there and stand confused until someone sees you and ushers you to a seat.  We were seated within 90 seconds, though.  This place is nice and clean, and everyone there was pleasant.

The service: prompt, English-speaking (for the most part), and our egg rolls came out at the same time as our soups.  Unlike most restaurants, we were never bothered once our food was delivered.  That was ok with me - I would have been happy to flag someone down if we needed anything more, and it's awkward trying to talk with a mouthful of noodles and broth running down your chin.  Besides, they really give you all the condiments and complements you need before you get your meal.  

The food: nice and hot.  We shared an eggroll appetizer, my husband had pho with flank and brisket, and I had pho with beef balls.  The balls were tasty, but I wasn't crazy about their texture.  The flank and brisket, along with the eggrolls, were great, with a good ratio of meat to fat.  The noodles had a good texture, and there were plenty of them.  Great big plate full of basil, sprouts, jalapenos, and lime just in case.

My complaint: The hardest thing to get just right, at least for me, is the broth.  Having been spoiled by my textbook broth, I like for it to be dark in color from onion and ginger brulee, and for it to have a strong aroma of beef balanced with the sachet spices.  Pho So 1 had only the latter - very aromatic but almost as light and clear as water.  

Bottom line: we're still looking for that perfect bowl of pho here in town, but you could do lots worse than Pho So 1."}
{"text":"I had dinner there last week, the rice I ordered was cold, the noodles my husband had ordered looked as if from other customers' left over and put it together,  nothing looked like the pictures in their website.  Basically they don't have any quality control and the presentation is awful, considering given them so many chances, I think is about time NEVER go back."}
{"text":"This place was lovely on the standards of a typical Vietnamese restaurant.  Not too crowded.  The service was decent.  Owner politely greeted us and was very friendly to our party.  Food was okay but not overwhelmingly impressive.  What we had:
- Mi xao don   -  so so
- Pho             -  so so
- Tau hu ky    -  average.  I was looking forward to this too!
- Com tam      -  excellent! But this is my favorite dish so I'm biased plus it's hard to mess this up
- Hu tieu mi    -  best out of all our orders***
- Che 3 mau   - not bad!

I'd come back, and I'd like to try the vermicelli dishes next!"}
{"text":"I don't know if they changed owners, but this quality of this restaurant took a nose dive. The old staff is no longer there and it has been replaced by young twits who are clueless about what it means to give proper customer service. Maybe these kids are related to the management or the owners. Otherwise, I don't understand how these imbeciles can work there unsupervised. If that is the case, I will say that family and business do not always mix. 

We visited a few times in this year and left the establishment after waiting over 10 minutes to be served. There were other people (Asian) who were being served as we sat and waited like fools. Whether this is because they are friends with the new staff and/or share a similar heritage is unclear. The one time when we were served we received crap service. It was never this way before as the the former staff used to treat all customers equally."}
{"text":"looks like this new owner deleted my review.


i ordered 4 items for 2 ppl and she gave us 1 small sliced onion and i asked for 1more

and she goes 'i will charge you!! '
with angry tone

so i asked 'ok is it new ? when did u start to charge?'

she yelled at me ' from now! today!! '

this is not a joke. she has VERY ugly attitude.
ok i don't mind paying extra $1 
i just didn't know new owner changed the rule!!l


this place was my favorite since 2008 but not anymore. new owner is really bad 


please learn how to respect customer. 

if you delete, i will re-post it"}
{"text":"I had the #1 special beef noodle soup, nothing special. This is not a place I would go out of my way for. They are really short staff, looks like the dish washer was serving and cleaning tables. I heard a phone in complaint, and some else was missing one of their order. There was a lot going on and they are disorganized."}
{"text":"Love the beef sate pho here.  Its got a great soup base with strong flavours   not for the meek cause it does have quite a kick to it.   If you enjoy a spicy bowl of Vietnamese noodles I definitely recommend pho so."}
{"text":"My family always come here when we visit Vegas. This is one of the best places for Vietnamese food. I like their Banh Hoi and their Bo 7 Mon (seven course beef). The portions are good and the price is fair. Friendly and fast service, most of the time."}
{"text":"I am a fan - the food is good, but this place is very dirty.  It needs to be CLEANED!"}
{"text":"To say this is the best pho place in Vegas, is sad. It used to be decent, but I ask you to try it out and see for yourself.

SETTING: Located in the same plaza as market 168 and Honey Pig, it has a fair amount of parking. Be careful on the weekends when it's super crowded and everyone's a crappy driver. Restaurant is open, spacious. Seats and tables are gross and sometimes sticky. 

Might be a bit of a wait depending on the time and day. Fridays, saturdays, all major holidays are pretty packed. 

SERVICE: Hit-or-miss normally. Late-nights are good from 8pm-ish onwards when it's got a good crowd going, but they're still attentive. 

Can be very annoying trying to grab their attention. Like some asian places, don't expect them to pander, smile, or be fluffy with you. Cultural thing? Slightly. In vietnam, it's normally very business-like in the sense that you go eat and get out. You've got places to be. Casual. Still respectful though. Nothing personal. 

Am I the ONLY one that finds it bizarre that they serve hot tea in regular-size beverage cups?! Where are my teacups and teapot?! Not a huge deal, but it's comical to me. 

FOOD: one issue I've had consistently with the place for several years is the temperature of the broth. They either serve it slightly warm or barely hot. You might think this isn't an issue. Good pho is HOT (still shy of boiling hot) throughout the whole time you eat it and doesn't grow cold when you're almost or halfway finished. It also serves to cook your thin meat slices in there. I can't tell you how many times my pho has come out barely warm.

If your pho comes out tongue-ready without having to blow on it (sorry, couldn't word that any differently :/ ), then they're doing it WRONG. Ruins the experience.

Broth is normally flavorful for me, but nothing spectacular like \"OH MY GOSH this is UH-MAZE-ING.\" I like to eat it as-is before manipulating it with hoisin and hot sauce. Whenever it is packed here, the food suffers. It's a pretty huge difference. Meat is fine, but I've found it oddly too tough sometimes. Hu tieu mi is one of my fave noodle soups, and they do a decent version of it. However, they LOAD so much into a bowl that it spills when I put my spoon and chopsticks in.

Would I call this perfect or even the best pho in Vegas? No. It's mediocre bordering on okay, but I'm happy this place has some awesome love for it. I'd rather stay at home and make my own, honestly. Am I being elitist about this? Maybe. I've just had decent or excellent pho since I was kid to know the difference in quality.

PROS: open late nights for the bar/club crowd and night owls. Okay pho, but seriously overrated. Good portions for both small and large bowls.

CONS: service. The food. 

VERDICT: Okay food for the price. Affordable. Great option for when you're craving food to soak up all that alcohol late nights. If you're not super picky or don't care, it's an okay place to go. Far from the best, but still better than the worst."}
{"text":"The food is good but the server is really badly when they come and check on you and if you want some more seem like they not be or they walk away when you haven't done telling them what you need"}
{"text":"This is one of the few Vietnamese places in south Calgary. I mainly choose this place for convenience. Their pho is tasty enough as are the springs roles and bun. The flavour is good enough so if you're short on time, this is a decent spot for a quick bowl of pho."}
{"text":"Terrible service. The lady at the bar (the owner) is rude, service is slow and they brought out pork dumplings when we ordered vegetarian. We asked nicely to get the veggie that we ordered but she refused and argued shamelessley then swore at us. Honestly the worst service I've ever received. She was more concerned with losing the cost of the dish rather than correcting her mistake. Plenty of better options available, don't waste your time here unless you want to ruin your evening! Would absolutely give zero stars if I could."}
{"text":"This WAS my favorite Vietnamese restaurant. Until one late night when I brought my family from California here, bragging to them that this was the best place in Las Vegas. Service was horrendous. I ordered the beef stew with egg noodle soup. I cannot believe they let this out of the kitchen. It looked like watered down beef boullion cubes with hard fatty beef.It was gross....I pretended that I enjoyed it just to save face. I don't understand. I've had this dish hundreds of times and it was always spot on. I've been a loyal pho so 1 customer since 1998. I'm astonihhed that they served such horrible food. Maybe ...it was a fluke but not to be harsh. I expect better...way better. Pho so 1 ship shape up and get your act together because Saigon # 8 is right down the street!!!!"}
{"text":"Flavorful food, great value and awesome quality of food. Service is good. Sometimes the place is a little less than sparkling clean but it's no big deal to me. Parking at the back!"}
{"text":"Excellent service! Staff was super friendly and helpful. I've been to other pho restaurants in Chinatown and was not too impressed with service or staff, but this spot is a keeper!  Will be back again  for sure!"}
{"text":"The dudes at Pho So 1 are always on point . Iv been going here for years . If I want Vietnamese food I head over to get my fix whatever it may be, beef stew , steak and rice , spring rolls and the egg rolls !!! The BEST EGG ROLLS IN TOWN.  Vietnamese done right"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm craving pho I visit this restaurant. The service is good and the place is nicely furnished. I almost alwayd order a large bowl of pho, which is usually quite delicious. The soup is very flavorful and the noodles aren't hard or undercooked. Comes with a small plate of bean sprouts and lime wedges and chilis. Prices are reasonable for the quality of food. However, once I found my soup rather salty and too flavorful."}
{"text":"This place is dirty, the floor is sticky, and I'm not a fan of leaving a restaurant and having the smell of the place penetrate through my clothes, hair and skin.  Yuck. But I will be honest, I'm not a fan of \"hole in the wall\" places, like my brother-in-law who says the dirtier the place, the better the food.  So the food may be decent or even good as other reviewers have written, but I just can't get past the interior."}
{"text":"Not only is the service horrible, the food is subpar. The pho broth has a very strong star anise presence which some may love but I'm not into that. The charbroiled pork chop was super dry and the shredded pork thing that it came with was unappetizing. I will not be coming back"}
{"text":"Favorite pho restaurant! This place is the first thing that comes to mind when i think of pho. Service is okay, but the food is excellent!!"}
{"text":"Been around for years if you haven't been and love Vietnamese cuisine give this place a shot.I came here with my family for Valentines Day. Thinking more about how it should be about a family being together than flowers and candy. Every restaurant in town was obviously packed. Wife wanted Noodles so here we went. To my surprise it was the busiest I have ever seen it. A few couples bust most of the tables were filled with families. Many others has the exact same idea I had. The one great thing about a busy business is you know, most likely you are getting everything fresh. The oly crazy thing that happened was when the manager went to the back and yelled \"What the F is going on?\" When things get busy, mistakes are easily made. It was more fun than anything. Waiter was top notch. Was the kind who tried to remember your entire order without writing it down. Hours later and I am still full. I can't wait til next Valentines day."}
{"text":"I believe that my taste buds changed because I used to really like this Vietnamese restaurant.  It is very authentic but my taste preference changed overtime.  For those who like pho, this is a good place to go to.  The only vegan option, I think, is there tofu vermicelli bowl.  I am not vegan but I thought I'd share that especially for that one person in a group that needs to know, \"is there a vegan option?\"..."}
{"text":"This place has been newly renovated and it's my first time being back since! It looks much more modern and much cleaner. I've always loved the food and now, I'll enjoy it so much more with the great atmosphere. I come here for the pho! And I love it so much. It's very traditional and it's extremely delicious. I highly recommend you come here! Especially during a late night craving! They're open late which is the best part!"}
{"text":"This place is horrible they charge you $1 for sliced onions and if you order more they charge you another dollar... Once I asked them for an ice tea and charged me $4 when you can get hot tea for free and add ice. They charged me ice for $4!  Poor customer service they just looking to charge you any kind of way. .. They also use a stove on the tables which is ILLEGAL! One wrong move and that stove can actually blow up! But if you do come here (which I recommend not to) be careful because they can charge you for anything and ALWAYS CHECK YOUR BILL. YOU NEVER KNOW WHAT THEY COULD HAVE CHARGED!!! IF I COULD GIVE THIS ZERO STARS I WOULD!!! NEVER COMING BACK!!!"}
{"text":"We came here literally because of the Pho So 1 in Van Nuys. We are such fans of the van nuys location that we went out of our way during our trip to Vegas to eat here. They are under the same ownership but this one is understandably not the same as the Van Nuys location. Still great pho though!"}
{"text":"Worst place ever. Worst service ever. Will never go again. Servers were straight up rude. Took forever to get food. Cancelled half my order cause it took so long."}
{"text":"After landing in Vegas we headed for food in Chinatown which is Spring Mtn Rd.  Pho So 1 is in the Big Lot strip mall with a Vietnamese grocery store: LV Superstore next to it.

We got:

Iced coffee - they gave us the drip coffee w/ filter so it's legit.  Good.
Bi Cuon - not what I wanted & not very good.  Fresh spring roll w/ pork fuzz I guess.
Grilled Pork & grilled shrimp cold vermicelli - fine, comes w/ fish sauce.
B. got a pho - he liked it.

They take credit card.  Very popular place."}
{"text":"Location: Better than the majority of the other Pho place. Ample parking. 
Wait time: 10-15 minute at times. 
Service: Prompt, Server knowledgeable. Friendly.
Decor: Acceptable. The place is old. 

Food:
Spring Roll: Good. Wasnt too soggy and rubbery. 
Peanut sauce:Excellent
BBQ Pork Vermicelli: Excellent. Flavorful. Portion:Good
Pho: Good.Wasnt too greasy. Meat:Good

Overall experience: Good.
I give it 4.5. Why not 5? Because of the decor =-D.
Strictly food; Excellent

Will return again."}
{"text":"Just what the doctor ordered, for a hangover.
Very clean place, great selection of food. I got rib-eye steak pho. It was nice and greasy (in a good way). They don't skimp in the meat at all. The flavor was perfect. I also had the egg rolls. They were crunchy and hot. All of the veggies were fresh."}
{"text":"I'm a fan only when I am in Vegas partying or visiting family. My family always go to Pho Kim Long, but finally they tried this place and it's so much better. The broth here is savory and not salty. My goodness they load your bowl with noodles and meat that I couldn't finish it, but it's worth what you spend. The only problem I have with this place is their service, their servers do not come around to fill up the waters..argh..I hate that especially, when it's hot and spicy with siracha."}
{"text":"UPDATE Spring/Summer 2016
One of the few pho places open late that is priced right and tastes good, with also good portions. Soup to noodles to meat ratio. Still tastes awesome. Spring rolls are just ok. But the take out spend, wow. Very quick. Worth the drive each time. Yums. 
They are now near the top of my list for pho places for sure. 

UPDATE June 2014
I do not like this place at all anymore. Go someone else. 

BAD SERVICE, ok food. They have great pho hands down almost close to the pho place I loved back home in Hawaii but the service was horrible!!! Even as an Asian person in there, I felt I was invisible. Three tables that were sat after us was served before us. It took 3 different people's attention before my husband finally got his soda.  I understand they were busy and the food came out quick, but the service was the worst I have experienced in a long time.  It was also super hot, they had 2 fans on but felt like there was no ac running, which made it even more uncomfortable and the experience unpleasant. It was cooler outside! I  would never dine in again maybe only take out.  It's a shame because the food rocked. I want to try again but not sure I would ever dine in again. Take out sounds better but of course it doesn't give you that Pho experience you want when you want that hot brothy soup."}
{"text":"I've been back to try the Vietnamese BBQ and all I can say is daaaammnn Geeenaa!

When the little grill and tons of plates of \"stuff\" arrived at my table, I was completely lost.  I looked around at the smiling faces of successful grillers, and thought, \"I want to be just like that guy, only without the mustache.\"  I had to ask my server for instructions.

I'm going to break it down for you so you're prepared to get crazy with your dinner:

You will get a plate of beef and shrimp, (order this one, both proteins were great) lettuce, mint, limes, onions, and jalapenos, (like with pho) some peanut sauce and some fish sauce for dipping, a bowl of hot water, and finally, little clear pieces of paper (rice wrappers)

Here's what you do:

1)  Squeeze some lime on your meats, because errrthing's better with lime.
2)  Dip your meats in the oil which is in the little reservoir around the grill, then place on the grill, cook to your liking.
3) Dip rice wrappers in hot water to reconstitute them, then lay on your plate.  
4) Fill wrapper with lettuce, mint, jalapenos, carrots
5)  Put freshly cooked meat in wrapper.
6) Wrap it up like a burrito
7)  Enjoy the HELL out of that delicious little thang!


I was with some friends, and we thought it was hilarious to call these things \"tacos.\"  We had a few drinks, so I'm sure it wasn't funny at all, but let's go ahead and just roll with it. 

Even though we left the table an absolute mess, the food was great and the experience was fun.  We'll definitely be back soon my Vietnamese friends!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place . I've gone to many other places Jenni pho grill , old pho Saigon , pho sing sing , and little old Saigon those place are not bad but pho so 1 has the best egg rolls and the best pho  ."}
{"text":"Love love love! Finally found some Pho to write home about. Few things in this world make me happy like pho does, I don't know why but there is something about shoving my face in a bowl of steaming broth and noodles that just puts a smile on my face. Works everytime.

The rest of the folks really nailied this place already so I don't actually have much to add. Good clean broth with a lovely fragrance, tons of noodles, and of course the sprouts, basil and lime on the side. 

One bonus this place has is that you can choose from 3 sizes of pho to satisfy your appetite. I ordered the small - and it was to much for me as it was. We also had some fresh rolls, but really the Pho was the focal point. 

I say don't go for the noodle bowl but hit this place for pho.

Also, you can park behind and there is also a back door to the resto."}
{"text":"The place was clean service  was excellent, very fast. The pho  was great! The broth was flavorful not salty. I was able to add the hot sauce, veggies,  and a little soy sauce without  it overpowering  the taste  of the rare meat. The broth was very hot  as well. The Spring Rolls Were fresh. The meat egg rolls with the veggie wrap plus mint leaves sure hit the spot. The staff Is multicultural  with very nice customer service."}
{"text":"The noodles on our pho is hard and not cooked well. Soup smells stinky"}
{"text":"YES GO HERE GO HERE!!! The ONLY good pho place in town, PROMISE!  It can get pretty packed, but its well worth the wait for us :) You also get a decent bang for the buck here. Ive always ordered seafood pho, and they are not stingy with the good stuff. Ive recently starting expanding my horizons and explored other dishes on the menu, they are alway on point. Open late, great place!"}
{"text":"Pho: salty broth, wasn't very hot and meat was too chewy. I got the special with added ribeye and the only edible meat was the ribeye... awful. 

Fried egg roll came late and wasn't even hot...with pockets of Luke warm frying oil in the skin.. ugh gross. The meat in egg roll tasted old too... I had to spit it out (dramatic I know) but I can't handle old smelling meat. 

Fried rice was tasteless and very very late.

Service was normal for a viet place

Honestly... I will never be back!"}
{"text":"The food taste so good!! The pho is always good. Egg rolls, spring rolls, shrimp paste, and even the tea is really good. But every time we eat here we get instantly sick! Im so torn, because it taste so good but hurts so bad. But I'd rather not pay to get sick. They must not wash their hands or keep food at right temp."}
{"text":"Ordered the egg roll and baby tiny roach were crawling around the plate!!! I would never ever come back here!!!"}
{"text":"If you are craving for a decent Pho place in town then this is it. The broth is tasy and the noodles are chewy. This place is always packed. We always order extra onions on the side coz with a little lemon and pepper on top, they get pretty tasty. The perfect accompagnement for Pho.
 
PS: They open pretty late as well."}
{"text":"Not much to say about this place other than the fact that they have the best flavored pho I've had in Las Vegas. I've tried several different bowls of pho but their broth is always delicious. 

Service sucks though."}
{"text":"Very yummy! Our favorites are the #12 pho  and spring rolls with peanut sauce. 
Only thing Is the bathrooms are always filthy so either use the restroom before you arrive and bring some hand sanitizer so you don't have to go into the restrooms, only reason I deducted a star."}
{"text":"read the reviews prior and expectations were high. the pho did not disappoint. everything was excellent. will be back next time visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"The concierge at the Venetian recommended this restaurant. The soup was very tasty, and the bean sprouts were all trimmed and everything! Inexpensive and very soothing after a night out ;)"}
{"text":"Terrible service.  I'm used to bad service at Asian restaurants, but this was ridiculous.

Order 2 pork chop rice dishes and asked for an egg on top.  They both came out, no egg.  We had to ask twice for egg.  One egg came out . . and we had to wait for the other one.  They also didn't give us a steak knife to cut the pork chop.

I ordered a Hu Tieu in broth with glass noodles.   The noodles were under cooked and the soup wasn't very hot.

Ordered Goi cuon.  Never came out even though we asked 3 times, we just canceled it.

I'm not looking for fancy pants service and charming waiters, just bring us our food.

Also seems slightly pricey for mediocre food.  We're sticking with the Rio Buffet from now on."}
{"text":"Everything I have had here has been great. I keep going back and I bring everyone that visits town. Its open late so if you want an after midnight snack or after the club meal they will gladly seat you and provide good service. 

Good broth, fresh ingredients. Service always good. The place has a cafeteria feel rather than the fine dining feel that a lot of businesses in Las Vegas go for. But, which would you rather have? Great food or a great scenery?  

I usually get the beef pho with tendon and flank. If I feel like rice I get the bbq pork plate with the egg loaf. Good Stuff! Enjoy."}
{"text":"Lukewarm pho - i think our soups had been sitting out in the kitchen for awhile. Really bad and slow service. Won't be back.
The table next to us remained dirty the whole time we were there. It was really gross."}
{"text":"Deserves 0 star. We often come here but today we found a huge dead fly in the vegetables. They replaced it but they never even apologized. We ate a few pieces before finding it which worries me because I don't want any of us getting sick. The worst thing through this experience is how the cashier which I believe is the owner treated us after letting her know what had happened. I will never go back to this place and I will let my family and friends know."}
{"text":"Service lacks efficiency. Long waiting time for getting served when busy. Need more employees for ampunt of customers. Bathrooms needs attention."}
{"text":"Horrible service and Pho was disappointing.  Not sure how this place gets good reviews, it was crowded, waited to be seated and finally after 20 minutes of staring at a couple of empty tables and trying to make eye contact with the many servers we were seated.  Menus were literally dropped on our table and as we were about to walk out one of the servers came by to take our order.  Grilled pork spring roll was pretty good, Pho was not!  Watery soup, not the rich broth expected from a good pho, chewy meat, and overcooked noodles.  Not going back and will never recommend this place!  Go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Hands down, my favorite Pho spot in Vegas. I always get the Grilled Pork Vermacelli bowl. I take all my friends there. Quick service and delicious food!"}
{"text":"We went in January 1st. The first meal of the year, woah oh woah, the worst restaurant i have ever been to. I understand that a lot of people was waiting but the restaurant has absolutely no system. We dont know where to go for signing up because nobody is up front. When somebody actually showed up, he ignored our existence until i asked him. The wait was not bad. But other customer was fighting over that table as well. The hostess let us resolve it among ourselves. I mean, really? Anyhow, we got the table. The table is dirty and smelly. We sat down and waited, and waited. 20 mins later, finally somebody gave us menu to order. Everybody in my table asked for ph. I asked for cháo ( porridge). He said  cháo takes a lot longer to make in a really sarcastic way, which i didnt appreciate at all. So i ordered ph. Food didnt take long to come. And the waiter forgot my order. I had to remind him to bring my food. So everybody in my table finished their food before i got mine. The broth is actually pretty good. That is the only reason why i gave it 1 star. In conclusion, i dont think i will ever come back here."}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant while I was in town for the New Year holiday; I thought the food was great, authentic, and priced fairly.  The portions were just the right amount for me (since I ordered appetizer, main, dessert, and a drink), but the individual dishes are slightly smaller than what I am accustomed to from other Vietnamese restaurants.  Flavor, however, was great on everything I had on both my visits here.  The food tasted quite fresh and service was quite good.  Even though this place was crowded with a line out the door, service is managed well enough that we didn't have to wait much to get a table nor to get our food."}
{"text":"Lots of parking available. Ordered pho special with beef on the side....okay, broth was a bit oily and our waiter barely was around to check on us or refill our water. Also ordered crispy fried noodle with seafood but who serves shrimp with beef and chicken? My husband didn't want to make  big deal out of it so he ate it...although he was in the mood for seafood and not beef and chicken! We have had better experience with pho on Oahu, even my son knows what great pho tastes like and he orders it exactly like me, pho special with rare beef on side. Customer service needs work."}
{"text":"Good solid food. 

Not much I can say about this place. They worked fast to clean the tables for us and within seconds of sitting down, we were already asked if we were ready to order. Nope. Need a few more minutes please. Okay. 

I got their beef ball noodle soup. Honestly, the pho taste just like every other pho place I been to. Nothing out of the ordinary, but their beef balls were kind of hard to chew. The only thing I really liked about this place was their egg rolls which had a good amount of flavor in it. 

Overall, I'll give this place 3 stars. The food wasn't totally extraordinary but it was good and the prices are affordable."}
{"text":"I will admit I used to cringe when my husband would tell me we were coming here for or lunch or dinner before.  But now that they have new owners and have remodeled the place and changed up the menu a little, I can honestly say I am actually looking forward to going back.  They have added two big screen televisions.  They now have wooden bench style tables and they play hip hop music.  When we arrived a couple of the waiters were dancing and one even danced us on in to our table (he was feeling it).  I ordered the roasted hen with a side of egg noodles the noodles had a sweet brown sauce on them with a kick to it, and a small bowl of soup.  To my surprise it was rather tasty the roasted hen was seasoned perfectly and crispy but the inside was not dry.  My kids shared the roasted hen and tomato rice place and enjoyed it as well.  My other daughter got steamed rice and beef and broccoli, that was enough to feed two people easy.  My husband got steamed rice with pork and egg loaf.  It was all good.  I also had, well my kids actually had the three bean drink, so good.  Next time I will make sure to order two."}
{"text":"The best pho and egg rolls in the area. If you like egg rolls, they have the best! The egg rolls come in an order of 4 pieces with lots of fresh vegetables. Big portions for the prices. 
The service is average."}
{"text":"One of the \"oldest\" pho restaurants in town. Believed to have been here probably around 20 years or so. I moved to Las Vegas in Dec 1993. I've always remembered it being there since i moved here, and thats a minimum of 16 years. 

This restaurant is a popular favorite when it comes to vietnamese food. Wide selection of different foods on their menu listing to almost 100 items like pho, bun, com... appetizers like spring rolls and cha gio (viet style egg rolls) 

Service is pretty decent. The owner (or owner's son? whoever it may be... young mid aged maybe high 20s guy) is really nice. 

One of my favorite few things to order is the #10 which is the special pho with combination of beef... good sized bowl for a large. decent amount of noodles and meat. usually comes out pretty fast and hot. a fav during the year, esp during the cold times to warm up ! 

another one is #54? which is the bun thit nuong cha gio... rice vermicelli noodles with viet egg rolls and barbequed pork on top of greens and eaten with their mixture of fish sauce ! one i like to order over the summer or when its hot... nice cold noodle (no soup base)

one other favorite i order a lot is Bun Rieu... its a special soup based noodle soup that uses tomato as a base for soup and crab meat... also have a few cubes of cooked pork blood as well... very tasty.. takes a while to make compared to #10 or #54 but its worth the wait... most of the soup is usually gone by the time i finish this =]

popular place for pho by many people of different ages... open late to like i believe 2am? busy during prime hours. 

one little con is they dont have a really good air ventilation system... sometimes can be a little hot or stuffy or have a little KBBQ feel when someone around you has gotten the beef plate to grill at table.. but dont let this stop u from going to this place..

one pro to mention is this place is bill splitting friendly... for those who like to pay for their own order when sitting in a group.. =]"}
{"text":"My new Pho stop when I get in town, love the broth, good service, always find a table.  good portions of meat."}
{"text":"I love Pho Meatball Soup and this place delivers. It isnt the best I have had ever but its the best I have had in Vegas. Pho in Seattle is everywhere and the market is developed where Vegas is much more limited in selections of Pho. The places here seem to be a bit less in quality than Seattle because their isn't the stiff competition, but this place was pretty tasty. I had #16 Pho w Meatball and I had the tendon one a day or two later. Both were very good and was what should be expected. I have not ventured into much else on the menu yet, but I would highly recommend, as for Las Vegas Pho this does the job pretty well."}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best Pho shops in Vegas, even compared to San Diego. I ordered the Pho Dac Biet Xe Lua, the whole dish and my party of 15 said that the food was fresh. We were not happy that the Che Ba Mau (3 Color Bean) did not have as much coconut in one of them and the waiter came over said no worries, not a problem. you want me to add more or get you a whole new one. Its very easy. Great customer service, but obviously theres a wait for this restaurant. (which is normal in vegas.)"}
{"text":"Below average foods and bad services. Won't come back again.! Waiting for hour for an spring rolls and it came out cold. It's looked like it's been it the fridge. I had to remind them all the time that we still missing orders."}
{"text":"Strange that our last meal in Vegas was at a Vietnamese restaurant, but after binge eating other foods, my family and I were really craving it. Pho So 1 is a medium sized restaurant that was fairly crowded for a weeknight and pretty clean as well. We were promptly seated, and food came out pretty quick.

I had the Pho Tai, and to be honest, I was disappointed in it. While they gave a ton of meat that was fairly tender, the broth tasted very watered down. The egg rolls I ordered were also pretty large, but a bit too greasy for my taste. Finally, when I think Vietnamese iced coffee, I think a very strong and sugary coffee from the condensed milk. Sadly, my coffee was more on the bitter side. 

Pho So 1 is a good place if you want a large portion size for your Vietnamese food. That being said, the quality of the food could be better. 
Service 3/5
Ambiance 3/5
Food 2.5/5"}
{"text":"Most definitely worth driving a little farther down spring mountain to get here. 

- parking lot is bigger and bigger is always better..to avoid bad drivers and for more parking spaces, of course.
- no wait like the one you always get at pho kim long.
- they give you TONS of meat in your pho. 


Happy recovery!"}
{"text":"After reading the reviews on this place I thought it was going to be better than all the other pho places in vegas but it was just ok.

I ordered pho tai sach (rare beef and tripe) w/my beef on the side. It came out quick, just a few minutes after I ordered. The bowl was small. They did however give more beef than any of the other pho places. The soup tasted good, but it was warm. Since the soup was not steaming hot, I had to dump all the beef in the bowl right away which i usually don't do."}
{"text":"This is our go-to pho spot in Vegas. Now when reviewing fast food restaurants, what merits 5 stars is obviously going to be different when compared to, say, a sit down fancy pants restaurant where you take your lady friends (only to be friend zoned later... sucka).

Therefore, I wasn't surprised to see the dearth of more enthusiastic 5-star reviews for what may be the best pho place off the vegas strip. I've been to 4 other places during my multiple trips out to the desert and this is the only place that I wanted to come back to. Plus my viet gambling friends always take me here so that has to mean something.

It is hard to mess up pho - all you really need is great soup and this place has it. Last time I tried a pan-fried beef dish with tomato rice (I believe it's #21 on their menu) and the beef was moist and flavorful. I couldn't really taste any tomato in the rice but who gives a shit, it's just rice. The sweet pickled veggies complemented the dish well plus you get a bowl of their awesome soup.

Service is good and you pay at the back after you're done with your meal. I know I'll be back in my next trip. Till then, best of luck to ya'll out there in sin city."}
{"text":"i love pho so 1 but they gotta keep the place clean..seriously"}
{"text":"My fiancé and I both love going out late night and getting us some Vietnamese food. I personally am a big fan of Pho (as this is my third yelp on a vietnamese restaurant). I was introduced to this particular place because I use to date the owner's son. I had never had pho prior. The establishment has flourished since then. The restaurant has doubled in size in 2002.

My fiance says that this is his favorite place for Cum Bo Lu Lac. Its basically barbequed beef and rice (i believe). I happen to like their jellyfish salad. The pickled favor is not overwhelming. 

 The pho is on par with most pho restaurants I have eaten. Price is also very reasonable, I think it was $6 for a bowl of pho which is around the going rate. Fresh spring rolls were very good too. 

Some people have mentioned that the place wasn't very clean. I would like everyone to keep in mind that most authentic Vietnamese restaurants aren't going to be very upscale and /or clean. Not that this is an excuse for hygiene, but I like to review on subjectivity. This is how most Vietnamese restaurants are, no boujie-ness but great food. If you're looking for an elegant Vietnamese restaurant, I can say, from experience, that the food will be over priced for exactly the same product from a mom/pop pho restaurant.

This restaurant isnt open as late as Pho Kim Long, but it is great. Last time I checked, they only took cash. So make sure to make cash on you."}
{"text":"YES! I haven't been here in about 2 years. Not sure if they got new owners or just changed things a bit. Looks more upscale inside than it did before, and service was awesome! Our food was out so fast that we were shocked. They kept checking on us to make sure we were good, drinks were refilled before they were even empty. When you're looking for good pho, it's all about the broth. I LOVE their broth. I could sit there and just drink a big bowl of it. I ordered the 13, beef brisket and flank. There was a TON of meat in my soup and it was so good. This place remains my fav pho spot. Phocking delicious ;)"}
{"text":"Pho So 1 is thespot!! If you want some good pho this the right place.This a happening spot and gets busy real fast during peak dinner hours and weekends however its worth the wait!! the staff takes care of you right away!!"}
{"text":"I always review based on a restaurant's food, customer service, price, and ambiance. 

Starting with the food, my pork chop over rice was really dry and the portion was small. My mom ordered their classic beef flank pho was below standard in my opinion.  The beef was old and dry. 

Customer service was not up to par either. The wait to be seated took about 15 minutes. I get that it was the weekend but that was no excuse for the poor flow of the restaurant. I only saw two bus-boys cleaning up the whole store. And there were plenty of empty tables but too short-handed to clean up, leaving many customers waiting outside. When it was finally my turn to be seated, the waiter had really bad attitude. 

For such a small portion, the price was so not worth it! Even the price in New York was cheaper than this place! 

I felt really bad for the workers because I felt like this place was short staffed. Leaving the store crowded and poorly ordered. Many angry customers were waiting by the door with me. 

Hopefully some changes would be made!"}
{"text":"Wow~ Vegas, you have impressed me this time!

Pho So 1 serves variety of Vietnamese food, including Vietnamese BBQ, rice dishes, and other noodle dishes.  http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/2irb7bL821PjTTokp9GNSQ/l I was tempted to try something else (Especially since we went there 2 days in a row) but after all the crazy nights of drinking... I had to get Pho. The service here is a bit slow and this is where they lose their one star. :(  But the egg rolls here deserves the rest of the stars!

Pho here is pretty good. http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/iXb1PCDpvJI5y95O4Bob_A/l  Not the best ever, but it's pretty awesome.  Summer roll is VERY fresh.  Lots of basil and cilantro with shrimps that were pretty big and plump.  The egg rolls??? OMG.... I want to go back for some more egg rolls.  http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/4l3Um2jUW1lG7U82B-qMDw/l I don't really know what it is about the egg rolls here, but it was just so tasty.  SO good....

Best cure for a hangover.  They have enough seats to seat 10+ ppl to a table.  Thanks Pho So 1 for your awesome awesome egg rolls!! :)"}
{"text":"9 times out 10 this place usually gets the 4-5 star mark on their chicken pho. This was probably the 10th. Really dissapointed on a recent trip.

Chicken Pho - Usually I order this because the beef pho is lukewarm at this place due to the high volume (which isn't really an excuse because Pho Saigon 8 does pretty big numbers as well, and their pho is always piping hot.) Not only was their soup lukewarm as well, but the chicken was overcooked. Sigh. Don't even want to think about it. Will give them another chance but kinda on the edge right now. lol"}
{"text":"Overpriced and poor quality. Their nem nuong cuon was pathetic. The meat was stale, and falls apart when you bite into it. It was about $6 and some change for an order of 2 rolls. I got the pho ga. It was ok. They gave me a lot of chicken meat though. My girlfriend's broth tasted like there was still soap in it. Guess they're pretty clean."}
{"text":"Excellent Vietnamese food and great service.  The pho and egg rolls are amazing!!  Will definitely come back.. :)"}
{"text":"I ordered the Vietnamese pork chop with rice and the fucking pork chops came out to look like some god damn beef jerky. Jack Links beef jerky tastes better than this trash. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"I like their pho. I like their expansive menu. I usually get vermicelli dishes here. And they're pretty good."}
{"text":"According to my friend, Pho So 1 is one of the oldest Pho places in Las Vegas. Well I guess that's why their Pho is so good. They've been doing it for so long that it's like second nature to make good Pho.

This is my favorite Pho place in Las Vegas. I come here so often that certain servers see me and they already have my order written down before I'm even seated (true story :P)

My favorite thing to order is item #12 a.k.a. Pho Tai Nam. I like to order the rare steak that comes with it on the side then let it soak in lime juice that way when i put it in my soup it's still a little pink by the time I get to eat it. Along with that I get the eggrolls (item #1) because they are SO DAMN GOOD. Not once have I ever visited and left disappointed with the eggrolls. They are consistently amazing every single time. They come with a decent portion of lettuce and veggies and what I do (if you've never tried) is take the eggroll and some veggies and roll it up in the lettuce leaf like a wrap, dip it in the sauce they give you and VOILA! taste bud orgasm.

I gave it a 4 because some days, the service just downright sucks lol. It's okay though, the food ALWAYS makes up for it in the end.

Out of townies. This is 10-15 minutes off the strip. Do yourself a favor and get your ass over here. lol."}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure what happened to this place. I've visited here plenty of times in the past 6 years and its been a hit or miss now. I experience bad service every time we eat in and now we do take outs late at night because they seem to be the only place opened so late. I noticed the pho is better to take home and add your own ingredients given you have them. The eggrolls are usually good and my favorites to get are any of the vermicelli noodle plates. I've tried a lot of the items on the menu but I just stick to my usuals most of the time."}
{"text":"As a fellow Vietnamese, I am aware of what good Pho should taste like and clearly Pho So 1 (Pho #1) lives up to it's name. 

Your typical Vietnamese Pho house decoration with simple table (plenty) settings and menu. Servers are prompt and cleanliness is acceptable. If you struggle on which kind of Pho you'd like, be adventurous and pick the Pho Dac Biet (Pho Special)! Warning, the bowls are eye-popping big, regardless if you order a Special or not! As the beautiful Pho lands on your table, the broth is hot enough to open up your pores, the aroma is rich enough that it could suffocate your nose, colorful display with very little floating oil, now the important part (**drum roll please**), once again the broth is hot enough to burn your tongue but the taste is truly a blast full of flavors with no Sriracha hot sauce or lemon required. Typically, you will get an after taste (from MSG!!) in some Pho houses but Pho So 1 leaves your mouth tastefully wanting for more, truly a work of art!

Hooray, Pho doesn't get any better than this! Stop by if you're in town, hungry after the gambling, or just hungry. 

Absolute LOVE."}
{"text":"Fast service...the food is okay nothing special.  The egg roll is the best thing they have on the menu...they are very generous on vegetables.   The spring roll, on the other hand, was way too chewy for me.  The floor was super dirty...."}
{"text":"Average pho place. It's not comparable to the pho places in oc. Don't get their hu tieu. Pho is decent but egg rolls is overly fried."}
{"text":"Not what it used to be. Price is wrong. This place was known for their broth. Now the taste isn't there. Service was bad - party of 4 and got 1 napkin and asked 3 different servers for extra lime while they're just standing around avoiding eye contact with you. This place was great 6 years ago. Lost all they're great employees. Now it's just going down hill."}
{"text":"My friend says they have the best Pho in town! I had the #72 which is Beef & Broccoli over steamed rice. It was delicious! It's very thin beef and different than anything I've ever tried. The sauce was very thick but was delicious on the rice.

The egg rolls are my absolute favorite! I would go there again just for the egg rolls :) 

Atmosphere- Each table has an assigned number and when you are finished with your meal, you pay at the register by giving them your table number. They are open until 3am which is nice...I love places open late!"}
{"text":"This is a decent pho place. It's a pretty large restaurant for pho so I'm assuming the service was slow because there was a lunch rush around when we showed up. It took probably 20 minutes for our food to arrive after we ordered. Not sure what the hold up was! Don't be put off by the servers here though, it is standard for a traditional Asian place. Very cut and dry, sit you down, take your order, give you your drinks, wait for your food, eat, pay at the register, and go.

Oh the prices are nice too. $6.75 for a \"small\" bowl, which was enough to fill me up.

I got the #13 beef pho with flank and brisket. The beef broth was decent, not the most flavorful I've ever had, but still good. The meat was very good! And there was A LOT of it! Large tender slices that was very proportional with the amount of noodles (ie, I still had meat left to go with the noodles by the end of the bowl). I was very happy with this, and very satisfied and full by the end of the small bowl!

My friends had the pho ga (chicken pho) but said the meat was dry and not that good.

The place was steamy and a muggy inside, could probably use some fans and ventillation given it's Las Vegas weather with hot soup/grilled items being served inside. The place looks clean but the tables were sticky, but that can sometimes be a good sign for a pho place. :) In this case it was not completely inaccurate."}
{"text":"This is where I go for some good PHO in chinatown. They also have an mobile app to order take out called \" quick app-etite\" on the app-store! I would recommend coming here if your looking for some good vietnamese food!"}
{"text":"Best Phô in Vegas!!! Reasonable prices and good portion sizes. The brisket really makes the Phô."}
{"text":"This place is so disorganized! I told the waiter that we were ready to order, he said okay wait. We were seated first but they took orders from two parties that were seated after us. Terrible service. Had to walk out."}
{"text":"Oh so good after a long night of partying and drinking! Its off the strip, but very easy to get to by driving.  Not sure how much it would be to cab, but its worth leaving the strip and not paying $20 for food.  This place is very clean and quite big, so the there usually isnt a wait.  Most of the waiters are latin which impresses me cuz they knew all the terminology of vietnamese food.  Service was fast and efficient. In and out quickly and best of all....they have clear noodles!!!  My fave!"}
{"text":"Let's face it in Vegas, all the Asian restaurants no matter how pretty the interior may be...the food is overpriced garbage that is barely better than Panda Express.  So really when you're on the strip all you're left with is American and European food, and after tons of heavy drinking that kind of food may not sit so well anymore. Honestly nothing cures a night of heavy drinking like a big bowl of Pho.

When I get Pho in Vegas, I love to hit up Pho So 1. It's got a pretty funny name, not quite Pho Kim Long, but usually places with funny names tend to have sh*tty food. But this place is an exception. The prices are pretty standard for Pho places, but it also is dirt cheap in comparison to things on the strip. About $6-8 for a bowl of pho. I like to order the large #1. When I first got it honestly I thought the bowl was tiny. I was so used to getting the bowls that were more like buckets at other Pho places.

But don't let the bowl size fool you. Unlike the other Pho places. Pho So 1 actually jam packs their pho bowls with noodles, meat, and condiments.  Where as the other Pho places may give you a gigantic bowl, but honestly it's all broth. I have a huge appetite and I typically leave Pho So 1 stuffed. I highly recommend their Pho. It's not as good as Grandma's, but it's definitely delicious. I also highly recommend their Cha Gio (deep fried lumpia). It's also quite good and they serve it right with the lettuce, noodles, etc. Although their dipping sauce is a bit different.

Anyway, if you have a cheap way to get off the strip. I highly recommend hitting up Pho So 1.

~G

p.s. Keep in mind service is standard with most Vietnamese restaurants which means a little rude."}
{"text":"When I come with the group I order the Goi Bo - special steak salad.  Always fresh and absolutely outstanding!

Fast, friendly and fresh, PS1 is good to go!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place. Been here countless times in the 20+ years I've lived here. I think Pho Saigon has better noodles but the broth here is handsdown the best. On my most recent visit, I ordered the larger bowl and I think all that means is extra meat but I'm not sure. There's a certain ideal ratio of meat to noodles I like, but after I finished all the noodles, there was just way too much meat left over. I'm quite unorthodoxed in the way I eat my pho though, no hoissin sauce and no sriracha. I like the natural flavor.

It's quite cheap for a meal and comes out really quickly, as with all pho in Vegas.

If you haven't been to an authentic Chinese/Vietnamese restaurant before, let me warn you now, don't expect anything in terms of service either than them taking your order and bringing your food. The food speaks for itself."}
{"text":"Walk in, sit down for 15 minutes! No greeting, no waiter...What can you say? No wonder they deserved the *** now! Walk out and no one even knows or do they really care?"}
{"text":"One of the best Vietnamese Resto's here in Vegas, they only accept cash. Food is great and the price is great as well. Soso service but the food makes up for the not so good service."}
{"text":"Great service, good food, and a very friendly staff, and if you like beer the have the strongest Vietnamese beer, the Golden monkey. Give it a try."}
{"text":"Some of my old friends are Las Vegas locals, and I have them to thank because without them I never would've found out about Pho So 1. The restaurant is in a small strip mall in Chinatown Las Vegas, which would be easy to pass by if you weren't paying attention.

I am in Vegas a lot for work, and I make an effort to come out to Pho So 1 pretty much every time I am in the area. The food is hit or miss sometimes - it ranges from average to amazing. For that alone I would normally give a 4-star rating, but the cleanliness and quality of service have declined a bit since I first started coming here.

Restaurant is decent size and always seems busy, plus it is open pretty late which is convenient when you need pho as a hangover cure. Like I mentioned earlier, the pho tends to vary in quality but when it's good, it is really, really good. The egg rolls (cha gio - the fried egg rolls) are almost always excellent.

I hate to say that aloof service tends to be pretty standard with most Asian restaurants, but it definitely seems to be the case here. Not that they're rude or mean, but they are not that attentive and can take quite a while to come around to you. My most recent visit, I didn't receive my ice water until I was nearly done with my pho despite the fact that I had been asking for it pretty frequently.

That said, the quality of food here is almost always so good I can't resist. So I put aside my dislikes and drive out to Pho So 1 to dive into an awesome bowl of pho!"}
{"text":"Yum.

Thick slices of meat.  Not the thin frozen market sliced ones.  The portion of meat to bowl is very tasty. The broth is very good as well. 

I always get my Pho with the meat on the side. Slightly dip in the broth for a little and squeeze lime over it. Soo good!

Overall: Definitely new pho spot when I come back to LV."}
{"text":"We always stop here for a bowl of pho, Vietnamese coffee and spring rolls every time we come to Las Vegas! The steak pho always have good amount of meat and perfect for the day after a night out in the sin city!"}
{"text":"The best pho I've found in Vegas. Good noodles. Quick service. Next to a Chinese supermarket so you can go for a cheap booze run after (or before if it's that kind of day).

I got the house special pho. My vegetarian friend (weird, I know, that I have any of those...) was actually able to find something he could eat--vegetable with fried noodles or something. The rest of our table got the house special pho.

No complaints all around. We were all so hungover from drinking all morning and afternoon that by 6pm after a well earned nap, we couldn't stomach the thought of another shot. Pho So 1 saved the day. And night that followed."}
{"text":"Came around here a little after midnight.

AMBIANCE:
Pretty spacious with a lot of seating and tables for big groups. Laid back atmosphere.

FOOD:
I ordered #65, charbroiled pork chop with rice. For $7.95 it was a reasonable price considering how much food I got on my plate, I like the veggies I got on the side, the pork was cooked just right, the meat was tender and easy to cut into smaller pieces yay!

SERVICE:
This is where they did a poor job. First time we asked for refills, our waiter forgot so we asked another waiter, he gave us this look that said \"I will cut you fools for even asking me that!\". After about five minutes he comes back and just slams a pitcher of water on our table. 

In the end this place was good for a late night food run. The service was the only bad thing about this place. I would probably come here during the day when the waiter is not sleepy, forgetful and giving mean I-will-kill-you looks."}
{"text":"The restaurant is pretty big and the decorations are mediocre. The servers are very kind and friendly. 

What I ordered was rare beef pho and shrimp spring rolls. The rare beef was thin and melted into your mouth. The soup base didn't have much MSG, and it was not watered down like other pho places I have been too. The pho was so smooth and delicious! Also, I put bean sprouts in it to give it a crunch to it and wow! Spectacular flavors! The shrimp spring rolls was not my favorite. (Two stars) I do not know what they put in it, but it just tasted really weird, maybe too much mint? But there was this vegetable that was thick and long, which I just took out. Too much chewing! Also, the peanut sauce tasted like watered down. I would not suggest getting this!

Overall, I like this restaurant."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite pho place around. I've tried most of the pho places around china town and I'd have to say this place ranks at the top. Their bowls are a pretty good size at a decent price. The food always comes out hot and fresh with tons of flavor. Our orders were taken pretty quickly and waters refilled occasionally.

I usually get #10 and I like my steak on the side so they stay rare. Aside from their pho, I've had their bbq once and it was alright. I wouldn't normally go to a pho restaurant to get viet bbq though, that's just me. The spring rolls and egg rolls are pretty good sizes and tasty."}
{"text":"Tasty place for a late-night bowl of pho- they're open til 3AM!
Ordered the #10 (pho with rare brisket, tripe, and more, then added meatballs for $1.50 extra) and the #54 vermicelli bowl with pork and eggroll. 

Food arrived quickly, and was tasty- soup was piping hot, pork in vermicelli bowl had a good char on it, and the inclusion of the eggrolls in the bowl negated the need for an appetizer. Portions for both were generous. Toppings for pho and fish sauce for bowl were fresh and brought out promptly after placing our orders.

Service was polite and friendly, water and tea were brought over before we even asked. SIgnage above each table indicates that you are to pay the cashier up front using your table number.

Minus a star for $15 minimum- that's pretty high for a \"minimum\"."}
{"text":"One of the best pho place in calgary!the restaurant is very clean and service is fast.this place is like my second home."}
{"text":"I went here with a group and we ordered quite a few dishes and shared. 

My dish was the charbroiled shrimp and egg roll bowl. When they brought it out, it had pork in it. They immediately took it back and replaced it with the correct meal. It was really good, but there wasn't a lot of shrimp. 

We also got spring roles, which were very good, especially the peanut sauce. 

The iced coffee was good if you like strong coffee, but it was mostly ice! The cup was gone in just a few gulps. It was a total waste of money. 

We also ordered a number 95, which is thin pieces of rare beef. This dish used to be so much better. Before, it was a generous portion of beef marinated in lime. Now, the dish is more expensive with a smaller portion and they changed the sauce to be more sweet. The old way was so much better. 

The 888 was okay. It was an all meat platter and it had a nice grilled flavor, but the meat was pretty dry. 

Service was pretty good, they made sure our waters were always full."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed our visit here. The service we got was great and the food came out fast/hot and delicious.

We ordered the shrimp salad rolls and the vermicelli rice bowl with chicken and spring rolls. I was very surprised by the portions - they were big for the price.

Also, they had great Vietnamese iced coffee.

Would I go back? Pho So!"}
{"text":"The food here is pretty good.  Some of us had hu tieu (clear noodles soup), pho, bo kho, stir fried noodles.  Overall, all the items were good.  The stir fried noodles dish surprised me a little, I didn't expect the deep fried crunchy rice noodles there.  It was ok, I wouldn't get it again but it worths a try :)"}
{"text":"You know what's a good cure for the post Vegas strip hangover?

Pho.

And that's exactly why I ordered Bun noodles instead.

In all seriousness Vegas' asian district has a decent pho place that attracts tourists and locals alike and according to my Vietnamese buddy who frequents Pho So 1 after many a crazy weekend, he says the Pho is alright.

They have a fairly extensive menu offering all manner of vietnamese dishes outside of the family soup & noodles like the aforementioned bun, and rice plates with pork chop, beef filet mignon, etc.  Also many chinese fusion dishes and some hot pot items also make the list.  

The restaurant is spacious and being off strip, parking is free and easy.  If you have a car and looking for some good, cheap eats, Pho So 1 is as good a choice as any."}
{"text":"I love coming to this place. It's one of my top 3 Pho places to go. I haven't been here in awhile and just recently had the time to enjoy #54! Everything was good, food, customer service, tidiness... The only thing I have to say is:

Returning back I've noticed they now have the option to BBQ at a table (with a portable burner). I would love to try it here... only problem was there is NO ventilation. They didn't even keep the front door open or bothered to open it when 2 tables had the grill. The place got smokey and maybe it was worse because I was next to one of the tables but it bothered me the whole experience I was there.

Hopefully they can change that. I like coming here and the staff."}
{"text":"My dad likes the bo tai chanh and bo la lot (rare lime beef and beef wrapped in la lot). The lime beef is pretty good especially with the dipping sauce. Their pho is ok too."}
{"text":"It was my first time having Pho... yes you can judge me.  

I never actually knew what Pho was so I never really needed to go.  Luckily we had some really great people bring us here for our first experience.   I'm glad we went with them because they knew what we should order for our first try.   We went with the all meat Pho without tripe.  Tripe, as it was explained to me, scared me.  We also ordered the beef and rice plate along with their egg rolls.  

First off, their egg rolls were so yummy.   My husband normally doesn't like egg rolls but he loved these!  Yay! I think we were supposed to share these but we ate them too fast.  Oops.   I'll buy extra next time Roger...  The beef and rice dish was awesome.  So much flavor in their beef and so much of it!  Pho?  It's a brothy noodle soup with options to add chicken or beef or shrimp.  Loved it! We like spicy so we added some sriracha sauce to the broth.  Oh so good!   

The place itself is clean with lots of seating.  I think there is a language barrier so I just have to point at what I want to place my order.  Otherwise I'm excited about Pho!"}
{"text":"Pretty standard Pho besides my bowl being packed with a tons of protein (meat). It was actually a huge bowl that I could barely make half a dent in.

Had a chance to try the 7 course beef as well.

I'd visit it again."}
{"text":"I come here all the time, its the best Pho here in Vegas, the staff already knows what I want once I walk through those doors. The interior isn't the nicest, and on some nights, the service might be slacking, but it is always busy. You get water and Jasmine Tea with every visit of no extra charge, nice bonus!! When I dine in, my family usually orders one order of the Spring Roll (which is deep fried, and served to you with lettuce, pickled carrots and Daikon, cucumbers and their special Sauce), one order of the Summer Rolls (which is the fresh rolls of shrimp, pork, sprouts, pho noodle, and lettuce wrapped in Rice Paper and served with a peanut sauce). I order the #10 Pho Dac Biet Xe Lua (Combination of Rare Flank, Brisket, Well-done Flank, Tripe and Tendon). The prices are reasonable. Parking is no problem and the staff is friendly. They do accept cash and credit. The best part is they are open till 3a."}
{"text":"late night different staff bland taste... It was weird the soup never used to taste like this! I had to keep adding fish sauce... It just wasn't the same and the red meat tasted like it's been out.. Smh"}
{"text":"This place made me mad.  It was hot despite the fans running, there were flies.  I needed a minute to review the menu but the server didn't come back for like 5.  The food itself was good, the pho was great, the portions were generous.  I just feel like it's a bad idea to go in the day time if it's not winter, and I wish it were cleaner.  I might try again in the winter if the flies are gone since the other reviews are claiming this is a decent place."}
{"text":"The place looked nice and modern. 
The old lady that gave our menu was off putting. No smiles, no hi or hello. NOTHING! did not even tell us how to place our order. 
Finally after a little while a younger man came along and took our orders. He on the other was pleasant. Our food was delivered right away by a young lady who was also pleasant. 

Food was ok. I definitely had better pho than what i had at that place. Broth was a little bland. They didn't have the chilli oil which was a great disappointment. 

Came to the counter to pay our bill, and the same grumpy old hag was taking our money. She was just miserable and it shows. Will definitely not come back nor recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times in the past, but it's been about 2 years since my latest visit a few days ago. First, the food. Compared to the other pho restaurants in LV, this is one of the ones. Unfortunately, that's the only positive about this place. Unfortunately, everything about the place overshadow the decent food and just plain out bring the place down. Dining there was like dining from hell. First, the service is about the worst I've ever experienced. They spilled the boiling pho on my gf's friend and rather than apologize, they put the blame on her. Second, they completely got my order wrong and while they admitted it, they never corrected so I ended up eating the wrong pho anyway since I was too hungry waiting for what I ordered. Next, the entire place was disorganized and smelly. Busboys were busting tables all around us while staff were running around but never really getting our orders or that of our neighbors' orders properly. I can only guess this place is still in business because people don't know where else to eat in LV. Here's a tip. Spend the money and pay 3x the price to eat pho at one of the restaurants in any of the major hotels (Mandalay, Bellagio, etc...) and you will still get better value for your money. As for this hell hole, they should be grateful we didn't sue for the spill. My gf spent the rest of the meal healing her hand with ice while I tried to convince it's not wort hassle pursuing a lawsuit."}
{"text":"Used to go here all the time until the last few times I walked in and couldn't handle all the dirty dishes sitting around and good covering the floor. I don't plan on going back. They really need some more staff or something."}
{"text":"Fresh vegie and yummy Nam Neong.We are enjoy eating. Good service. More over, We are appriciate that."}
{"text":"As we walk in no one greets us as the host is on his phone. When we tried to go look for a seat he then put his phone away to ask us how many people is in our party. After we all got seated we put in our order. 3 out of the 4 people got their foods while the fourth person waited for the food to come out. We kept looking for our server and asked the other server for our food. No one even came over to acknowledge us until the 3 people were done eating. There were no aplogies or anything. Never coming back here again."}
{"text":"This place never seems to disappoint me. I'm always extremely satisfied on every visit. The food is great so as the service. It's a great family restaurant and caters crowd of every kind"}
{"text":"My husband craves this place.  He would eat pho here every single day if he could.  I like pho, but I am not obsessed. So I usually put him off for a while, usually we go once every 2 weeks or so.   After coming here for pho we don't go anywhere else now.  We also take all our guests here atleast once. You can tell it is has a \"cult\" following.

The restaurant setting is sort of like an Asian diner.  A little dated with cheesy fake silk flowers, but relatively clean restaurant. Every table has popular condiments like Sriracha, hoisin, fish/soy sauce, and chili paste, napkins, soup spoons, and chopsticks.  The service can very a bit variable, especially with ordering, which is why I give it 4 stars rather than 5.  Sometimes it is attentive, sometimes you are waiting and trying to catch any waiter's attention when it is busy.  Once you have their attention, service is pretty good and quick.

The menu is huge and everything is incredibly affordable, actually a real good value! Typical appetizers such as spring rolls, summer rolls,  and satay.  They have atleast 20+ pho soup dishes, and plenty of noodle, rice, and stirfried dishes.
I am a pretty particular eater. I don't eat any starches (no rice, noodles, etc), Pho So always accommodates my no noodle request correctly when I order pho.  The broth tastes light and is consistent every time, but not particularly unique.  The broth is the basis of every single one of their pho soups, so all the pho orders come out in a matter of minutes of ordering, since they just require the requested meats, rice noodles, and the ladling the generic broth over it.  

I have tried other dishes there, like the bo luc lac, which is delicious and a decent portion for the price.  Although I haven't gotten it myself, I see many people order the meats for the do-it-yourself grill and then put it in a lettuce leaf adding rice noodles, vegetables, and condiments.  Looks fun.

Alcohol offerings are a few Asian beers and a basic \"house\" red or white wine (AKA Sutter Home)...that is it.

In summary, I give them 4 stars.  For the price, the food is good and consistent.  Service is always friendly, but occasionally it is hard to get your order in when it is busy."}
{"text":"The taste and quality of the food has gone down tremendously 
My friend ordered beef stew. It was super salty that he almost got a stroke from it.
Mine was Pho. It was bleh.
The end"}
{"text":"The good thing about this restaurant is that they have a big dining area, which is great for large groups. They were willing to accommodate our large party of over 12 people.
In my opinion, the food was decent, it wasn't bad, but I've had better pho else where. My husband on the other hand thought it was good. I ordered the Pho Chin Nam, and while the beef was good, the soup could have used some improvement. I felt like it was missing something, that made the flavor lacking for me."}
{"text":"I'm gonna keep this simple, you can't go wrong here. whatever you order will come out in heaping amounts, and it will be extremely fresh and delicious. This is the spot is you want to try any and all kinds of Viet food.....this is a great place to meet up with friends to share food so you can have many tastes. You'll love place and will keep coming back.
Order some 33's while you there....really refreshing beer!!"}
{"text":"I've eaten at a lot of pho places in Las Vegas and this one by far is my favorite. The broth is amazing by itself even before I add garnishments. They have my favorite Vietnamese coffee too. Very affordable AND they are open 24 hours!! Quick service too! Love it!"}
{"text":"What lured me to choose this place for my pho cravings is the late hours. I came here with a table of 6 and we were seated right away no problem. They gave us waters right away and the waiters are very attentive.

I ordered a #14 pho which had rare steak, tendon, skirt flank and tripe. The ratio of noodles to soup was perfect, but the rest of the meats were not proportioned evenly. It was literally just all tripe (which is okay, but more steak or flank would be great too.)

Overall, I would come back just because I always crave pho around midnight~"}
{"text":"Really good Vietnamese food! You have to try the pork spring rolls and the bu lac luc (shaken beef).. I had a flavor overload ... Everything was super good!"}
{"text":"First visit here but won't be our last. Took a chance to eat at another Vietnamese restaurant in Vegas. Love that they offer the table grill. So fresh and good and cooked to perfection because you grill it yourselves. We went with the beef, shrimp squid combo, enough food for 4, so yes, we over ate, but it was worth the calories to the last savory, sweet morsel! The waiter said they will soon open until 2AM."}
{"text":"Last year we ate here.  It was quite good that we came back this year.  Total bust this time.  The thit nng and sn nng tasted like rubber. Chè ba màu had burned beans.  Others in my party were disappointed with their food too."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. Pho's been around for a long time now and it's never failed to impress. The atmosphere is warm and inviting, greeting you at the door with a blast of Vietnamese spices and flavors waiting for you inside. Service is quick and efficient, and the food never takes too long to make it to your table. The classic pho is always perfect and fresh made, and all the other dishes follow suit! Best parts of the meal for me are always the generous portions of pho, the egg rolls and spring rolls tie the meal together nicely, and the shrimp is just to die for. When the meal's all said and done, the bill will make you feel even better about the meal, and you always leave knowing you got the best bang for your buck. Ten out of ten, would recommend to everyone i know, if I hadn't already ^_^"}
{"text":"Pho came out fast. Super salty though. Service was nonexistent. No water refill or bite check, but that's how most Asian restaurants usually do it. The pho was good too because there wasn't a crazy amount of noodles in it. That's pretty much it."}
{"text":"Good late night food, been here a couple times with friends and family. I like their tripe and pho. The waiter is funny and friendly, this is my go to pho place. I usually go here for late night meals."}
{"text":"Updated review, egg roll is back !!! Its good but salty. 


Hmm New management and im not going anymore.
I have been this place for 10 years
Always ordered #10, spring roll or egg roll and i did the same for today.
Egg roll was the worst ever.
They said nothing has been changed but there is...
Lady said its not new management but her husband said yes.. 
Hmm i really don't care if its new or not
Only thing i care about is taste..."}
{"text":"sooo not appetizing to eat when there are a DOZEN flies hovering over me...barf!"}
{"text":"It's been a tradition in family for us to always go here before we go back to Cali. My favorite thing to get is bun cha gio Tom thit nuong!"}
{"text":"Pho So 1 is tucked away in a corner in a long hall-like seating area with entrance/exit doors on each end, giving people access to enter from the storefront on Centre street, or from the back where there is a parking lot. Seat yourself and await your tea. The restaurant interior isn't much to look at, but there is a large fish tank with a gigantic fish inside, which I always like to watch from afar. 

I was introduced to this place via a couple of friends who use this place as their go-to place for pho. It is definitely good soup. Really good spring and salad rolls as well. And best of all? Cheap! You can have a filling and satisfying meal here for around $10 easy. It's especially nice on a cold night, when all you want is some spicy hot broth and soft noodles. Really good soup, definitely worth checking out."}
{"text":"Meh. Went here today with a friend to get rid of a pho craving that ive been having for a week. 

Interior: The dining area was dirty, and a bee was flying around our table so we switched spots. The saucers had crusty sauces on then and the tables were sticky. Tables were sticky. 

Food: i got the #10 combo pho. It was decent. The broth wasnt as tasty as id like, and the temperature wasnt as hot either. Id rate the pho 7/10. Ill give them credit for being the fastest pho preparers though. My pho came out in 1 min. Even faster then the side plate with mint, bean sprouts etc. 

Service: it was very fast and prompt. Server came out with water as soon as were seated. He was pretty friendly as well.

Overall it was decent. I wont be back however. Ill stick to Pho Saigon 8 and Pho Kim Long (if i absolutely need pho past 11pm)."}
{"text":"If you like eating with bugs here's the place! Glad I was half way done with my meal. 
 My boyfriend and I even told the waiter and he just looked at and said I'll let them know but he didn't. So when we gone up to pay to the register we mentioned it and just said,\" things like this happen we spray every month and make sure everything is clean, I'll give you 10% off and everyone is happy.\" I mention these things shouldn't happen when your eating. I was so upset that I walked out because I couldn't believe he said that. When my boyfriend gets in the car I asked did he say anything else he said no. But I checked the bill and he didn't even give the 10% off ."}
{"text":"The best place for authentic Vietnamese food!! Me and my boyfriend are here atleast once a week! No other place compares! Not the best service but the food comes out quick and is not expensive at all"}
{"text":"I used to eat pho so 1 with my family when we come to Vegas. Their pho is NOT good at all!!! We stop going their for years. Then we found other pho place like Kim Long or pho Saigon 8 which right down the street. We went back to pho so 1 this passed Saturday to try again with my friends. I must say it was a HUGE MISTAKES!!!!! The services was horrible and the foods was NOT good! Myself, my husband & my son came in last and I order bun bo hue, it was ok and my husband & son order pho. It took them at least 30 minutes or more. After we waited for 20 minutes, I went to the cashier, which I think she's the owner. I ask her about my 2 bowl of pho. She brushed my off in a very rude way. Then she said \"u need to wait cuz there's 20 bowl of pho togo ahead of u\"!!! By then I was mad but I didn't want to say anything. So I went back to my table and patiently wait until another 10 more minutes. By then my husband was really upset! He got up & went back to the counter and talk to one of the guy which we also think he's the owners son, cuz he did not wear his uniform. He's not a tall guy, kinda chubby and of course not good looking at all but he sure act like he's all that! Anyways, my husband ask him about the 2 bowl of pho. He told my husband in a very rude way again, \" we have 20 bowl of pho togo &  u have to wait!!\". My husband was so upset then said, \"u can't make 2 bowl of pho for us & let the 20 bowl wait.  It only take 3 minutes to make 2 bowl of pho\". They rather let their dine-in customers to wait & loose us for good or just push the togo wait for 2-3 minutes & makes their customer's happy! I guess they don't need customers cuz they think that they have so much that if they loose us know cares! To build customers takes a long time. But to LOOSE customers, not  long at all! Anyways, we still have to wait for our pho for another 10 more minutes until we get to eat our pho. By the time they bring out the pho. I over heard  that they have party of 20 coming. So they started to clean up our table just to get the other parties in. By then I was upset becuz they took a long time for our  pho to come out, then they rushed us that's really bad!!!!!! We will never go back & I will let everyone that I know not to go to PHO SO 1. Who ever read this, please don't go to pho so 1 cuz they will treats their customers like SH-T!"}
{"text":"It is really hit or miss with this place. If you go in with 10 or more people, you will get okay service because their tips depend on it. If you are regular folk like myself, (family of 4) you will be on your own.

I ordered eggrolls, fries, pho, and crispy noodle. The pho came first. Eggrolls came 20 minutes later and we had to ask again and remind the staff. 

We ordered fries and they never came. It was around 6 pm so I thought the servers would be attentive. But we were wrong. We had to flag them down for a refill of water. We had to tell them to remove the charge for food that never came.

I watched the first server leave the restaurant presumably it was the end of his shift. Yet no one else came to check on us. Thumbs down for sure. 

While we were waiting for our eggrolls I noticed another Customer come in and be seated. She was just 1 person and she was waited on 3 times before we for our second round. 

Good thing is, if you do not like this place just go to another pho restaurant-  many other options on in spring mountain."}
{"text":"Good tasty, nice service. Beef pho soup has 6 choice and each one all delicious.Tai tea is also good to drink. I will take my family to eat it again."}
{"text":"The broth at this place is pretty decent - if you've been to pho saigon 8, it tastes a bit like the broth there. The coolest thing about this place (I thought), was that you can get \"extras\" on the side of whichever savory goodness you love best in your usual pho special.  I got an \"extra\" of tripe on the side, which came in its own soup and which I could dunk into my bowl at leisure.  The sides are not too pricey for how much you get ($2.50 for a huge fistful of tripe), and if you love the soup, it comes with that too.  Other than this, I'd say this place is maybe a bit above average, though nothing to write home about."}
{"text":"This was a really good bowl of pho.  I was disappointed when I saw the bowl was not as large as the usual bowls that I get, but that medium-sized bowl really filled me up.  The aroma from the bowl of pho felt like I had something homemade.  I wouldn't have gone here unless I had a car.  There were so many items on the strip that I wanted to try.

There is an asian strip off of Spring Mountain with so many restaurants and stores.  You can save money and have a good meal by taking a little drive."}
{"text":"Go to Vietnamese spot when we visit family in Las Vegas.  My fiance loves the Pho and I always get the pork chop rice with over easy egg and never disappoints.  Would definitely recommend if looking for some Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"\"My mom just stomped on a roach in the bathroom and when I asked to speak to a manager about it.. They never brought one out to me and had me just tell a server.. Not coming back and telling my friends and all of yelp\" - this being my most recent TIP posted for this establishment. 

Again, another establishment I hate to do this to since I was such a regular at this place, but in all honesty, when you see a cockroach in a place where you like to eat, it really does make you want to never come back. Last night 12/8/15 I was dining with a large group of friends (about 18 people) and a manager of some kind (he was not wearing restaurant uniform) made his way to even greet us and thank us for coming to their establishment. 

Everything was fine, until my mother and I decided we needed to use the restroom. My mom has said to me several times that she even though it's cheap and the food is decent, she doesn't like coming here because she always sees small cockroaches in the bathroom. I had personally never seen them before, so I would continue to come here whenever friends would want a pho run. This time on 12/8/15, it was a different story. My mother and I walked into a very dirty restroom and as she entered the handicap stall, she yelled at me on the other side, oh man.. see there goes one cockroach. and then I hear \"stomp\" and she goes, \"I killed it.\" She allowed me to come and see for myself, and that is the pix I have recently posted. 

We even saw another small cockroach on the floor near the sink, but I wasn't in the mood to stomp on another one, because quite frankly that's not my responsibility. Seeing a cockroach in an eatery establishment, it does something to your stomach thats hard to describe. I enjoy the food here, and even my meal that night was delicious, which was number 71 btw, the diced beef with onions and tomato rice. 

I very politely asked to speak to a manager, and the server asked if everything was okay, and I kindly responded, \"yes, it has nothing to do with the food or the service, that was fine, but there's an issue with the bathroom and I just wanted to discuss that with a manager\" the server nodded his head and said okay. and while we were still packing our left overs and splitting our bill, I was waiting for a manager.. none came. I kept looking at the server I spoke to, and it's almost as if he was trying to ignore me/ avoid making eye contact. 

I finally after patiently waiting and still no manager came out, I approached the server and asked if he was going to get the manager, or if he just wanted me to tell him. So I ended up just telling the server, and he responded, \"Oh well we sent someone to the bathroom already and they didn't see anything.\" and I responded, \"oh really? because here is the photo proof. and I can tell you exactly where it's laying.\" What's really poor service and disappointing is that instead of just being like, \"I sent someone back there and we didn't see anything, but we apologize for that experience and we will look into it more and making sure we better attend to our restrooms...\" they kinda brushed it off like, \"oh well, we didn't see one, so no there's no cockroaches here..\" I insulted because it was like they were saying or making it seem like I was making it up. but no I have picture proof.. and I would post this kinda stuff unless it was true. I even said to the server, I like the food here and I like coming here, but I cannot continue to come back if you guys don't care about your bathrooms and the cockroaches. and honestly the lack of interest in fixing the issue is enough to make me want to never come back. There's plenty of good pho and Viet food in this city. This is the last time Pho So 1 will see me, my business, and those I associate with."}
{"text":"This place is good, cheap and fast.

If you are looking for good customer service and great ambiance then this place isn't for you.

If you are looking for a place to get your fix of good vietnamese food other than your standard Pho, then I would come here...and thats what we got... all 4 of us.

This is what we ordered
(1) 1 order of Cha Gio (Vietnamese Eggrolls)
(2) Bun Bo Hue (Vietnamese spicy beef noodle soup w/ Pork feet)
(3) Banh Canh (Vietnamese Udon)
(4) Mi Xao Mem (Stir Fried Egg Noodles -- soft)
(5) Pho
(6) Thai Tea
(7) Vietnamese Coffee
(8) Sam Bo Luong

Like I said a good place for a variety of Vietnamese dishes. I don't have anything bad to comment on this restaurant. Gave it a 3 out of 5 stars because the food is good but not mind blowing. In addition to the restaurant always being jammed packed."}
{"text":"If your hungry for some great food, stop here. Skip the fast greasy food joints next door and come here. The service will be better, the food comes out just as fast, and the taste is remarkable! I love the family atmosphere and these young servers give you the respect and smiles that other \"chains\" are missing. Huge thumbs up. Nothing on the menu will disappoint you!"}
{"text":"Food is always great and fresh. One of the best in Calgary. Price matches the quality! Weekly stop in here and always consistently perfect! Salad rolls, and 22B - beef if your curious!"}
{"text":"I'm NEVER coming back here again! Just went to go eat here with my mom and was harassed by the owner simply because we didn't want to pay for something we did not like so we did not eat it. She said her food is not gross & that it costs her labor and money. And said we better pay with a credit card. So we told her to call the police but we were not paying for something we did not eat. She then proceeded to tell us to never come back & told us \"fuck you\" & called my mom a slut. This place needs a health inspection and a change of management !!!"}
{"text":"Quick service and food came out pretty fast. A friend recommended this place for the beef pho. I was not disappointed."}
{"text":"Well the pho here is pretty authentic I think it actually may taste better than pho Kim long and they're open pretty late well until 3 at least so it's a good place to go for late night pho . Only issue is that when I come here I haven't even looked at the menu and they're already rushing me to order like chill man I'm trying to figure out what I want . But other than the customer service being kinda bad I guess the place is sorta clean and they're always serving us right away and the food comes out fast most of the time , it's a good place to eat and go if you're in a rush . Plus their pho like I said is pretty good , well the broth . But that doesn't mean there isn't MSG in it so don't eat too much of it now"}
{"text":"My boyfriend loves their pho so we stop by every time we're in town. I'm very picky with my pho and find it to be alright. My noodles were a little soggy but not terrible. Eggs rolls are good though!"}

{"text":"Last night I was stoping by pho 1 and eat Vietnamese pho omg unforgettable tasting of pho in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"I came here at 1:30 am because my goto spot was closed. Place was just ok. The spring rolls we're standard. The peanut sauce they we're served with was runny and when I tasted it tastedlike rotten eggs. I don't use much of it anyways, so it I didn't make a big deal of it. Whatever it was, it had gone bad.

The Pho was just ok. Not the best, not the worst.

I probably won't be back."}
{"text":"Their customer service was a no star rating...  Went in with friends and we're ignored.  Had to ask for menus as well as water to start. We saw a sign saying \"$15 minimum purchase required for credit cards\"  we made a point in asking our waiter if that included debit as well...  He said it did not. We ordered our food and only had three people in our party...  They had served at least 6 people who had come in after us.  We were left waiting an hour.  I had to raise both hands to get the attention of a waitress.  After telling her we had been waiting for an hour she got us our food right away.  When paying for our bill the cashier said that debit card is included in minimum payment of $15 

Pho and the spring rolls were very delicious which is why I gave 2 stars instead of one lol"}
{"text":"Hands down one of the best Vietnamese restaurant in Las Vegas.  I used to love PS1 now I love it even more.  The newly renovated restaurant is beautiful with modern decor and cozy atmosphere.  But the food is even better.  Bo Tom Muc Nuong Vi and other Wrap & Rolls dishes are phenomenal.  Pho bowls are generous portions with flavorful broth.  Service is fast and friendly.  They can accommodate big groups.  It's the perfect place to go for Viet food when you're in Las Vegas.  It's worth every penny."}
{"text":"As someone who travels the country in search of great meals, Pho So 1 is in my top 5 below $10 meals in the United States.  

This is Pho the way it was meant to be enjoyed.  Anyone who has reduced the stars to below 5 has done so because of:

Customer Service or Location or They Don't Understand What Good Pho Is:


As my wife says, if your pho place has a table cloth, get out of there!  Pho is like soul food, the place should be a little messy and unfriendly.  It's a $10 meal - family-owned.  They are great with locals and remembering names.

I just love this place, and you would be hard-pressed to find a better meal in Vegas!"}
{"text":"The pho was okay, but this is Vegas so it may be the best in Vegas, but not for pho anywhere. I would not return as a couple of other pho places in Vegas are a tad better."}
{"text":"I always come here when I'm in vegas. Their pho is decent and hence the four stars, not five.  I love their bo nuong vi...their mam nem is soooo good. :-) this sauce isn't meant for everyone. They tend to very busy during the lunch hour and opens late. Nothing beats pho after a night of drinking!"}
{"text":"Always come here when we're in Vegas. They have a buttload of Pho places on this street but Pho So 1 has got to be one of the best."}
{"text":"Every now and then i need a reminder of why i dont eat my favorite ethnic dishes very often and why i always resort to cooking stuff at home.

Pho So 1 is the perfect example. 

Service was....yeah it could have been better. We were seated right in front of the cashier and three times they brought over things we didnt order and giving us dirty looks when we said we didnt order them.

Food seriously wasnt all that great. The egg rolls had broken outsides and almost looked like someone sat on them, the fish sauce dip was bland and had no taste at all.

I normally order Hu Tieu My Tho mainly because i havent found a place that makes good Hu Tieu Nam Vang. The egg noodles had a fishy after taste to it that's not suppose to be there, the noodles were way too dry, and there wasnt enough sauce to hydrate the noodles to give them a little play so you can work with them and importantly, for flavor."}
{"text":"Meh.  I've definitely experienced better.  Way better.

Service was pretty horrendous here during my recent visit.  Granted, we had a group of 19 so I guess it was a bit understanding.  Our orders were mixed up and the person bringing our orders went around our table asking who ordered what.  Many times, he came to our tables with a dish that no one ordered and asked whether we ordered it.  It was pretty chaotic.

The food was also horrendous.  The Pho we received were not hot, tasted mediocre, and they seriously should reconsider naming their Pho #1.   Horrible Pho.  I also ordered the Bun Nem Nuong and it was equally as horrendous.  The noodles were hard, the nem nuong were chewy, and the egg rolls were meh. 

I will never go back here."}
{"text":"I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!! It has fast service and super great food. I've been to other pho joints but their pho broth doesn't even compare. Also they give hugh sides of all the extras that go in the soup."}
{"text":"Hung out with Vietnamese Peeps growing up and so I've had my fair share of \"FUH\" Soups. Now, what makes this soup stand out from the rest I've tried is the Broth. Broth is the main thing that differs one soup from another. Let me tell you, this place has Nailed it! 

Special Combo: rare slices of steak(cooks in the broth), well-done brisket, flank, tendon and tripe. Half the time I'd order this and the other half, just brisket, tendon and rare steak. Not only is the broth Super Succulent, the noodles got the right bite and they give lavish amounts of meat (opposed to every other place i've been to).

Honorable Mention: Fried Egg Rolls - These are one of the best Vietnamese Egg Rolls I've ever had. There's just something about them that makes it exceptional from every other one i've had in Vietnamese noodle houses.

Perfect for Cold Winter Nights! There are numerous Pho/Viet noodle spots but this one got me looking no further! I used to come here 1-4 nights a week for a while.. If you have a favorite Pho spot, do me a favor and give this one a try and let me know what ya think!"}
{"text":"After reading some of the reviews from Yelp, the Mr. and I decided to get some Pho here, during our weekend Vegas trip.

It's a nicely located not too far from the strip (and close to the Zombie Apocalypse Store); if you don't have a car I suggest you check on the price of a cab first, it may not be worth the expense.

The staff if very friendly, quick and attentive.  Our food arrived quickly and our other requests were taken just as fast and with a smile.  I give the staff 5-stars.

However, the food it's self is ok.  Nothing spectacular, but certainly satisfies the craving for Pho.  

Being from LA we have some one great Pho place in Chinatown, that by far is 10x better than Pho So 1, but as I've mentioned if you have a craving, as we did, and you're not familiar with other places, this would do well enough."}
{"text":"This is my \"go-to\" spot. I normally order pho Bo vien large extra meatball and a large tsingtao. I like the larger sizes of meatballs they use and the broth is pretty delicious. This place is usually good on getting your pho to you in a timely manner, but the the same could be said with most pho places since it's not that difficult to prepare. I have yet to venture from my usual but when I do, I shall review it."}
{"text":"I wouldn't know how crappy the pho is at this place because they didn't  bother taking my order at all and I'm viet too. Wtf?  I sat there for over 10 minutes and not a single waiter came by to take my order.   They should rename this place to Pho So Zero. And I'm talking about zero service!   So I got up and left.  I've had better pho in san jose anyway."}
{"text":"OMG! I went in to this restaurant because Pho Kim Long had such a long line. I did not expect the food would be this good. I used to come here a few years ago, but everything from interior to food was top-notch.
We ordered a spring roll and beef combo pho. IT WAS DELISH!!!!!
I am not going to other pho places. It was BOMB!!!"}
{"text":"Come for the food and try to forget about the service.

After a few pho-less years, I got it in my head to try some pho again. Based on some reviews, the general consensus was to try here as they were considered to be one of the better places for pho.

The reviews were right on the pho (and on the service). Normally when I go eat pho there's only a few selections. Not so here. There's a several page menu with a LARGE selection of items including non-pho items. Fortunately, if you aren't sure what to get some of the more popular items have photos so you can see what you're ordering.

Once ordered the food came in a decent amount of time. The main issue is getting anyone's attention. While the restaurant is FULL of staff they all have this sort of focused look in their eyes while never making eye contact with anyone. Hence they'll never see you waving your hand as you need another glass of water or help with the choking victim (I kid on the choking). 

Eventually it you time it right, you'll give someone who hasn't learned the \"Avoid Looking into the Eye\" trick and you'll get your service. That said the staff were nice when we got them (they even offered us an extra appetizer from a mistake order from another table).

Just know you'll have a hard time getting service.

That said the food is good, the restaurant is clean, and there's plenty of parking since it's in an outdoor mall. if you want some good pho and you don't mind a bit of a wait on service try it out. Besides the waiting allows the food more time to digest. =)"}
{"text":"Pho So 1 is very consistent in taste, flavor, and service.  It is a popular late night option for me and my friends (and thousands of other regulars, apparently).  I usually get the Bun Bo Nuong (Charbroiled Beef over Vermicelli Noodles and Salad) or the Bun Chay (Fried Tofu over Vermicelli Noodles and Salad).  We also get the Vegetable Eggrolls often, which are delicious with the pickled carrots and radish that are provided.  The servers are usually nice and efficient.  I appreciate the fresh basil and mint provided.

Why 3-stars instead of 4 or 5?  The water has a weird taste.  Maybe a filter needs to be changed more often on the ice machine and water dispenser.  Also, the tables and floors are usually really sticky.

But the food and service are good enough that we will keep coming back when we are in the mood for pho or vermicelli bowls."}
{"text":"Pho So 1 is always busy and always good. I have been solid here for 25 years of coming
to Las Vegas and it never disappoints. Randomly I will attempt a different pho place however 
none of the other places in the area can compare when it comes to the pho.  Especially stay
clear of the dump across the street pho Sing Sing."}
{"text":"I just can't anymore with Pho So 1. 

I had a cockroach crawl across the table. They offered me a free coconut water.
They now have a credit card minimum of 15 dollars on food that normally costs EIGHT dollars for a bowl.
The restaurant is utterly FILTHY.  Under the tables, the bathroom, are just disgusting.
The day staff is rude.
The place is loud as hell. You get an entire family of Vietnamese families, they will sit in the middle, blast music from their phones, have screaming kids and there's no way to break up the sound. It's just obnoxiously loud EVERYWHERE. 

Very disappointing."}
{"text":"Been coming here since high school. The #1 reason why I keep coming back to this location is because of the pho broth (obviously) but I just feel like it tastes better than any other pho places I've been. 

This place has been renovated and I do like the new decor and look of the place. It feels much cleaner. 

I usually get the combination pho, egg rolls, spring rolls, or the pork chop rice dish. The last time I was here I got the oxtail pho. While the broth was perfect, I wished they had added more oxtail. I was really hungry! 

If you're looking for a good pho place, come give this place a try! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I'm from Los Angeles and there are 2 of these restaurants by where I live.

When I'm in Vegas and I get a craving for pho, this is the ONLY place to go!  

Not being a local, it was a little hard to find, but well worth it!

Egg rolls - always served piping hot and crunchy!

Pho - I can't say enough good things about it!  It's an experience you have to go here for because delicious, addictive and perfect doesn't even begin to cover it!

Good value, wonderful food and it'll have you coming back for more!"}
{"text":"Terrible service, owner is something else.  Sure the food is good walked out because of her. will never recommend or go back."}
{"text":"Fantastic service, very quick and knowledgeable of the menu. Some of the best pho available in the Valley. 

No need to write a long review, if you enjoy Vietnamese, this is the restaurant to try."}
{"text":"I tried to change it up a bit and retry this pho joint. This place is dirty and the pho is mediocre and broth is bland. I will stick with Pho Saigon 8."}
{"text":"Terrible bun nem nuong.  Pho is whatever. Fried rice sucks.  This place isn't good what it used to be.  They can't even make sua dau nanh hot!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Vietnamese restaurant since I moved the Vegas. But the problem they never took care of the cleanliness of the place for example the chairs are so filthy dirty including the walls and the floors are slippery, I hope the shape up or I'll never be back here again."}
{"text":"I got the name of this restaurant from a Pai Gow dealer at Aria hotel and I was immediately sold. But before I went I decided to read Yelp reviews and saw a mixture of good and bad. But hey I figure it's better to experience it myself. We were seated right away...but it took a good 10 min before anyone stopped by to take our orders. I was kind of disappointed but had read about this part. But when the food came out...my mindset changed entirely. The egg rolls were probably top 3 on my all time list. That's saying a lot bc I've had a lot of great egg rolls across the country. Then the pho came out. I wasn't sure if I was recovering from a hangover but it tasted amazing as well. I got the special and the meat portion was perfect! I usually complained about how little they give you but this place did not skimp out on that area. I would definitely go back if I'm ever in town again!"}
{"text":"Table was dirty.

Order was taken and got asked by 2 others if I was ready to order so apparebtly no table assignment can make things confusing.

Ordered combo pho... no meat balls wtf, dissapointing.

$10.95, also very pricey for no meat balls.

Broth was ok but it wasnt hot enough to wilt the veggies. A big thumbs down for any Vietnamese restaurant.

Did not get any service after getting my food. I had to walk up to the counter to pay.

Don't think I will return. They seem to nickel and dime you for extras that shpuld be included in thw entree."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place after a recommendation from my nail lady (who also happens to be Vietnamese). The hubby and I shared the typical spring rolls. They were excellent! The hubby had #71 which is sliced steak with rice and it was delish. I had shrimp pho and it was good as well. The service was great and they were even excited to give our baby some toys to play with (a bowl and spoon). 

We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Initially when I first got to this pho place I thought that it was going to be good based on how crowded it was.  I was wrong. 

I ordered spring rolls as an appetizer and hu tieu my tho as my lunch entrée.  The spring rolls were just mediocre.  The sauce definitely needed improvement.  It was so watery and lacked a lot of flavor so I had to add more hoison sauce to make it taste better and that didn't help much.  The hu tieu my tho was NASTY.  It wasn't even made with hu tieu.  It came out with regular banh pho noodles.  The worst part of it was the fact that they added tomato sauce to the dish.  I found that to be pretty weird because NO ONE serves it like that anywhere else that I have been.  

The place was busy and they were extremely understaffed.  I had to request for water twice before they actually brought anything back to my table.  I don't recommend this place to anyone.  It was my first time at this place and I definitely won't ever come back again.

This place should be called Pho Not So 1!"}
{"text":"I love this place number 9 rib eye pho its the best."}
{"text":"Great pho place.  I come here quite often when I am in Las Vegas.  Good portions at reasonable prices.  Service is hit or miss.  Sometimes we get a server who cant speak or understand English too well which leads to messed up orders.  They are quick to fix it though."}
{"text":"Went here with the family to compare this store with the same franchise in California.   I have to say the food just isn't up to par, and we prefer the Simi Valley branch the best.  

The fried eggroll was not as good.  And used a different eggroll wrapper which makes a huge difference.  The order came with 4 rolls... The Simi Valley branch comes with 5 rolls.  

We ordered Pho and dry noodles with bbq pork.   No complaints with the Pho, the broth was good, hot, & tasty.   However the other dish...the noodles with bbq was served burnt.   It was inedible.   I thought my son was exaggerating, but he was right.  All I could taste was badly charred meat.  I don't think burnt food should leave the kitchen and served.  

Finally the prices were higher here in LV than in Ca... Like 25% more.   We had to even review our bill and ask the store owner about the difference.  We were told they raised prices recently.  So be sure to check out the prices.

Next time we're out in Vegas I'd like to try out a different Pho place.   I hope Yelpers can steer us to THE best pho place in town."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times now and they're aight. Tonight, I was hankering for something hearty but cheap, and naturally I thought Vietnamese. Had to stay awake so I tried their French coffee with milk, very good. It came out in the apparatus that it brews in, so it was nice and fresh. I had the rice dish with charbroiled beef which was a bit chewy. The vermicelli noodles were also not that great to bite into but they were ok. It was cheap and open late so I would come back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places for pho. I've been to their other restaurants in SoCal and they are just as good. You can't go wrong with their noodles and the egg rolls are always fried perfectly. A great place to dine out if you don't want to break the bank. They are also open late which is a plus."}
{"text":"I was in Vegas for vacation last week and found this place while craving for some pho. It's in large plaza so lots of parking. Inside actually looks larger and cleaner than what it looks from outside  interior is modern and clean, and service was quick and nice.

We ordered spring rolls and they were so much better than ones here in L.A. the wrap is chewy and not so thin like others and was very fresh.

Pho was also good. It wasn't Wow! but I would go back to this place when I'm in vegas next time."}
{"text":"Always such a good place to eat! The food always taste good, great service, and clean. They're newly renovated now and we waited a while for them to reopen, but the new place looks great! Good decor, roomy, feels comfortable. Tonight I tried their vegetarian dish with tofu, my husband had the brisket and flank pho, and we shared summer rolls for an appetizer. All good! One of our go to's when we have to eat out. It's nice when the servers come around and ask if you're enjoying your food."}
{"text":"I have to admit, this place is just ok to me. I like a few of their options, but I usually get a rice plate and I didn't really love it. Refills were hard to come by, which was annoying, but it's ok for the price."}
{"text":"Pho is definitely good to eat when you're hungover. After a fun weekend in Vegas, we stopped by here before heading on home. The wait wasn't too bad that Sunday, but there was a bit of a lunch rush. I ordered the pho with the beef and brisket and it was pretty good. I know pho places can have their bad days (bland broth, salty broth, etc.). I've only been here twice and both times have been good so yayyy."}
{"text":"Good food and service has been very quick for me everytime I go. My new pho spot."}
{"text":"I love pho and this place has the best. I came with my family and ordered some last night and like usual, not disappointed. I have very picky kids but they love  getting pho from here. We have tried a lot of places but this one is our favorite. Now if I can only get my kids to eat it when I make it. Lol. Guess that's why we go out"}
{"text":"This is located in a big shopping plaza off the strip but not too far. Apparently there is many similar ones, not sure if they are all a chain. The wait time took awhile even on a Sunday night!

The pho quality is definitely up there and is pretty authentic. I could barely finish it. Other than that, it's a very typical pho place that fills your drunken needs. Service could be improved a bot but that's about my only gripe."}
{"text":"Tried this place on the advice of a Vegas local who highly recommend the place. Good place to try if you're craving some pho. 

Overall, food was good, nothing spectacular but nothing horrible either. The biggest down side was the service, they weren't rude but it was hard to find any help. Took a while for our server to take our order and for our food to come to us (bigger groups who came in after us received their food first). But after we received our meal, our server was nowhere to be found, we had to ask other servers passing by for help."}
{"text":"I don't know why my boyfriend and I always come here all the time and complain about their pho. 

The taste is decent and the meat is generously given. It's just then broth always comes out warm or even less! Sometimes my rare steak doesn't even cook.

I don't know if it's just me and my boyfriend but we love our soup burning our tongues on our first bite. 

This place is decent but I think we are going to start going back to Pho Kim Long for late night pho fix."}
{"text":"I was really looking forward to the food and ordered what I always get when at a Vietnamese restaurant - the pho with rare beef, tendon, tripe, brisket and flank, and the spring rolls. 

The rolls were alright, but not fresh, the pork and shrimp were super dry like the rolls had been there for awhile. The peanut sauce was so watery and didn't really taste peanutty at all, it was a little gross. 

The pho broth was alright, but the main thing for me was that it wasn't hot, which made me feel like I was eating old food. Noodle soup, in my opinion, should be super hot, with steam coming out for a long time after they serve it. 

Overall it was pretty disappointing, which I'm sad to report."}
{"text":"I am a regular here. I have unwillingly accepted it. It first started with coming here with my family almost weekly. Now that I'm a little more grown up, I see myself coming here willingly with my friends. In all honesty, depending on the day, this place is a hit or miss. I always enjoy the broth and at times, the noodles are cooked perfectly! Their bbq pork vermicelli noodles are also delicious and a great selection for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Very fresh and tasty. Price is great for a higher end Vietnamese restaurant.

Will be back!"}
{"text":"It's pretty good. I ordered rice with porkchops and bun bo hue. They give you heaps of food and the bun bo hue is delicious. And they stay open late!"}
{"text":"This is my fave pho place ever! Super cheap (I think most pho places are anyways...) Big portions, great flavours...and free green tea when you sit down. The staff aren't very fluent in english so they do a thing where you just write down your order number on a piece of paper and they come by to pick it up. I think a lot of places like this do something similar. It's always quick service and great food. I would eat here everyday if I could!"}
{"text":"One of the more popular Viet restaurants in Vegas. Probably second only to Kim Long. I think there are better pho places in town (I'm Vietnamese) so I only come here if I want the Nuong Vi which is a combination of raw meats/seafood which you grill yourself at your table. If you're in the immediate area, you could do worse but certainly if you're coming from the Strip don't drive past all of the other restaurants just to come here unless you want one of their specialty dishes."}
{"text":"A friend of mine order some Vietnamese eggroll and got a little surprise crawling around on the lettuce. It was live snail! It just show that this place doesn't properly wash their vegetables."}
{"text":"RECOMMENDATION:  Pho, Duhhhh!!

This place is very good for being in Vegas and not having too much competition compared to living in So. Cal.  

So if you are in Vegas and craving Pho, drop by here and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is without a doubt the nastiest unsanitary unprofessional low-class Third World Restaurant in Las Vegas as of today. If you're stupid enough to go into this restaurant after my review then you can hear the death throes of bankruptcy and the health department shutting this place down and turning it over to someone else to reinvent it again any day now. This is after going there for 8 good years until recently in the past year a change of ownership within the family has now turned it into a bunch of egomaniac kids with no idea how to run a restaurant. Examples? Heat turned off in January on cold nights inside the restaurant about as cold as it is outside 50 degrees give or take five degrees even the staff were wearing coats and hats serving customers. When I asked about the Heat it wasn't broke or anything to that effect they just didn't want to turn it on, but they did have a heater fan sitting on the bar by the cash register supposedly to heat the whole restaurant and said that the grilled food some people purchase is enough heat to warm up the restaurant LOL. Half the beef for the table barbecue is uneatable literally nothing but fat and tendon as opposed to what they used to serve and what their other family restaurants serve at Viet Noodle Bar just up the street on Spring Mountain. If you want to vomit going to the bathrooms they're filled with roaches urine feces and trash all over the floor and unspeakable body fluids on the walls. The Cashiers beg for cash payment so as to have under the table income and avoid IRS penalties for fraudulently under-reporting cash income. When we realize the barbecue was unedible we asked for a credit or exchange to get something else and the manager on duty which is the nephew of the previous owner now at Viet Noodle Bar with tattoos all over his body a coat and a hat on BECAUSE THE HEAT is off to skim more cash  said, \" I'm not giving you a full refund for the entree,\" and when I said it's up to you to make some kind of adjustment he said, \" well then I'm not making any adjustments.\", and charges the full price which of course is going to be disputed on the credit card never to be paid and this Yelp among other social media reviews like TripAdvisor to rid the Local Clark County Residents of this Diseased Scam. Believe me, I'm not the only one that feels this way. MANY others had this same experience or worse. But you go along and listen to those fake five star posted reviews to this restaurant which is another scam there obviously perpetrating and waste $48 for two entrees that are unedible as you get a ton of bad attitude from the staff towards your farewell as you pay full price for this joke soon to be closed or traded within the Viet Underworld of Criminals. \"CAM ON !!\""}
{"text":"A staple to come to everytime I come to Las Vegas with the gang.

This place has the best Pho in town and this thinly sliced beef dish that 

you grill right in front of you. So delish with the peanut sauce! This is 

surely big enough for 2-3x ppl.  I am getting hungry again!"}
{"text":"My go-to Pho place. I've been going here since I was a kid. It's really convenient when you want your pho fix especially when you're getting off work at 1 AM. They have really good hours.. I think they close at 3 AM. It's quick and tasty. I've gotten the pho, rice plates and even griddle. I recommend if you're looking for something casual, quick and cheap. Definitely a great place to meet with friends."}
{"text":"It's a must when you're on vacation, gotta have our pho fix! But this place has so much more than pho! It has nam neuang, and we came back just for that! I saw that it was closed for a little bit and just recently opened back with a complete remodel. Much cleaner with a modern farmhouse feel. It's a little further down on Spring Mountain, but not too far, and definitely worth the extra minutes. My son had their pho, I had the bun bu hue, hubby had the pork chop. Pho was good, but not the best he's had. Bun bu hue had good flavor and was hearty. Pork chops were ok and a tad bit small. The nam neuang was the best thing we ate. It comes as a spring roll or a do-it-yourself wrap. Both are good, but you get the crunchy egg roll wrapper in the spring roll. Service was as expected, food comes out pretty fast. Prices are average."}
{"text":"Doesn't even taste like pho, nor smell like it.

I had asked for extra veggies in my vermicelli, and it looked like they put in less than most places normally would if i had not asked for extra. This plate was ok.

My seat had a bunch of rips in it, and when you sit on ripped leather it kinda hurts if you wear a dress/shorts."}
{"text":"This place used to be decent, but has gone down in the years.  The pho here was below average compared to other pho restaurant.  I asked for a spoon since there were none left on my table and never got one.  Needless to say service is poor.  Used to a go to place for me, but I have found other places that have opened up around the area.

Parking is easy, big lot."}
{"text":"When you start reading my review, please turn your feet away from this place. Who ever gave them five stars probably because they dont care for how clean this shop should be.

I've never had such a bad feeling about a restaurant like this one. This place is Gross!!!! So dirty. From the moment i walked into this place i could already feel that. All tables and booths were not in good use. The sriracha, hoisin sauce bottles on the table didnt look clean at all. 
I was recommended from a friend but i think she was wrong! 

Now, talk about the restroom experience. Totally dirty from door knobs to paper towel. Oh dear, i cant even understand how a place like this can pass the inspection. 

Next, the food. Oh no! The laminated menu that they handed already proof what i just said. The food itself is not tasty and and \"clean\". Plastic bowls just make the food bad and unhealthy. 

If you dont trust me, see for yourself. Did i expect too much about this place?"}
{"text":"Legit pho and awesome grilled porkchops.  Not sure how my family found this place, but I am glad they did.  After rolling by a ton of places lit up with fancy signs and neon lights, pulled up to this restaurant not expecting much.  How wrong was I."}
{"text":"So you are craving pho after a night out and about all over lost wages... what are you going to do? go to chinatown (err asiatown???) and get some Pho...

The pho is ok, the other stuff is ok also it seems a bit pricey on some items like an extra buck or two over So Cal prices, but it is vegas so yeah... 

Pro Tip: Make sure that the waitress completely understands your order, ours was wrong in 3-4 places out of a group of about 15... 

Since they do not speak english very well here be warned. The food is very average as well. I have had much better and much worse. None the less a bowl of pho in lost wages can be a very good thing, even when its very average...

Also they dont take all credit cards, I think just Mastercard and Visa."}
{"text":"A review long over due. I am a regular here thanks to my Vietnamese friends' recommendation!  Everything is yummy, but I usually get the barbecue combination and fried egg rolls with lettuce. They are very generous portion, be sure to go with friends. Love their food!"}
{"text":"The soup is ok, but this time find a piece wood with mold in the soup! Ask discount they even didn't say sorry just tell me NO...Bad experience..."}
{"text":"It was late, well, early for the vegas after-hours eating schedule, but definitely late for oldies like myself.  We walked in after a very short (thankfully) evening at a club, and I was famished. 

The staff here is super friendly and accommodating. It was actually a surprising experience to have been treated so nicely at an asian resto. Usually, and maybe it's due to a common language barrier, the customer service is nominal at best. 

Anywho their menu was impressive, with a large array of options for the picky tummy.  Pricing was great, with items ranging $6-$7. The portions are definitely meant for the hungry and soon to be hungover.  

I ordered the pork broth/ pork/ udon noodles.  I really loved this dish. The broth was clean, and didn't leave a filmy grit in my mouth. The pork just as great.  Fair amount of garlic, green onions and cilantro (which I removed). Again, I thoroughly enjoyed this dish and found it quite sad that I wouldn't easily be able to find a rival in my home town. 

Everyone else seemed to really enjoy their meals as well. We ordered the eggrolls which were a bit girthy-er than I'd like but hey its fried and cruncy. Can't really go too wrong with that. 

Satisfying meal that won't leave your wallet feeling raped. I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"Definitely a solid pho choice, especially coming off a hard night of clubbing.  I'm actually kinda surprised a place like this exists in Las Vegas.  I've been off Strip plenty of times, but even some of the stuff out there is pretty expensive.  This is quite the cheap option for sure.

Got what I always get at a pho place: the special combo.  I guess here it has rare slices of steak, well-done brisket, flank, tendon, and tripe.  In other words, the same as I expect.  Noodles were solid and tasty.  The beef was very delicious and had plenty of flavor.  And the soup wasn't loaded up with MSG, thankfully.  And if I remember correctly (and I may not), this was $7.95, so about what I'd pay for a bowl of pho.

Great service here for sure, they're super fast.  Hell, I was laughing when the waiter came out after 3 minutes and apologized for being late with our food.  If only other places were that fast!

Does get busy, but there is plenty of seating.  A bit cramped, but nothing that makes you feel uncomfortable.  Def will come again."}
{"text":"Been a customer since day 1. Soo many memories here. 

I'm excited that the OG owners are back. Remodel looks nice, clean, and modern. Pho is best for any occasion....hangovers, rainy days, breakfast, ANY day. 
Our servers were quick and attentive. The food is delicious, reasonably priced and comes in good portions. Somehow I always order the same thing....pho and eggrolls. I look forward to trying other items on the menu next time."}
{"text":"I love this place! It may seem a little strange by the outside and area it is located. But do not let that or the old negative reviews scare you! They have been around almost my entire life and that says a lot. The smell of their pho is so delicious and the taste is even better! I may be a white girl but I know my pho, and they've got it on point! I recommend the rare steak pho (?) and the spring rolls! Mmmmm!!! Plus they're open late, perfect for stuffing your face after a long night of partying! *hangover prevention and cure*"}
{"text":"Hate to tell you folks this but the Clark County Health Inspector has closed this place down twice in the last year or so."}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed this place before? I've ate here probably about a dozen times. I've only been to a few other pho places so I don't have too much to compare it to.   But I keep coming back here because I think there pho is that good.  

It's more of a salty pho, not one of the sweet ones.   I always get the rare steak which is $7.99.   The meat is by no means really really good but it is decently tender and just hits the spot.   The noodles are great to me and the portions are generous.   The service is actually pretty terrible, they generally just drop off your food, then maybe check on you once throughout your meal. Sometimes they are pretty slow with refilling waters.   When you are done eating, don't expect them to bring the check. You have to go up to the front counter, tell them your table number and then you will pay. 

But I'm too busy eating to really care anyways. Leave me alone and let me eat my food. If I really need something then I'll wave somebody down to help me.  

You could upgrade the size of your pho for just one dollar more which I would recommend doing if you have a hearty appetite.   Never really a wait time to sit down and the food gets out you pretty quickly.   Regardless of just getting 3 1/2 stars on yelp, if you're looking for a tasty bowl of pho, I would definitely try this place out"}
{"text":"Spring rolls were very good.
Vietnamese rolls were just ok.

But of course everybody comes here for the pho.  The pho has this great light broth, balanced on every corner of the palate.  Really, really good stuff."}
{"text":"I have been to this place a few times, and I will def go back when I am in town. I took a couple buddies there to cure our hang overs with some pho and it totally hit the spot. We also ordered some spring rolls and egg rolls which were really nice. Unfortunately they weren't offering the grill that early in the day which was a let down. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Pretty good Vietnamese food with a wide selection so you're not limited to pho. Really great service!"}
{"text":"If I could give this place 10 stars I would. This is the best Viet food in Vegas and the best Viet food I have had anywhere in the country of over 12 years of traveling the country trying Viet places all over. It is no mystery why this place is always crowded. 

You can not go wrong with the Pho here but I usually opt to get the vermicelli bowl with grilled pork, egg rolls and add the bean paste shrimp. This is one of my favorite dishes to eat anywhere. Meat is smokey good and everything is done perfectly fresh. 

My other go to dish here is the Cubed Beef Salad. It is like Filet Mignon over a bed of lettuce and yummy grilled onions. 

I always wash it down with a Viet Iced Coffee.  

I love that this place is open late and the prices are so reasonable. No trip to Las Vegas is every complete with out a trip to Pho So 1!"}
{"text":"I don't know why this place is busy.  I order the special hue spicy soup and have to say it is the worse bowl of soup.  The broth had no flavor and tasted like boiled water.  My husband ordered the seafood soup with egg noodle and he couldn't even finish 1/3 of his bowl.   I first wrote it off that we didn't order their specialty. .. \"pho\" until I bit into a rotten piece of meat. That was done.  A waste of $30 meal.  Awful customer service,  awful food."}
{"text":"In one Vegas trip, we made two visits.. so heck yes, we enjoyed it!
The broth here is remarkable.  Not a lot of places here in Utah can match that same flavor I enjoyed.  It is a little pricier than most pho places since it's about $9.00 for a Pho Dac Biet.  They don't have sizes but their Dac Biet was larger than my meatball bowl.. so I'm guessing that's the reason it's more.  Their menu ranges from pho, porridges, rice/vermicelli dishes, bahn canh and many other Vietnamese dishes.  They even have spring rolls you can roll yourself with a big plate of ingredients.  I haven't seen that anywhere else.  The restaurant is constantly busy. Both times we we're there, I noticed there were only a couple of tables available at a time.  Service is okay, it takes a while to get someone's attention since they're always running around.  Also, make sure you try the Vietnamese coffee! Strong but great! :)"}
{"text":"After midnight on a wednesday, a rare miracle occurred and my boyfriend agreed to indulge my noodle soup craving! After we shared a lackluster pho experience in Seattle, he's always resisted any mention of brothy noodles. 

Upon arriving, the restaurant had several occupied tables. My order was promptly handled and I was offered a complimentary hot tea while I waited. The tea was steaming when it came out, but had the tiny residuals of ice floating in it- a considerate touch since I wouldn't be staying long enough for the tea to cool in the glass on it's own. I enjoyed the tea, it was flavorful, very refreshing and a nice precursor to the meal.  I ordered the #10 for myself and the #12 for the boy. My meal came with gelatinous chunks of meat, shredded tripe, brisket and rare steak as well as chopped green onion and raw onion. I really enjoyed the textural variety that the different meats contributed to the meal; the shredded tripe was something I found surprisingly pleasing. The only negative is that the gelatinous pieces were so rich, I doubt I'd be able to have this same dish too often. His had a lot of shredded brisket and some rare steak, as well as the green and raw onion. The noodles and toppings came in a container to themselves, with the broth and additional raw vegetables in separate packages. The vegetables were a huge portion- tons of bean sprouts, lots of fresh herbs [basil and others that I didn't recognize] and chopped jalapeno and lime quarters. There were also several containers of sauce. It was all wrapped up well and stayed hot during the cross-town drive home. I appreciated that the steak was pretty much raw when I got it, so that we could pour the hot broth over it and let it cook in the soup. The meat is more tender that way. The broth had a nice spice level without being obnoxious, was just salty enough and worked really well with a fresh squeeze of lime on top. 

In fact, the broth was flavorful enough  that J finished most of his which is exceedingly rare to see. Early into the bowl he said that he'd be willing to have their pho again, so I am VERY happy! More noodle soups for me! Pho so 1 has converted a pho-phobe. And the generous portion of vegetables and different herbs makes it feel virtuous enough to have instead of burritos, so I can justify eating here again soon. The hours are perfect for me as I often work pretty late. I chose this place because they aren't open 24 hours; I just can't help but think maybe their chefs are happier or something.  

Their iced coffee with condensed milk is strong and has a unique taste to it. It reminded me of custard with a strong coffee punch. When I recieved my order, the server laughed and asked if I was going to be partying all night. The cup had a lot of ice and the actual amount of coffee ended up being rather small, but that's probably a good thing considering the time of night I was having it. 

Yay, Pho So 1,  you are #1 Pho sho!"}
{"text":"Super excited that this place is back open! Love the new decor and service was top notch!! I have 2 little boys and just as I was about to request plasticware and scissors to cut up the noodles, our waiter anticipated our needs and brought it to us along with extra napkins and straws. They offer a wide variety of Vietnamese cuisine that you can't go wrong with anything you order. When I asked my son how he liked his food, he gave me 2 thumbs up and asked when we going back!"}
{"text":"I recently found Pho So 1 and believe that I have now found my new restaurant to get pho after a long night of drinking. There has to be something in pho that tastes so good and helps you recover that much faster. I think that the pho (especially the broth) here is better than many of the other pho places in the area. 

I almost always have to get a side when I get pho and the side to get here is the fried egg rolls. Definitely fried to perfection and when wrapped in a leaf of lettuce and dipped in fish sauce, it is a tasty way to start your meal. 

The service the last few times has been a bit questionable as I think they hired some new staff, but I'll let it slide since they did get our order correct. 

If you are looking for pho...then look no pho-ther...Pho So 1!"}
{"text":"I can't believe i forgot to yelp Pho So 1.  LOL.  I make a stop at this restaurant on almost every Vegas trip!!!  The pho is excellent, and the broth is so yummy.  It's a great hang over remedy :o)  The broken rice is also good too.

The coffee is good and strong, not diluted with water.  The smoothies and che (the coconut milk desserts) are highly recommended.  The restaurant is clean and the service is fast."}
{"text":"Their pho is outstanding! Everything else is \"ok\". But the Pho is the stand out. Especially the rare beef which is delivered raw in a pack to be added to the hot broth. Really delicious!"}
{"text":"I joined this site, specifically to review this place.

Came here, looking for lunch, and was recommended this place by a relative--myself, husband, 3 & 5 year olds, step-mother, and my brother.   Walked in and was excited--everything smelled good, and the place was on the empty side (we'd come a bit early) which was good because we had 2 kids with us.  

We ordered noodle bowls--one tendon, one with tripe and other cuts, one of the brisket ones (#13 I believe?  Was what my children shared), another brisket one for myself (#11 one) and the spicy noodles with the blood sausage in it (#63).

Was not impressed at all by what came next.  We received our veggie plate, and I was dismayed to find that all the plates had partially rotting basil placed on them.  A bit bummed, but not deterred, I picked off the decent ones and set them aside for later.  Then the actual noodles came--the broth was a very watery beef broth, and was definitely not as good as something I could've made my self at home.  My meat was alright, but my children's as well as my husband's and brother's meat all tasted more on the wet muddy cow side than proper beef should--the kind of taste it gets when it hasn't been cured and hung properly.

I could have set this all aside, and given this place 3 stars (because at least the food was inexpensive), had the service not been so awful.  The one bright side was the waitress recommending the specific noodles (the meat on #13 was thinner and easier for them) for our children, and the man servicing the register who was pleasant and polite.  However, the waitress spent the rest of the time being extremely curt with us.  The restaurant was nearly empty, yet we were seated right next to the restrooms;  I normally wouldn't complain, but there were other empty tables that could've seated our numbers, and there was a smell.  Top this off with a bus boy who, at first I thought was restocking the table next to me, but then spent the next 20 minutes standing 10 inches away straightening out chopsticks and other such things, rather than moving to an empty corner of the restaurant.

Add this to the fact that we caught the same waitress ignoring and arguing with a couple in the booth next to us (it took them 30 minutes to actually have her come by to talk to them!).  I'm not sure how they normally are, but apparently this was a bad day for them.  With tons of other places in Vegas to eat, I certainly won't waste my time here again."}
{"text":"When we asked for onions, the waiter took very long to come by and gave it after we finished our meals, so there was no point. Not to mention, we found hair in the pho bowl...
Overall, bad customer service, the waiters are also young."}
{"text":"If you have bad customer service, at least have good food. The pho here is underwhelming and lacks flavor. I went here with my family and being treated so badly left a bad taste in our mouth (or maybe that was the pho)."}
{"text":"I was just here last night with my mom. As we walked in, we can tell it was pretty busy and decided to wait for someone to seat us while the tables were still being cleaned. More people started to walk in and apparently they were too hungry to realize that there were other people waiting to be seated ! That was not the case because one woman played dumb when she obviously saw that we were there waiting patiently. The staff at Pho So 1 really need to fix this problem, especially for a thriving business. Guests don't know whether they should seat themselves or wait to be seated. I understand that they may be under staffed, but their seating system is so unorganized. I'm highly disappointed, especially since I've been coming here for many years!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has it's ups and downs. There are times when the people that are working there can have an attitude. Other than that, my boyfriend and I go here a lest once a week. We absolutely love this place. 

The #12 pho is the best. Also the #67 rice plate is really good.

Every time my boyfriend and I go there we always get good service."}
{"text":"i love this place best late night drunk food and cheap been going to this joint for more than 10 years best hot tea in town, first choice for me hands down"}
{"text":"Food was good, can't complain fast service! Price was reasonable. Downfall was that they don't have \"chili oil\" but will still be back."}
{"text":"The food is the most authentic and delicious in Vegas that I've tried. Definitely better than pho Kim long and other viet restaurants I've helped to try. The pho, bo Luc lac, bun rieu were all legit and deeeeeeeelicious. Drinks- soda plum, jelly and coconut were on point too.
Authentic food coupled with attentive and very patient service! All the waiters were so nice and accommodating to a screaming and messy, but too adorable baby in our party."}
{"text":"Great Service, great menu!

Every time I am in Las Vegas, my friends and I usually go here to get our Pho fix here.  I have been coming back for over 10 years now.  

This place will not disappoint you."}
{"text":"amazing broth. i came here after a night out at XS. and bloody hell, one of the best phos I've EVER tasted, not just because i was semi intoxicated. such a rich aromatic broth.... good portions of meat... AHHHH i need to go back."}
{"text":"I absolutely love their food! I always get their pho & I never can go wrong. I don't eat rice noodle so I always order egg noodle and that makes this place so much better. I also recommend their fresh spring rolls, fried spring rolls, vermicelli, combination fried rice, & everything on the menu!  

The only thing is that is gets really crowded and sometimes the service could be a little bit slow. Other than that it's the best pho place in vegas."}
{"text":"Wife and I use to go here all the time for some very good soup but then it happened.  On our last trip here we both always order the number 10 and this time there was no meat, tripe, belly nothing but veggies and noodles.  Boy we were stunned, we confronted our waitress who said it was her first day and I told the wife she's one of the owners.  She outright lied to us but did bring a separate bowl with the missing ingredients, not all of it just enough for one bowl, the wife's.  I didn't get any.  Can't complain to anyone when your server is the owner and on top of that she charged us for the \"so called extras\" boy was I pissed.  Told her we'll never go back to this cheating place again.  We're gonna miss the good meals we had here but we'll find another good place again."}
{"text":"This used to be my favorite pho spot, but service has just been terrible lately. There are many more restaurants in the area with better service."}
{"text":"Horrible customer service ! Every time we visit Las Vegas, this is the go to place to get breakfast before we leave. However, because of this incident, we won't be returning.
They even manage to give us the wrong order. We had a hair in our bowl of pho. We asked for two small empty bowls, never got it until we went up to the manager herself and asked... Again. We even asked for three plates of onions. We asked three times, and all those three times, we were ignored. We didn't get it until I had to get up AGAIN and remind them. 
When I asked the manager for the waiters name, she hesitated and said his name was \"Phat\". Which was probably a fake name. 
This place claims to be number one, but I beg to differ on their service and food quality."}
{"text":"Coming from the restroom twice, each time there was an employee there,  neither of them wash their hands. Food is good and i like #11 and #12. However, i will not eat here ever again because of health code violations"}
{"text":"Very good pho most days. Sometimes it's watery. When the broth is good it's one of the best in town. I love their beef salad and egg rolls too. A lot of the waiters seem tuff as fuck! Wouldn't want to encounter any in a dark alley. Love this place!"}
{"text":"My favorite Pho place! Order number 54 with a side of grilled chicken and prepare for heaven."}
{"text":"I have always been a fan of Pho So 1 because they have Vietnamese Barbecue! That is my favorite, just make sure you don't order bbq during your lunch hour because you will smell like it! And be sure that you have time to bbq and eat, since you are grilling the food.  I always order the combo with Beef, squid and shrimp! Oh my oh my it is so good especially with the pineapple sauce, which smells like fish sauce and is just a savory taste that makes you want more!!"}
{"text":"Good service. Food tasted okay, nothing to rave about. Gotta have pho when you're hung over though. The best hang over cure!"}
{"text":"I used to be a regular here till they changed owners... This place sucks now. The older waitress is very rude. We ordered the bun bo hue, pho, and grilled beef with lemon grass. They brought a bowl with hot water and waited like 30 mins to bring out the beef and the pho. They took a bit longer to bring out the bun bo hue. The Bun bo hue didn't have any PORK BLOOD, so I call over the owner and said that this soup doesn't have pork blood and she said hold on and sends the waitress out way 5 mins later to tell me they ran out of pork blood and that they put extra ham in it. I tell the waitress I don't want the soup any more since the whole point of that soup is for the pork blood and hat they should have let me know before they made it that they were out of pork blood, and she said it's here now and they put extra ham and to eat it or take it to go. WE WILL NEVER COME BACK!! HORRIBLE AND RUDE MANAGEMENT"}
{"text":"Never going back.Keep treating your customers like dirt.
Rude staff treated us like we inconvienced them by walking in the door.
Don't worry,,you'll never see us again"}
{"text":"BEST VIETNAMESE RESTAURANT IN TOWN. The food is great and very fairly priced. The staff is attentive and helpful. The restaurant is clean and spacious. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"My mom was raving that this Vietnamese restaurant was good but the reviews showed otherwise; I still decided to give it a chance. The restaurant is very spacious--as opposed to the surrounding pho restaurants. I don't think you should have a problem with getting in, as pho is a quick meal so people are in and out. The decor itself was plain and didn't stand out much. The service was friendly but it may also be because they're my people.

I wasn't craving pho at the time so I decided to go with chao ga (rice porridge with chicken) and my mom got hu tieu nam vang. Everyone's food come out first except for mine and I probably waited around 15~20 mins until they realized I still haven't gotten my food yet. When it came out, I was so happy because I was starving! Now, the chao ga was good; there was a lot of white meat chicken and it was really flavorful and I did enjoy my meal. 

However, when my mom and I got back to the hotel, we were really tired and our mouths felt really dry. That's when I knew that our food was packed with MSG and before I knew it, I knocked out on the bed for a few hours. I woke up and immediately started drinking water due to dehydration.

Yes the food was good but it makes me question if the food was good due to hours of prep time and flavor, or due to the added MSG. I would have to go with the MSG and that's a no-no for me."}
{"text":"Clean pho soup base, and the price for a plate of egg rolls is worth it. I always come here for pho when I come to Vegas and it always hits the spot."}
{"text":"Used to be my favorite place to eat pho.  Food was always great.  My wife and I would always share the special pho and the pork vermicelli.  Place is not the cleanest but we've managed to look past that.  Was disappointed from my recent visit as I was flipped off by the owner for taking her parking spot.  I did apologize to her as I didn't see that she was trying to park there but I had my 22 month old daughter with me and told her that giving the finger was totally unnecessary.  I'll go back there eventually as my experience has always been great  and everyone else provides decent service but I will start experimenting with different places for now."}
{"text":"Fast tasty pho what more do you want in Chinatown ?   Have a Chinese menu if you have less adventurous eaters in your group. No. 14 is my favorite pho (beef tendon, flank).. Awesome

Fast tasty pho what more do you want in Chinatown ?   Have a Chinese menu if you have less adventurous eaters in your group. No. 14 is my favorite pho (beef tendon, flank).. Awesome"}
{"text":"Who else has a problem with this besides me? Additional charges to have your rare steak on the side instead of in your bowl when ordering Pho Tai (Rare Steak Pho). To have my meat \"traditionally\" or \"normally\" placed outside of my pho soup on a plate will cost me. Lame. I can get a large coke for a buck. They should remove the Pho Tai as an option from their menu. You come to a Pho place that claims to be number 1 yet they don't have ALL  the options. 

As I am writing this review they attempt to ruin my evening again by placing a bowl of food in front of me then removing it because they somehow messed up the order and that bowl belonged to a different table.

I ordered Bun Bo Hue. My meats had a funny smell to them. Disappointed. 
 
DESPITE it all...I won't let them get to me - I'm in Vegas!!!

Do not waste your time, money, or gas if you want Pho. 

Oh and best of luck to you with the house unless you're playing the slot machines."}
{"text":"Do not eat here.  I was in Vegas for 3 days.  I normally eat here when I'm visiting, loved the Bo 7 mon.  Only this time I got food poisoning.  This was the first thing I ate getting off the plane.  My second meal was steak at the Wynn's SW restaurant.  I'm positive that I did not get it there because I was with other people for dinner and everyone was fine except for my boyfriend and I.  We did not feel normal until we came back home.  It was a shame."}
{"text":"Hello!! Yum. Super Yum.  Had #13 (or 15?) the regular Pho soup with meat, #52 yummy vermicelli dish with grilled shrimp and pork soo good.  Also you must try the egg rolls with the lettuce and mint and cucumbers and stuff. It is so delicious.  Service wasn't amazing but wasn't terrible either.  Food was so good it didn't matter!  They also have the bbq/cook your own meat option which maybe I'll try next time.  Highly recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"The pho is always tasty and full of whatever meat you decide to order. Servers aren't obnoxious and the prices are very fair. paying at the cashier rather than your table is a nice and convenient touch."}
{"text":"I used to go here a lot when i resided in vegas. This place has some bomb pho. Good portions and good service. They also have good vietnamese shabu shabu. Everything i ate there was good. This is one of the best pho joints in sin city."}
{"text":"It's hard to find good Pho places in LV, this place was ok. Egg rolls were good and came out quick, were steaming hot too. Pho broth i think could go for a bit more flavor. other then that, service was good and pho was ok"}
{"text":"I do not usually write a review, but a few days ago me and my friends went to this place. I ordered bun bo hue and It was completely outstanding. The secret is the broth. Can not describe it but highly recommend it. Must try if you are the one have a fancy taste ;)"}
{"text":"Maybe I was sober when I went here. I had better pho than this. The broth was very bland, not flavorful enough. There wasn't any \" nuoc beo\" The owner was very nice however. Maybe, I will try it again when I am drunk."}
{"text":"It's an okay place. Best thing was the egg rolls but still a very bland restaurant. The fried rice was very bland, had to add pepper, sauces, and a fried egg to enhance the flavor but did not make much of a difference. The side dishes of meat had to some flavor but had better around here in Las Vegas. Large portions but very tasteless. Good customer service was a plus. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I used to eat pho so 1 with my family when we're in Vegas. Their pho is NOT good at all!!! We stopped going there for years, then we found other pho place like Kim Long or pho Saigon 8 which right down the street. Pho Kim Long and Saigon 8 actually does not have as much MSG like Pho So 1, pho so 1 just makes you sick after sipping their soup. We went back to pho so 1 this passed Saturday to try again with my friends, I must say it was a HUGE MISTAKE, thought it was a bad batch last time, but guess what, its all bad. The services was horrible and the food was NOT good!  Save yourself the trouble and go to pho Kim Long or Saigon 8 to enjoy a nice bowl of pho."}
{"text":"Remodeled good service the soup is not hot me a little Improvement in there other than that very good very good tasty authentic clean."}
{"text":"Alright, I finally have the honor of giving a one star review. So where do I start.......

Well let's start with the service, now when it comes to Asian restaurants we all know not to expect 5 star, 4 star, or even 3 star service. So with that in mind this place completely blowed. Maybe it was bad luck, or maybe we just came on a bad day, but the service was by far some of the worst I have experienced recently.

First and foremost they kept bringing out random orders that weren't ours, and despite this lack of competence on their part, the waiter for some reason started to get frustrated with us.....(well f*!K him).

Moreover, the lady that was behind the counter (the owner maybe) gave us this piercing dirty look because we were frustrated that the orders were coming out wrong. It was as if she was on her heavy period and I took her last box of tampons and hid them.

Second, the correct orders took forever and day to come out. By the time we had received our orders, two tables were already done eating. We only ordered three entries, but it seemed like the cook had to go to the farm to slaughter the cow and bring it back to the restaurant.

As for the food............it was average. Definitely not a hot spot for Pho here in Vegas. I've eaten Pho since I've been an embryo in my mommy's uterus, so this place is a no go for me. The free water sucks too, you can definitely taste the \"tap\" in the tap water.

Pho So 1 completely sucks, I hate this place, I vow to destroy it, turn it into little pieces, gonna turn my back and never look back......."}
{"text":"The best pho! The beef stew egg noodle is pretty good and authentic! Their desert is good too!"}
{"text":"Super good pho for super cheap! The crispy noodle stuff is also pretty damn good. The other menu items are pretty decent, but nothing special.

The restaurant itself looks like a typical Chinatown restaurant- tables are always slightly sticky or greasy, the tables and chairs show their age, and tacky plants and decor are strewn across the restaurant.

Some of the wait staff are really exceptional, but most just take your order, drop off your food, and never glance at your table again.

That said, it still is one of my go to pho places. Their prices are great, they're open late, and one of the best comfort foods I know. What more can you ask for?"}
{"text":"In the spirit of Don King, I'll have to put up two heavyweight contenders:

Pho Saigon 8 \"I 8 pho\" vs. Pho So 1 \"yea so, we #1\"

This is a lot like Ken vs. Ryu (Street Fighter!)... if you don't know what the hell I'm talking about, than you missed out on an era of video games, and my set-up for the review was wasted because than I can't explain it to you terms of Kens flaming dragon punch vs. Ryu's flaming fireball. If you do know Street Fighter, than you'd know that I'm trying to say is that I think both restaurants are almost comparable to each other.

This is how I see how each breaks down - I order \"Pho Tai Nam Gau Gan Sach hay Pho Dac Biet\":

Pho So 1 -
PRO'S:
. This is typically the place I normally go to when I'm hungover like I normally am in Vegas. Pho does a body good after drinks.
. It's clean, it's nicer looking than most Pho restaurants, and it's usually packed...most often with some hotties.
. They have an extensive menu
. huge parking lot
. Catch up on finding a real estate agent because they advertise in the menu.
. Meat quality is better than most LA Pho restaurants I've been too.
CON'S:
. Mediocre pho broth. Can sometimes taste like beef broth in a can. The 99.8% fat free kind. Come on! Fat is flavor!
. Service??
. Get distracted by look'n at the menu cuz a bunch of real estate agents advertise in the menu.

Pho Saigon 8
PRO'S
. Pho broth is slightly better than So #1
. Won numerous awards in several publications for best Pho/Vietnamese restaurant.
. My friend \"Double D\" says this is her favorite place, and she's a local.
. Meat quality is better than most LA Pho restaurants.
. The #8 is a goodluck number to Asians. Esp, Asians who gamble.
CON'S
. Smaller parking lot
. The day we went they forgot about our drink order.
. Older and less appealing interior
. $7 freak'n dollars for a LARGE bowl which isn't any bigger than So #1's large bowl of Pho. In fact, I think it's slightly smaller.
. My boba in my Thai Ice tea was like rubber pellets.
. It's located further west on Spring Mountain than So #1

It's almost a toss up, but I'd have to give it up to Pho So #1 mainly because it's more convenient, and it's a slightly better value than #8 regardless of taste."}
{"text":"So far so good!  Finally made it in here but was only able to try their pho.  Will have to check out the vermicelli another time.

#1 pho (dac biet)....5 stars.  One of the best tasting broths in town....ALMOST as good as Pho Hoa on 17th Ave SE.  The broth is well seasoned and there's plently of meat.  Definitely one of the 2 best pho's in this neck of the woods and a must try...the other is Pho Hoai Vietnamese Noodle House in China Town (just as flavorful but has a stronger beef bone flavor if you care for that)."}
{"text":"The Pho here is pretty good, the broth very flavorful. The spring rolls were pretty tasty. Prices and portion sizes are good especially compared to Pho Kim Long. Service was adequate not great but you do not really expect much of that in these tye of places."}
{"text":"This place is dirty the meat in the pho had was smothered in fat, the manager is like an 18 year old stoner that has no professionalism at all not to mention the host in the front who also takes your order is also about 12 and is rude, aggressive and not accommodating. I had to ask for a manager and he said \"he's eating\" as if that's a normal response and then points to him sitting a few tables away... it was pure comedy. Low budget all around never going back to this smelly place"}
{"text":"Good food and good customer service.  Just the way I like it. Recommend number 14 with extra noodles.    Extra filling."}
{"text":"My fav place to go. Their pho noddle have sizes u could choose. Good price, great tasted."}
{"text":"it was our last day in vegas, and we just weren't feeling any of the buffets. so, we went off the strip right by the 15 freeway and hit up pho so 1. my cousin's girlfriend found it on google and we decided to go there. it was pretty good. i normally don't like pho, but i love bun (vermicelli rice noodles). i got my usual, bbq pork bun that includes some cut-up egg rolls. it was so good. i did have to use the entire bowl of sauce that it came with because it was sort of bland, and not much pork. i normally only use about half of the sauce, but i wasn't trippin'. the prices were good, and the food and service was good also. their iced coffee is very strong. this was my first time trying real vietnamese coffee, so it blew me away. i normally drink weak coffee, but this was quite a jolt. it was a little too sweet, so i had to water it down with some water to my liking. overall, great spot if you're craving some good vietnamese food."}
{"text":"their food is just so dang delicious !!!! The best Vietnamese food in Las Vegas for sure! Their pho broth is on point  and portions are generous... No need to order extra noodles or meatballs. Egg rolls were crisp to perfection. Yum"}
{"text":"I ordered my usual Pho and fried egg rolls.  The waitress wasn't the friendliest, but not rude either.  The food was actually pretty good, but the waitress never checked on us to see if we wanted anything else. We didn't, but she certainly did not get my customary 20%-25% tip."}
{"text":"Since it is about to get warmer in Vegas, I thought I might as well get my pho on while the weather is still cool.  Pho So 1 has been on my list for a while now, and this was my first visit.  I had the beef pho with rare steak, fatty oil, vinegar onions, and a Vietnamese iced coffee.  

The pho soup was yummy.  It was a bit yeastier and not as beefy tasting as my normal place.  At first I didn't like the yeasty flavor, but with some hot sauce, hoisen, fatty oil, etc., this soup turned out pretty darn nice.  The vinegar onions weren't quite as sweet as my usual spot, and a bit on the strong side, but with a spoon full of broth they were really good.  

I think this place might be a little bit more mainstream than my usual spot (my usual spot is kind of unpopular, in fact).  I would bring someone here if they have never tried pho before.  Definitely a great pho restaurant!"}
{"text":"I love the pho here especially the sate beef  #15 , but the service brings everything down. I wouldn't come here if it wasn't for the sate that i really like. I use to be a regular but i am no longer a regular because one time i had a party of 6 -7 people i went to pay for my friends  and i . The lady that wears the hat she is the boss i gave her  $20 and the rest on debit i thought everything was okay then we started leaving after i pay she shouted \" Hey you didn't pay!!\" Which then i went up to her and explain how i paid because she was confused with the receipt paper then she was like okay. Didn't even apologize at all it was so embarrassing because that day was also  kind of busy. :( 

Few months later i went back thought maybe service would get better. Another incident happen. I order #15 i wanted extra noodles and so did my friend , but she wanted round noodles and i wanted the regular noodles. On the paper thing they gave us i put extra noodle and under that extra round noodles. Which i should have put like 1 extra noodles and 1 extra round noodles or something, but i didn't and i thought they knew  what i was talking about which i thought wrong. They came out with 2 round noodles and i told them later i put whatever i did and the boss was like \" Its your fault\" ..in my opinion if they aren't sure what i was talking about they could have asked but they didn't and start saying its my fault. i see its my fault, but where i use to work even if the customer is wrong you don't say that because its basic customer service."}
{"text":"We've been coming year for yeeeears! We usually order the Phô GA with extra vegetables and spring rolls (those are the cold ones) and it is bomb!

Come early cause it can get really busy, this place is thee Phô spot in Vegas, tourists from all over make it a mission to come here. I order two waters because when it gets real busy your waiter won't pay you another visit. 

Place is in the heart of Chinatown, plenty of parking outside, sometimes there's a longer wait for a booth but I never have trouble. I like the hot tea, comes as soon as you sit down. 

Only negative is its diner style payment system, have to get up and go to the front to pay, obviously for logistic reasons due to the cafeteria style environment. Before you try other Phô places in town be sure to check this place out first."}
{"text":"Best pho noodles in Vegas !!!! If you get the large they're generous with their meats"}
{"text":"Can't go wrong here.  I eat their delicious food every time I'm in town.  The grilled, lemongrass beef with all the fresh veggies - the pho.....it's amazing.  I would prefer to not go elsewhere, however they get so packed and busy that sometimes I have to.  Their customer service has markedly improved (or maybe they just know me well by now); the servers are so, so busy but still friendly.  You also know you're in the right place when most of the Vietnamese community is in here eating.  They would know the best Viet food in town. :)"}
{"text":"I had to bump major stars down from Pho So 1 because of our second visit here - the food was drastically different! Although they offer a wide variety of unique traditional Vietnamese dishes, they are very inconsistent. 

This time we tried: 

\"Pho Ga\" (chicken pho) - Great news, they give a huge portion to-go! It was a good enough size for 2 regular sized bowls! Bad news, the chicken was very tough and super dried out, but that didn't stop me from enjoying the plentiful pho noodles and the comforting chicken broth. I guess I was forgiving and not too picky, since I was sick and I needed hot broth to sooth my sore throat. Flavor rating: 3/5

\"Bun Bo Hue\" (spicy beef noodle soup) - Not good at all. It was really bland and watery. Plus the meats weren't tender. I wouldn't suggest ordering this here - Pho Kinh Do had a much more flavorful broth and overall tastier bun bo hue. Flavor rating: 1/5

\"Chao Tom\" (barbeque shrimp paste on sugar cane) - This dish was terrible. The shrimp paste on the sugar came was so bland and gummy. It tasted like I was eating some part of a plastic container - it's nothing that I would ever consider ingesting. Don't even bother trying this dish here. Flavor rating: 0/5

I raved about how they hooked us up with lots of fresh herbs and veggies on our to-go order last time, but not this time. I was really let down. :( 

It won't stop me from eating here, also they are still so much better than Pho Kim Long (PKL) - They offer many unique dishes my Vietnamese taste buds crave, I just know what to expect now."}
{"text":"Best pho in Vegas. Hands down! The broth is flavorful, the noodles are perfectly chewy and the fish sauce (don't judge me because I like fish sauce in my pho!) is very tasty and not too fishy. Aside from pho, they also have very tasty egg rolls which I HIGHLY recommend. 

The service isn't all that great, and I tend to have to wait for a refill on my waters, so I had to take away one star."}
{"text":"Greatest service I've ever gotten as an Vietnamese restaurant. They were very kind and attentive. Water is filled before having to ask. Very polite and generally nice people. Got the BBQ beef to share with someone. Came with big plate of vegetables, rice paper, noodles, two sauces and seasoned beef sliced thin. The grill cooked the beef and you rolled your own. The portion is great for two. The pineapple sauce was great! Overall very satisfied with the meal. Other people I dined with also loved their food. The price and portion was just right. The bathroom is hella clean and vibe in the place is nice. Great for groups."}
{"text":"The essentials to Pho are the following: the broth, the noodles, and the trimmings.

I felt that the broth was decent though, and so was the noodles. They gave me soo much meat though, which only tasted so so."}
{"text":"Decent pho place. Took off a star for dirty spoon and bad service. The food was good, hit the spot and comparable to pho Kim long down the street."}
{"text":"The best Vietnamese restaurant in Las Vegas in my opinion. They are always crowded especially during the weekend. All of their food is authentic, the portion is big, and my family loves it. Although we always got our order really quickly, the service is not very great there. They had a lot of waters/waitress on the floor every time I was there, but they either ignored us, or tried to be busy on other things else that were not really  important. Well, I don't think it is a big deal because their food is so delicious."}
{"text":"My favorite Vietnamese/pho place!  Wouldn't ever replace it!  Their customer service is about the same as any other Asian place lol but they're fast and I'm all about food quality it's a A+ to me!"}
{"text":"i'm sooooo used to pho saigon 8 and pho kim long, that this place doesn't cut it for me. after our tuesday night gathering a bunch of us like to eat dinner together, so about 10-15 group, we get seated really quickly after 10pm. between my boyfriend and i we tried whatever # pho that's well done meat and pork vermicelli. the broth for the pho tasted really rich in MSG and not fresh. as for the pork vermicelli, the noodles were sticky and tasted a day old. i'm not sure why but both dishes tasted not fresh. as many times we have come here with our big group of friends/family i haven't been impressed chance after chance.. i give two stars for the speedy service and quick seating. =/"}
{"text":"Open late. Never had to wait. Always had fast service. I thought they were friendly. Probably has msg butttt what Asian food doesn't? Topped my water. Almost sounded like a rhyme, almost. Haha.

But really I thought the pho was pretty good/decent. It satisfied my post alcohol binge, post all day at the day clubs, cold and hot cravings. if you want something else besides pho, they have other Vietnamese dishes like bun rieu and such.

Springs rolls was good along with the peanut sauce. Had a perfect amount of mint that I like.The peanut sauce I think was also good, not runny, you know at some places where it's on your hands right when you dipped your roll... Gross.

Finish my meal with a ice cold cafe sua.

 
Can use your credit card if the total on it is $15 or more."}
{"text":"Love the food...my number one choice for pho during late night hours. Service is quick and friendly. Only place I'll eat the Bun Rieu. Cheap and worth the drive from the south side."}
{"text":"Not bad place to go get some pho. I've tried better since I live in San Jose. 

Pros: plenty of parking, nice servers

Cons: Food taste ok. 

I still would come back to try it again next time..."}
{"text":"Came here with a big group of friends after a long night out. The staff was great; quick service and super nice. I love that they were able to separate checks for us when other businesses are not keen on that. I had the bun bo hue, my all time favorite. I was a bit disappointed because it wasn't anywhere near the spice level it should be. It wasn't totally bad, but I've had better."}
{"text":"Their broth is pretty good here. Taste really fresh"}
{"text":"My favorite of ALL the Pho restaurants in Chinatown!   Simple.  Friendly servers   Delicious rib eye.   Go with the #9.   The decor might not be elegant but who cares.  It's always clean.  Fast.  Open late and very good!"}
{"text":"Everytime I come to Vegas, this place is a must eat place for me. Everything I've ordered from their menu has been delicious. They have delicous pineapple sauce. The service is usually good. I'd definitely recommend them to everyone."}
{"text":"This place has been my go to since forever. They recently renovated the entire restaurant and the place is so modern and clean! Their pho is one of the best in town and my absolutely favorite is their BBQ (nuong vi). They also have broken rice dishes (com tam), vermicelli (rice noodles) and many other traditional dishes. One of the unique dishes they have there is Fried Pho Noodles (pho xao don), I have to get that every time I eat at Pho So 1. If you haven't been there lately I recommend paying them a visit, the original owners are back and the food is great - again!"}
{"text":"This is my go to pho spot in Chinatown. 
One thing I know is if I want to be quick that I can be in and out. Service is quick and the food is quick. 
Broth could be bit tastier but nothing a little pepper can't fix. 
I always go late night which is also convenient for me when I get out of work! 
Great place continues to satisfy."}
{"text":"my other favorite Vegas regular people food place, the vermicelli noddles had so much BBQ pork it must have been a mistake?! Delicious and worth the price, I've had better Vietnamese coffee, but that does not distract from the food, service, or locals."}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time today. Pho broth tasted pretty good without having to put any hoisin sauce in it, however it is super cloudy compared to most pho broths meaning it is super fatty. Small portions for pho. Water is from the tap. 

Also got their chicken fried rice, chicken was overcooked, dried, and unappealing. Tasted like it was left out on the counter for a few hours to get that hard.... 

Ac was also broke.. So it was humid and flys had taken over lol 

And there were so many workers there standing around but we still got our orders late.. Wasn't packed either. Our fried rice didn't come out until everyone was finished with their pho. And the lady's next to us also got their meal late."}
{"text":"OK AFTER MANY VISITS AND NUMEROUS AMOUNTS OF MOUTH WATERING PICS, I AM FINALLY DOING MY REVIEW ON THIS PLACE.

Whenever I come here, I get one of 3 options.

1. Pho (Beef Noodle Soup). I get the rare steak, flank, and brisket option. If you dont want your broth as greasy, minus the brisket. Just your basic pho with nothing but meat. No tendons or tripe. This would be a good choice for you first timers that dont wanna second guess what's in your soup. For you adventurers and seasoned vets, the combination has everything in it. Don't forget about the bean sprouts, cilantro, mint leaves, and sliced jalapenos that come on a separate plate for you to throw in there at your discretion.

2. Rice Vermicelli. I usually get the Charbroiled Beef or Pork with Egg rolls and Vegetables. I get this because it comes with the crispy egg rolls that they make so good. So instead of ordering it as a side item, it already comes with it. They give you a small cup of sweet n sour fish sauce to mix in your bowl for that complete flavor.

3. Rice Dish. I get the Diced Beef with Grilled Onions accompanied by Tomato Fried Rice. Very tender cuts of sirloin pan fried in oil and soy sauce. Very flavorful.

I have also have tried their Seafood Barbeque Combination. When you order this they bring out a portable grill heated by a specific gel. On a separate plate they give you raw shrimp, beef, squid, and tripe. You cook these items yourself. So basically, this is their version of Korean Barbeque. It's pretty much guaranteed this is what you will be smelling when you walk in there. This is what parties of 3 or more usually get because for about 25 bucks you get a decent amount of food.

Last but not least, I have heard great things about their Beef Salad. Eventually I will get it and it will probably be my fourth option.

These guys are open until about 3 am 7 days a week 365 days a year. I know this because Christmas Day nobody wanted to cook so we went here. Their service is very efficient and they always seem to be fully staffed every time I go.

The only negative thing that brings them to 4 instead of 5 stars is that the floor always seems to be littered with misc things. Not to the point where its piled up but if you look hard enough, you will see it. I will give them a pass because everything else makes up for it. Any questions? Message me and I will tell you everything I know! 

You can also check out their website: www.phoso1.com

Keep in mind, not all they have on their physical menu is on their website menu."}
{"text":"I've eatin here a bunch of times but keep going back to the satay pho. I love it here and if i hadn't tried some other dishes on the menu i would give this place 5 stars. 

I've eaten the vermicelli dishes and had one thing with what was apparantly meant to be crab. it was a rolled tofu like substance and was gross. Won't be having that again. Vermicelli dishes are ok. Sandwiches are good but not as good as that sub place across from the harry hays building downtown but those are delicious!

Service is no fuss and fast. i like that you write down your own order and that they don't try to be fancy. Dining area is fresh, modern and clean. Thumbs up!

Overall great place to eat and reasonably priced!"}
{"text":"This place, the family, the food has always been my favorite. I grew up here, the food is pretty amazing and we go to all their restaurants."}
{"text":"Usually I hate pho, but for very odd reason this place is good!!!

kinda hate the service tho.."}
{"text":"My friends wanted to get pho after a weekend of debauchery. I was hesitant at first, since I never heard of a good pho place in Vegas. Of course, this is coming from a person who is spoiled by homemade pho and who also lives really close to Little Saigon, the mecca of good Vietnamese food, outside of Vietnam.

When my friends and I set foot in this restaurant, we noticed that 85% of the patrons ordered bo nuong vi (DIY grilled beef, that comes with with vegetables and rice paper). Oh wow, I haven't seen this at restaurants in a long time. But then again, I am spoiled and only eat this dish when my mom makes it. 

Since everyone ordered this, I also ordered it too. I am glad I ordered this dish, as the taste was impeccable! The beef and shrimp was seasoned in lemongrass. You are given an abundance of fresh vegetables. The combination of the vegetables and beef/shrimp was heavenly. 

The service here is really great too. All the servers were friendly and very accommodating. 

Now, I officially have a go to Vietnamese place when I am in Vegas. Hurray!"}
{"text":"The prices are cheap, portions plentiful, and service quick. Pho So 1 has a large menu that will surely appease all members of your dining party. I stop by any time I want a quick bite. My favorites are the rice plates and seafood soup with thick clear noodles."}
{"text":"BEWARE OF THIS RESTAURANT!

I visited this place for a second time this past week and I for one will never be coming back to this restaurant. The place is absolutely filthy and is way overdue for an inspection. The walls were covered in layers of dust and splatters of hoisin sauce and Sriracha. The floors were so sticky that I had residue on the bottom of my shoes, so as I walked out I was still sticking the ground. Their fake flowers have so much dust, that it began to fall when the A/C blew on it. My first impression of the restaurant was terrible and the waiter was very pushy to take my order as he hovered by the table until I made my decision. 

I should have never come back to the restaurant. My first time visiting, I got sick after eating, but assumed it was because of the mam nem (fermented fish sauce). But after coming back to try the food without the sauce, I came to realize that I was sadly mistaken. I once again got sick from their food and all I had was their Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio. The food did not taste good,  but I am a kind of person that knows the preciousness of food, so I continued to eat. The meat was dry and very chewy and the egg roll lacked flavor. I had very little Bun and had a lot of sour vegetables at the bottom of my bowl. 

Overall I was very disappointed in my visit and I hope that the Health Department takes notice. This is a place where you are only asking to get sick and there is a reason as to why there were only 2 other families within the restaurant. This is a place you need to stay away from. BEWARE OF THIS RESTAURANT!"}
{"text":"Extensive and authentic Vietnamese menu.  This is my 'go to' pho/Vietnamese place when I'm back home.  

Good portions, great prices, prompt service. It could definitely use a deep cleaning, but I haven't gotten sick yet, *Knocks on Wood*."}
{"text":"Still haven't found a Vietnamese restaurant that serves pho with good broth in Vegas but when I do crave pho I usually get it from here. Service was ok. Food is good."}
{"text":"This was the 1st stop off the plane for a quick bite.  Upon arriving, I knew it was a com tam type of day. I got the one with the broken rice w/ shredded pork skin, steamed egg cake and pork.  We also ordered the egg rolls.

The eggroll order had 4 standard size pieces.  The great thing was that it came with a lot of vegatables.  Pickled carrots and daikon, cucumbers, herbs and lettuce for wrapping.  Nice and hot, filled with meat and extra crunchy, these were pretty damn good.

The Com tam was good.  Big portions of everything. No complaints here.  The prices were not bad at all, $6.95 for the Com Tam and around 5 bucks for the egg roll order."}
{"text":"Like always food is great but service is terrible. Seriously they need to hire wait staff that can handle high volume. Everytime i come here always have a problem with either waiting too long to order or wait staff doesnt understamd english to well. Its a shame to cause the food is great nothing here is bad food wise."}
{"text":"Not bad. I've had better pho and mi kho in MN."}
{"text":"I didn't come here for Pho' if you like Pho' I have another favorite for that.  I am recommending this place for a fun dish for more then one person were you cook and roll your own rolls its called Vietnamese BBQ. 
 
You will have to ask the waiter for simple instructions in how to do it.  All though he jokingly said \" you don't know how to do it, why you order it! \"  I will give you a short breakdown of how to do it. 
You will get a plate of raw beef and shrimp ( I recommend 2 plates for 4 people ) and    a grill with a flame coming out of the top with oil on the side of it.  
Dip your meat in the oil on the side of the grill and place it on the grill.  
Dip the wrappers in HOT water to make it soft add your veggies (lettuce, mint, basil, jalapenos, carrots and radish )  
Add your cooked meat and wrap it up like a little package.

By the time you have ended your meal you will have it perfected!  We recently took some out of town guests here and they had so much fun they have improvised a way to do it at home and continue to talk about how much fun it was.  It is a fun way to spend an hour or two with friends over good food.  I will be back, I am sure more then once..."}
{"text":"This is a pretty standard pho spot,  with comfortable booths,  and less comfortable tables with chairs.  The staff can be kind of unattentive at times if you dont keep their attention.  There are no booths able to accommodate groupa larger than 4, and more than 4 needs to sit at the tables in pretty close proximity to other guests.  Overall a pretty good value.  My favorite is the triple meat beef tripe and the spring rolls. 

Cheers! 

-MikeB"}
{"text":"Bun Bo Hue.... that is all I have to say. You don't always find bun bo hue with that much flavor but this place has it all. I'll be back for sure"}
{"text":"I love the Pho here!  I am hooked."}
{"text":"3.0 stars.  

The bathroom was this slippery goooo... I was literally skating ... YUCK.

The pho on the other hand was pretty good.  The mexican waiter kinda takes away the whole experience of eating Vietnamese food and ordering in my native tongue.  The broth was good, and not too much msg.

Service could have been a bit better.  And the bathroom definitely needs help.  It could have had 0.5 to 1 more star if it wasn't for the bathroom debacle and the service."}
{"text":"I am so glad that this place is back. Pho So 1 had the best pho in Vegas, and they were gone for a little... but the restaurant has a nice new look and the quality of food is still awesome!

My friends and I each ordered the pho tai nam.
Pho So 1 makes some pretty damn good pho, and it looks like they still got it!

I only knocked off one star because during the whole meal, our waters were only refilled once..... at the end of our meal. 

This restaurant always seems to have people in it, and it deserves to. Come here if you want some delicious pho!"}
{"text":"This is the best phone soup I've had in Vegas
 I seriously won't go anywhere else if I want pho"}
{"text":"Since this place named Pho # 1, so ordered Pho. Good ambient, fast service, friendly enough. Soup was not hot enough to the standard, but tasty, especially with the addition of Pho Oil to the soup, made it a much tastier soup & keep the soup hot longer while you are eating. The way I love to eat. Recommend to try it."}
{"text":"I think this spot has become my necessary go-to on every vegas run. The pho is on point and the vermicelli satisfies my viet cravings.  One notable thing, I've never been to a pho restaurant where the servers ask how your meal was. I was kinda shocked when a gentlemen checked on our table to see how we liked the food.  Impressed by something so small.  Bottom line, I'll be back on my next trip to the V."}
{"text":"Great place to eat PHO! 
My favorite is the chicken PHO and Shrimp PHO.
Also the pork chop plate, the spring rolls and egg rolls =)
The lemon grass grilled beef is also good.
There's plenty of parking and it's cheap!
Service is terrible though! But you can't expect great service at an asian restaurant lol just sayin.. =P"}
{"text":"I actually dined at Pho So 1 during my recent Yelp! sabbatical. I have been going to the SF Asian Market for the past few years on a near weekly basis and never realized that Pho So 1 is located in the same shopping center! After hearing so many good things bout this place, I decided to check it out one day.

This is a definite one and done for me.

a) the place is NOT clean at all. The seats and tables looked like they could use a good cleaning. I kind of winced as I went to sit in the booth. When I went to look at the menu, a dried piece of lettuce was stuck to one corner and fell off onto the table as I noticed it. 

Nice.

This was my first impression of this place.

b) Ordered a plate of roasted chicken with rice and salad. The chicken was very dry and tasted bland. Wildly unimpressed. The rice and salad was serviceable, but it's pretty tough to screw those up.

c) Ordered a bowl of Pho..and while it wasn't terrible, it also wasn't anything special. I can name a dozen places off the top of my head where I can get better, more satisfying pho in this city.


Service was okay. Just okay.

I just don't get what all the hype over this place is about. No thanks.

2 stars.

Meh."}
{"text":"Cons: 1) beef has too much oil meat; 2) not accepting cards, because it's charge them more if use.

Pros: 1) stuff is welcoming and nice; 2) pho was delicious and huge; 3) not expensive; 4) hot Jasmine tea was great."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst Vietnamese restaurant I've tried in Vegas. 

First, it's kind of confusing when you just walk in because they have no stand that you walk up to to get seated. We just walked in and waited until someone saw us and sat us. They sat us at this weird booth in the corner that had one full seat and one half seat, so instead of seating 4 it only sat 3. Since we always sit side by side, we sat on the full seat which faced the wall. 

It took about 15 minutes for someone to come take our order. I'm guessing it's because our seats didn't face anything but the wall. We ordered egg rolls, pho, and a rice plate. The pho came first, then the plate, THEN the egg rolls (which were listed under the appetizers).

I had to pour so much sauce into my pho just to give it some slight flavor. The beef and pork rice plate was pretty bad. The rice was very crumbly, like it didn't have enough water and the pork was not appetizing at all. The only dish we actually liked were the egg rolls. 

Throughout our entire hour and 15 minute dining, we only got our water filled twice. Once when they just gave them to us and the second time when we asked for the bill and he asked if we wanted water. 

The service here was very bad. We were never payed attention too and the waiter was never friendly. We were seriously sitting there waiting for our water to to be refilled for about 45 minutes. Then when the guy finally came and we asked him for the bill, he took 10 minutes to bring it. Then some other guy who wasn't even our server came and took our card. After that we waited another 10 minutes just to get it back.

Yes the food was really cheap, it was only 18 bucks for the both of us, but the service was just unbearable. 

We won't be coming back."}
{"text":"Truly one of my favorites, cheap and perfectly flavored, its always busy so you know its good, the combo with a couple extra meatballs, is a home run.   Add  Hot sauce and some other combos on the table..whalla...Fah  as in PHANTASTIC!"}
{"text":"service a bit slow very noisy atmosphere but I love their grill steak and shrimp wu can make your own spring rolls."}
{"text":"Whenever I am in Vegas and have a craving for some good Vietnamese egg-rolls I would come here.  This time around was a huge disappointment.  Seems like they took the old egg-rolls and refried it.  When it came out it was soaking in oil. I could see the oil dripping.  I asked them to take it back and surprisingly they took it back  and brought out fresh ones.  Unfortunately they were still greasy but not as bad as the first ones. I won't be coming back."}
{"text":"The service was fast, the food was fresh and good. The spring rolls, imperial rolls, the thai iced tea and pho were all great."}
{"text":"This is my first choice for pho on Spring Mountain.

I eat pho roughly once a week and I feel like a regular going to this place. Their broths are absolutely amazing. I like how it's not oily, yet packed with flavor. They come out with sides of mint, onions, and whatever you want to throw in it. I personally like mine with everything except the chili slices, with extra squirts of fish and pepper sauce. The orders take roughly ten minutes to come out, regardless of how busy it gets. And it can get quite busy in there. Curious as to how Chinese, Vietnamese, Korean, and English sounds like in one room? Try going there around 9pm on a Friday night, it gets LOUD in there. However I don't mind the noise, it adds character to the bustling and rustling atmosphere.

Broths and most of the meat bowls are all roughly under 10 bucks a pop, which is a steal for me. I always leave feeling full and well-fed.

The wait staff is how I like it; fast, to-the-point, and ubiquitous. There are a lot of people walking around filling half-empty cups of water and serving food non-stop.

I would definitely come here if a friend was in town."}
{"text":"Restaurant is nice and spacious. It's comfortable and modern for a Vietnamese restaurant. The menu has quite a variety of food selections to choose from. Had the fried chicken with rice and it was really good. Food came out fast. Service was great. 

The Vietnamese drip coffee was one of the best I've had. Super strong and flavorful. I had to add extra water to lessen the strength a bit. 

No complaints. Highly recommend it. I'd come back!"}
{"text":"This place was awesome.  It could have to with the fact that we walked here from the strip and were starving, but still great.  I had the #10 Pho Dac Biet Xe Lua, which was hot, fresh and the broth is very good.  This was our first Vietnamese experience. Now we need to find some where in MI to try also."}
{"text":"Pho Ga was alright. Service sucked."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times so I thought I would finally review it. This place has pretty good pho! I can't complain about it at all. The broth, noodles & meat are all tasty! The only downside to this restaurant is the service, like others have mentioned. In fact, the service is pretty much atrocious and non existent. Every time I have been here, I've only seen my waiter once and that was to order my food. So, if you are expecting decent service, this is not the place for you."}
{"text":"I got something like the Bo 7 mon here, although the didn't do Bo 7 Mon, so It was really just a giant plate of thin sliced beef with seseme oil, a grill on the table to cook it, and everything you need to make about 60-70 spring rolls.  For ~35 dollars this easily feeds four.  Most people come for the Pho, but if you are feeling like something different, try this dish, its refreshing and healthy and amazing."}
{"text":"I'm so sad that I can't give this place a higher rating, especially when their iced coffee and egg rolls were so delicious. 

First off let me say that my friend who has visited this place numerous times said this was the first time the services was poor. We went for lunch hoping to have some yummy pho. Sadly it was not meant to be. We started off with an order of spring rolls, egg rolls and the iced coffee. My one friend who ordered the spring rolls found two pieces of hair literally in the roll (she notified our server asking for a replacement of the egg rolls instead). My other friend and I enjoyed our egg rolls as they came out quickly and were yummy. Unfortunately there was some confusion (I don't know how as my friend speaks Vietnamese so we thought we could avoid any language barrier etc) as they brought out another order of the spring rolls rather than the egg rolls my friend had requested. She notified the server who made the correction. Meanwhile she had also gotten her egg noodles she ordered while my other friend and I were still waiting on our pho orders. We noticed that two additional tables near us received their order despite being seated after us (and it seemed their orders were even wrong but yet they received a replacement in a timely manner; we still had yet to receive ours). We notified one of the servers that we had been waiting for awhile for our pho orders. He seemed to understand and it appeared went to check on the order(but again who knows even with my friend speaking in Vietnamese we never got our pho). 

I don't know if this was just an overall bad day on their part with service/kitchen communication as like I mentioned a few other tables seemed to have gotten the wrong order (but heck they at least still got their pho). We started to get a little frustrated that we still hadn't received our pho for I'd say 30-45min after initially ordering and then even notifying them of still not receiving anything. Finally we had enough decided to just cancel the pho orders and pay and leave. We were offered a simple I'm sorry and given our bill (they didn't charge for my friend's spring roll order so we ended up paying for 2 egg roll orders, 2 iced coffees and an order of egg noodles). I would've expected a little more sincerity or for them to comp on something since not only did my friend's order have human hair in it but they completely forgot to bring out half of our order. 

I am very mixed on returning as the food and coffee we did have was good but the service was horrible that day."}
{"text":"I'm glad we chose this place over the other hundreds of choices.  We literally ordered and in minutes our food was at our table.  The service staff is friendly and quick.  The pho is delish.  The broth hit the spot and the egg rolls were hot, crunchy and really good flavors.  Its so worth it to leave the strip for this place."}
{"text":"I was visiting Las Vegas and found this restaurant 
The inside was nice the lighting was interesting
My food was in the ok department as in taste
( bbq pork soup )
I was hesitant to even walk into the restaurant because they have a confusing sign at the door stating that they have no public restrooms but in actuality they do have restrooms 
the sign should say restroom for customers only"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite pho place to eat at. For under $7 you get a bowl that can satisfy your hunger. I always get the pho with rice noodles, brisket, rare steak, tripe, tendon, and green onion. That's a lot for only 6 something if you think about it. The broth is just right as well."}
{"text":"Great Vietnamese place in the Vegas area, prob about a 10 to 15 min drive from the strip. 
We came after a business conference,  no wait at all. 

 I ordered the com bo Luc lac which was great but took a lil longer than my colleagues orders. I still recommend it.
Everything was great which I was told by my fellow business colleagues.. 
Bun bo hue - good 
Pork chop plate - good 
Pho - good

I will definitely be back when I'm back in the Vegas area!!"}
{"text":"The food was AMAZING!! We had the Pho Chix soup and spring rolls made with chargrilled beef. So  delicious. Staff is super friendly. Very clean and comfortable atmosphere. If there were six stars I would give them"}
{"text":"I love Vietnamese food and would have it everyday if possible. We move around quite a bit being in the military and the first thing I look for once we move to a new place is a good Vietnamese restaurant. I was excited to try Pho So 1 after so many failure with the others and I've received so many recommendations from different sources about how delicious their food is. The place was a full house our first time  there and every time we are there 6 years after (w/c is once or 2x a week)... good indication of how great their food is. Their pho broth is the best...very flavorful and you don't see grease floating above your pho. They also have bbq pork spring rolls that are to die for that I can't find anywhere. Their bun bo hue (sp?) is delicious and their vermicelli noodle with bbq pork, egg rolls, and shrimp. The portions are huge...good enough for 2 people. We take all our out of town guests here and they love it so much they end up coming back and favoring this place. 

If you are ever in Vegas, you've gotta stop by and try Pho So 1."}
{"text":"its okay...not good not bad...

I order a number 11, rare steak pho....the bowl is very small and the meat quality is below average. I will not be coming back. I paid 7.51 for a bowl of rare steak pho that was very small.

The restaurant is not very clean. Alot of fobs eat here. No-then wrong with that.  But being clean is a question mark here."}
{"text":"Pho so 1 was my go to spot for a late night meal, but the last time I was here I had to consider an alternative place. The food is really good no doubt and when the staff is on their game, everything is great! But my last visit was not one of them. It was around 11 pm and it wasn't too busy that night, open seats and bussers cleaning tables. We waited a bit for someone to spot is and seat is, but the bad part was when we waited 20 mins for someone to acknowledge us. We didn't get water or our orders taken, or even a glance in our direction. Needless to say, I may or may not come back in the future."}
{"text":"Food was decent, service was ok. The only bad thing was the rice was so mushy...talk about over-cooked! Other than that, the restaurant was a good size for big parties in your group."}
{"text":"I got a take out order of the Rare Beef Pho today. It was amazing.  Plenty of add ins. (jalepenos, sprouts, noodles, onion, basil.   Yummy.  I live on the other end of Vegas (by Nellis) and it was still steaming hot when I got home.  Will definately go there again!"}
{"text":"It isn't the best nor worst pho I ever had. Service sucks but at least it's open late. If other pho places are open when you're craving, there's better choices."}
{"text":"hands down best pho in vegas!, they also have a place located in van nuys california which is my home town, service is great but does get pretty packed at certain times, definitely hits the spot when craving something hot, spicy, lemony and delicious!"}
{"text":"I absolutely love pho so 1. Delicious authentic Vietnamese food. The staff is great. I've been a customer for 7yrs."}
{"text":"Haha walked in waited for a bit, no one sat us, walked towards the register and a server walks right into me and continues to go towards another table. In the meantime the cashier just looks at us like why are you here.... I guess that means it's time to go."}
{"text":"Thai Tea = diabetes in a cup
Suong Sa Hat Luu? = strips of jello in coconut milk...

Pho Ga was so salty! (i guess they use the same meat broth for all of their soups? yuck....so much for the \"chicken\" part)
the Pho Ga did NOT come with the nuoc mam gung (sweet fish sauce w/ ginger).. i was so disappointed...AND my bowl had like 4 strips of DRY chicken meat...

2 stars for the service, i know they tried lol


never coming back..."}

{"text":"Authentic and rich with Vietnamese customers.  I left my reading glasses at the hotel and the menu looked like Morse Code.  The waiter had to explain the different numbers.   I had #93 - get to work and make your own summer rolls.   I had the Vermicelli rice noodles, a shrimp tube rolled into a stick of fresh ginger.   I had to slice it and place in the soaked rice paper.   My friend had the Pho with meatballs and rare steak.   This is his second visit to Vietnamese food and he ate everything.   I've taken a menu home to study it and return next week.   The service is friendly and quick.   Bring your eating clothes...

I'm stuffed like a cabbage in a Jewish deli."}
{"text":"Ok, so there are so many resturants that serve pha.. But ive been coming here for years... And still believe that they have the best pork chop! And they have nice portions which is good for me! Yum stuff keep it up... I agree they have weird service? But still love the place!"}
{"text":"I come here almost every trip I make out to Las Vegas, because it's one of the few places that 

1) serves fresh, delicious food
2) is open until 3 am, and
3) doesn't attract the drunken, sweaty, raucous, smoke-reeking post casino/club crowd in spite of #2.

I ain't goin' lie, sometimes the drunken sweaty raucous post casino crowd includes me too, but you know how most locals avoid certain spots after a night of partying (back home in the Bay Area, it would be Westborough Denny's and Lucky Chances) because you KNOW those mother fuckers are gonna be crowded? Well, when in Vegas, this is where I go when I want to avoid any kind of eatery within stumbling distance of the strip. 

It's almost worth the potential DUI, I swear.

Food-wise, I always ask for grilled beef or pork over broken rice. Condensed milk coffee is strong and always a favorite."}
{"text":"They bring your food super fast during lunch. They start you with gummy veggies that you can eat with your food. Meat is awesome and so are the noodles. The Beef Pho is my favorite. 4 stars just because of the atmosphere. It's a nice casual spot for Pho I totally recommend it."}
{"text":"**** Cheesecake Factory of Vietnamese ****

They're pretty good at everything but they're not exceptional yet I have been here at least 25 times.  Why - because they have a little bit of everything and it satisfies a big groups' needs.

If you're coming from a big Viet community, this place will be avg to above average but the good thing is that place is open super late and can accomodate huge groups."}
{"text":"Only a couple of Viet joints in Vegas get the seal of approval from my extremely selective relatives from Orange County, and Pho So 1 is at the top of the list.  While they were in town for the holidays, we stopped by for our routine visit.  I though I might share a couple of other recommendations from one of the most authentic Viet kitchens in Sin City:

1.  Pho Xao Don Dac Biet (Stir-fried Combination Pho): the pho noodles are deep-fried, then served with a combination of beef, chicken, shrimp, and various vegetables in a light flavorful gravy.  I love this dish but think the chicken is a little dry, so I order it with everything else but this overrated white meat.

2.  Bun Rieu (Vermicelli Soup in a Crab & Tomato Broth): few non-Vietnamese know about this noodle soup, and thus it's one of Vietnamese cuisine's best-kept secret.  The broth is richer than it sounds, with crab bits, fried tofu, even escargo when they have it on hand.  I love the chunky crab contents in contrast with the light vermicelli noodle, it's a very well-balanced soup.

3.  Thit Nuong Cuon (BBQ Pork Spring Rolls): spring rolls are originally made with braised pork and shrimp, proteins that carry minimal flavor, leading to the necessary accompaniment of the marinated fish sauce dip.  However, when spring rolls are made with BBQ Pork, the flavor is built-in, making the fish sauce dip optional."}
{"text":"The food is ok, but the ambiance was terrible. It was smoke all over the place (from the bbq) and poor air ventilation. 
Ambiance 1/5
Food 3/5

* notes: we asked the waiter to cut the shrimp roll for us.. Surprisingly he just provided us a scissor...a not so clean scissor.. 
For people who are considering an ok environment to eat pho.. This is definitely not the one you should try."}
{"text":"The food is okay. The service is pretty poor. They don't know their own menu very well. My friend ordered a noodle dish and it came with rice and the server was quite sure we were mistaken but then faltered when I could recall the number of the item. She looked it up and we were right. They did bring it back almost immediately so I suspect it was just scrapping the topping off and plunking it on top of noodles... The one in the north on Centre St is better I think. The server was friendly. The restaurant was relatively empty on a Wednesday evening. The restaurant is in a mall and the parking lot was relatively busy but we managed to find parking fairly easily."}
{"text":"The Pho is still tasty, broth as good as before. This time I ordered the fried spring rolls.The spring rolls were much thinner than I've had previously here so the balance between filling and wrapper was not the best and the prices had increased.  The one thing I dislike is when a restaurant hikes the prices and reduces the portions, do one but not both. You can't be stingy with food and I don't mean amount of food but there are certain things you cannot do. When you skimp on filling in the spring rolls and affect the taste that's being stingy to me. The rolls were freshly fried and crisp but as I said the balance was not there."}
{"text":"If there was a possible zero, this place would get it. But, Yelp felt the need that all business deserve pity stars. 

From upon entering, we're greeted by an Asian fellow with glasses. There were two-three tables open for 10...he reluctantly seated us and was about to put us on a waiting list. If not mentioned, we would have wasted our time. 

Soup is less than mediocre, broth was bland and constumer service was blatantly disrespectful. We asked multiple times for simple sides like onion, and waiters would not acknowledge our requests. 

Just to top off the cake, there was curly hair in my #10 soup. The cashier was apologetic, but not by nature. She looked at my wife and I, trying to find out if the hair belong to one of us. The hair was curly and short, possibly armpit hair. For her to stare up and down at us, it was very offensive, we did not plan to eat someone else's pubes. For a restaurant that cries it is the number 1 soup restaurant, they sure treat us like we are the last people to come back."}
{"text":"I loved dining at this local spot for lunch and dinner for many years since I moved to Vegas in 2000.  They newly renovated the entire venue and it looks immaculate and modern. The atmosphere is still very relaxing and the servers were awesome to say the least.  Kudos to the owners to taking this original popular pho restaurant to the next level. The new menu has lots of authentic Vietnamese dishes. The pricing is very affordable and the generous portions will have make you full and coming back for more."}
{"text":"Probably the worst Vietnamese place, I have experienced! When it comes to costumer service this hits a all time low. After being seating at a booth for 15 minutes, I had to flag down a waiter for the menu (Minus a star)! It seems the like the waitress and waiter are all gathered around the cash register talking amongst themselves to care! We have to inform the waiter that we never got any cold water (Minus another star). The waiter decides to gives us an attitude when we was placing our order (Minus another star)!

WARNING: The establishment itself is a OVEN!!!

Lacking AC in this weather is not a welcoming place to dine. When I ask about the AC the waiter claim it is working (on) and the heat is cause by the weather outside! Sorry that was a load of crap! I posted a picture of the thermostat of the restaurant and it reads 90 Fahrenheit. I am not a high maintenance person but temperature that high ruins the dinning experience. 

The food is nothing to rave about! The chicken dish was dry! The grill pork and egg roll with vermicelli was decent! You could have gotten this in another Vietnamese restaurant. I could not imagine eating Pho here because of the heat! Personally with the lack of AC (Las Vegas being so hot) with bad costumer service, I would NOT RECOMMEND this place based on today experience!"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the pho with white meat chicken. The chicken was a bit dry but still yummy and plentiful. The pho broth was tasty so there wasn't any need to flavor the sauce, thankfully. I would gladly revisit the next time I have a mad craving for pho. I wasn't a fan of the thinly sliced beef because my pho wasn't hot enough to cook it the way I wanted it.

Edit: Due to the $15 mininum to pay by a credit card, I ordered the egg rolls but didn't get to try it. I took them to go, went to a store and left them in my basket! LOL!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! The plates that comes with your own grill is the best! You grill your own food and you can share that with 3 people! It comes with tons of veggies, sauces, and spring rolls wraps! It will leave you so full! It totally worth the price!"}
{"text":"I ordered hu tieu my tho and waited 30 mins for one person to bring me water. I ASKED ABOUT MY FOOD AND THEY TOTALLY FORGOT TO MAKE IT. What kind of restaurant is this??? The table that came after me got their food first. Tell me why i shouldnt give yall one star."}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Been coming here for years, not ever again. Front desk dude is a complete a$$ and ruined my dinner. Missing food, not even an apology just a typical stare and rudeness. You lost our business forever."}
{"text":"This place had lots of reviews, so I gave it a try. First, the staff needs a little coffee in the morning because they were already stoic. We had bi Cuong, nem Cuong, and goi  for apps, which was OK. My pho tai came and it was blah. I just am disappointed whenever a place calls itself Pho... Whatever, that it should at least have decent pho. My gf had Chao and bo kho and she said she liked it."}
{"text":"So I'm a Californian that visits Vegas regularly and always come here at least twice on a given trip. I only get one thing on the menu because it's so palatably good that I never get a chance to try any other. Plus this item isnt common in all Vietnamese restaurants. 

Order the BBQ grill (pork or beef) spring rolls and have the grill on the table so you can cook and compose your roll to your own specifications. The sweet sauce with peanut in it is the icing on the cake completing the meal perfectly.

Prior to this restaurant, Vietnamese food was never a preferred cusine. I now know I just didn't go to good restaurants. That's how good the food is here!!!

In the casino, on the table games, I've mentioned the restaurant several times and surprisingly many people and out-of-towners knew about this hidden gem.

Lastly, it's not a fancy place so decor is standard but food is absolutely scrumptious and it's sooo cheap! Added bonus!"}
{"text":"Great place. Clean and fast serving. We had 1,,2, 7 and 13. Lots of side veggies. 
Love that it was open until 11:00pm."}
{"text":"I might be the odd one out on this review but I have to be honest I really didn't get to experience the hype on the food here. One of my co-worker's introduced me to this place and mentioned good things! We decided to order ahead for to-go and then once we got there our food was ready which is great but it was just sitting randomly on the counter. I thought this was odd that they didn't have anything in place to keep the food warm because once we got back to work which is literally only a 5 minute drive up Spring Mountain Road, the food was cold as ever. Whatever I guess that's why your employer offer's microwaves in the break rooms.. or do they? The order that I got with the chicken was like blah I mean it was good but I had to literally ask myself was this a joke with the amount of chicken they placed on top? And for a \"lunch special\" I sure didn't think that this dish was worth almost $13. It was TONS of white rice and a pinch of chicken! I almost wish I would've opened the bag prior to purchasing it because I probably would've either asked for more chicken or just don't pay for the order. Hope I caught them on a bad day.. I may or may not be back, just won't be in a rush to try it again that's all!"}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant yesterday when we were in Vegas for spring break. The food was OK but the service was terrible. The owner was very mean and didn't care about customers. Never come back for that service"}
{"text":"One star and here's the reason:

(-1) The lack of flavor in the broth. Pho is known for the thick flavored broth and this just LACKS so much of the uniqueness of pho.

(-1) We had 9 people. Everyone ordered their own pho bowls. Only 7 came out. We had a feeling they put the last two bowls on someone else's table because a waiter came to us with an order of egg rolls that we didn't order. Ugh. 

(-2) Our hostess was a rude. B.I.T.C.H. You do not wave customers off, bump into them and glare (Hello. You bumped first). As she was taking our orders, she was glaring when there was too much order. (Our pho order wasn't complicated so chill down lady. Lady you're working at a phone restaurant not Starbucks - THAT'S complicated). Service please.

One star is for that young guy with a tied back fohawk hairstyle. You saved our tummy and fixed our orders really fast. And I saw him make sure other tables got their orders too (Ahem. Those eggrolls...)

Anyways other than that, the reason why this place is popular because it's the one of the first pho you see along the way to hunger lane. So not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Loved this place. We were in LV for edc weekend and wanted to try some pho here. My friend recommended this place. We went there around noon. It was already busy.  We got seated quickly and the server took our order right away. We ordered the combination pho and shrimp spring rolls. 
The food was awesome. Not too salty but flavorful. The spring roll was fresh and tasty. Will definitely come back if we get back in LV again"}
{"text":"Bo Nuong Vi is yummy.

Pho is just okay.

The last trip I had there wasn't as great. The spring rolls had some type of old taste to it. The \"Com tam bi cha suong nuong\" (rice, dry shredded pork, egg cake omelette, pork chop) was good except for some reason half of the pork chop was delicious but the other half was super dry - how did that happen?

This is a great fall back plan, but normally not my number 1 pick."}
{"text":"It's cheap. They give you a ton of meat. Those are the pros. The con? Really bland broth. Friendly and quick service at least.

Not a bad restaurant, but not great either. Pretty average pho spot."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ordered 80A and we made our own spring rolls. It came with a huge portion of marinated beef which probably could have fed another person easily. First time here but would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I like their Bun Bo Hue and their Nem Nuong. However, it's really smoky in there because they have BBQ but they don't have hoods. The beef was overcooked in their BBQ Beef Rice dish. Their Ca Gio is a little dry. I really like how it's so packed in there all the time. It's fun to eat at a hustling and bustling place. All the dishes come out so delicious looking. I enjoyed my experience overall."}
{"text":"the bun bo hue was really good! the broth was spicy and delicious! all i needed to add was lime and it was perfect! The meat was tender and oh so yummy in my tummy. i also tried the bun rieu which was not that great. it was very oily and there was so much tomatoes that that was all i tasted. the soy bean drink was very refreshing :) the price wasnt that bad at all."}
{"text":"Pho was mediocre at best. Prices were too high for what was being served. Fresh spring rolls were good! I wouldn't recommend this to anyone looking for that fire pho"}
{"text":"I go here every time I go to Vegas and so do my friends.  It is filled with locals and Vietnamese having Pho at 9 in the morning!  We always get bar-b-q  with lettuce and we make wraps.  We really do not know what we are doing but the food is delicious and we often order sides and Pho.  I believe they take cash only (imagine that) for payment.  Go there and try it, I think you will like it very much!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice on a recommendation of a local Uber driver (he knows where the good pho places are). He said that the broth here is better than the other restaurant we were planning to go to. I know I'm bad about writing a review from over a year ago but I recently went here again and the food was just as good!

Located in Chinatown, it's tucked away from the Las Vegas Strip. I got a rental car this time so I found the place pretty easily after a little GPS meltdown in Google Maps. I knew it was somewhere on Spring Mountain Road... Anyway, there's plenty of parking here in the lot and they are open pretty late. 

My usual order was the pho special combo with beef on the side. Never disappoints and it comes out super fast. Their broth is very tasty and I did not notice any MSG in it. All of the ingredients were fresh and delicious.

They take credit cards which is always a plus. Minimum is $15."}
{"text":"Very excellent, super fast service, and the Pho Bo Vien was absolutely delicious. The service is so nice and welcome and the prices are affordable."}
{"text":"I'm soo glad they are back in business! My family has been eating at Pho So 1 since we moved to Vegas over 10 years ago! we were so bummed that the closed for a few months during the holidays, we weren't sure if they were reopening.. but our family is happy they are back! We love the food! we never have any complaints when we go there! The new set up is nice! Definitely more up to date and modern! we've tried other Pho places, but this is still our favorite!"}
{"text":"Their quality of food has gone done as I came here throughout the years for pho in Vegas. 

At my last recent visit, the broth was bland and the pho noodles were stuck together in clumps. The soup for it was plain and tasteless too. The bun bo hue's noodles were too hard and weren't boiled long enough and the customer service has gone down. The servers seem more clueless and lost. They often forget to refill our water when we asked and not remember to bring us whatever we asked. 

Not coming back."}
{"text":"Reason i'm giving this a 3 star is because of great customer service. We had servers constantly filling our waters and asking if we needed anything else. But the food was quite horrible in my opinion. My fried chicken was completely burnt and hard, it felt like it was cooked a few days ago and they refried it because it was very hard to chew. The soup was very very salty as well they have to cut the sodium for sure. I would never come to this place for the food again, but the service was amazing and plenty of parking."}
{"text":"This is the only place I go to for pho in Vegas. It's that phockin good! Their broth is clean, not too oily, and very tasty. I wanna say its the msg again lol, because msg makes everything tastier, right? It's like magic. And usually msg makes me really thirsty but not here. 

I also love their egg rolls (dipped in their fish sauce combined with sriracha and hoisin sauce ahhh), combination fried rice, and their beef and shrimp combination for bbq. By the way, does anyone know what that pink gel-like substance is underneath their grills that they bring out for bbq?"}
{"text":"Always great here. Delicious vermicelli bowls and friendly service. I'm glad they are reopened!"}
{"text":"the new pho so 1 changed the cook. majority of the food that i ordered are SALTY.. fried rice is salty, egg roll is also salty. the place looks great though. im just not coming back here again cos food is not great anymore. Sorry."}
{"text":"This is one of the better Pho joints among the many scattered on Spring Mountain Road. Super casual and decent service. Note: They take CASH ONLY."}
{"text":"I don't know if the owner changed but the service was horrible. We had to keep asking for our hot tea. It didn't come until we were half way done with our meal."}
{"text":"I'm really, really surprised that this place doesn't have 4+ stars and that it's hinging on a yellow status. WTF! I of course presumed Pho So 1 had a high ranking, and out of curiosity decided to check it out here on Yelp. 

You're talking about a place where all the Vietnamese locals/older generations go and eat. This has been an institution for at least 16 years (it expanded from one store front to two about 13 years ago, if I can remember correctly). My parents (born in what was once Saigon), friends and extended family all come here for Vietnamese food. Sure, they've tried Pho Saigon 8 (not bad) but this place is consistent in their tasty food.

The pho broth is always flavorful. I never feel cheated out of meat portions (balanced proportionately with the noodle serving) and they serve you a heaping side plateful of vegetables (I can't even stand those places that give you a little stem of thai basil to put in your soup). 

The sauces are solid. The goi cuon peanut sauce is delicious with great consistency, and the fresh shrimp spring rolls are always fresh. The fried egg rolls are meaty and just plain delicious -- they randomly were once too soggy a few years ago, but that's not the case anymore. The nuoc mam (fish sauce) is great, and that's not to be an overlooked thing because other places mess it up (along with the peanut sauce).

I also order their bun thit nuong. Their grilled meats are NOT fatty which is an unfortunate occurence in a lot of Vietnamese places and again, there is a decent amount of meat. 

Their Vietnamese iced coffee... I took it for granted how well they make it until I had it served to me in other restaurants. You think places can't mess up condensed milk with Cafe du Monde grounds and a little water, but shit, they do. My mom craved the coffee this morning and we went their this afternoon for lunch.

Their seven-course beef menu is reasonably priced (beats a good San Jose joint that specializes in 7-course beef). In fact, everything is. Anyway, the beef menu is really fun to order when you're introducing people to the world of Vietnamese food (just make sure they're not vegetarian). It's fun and definitely hands-on. You get to wrap up your slice of beef with a good handful of basil, mint, and vermicelli noodles and choose which one of the three sauces you feel like dipping it into. It's great fun in variety! If the fish sauce/nuoc mam and garlicy taste of things there didn't permeate my hands/mouth/face/body, it'd be a fun date menu. But don't take a date here for the seven-course beef if you plan on smooching later for the first time.... 

Ambiance: Okay, it's pretty much a typical Vietnamese joint. At least the tiles aren't slippery from grease like it was 15 years ago. It is clean and bright inside now. My dad doesn't really like the grilled smell when someone is grilling next to us -- but that's what you have to expect when at a Vietnamese place that does a good job with their grilling menu. But why am I even talking about ambience? It's not like it's a Thomas Keller restaurant.

Service: Okay, fine. So it can take a little while for a server to see you - BUT the food comes out REALLY QUICKLY so come ON, people! (I'm talking to those reviewers that complained a lot about it...not you.) So yeah, you wait a few extra minutes to grab their attention, but once they see you, they attend to you and from the time you order to the time you take your first bite, you've had time to prepare your chopsticks and sauces. This is also the case on a really busy Saturday afternoon. The owner's son that has worked there from forever ago remembers me from the time I was a little side-kick sister going in with her big brother. He just stopped by the table briefly to say hi, despite the restaurant being packed on a late Saturday afternoon. If something doesn't work out, they're flexible. I ordered the 7-course beef menu for a friend trying Vietnamese food for the first time, but he wasn't able to eat peanuts straight up. They took out the courses that had peanuts and switched it out with something else. I was AMAZED the waitress was even willing to stand there for more than five seconds on a busy night explaining what did or did not contain peanuts. 

I cannot tell you how often I crave this place while I've been living out in suburbia New York. I have to come to this place at least three times on a two week vacation while here in Vegas. And they are always consistent, so after all these years, I know exactly what I'm getting. I've tried other places that have popped up, but I still have no question about where I'd want to go."}
{"text":"Very solid Vietnamese food.  I enjoyed the iced coffee and rice vermicelli with grilled shrimp, egg rolls, and veggies.  This is the dish I get every time I go for Vietnamese.  My husband also enjoyed the pho ga (chicken pho soup).  Service is very prompt and generally friendly."}
{"text":"Ive been here 3 times in over 6 months. The first time the service was excellent, The food is always great but the service always pretty bad - mediocre, 

I ordered a bun cha gio thit nuong, it took a while before it came out. All of the people who were with me got their food and finish more than half their pho before I could even get my order. They never addressed my issue until I told them 15 minutes after the ordered. I had to hurry to finish my meal to leave, We were on a tight schedule. this place has good food, but crappy service. 

This place is good for those who dont mind the service but enjoy the food."}
{"text":"Excited to finally see that Pho So 1 is open again. The staff here is very friendly and really know how to treat their customers. In addition to the awesome guest experience, their food is top notch. I had the brisket pho and the broth was amazing. If you want the best pho and the nicest reataurant owners on Spring Mtn, you go here."}
{"text":"Service is quick and to the point, the place is full of smoke because they bbq in the restaurant need more vent.
Rare beef noodle soup is one of my favorite."}
{"text":"After a long crazy night at Vegas, I always crave for a bowl of pho the next day. I decided to check this place out since there were a lot of reviews on yelp! Parking was plenty since it was located in a large shopping center.  Another bonus is there was no wait. This place is good for small or large parties. The staff was attentive and served your drink right away. They came right afterwards to take your order and the food came out in a timely manner too.  The ave price for a bowl of pho is around $7. A little bit pricy since back at Sgv, you can get a bowl for $5-6. 

I ordered the meatball pho $6.95 while my bf ordered the pho tai (rare steak) $6.95. I have to admit, they will give you tons of meatballs. I felt like they served more meatballs than rice noodles. The meatballs were also good sizes. You would think I would have have a better review but what my bowl lacked was the temperature. I felt like my soup was lukewarm. I can handle hot soup, so this was just so disappointment. I come to have pho because of the hot soup... Not to have more meatballs and noodles. The soup did have flavorful but it just wasn't hot enough.  They did come out with a large plate of limes, bean sprouts, basils, and jalapeños. 

Would I come back, yeah I would. But I will pray my soup will be hot the next time around."}
{"text":"Their food is average, but their service is absolutely disgusting. Bun bo hue should have pork blood, but they were out. I asked for a discount and was told by the cashier that extra meat was added to make up for it. Obviously a complete lie. We also ordered a large bowl of pho, and we got what looked like the contents of a small bowl served in a large bowl. The pho tasted just average while the bun bo hue tasted awful. This place is open late so I thought I had found a go to late night spot, but I'd rather starve than eat here again. I'm avoiding at all costs, and I suggest you do the same. I think the biggest slap in the face was when the cashier told me they put extra meat to supplement the missing pork blood when she hadn't even left the counter the whole time I was in there, and the waitress didn't know my bowl was missing pork blood until she went into the kitchen to confirm with the cooks."}
{"text":"This place rocks my Pho socks.   
I am impressed by my late night pho search.   
Yummy
Yummy
In my
Tummy 
I will pho sure go back to this place"}
{"text":"I had the #15 minus the brisket.  So that translates to pho with flank, tendon, and tripe.  To some people, that's all the nasties but to me it's all the yummies!

The bowl doesn't look that big but they really do pack in the noodles and fixings... so much that you can barely get any of the broth.  Speaking of the broth, it was lukewarm!  And that was for all three bowls of pho that we ordered.  That was disappointing.

Other than that, I still like how many choices you get on this menu."}
{"text":"One of the ways I pick a new restaurant to try is by looking at which one is bustling with people and has a full parking lot. This pho place, which I found on yelp first, fit the bill. I was impressed that the menu was in 4 languages! (English, Vietnamese, Chinese, and Korean) 

Got the pho dac biet xe lua (special combo) for 6.95 before tax.

Not very clean + rude service = formula for great Asian food. My rule of thumb is, the ruder the service and the dirtier the place is, the better the food, and that's what I rate. ;)"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner and I got number 77 on the menu, which is the Com Ga Roti. The rice was a little mushy and the chicken was dry. The portion size was actually pretty big and I found myself surprisingly full after devouring it (I was really hungry). With they gave more veggies though. The service was good and the food came out fast. Overall, decent restaurant but I don't think I would come again since I'm sure there are better places out there."}
{"text":"Best pho place I know of. Being Asian I'm very particular with my Asian food. Especially with pho you have to perfect the broth because that's what makes it really good. 

We are from Utah and this is always our first stop every time we come to Vegas and we come here again before we leave Vegas. We always get pho and a side of grilled beef really good!"}
{"text":"I would not recommend this restaurant to anyone. Wait staff is not very attentive to customers. Probably overworked and underpaid yet restaurant will charge 15% extra charge for party of 6 and more. Brought hoisin sauce for ch giò?!? Ordered 6 dishes and they are all so so. Don't order nem nng for sure or ph."}
{"text":"As a Vegas loca(l) for about 13 years, this is the best pho place I've found in the 702. I've been to many before and many after my discovery of this place about 5 or 6 years ago. This place has me coming back because of their perfect broth, it's just right IMO and doesn't need to be masked with much hoison and sriracha because it's pretty darn good on it's own.

They never skimp on all the wonderful fresh herbs and veggies that accompany whatever dish you're having. I always feel bad not using it all up. 

But the biggest factor on my critiquing of vietnamese restaurants is the nuoc cham. Yep. Mhmm. That stinky, salty, tart, sweet fish sauce that I dip mostly everything into. Perfect flavor--almost as good as how my mama made it. Every other place is either too salty, or too watered down but this place got it just right. 

Another great thing about this place is that the food always comes out fast, even when it's busy. The service is really good, for this type of restaurant. I'll leave it at that."}
{"text":"Awesome Pho, Egg rolls & service'"}
{"text":"Even busy but the rotation fast so we wit no more thn 5 min , soup so far is good to me , we always go to jenny pho but here the price is reasonable and the amount is enough , they to busy thats why they out of beef steak and pork , if someone complain about cockroach in the restroom , tell me where in vegas the restaurant doesnt have cockroach in the KITCHEN?!? I dont mean its fine with cockroach but why complain cockroach in the restroom ... It s not in ur food anyway , btw over all food is 4 stars to me but cause the service ... Even busy pace they try their best and we really appreciate... Sorry no picture i forgot lol ..."}
{"text":"Came to get some pho and this place is closed for renovations and under new management. 

This is my go to place for pho!"}
{"text":"Call me picky or predictable when it comes to my Pho, but I always stick to the basics.  An order of Pho and side of eggrolls. 

So this place was highly recommended to me by my dear, dear friend.  It wasn't difficult to find it especially when I'm not from Sin City.  Parking was plentiful.  Location is in a good size strip mall.  

As my family and I first walked in, we were just standing there, waiting patiently for someone to throw a glance at us, seat us, SOMETHING!   Ten minutes passed and all the workers were just busy serving everyone else.  Granted, they were moderately busy.  Anyway, as soon as the next customer came in they went straight to a table and sat themselves.  Soooo, we did the same.  Took another ten minutes to flag someone down to come to us and finally brought us the menus.  OMG, are you kidding me?! All I said to myself was, the frkn soup better be good or else my friend gets it! hahaha...

Thankfully, once we ordered, it wasn't too long before the food came out.  We ordered Pho, eggrolls, and the bbq pork.  Pho soup was good a 4/5.  Eggrolls were not so good 1/5, a bit too oily.  Bbq pork was really good 5/5, tender, juicy, and so bbq perfectly=)

Basically, its nothing to rave about.  

I don't think I will go back to this place whenever I'm in Vegas again.  The place does not look \"clean\".  And my mom used the restroom and she said it was filthy so I just had to hold mine until we checked into our hotel."}
{"text":"Honestly, I would only come if you can't find anywhere else to eat. The wait for seating was short but the wait for food was terrible. We got 3 meals out of 8 came out. We ended up leaving because we waited for over 40 mins and we still didn't get the rest out of the food. Not only that, when we asked numerous they kept saying 5 mins but when we got up and left, they were rude and told us that the rest of the food takes very long to make (they should have stated this before when we were ordering). I wouldn't have mind if I waiting if they told us beforehand but honestly 40 mins is unreasonable."}
{"text":"I was introduced to this place nearly a year ago by some co-workers. Outstanding! I have been several times and will continue to return. Although it has been a little while since I have visited Pho So, the waitress recognized me and asked if I wanted my usual, the steak salad with fresh veggies and rice. The steak is tender and juicy with just enough seasoning and spice. The egg rolls were fantastic as an appetizer. Definitely one of my better dining experiences. It's usually busy at lunch time, but it's never an issue with the attentive and efficient staff. The food is always served up fast and fresh."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. It was recently renovated and it looks very nice! Their Pho is very delicious! All ingredients are fresh and their service is very good. Parking may be a little tight since it's by a grocery store, but aside from that it's perfect!"}
{"text":"I eat here a lot, my brother in law swears by the place, every time he comes to Las Vegas, this is pretty much his first stop.  

Pretty easily accessible on spring mountain, if you are going east towards I-15, might be a bit more difficult if you are going west and away from the I-15 during congestion.

I've heard that they use MSG, but I have no complaints about it, although I need to drink a bit of extra water.  My mom gets a headache sometimes after eating here, so she isn't a big fan of it.

You can order pho, rice or even get the grill to make your own rolls with the meat/shrimp they give you.  The food here is pretty good, probably some of the better Vietnamese food you would find here in Vegas.  Typically the meat is good, any of it (flank, steak, beef balls etc - or you can get the tendon or tripe if you like that as well).  I like getting the grill, reminds me of the old days of living with my parents and making that stuff at home and the nostalgic feel to it.

Orders are usually pretty quick - I tend to come here during non-rush hour times though.  Service is to be expected of a pho place because of its popularity.  Overall, quality place for the food, not so much for the service."}
{"text":"I think the broth need to be more flavor... the owner seems nice very jolly friendly there is a $15 minimum on a credit card but if you eat one bowl of pho and a Vietnamese coffee you just hit the line."}
{"text":"Pho So 1 has been our go to place for a quick soup, etc.  We used to frequent Shawnessey Vietnamese, but they were getting to be consistently poor in quality of their meals.  Pho So 1, is not your fancy diner, as most times you have to get your own water which is already poured at the front desk.  The soups are always consistently good, we've not had a bad meal there."}
{"text":"This place is reasonably priced for the amount they give you. I couldn't finish mine so had to take it to go.

I got the combination pho. It was good. The beef was tender and easy to eat. It had the right amount of flavors. The broth was good. 

The service was quick to take our order. And also the food arrived quick. They didn't come back after that lol. We didn't get more water except we got the bill.

The place closed down an hour and half earlier when I was there late at night. I don't know why but I saw them turn down people. It's not the cleanest place but it works. 

It's a good pho place to go to when youre looking for one at like 2 am."}
{"text":"**MEH VIETNAMESE CUISINE IN VEGAS**

Hangovers?

Vietnamese food to the rescue.

Did not order the pho, decided to go against the norm and ordered the BUN THIT TOM NUONG instead.

Fish sauce was MEH.

Noodles were MEH.

Greens were MEH.

Grilled pork and shrimp both MEH.

Egg rolls were not that impressive. Too thick with MEH fish sauce.

Menu were in Vietnamese, Korean, and Chinese. WTF.

Service was tolerable, not the best, but then again, to be expected.

Go to Pho Kim Long instead."}
{"text":"Wow this place looked like a dump but a really bustling and busy one. Came here for lunch on a Tuesday before my drive back to CA. It was packed! Only took maybe 10m to get a table. The tables are really close together and ours wasn't super clean. We also didn't have the utensil or condiment caddies. I had to eventually grab one from an empty table since our food had come out.

There were flies everywhere. So gross. One table asked to be relocated from their window table, because the flies were bothering them. There was even a dead fly on the utensil caddy at the table next to us. 

The only reason I give 3 instead of 2 stars is because the food tasted pretty good. Their egg rolls were fat and crispy, a stuffed with lots of pork, carrots, glass noodles and woodear mushrooms, and they were seasoned well. The chicken pho had shredded chicken breast and a ton of noodles. We even all requested fewer noodles and there was a ton of noodles. The broth had a good flavor, and you could taste the spices. Only complaint about both dishes was that they were both super greasy. The pho broth was so oily that none of us could really sip too much liquid.

My bro ordered the lemon soda (soda chanh), and they put so much sugar in it that it was undrinkable (even after they replaced the first one they brought out).

The food was good but the sanitation and cramped nature of the place are a major turnoff. Don't think I'll return. My stomach was doing somersaults for the first 30m of my drive. No bueno."}
{"text":"If you're looking for an authentic pho spot-- especially after a late night at the strip-- you need look no further than Pho So 1.

It's fairly spacious inside and does not boast the most impressive aesthetics. No, it's not exactly pretty inside but that shouldn't matter ultimately if all you crave is the grub.

We first tried this place after an eventful night at Encore and were all salivating for some hydrating asian cuisine. We couldn't have picked a better spot than this one.

I ordered the rare beef pho. It arrived eventually with all the delightful accoutrements I could have ever dreamed of having. Crunchy sprouts, flavorful leaves and stems, thin delicate beef that melts in your mouth. And of course, the broth itself. It was full and flavorful--easily the best pho I have ever tasted. Not too salty and not watered down-- I couldn't have asked for a better bowl of pho.

This continues to be a favorite spot for my friends and I whenever we are hanging out in the asian district."}
{"text":"Large portion, reasonable prices, food is flavorful and soup broth is on point! Love the new interior design as well! The employees are also very friendly and attentive! Definitely coming back with more friends and family!"}
{"text":"Pho 1

Pho 1 was introduced to me by a friend, and what a delight. We ordered the Number 12  Tai Nam Gau. The broth was flavorful, and the \"extras\" to put in the soup were all fresh, and nothing wilted, which I have experienced at other establishments, thus making me question the food The egg rolls were phenomenal and flavorful The peanut sauce was outstanding.  Pho won my heart, however there were several ambiance issues that strained the dining experience.

While we ate, a kitchen assistant set up a work station next to our table, where he proceeded to refill bottles that are placed on the tables. It was distracting to hear the final sounds of various sauces being ejected from each plastic bottle. There were at least 20 that were refilled. When I thought it would be over, out came another set of bottles. I hope that if management reads this, prepping will be done in the kitchen. Another distraction was the lighting. The room could use a screen on the front window. The afternoon sun cast a light, and as I talked to my dining partner, she was like looking at a shadow. When I placed my glasses on, all she could see was the reflection of the overhead lights and we could only laugh that wearing glasses made one look like an alien. We began  a discussion on restaurants and ambiance. I realized even a food truck has it's ambiance  and if there was a jack hammer  performing roadwork next to the truck, it would ruin the experience.  We had our final laugh as a busboy began to clear tables and managed to stack dishes and toss in the silverware to create a cacophony of tableware sounds I realize these are minor issues, however it does make a difference  to improve the entire dining experience. 

I am not a fan of plastic bowls as the soup did not retain it's heat. The server never returned to offer a refill on out tea or offer dessert. 

 I will definitely return to Pho 1 as I enjoyed the soup,  however, if I was bringing a friend to enjoy  a meal and to talk, it would not be my number one choice due to the ambiance issues and the lack of service."}
{"text":"If I had to guess.... I've probably been to over 40+ Pho Restaurants in my life. I've been to Pho restaurants in San Jose, Little Saigon, all over LA and Houston and yet this is by far one of my favorite restaurants!! The taste is awesome (not too much MSG) and the restaurant itself is very clean and comfortable (for Pho restaurant standards)."}
{"text":"Pho No. 1   deserves 4 and half stars.  This is the best Pho place in Las Vegas, and I grew up in the heart of Pho country.  Their Pho is probably better than 95% pho places in Little Saigon and the surrounding Southern California.

The broth is tasty, aromatic, delicious, full of beef flavor. The rice  noodles were cooked just right.  Their meats are sliced paper thin, taking away most of the texture and taste. I would give 5 star if their meats are sliced by hand thicker. The big bowl, really big, is about $9.  

Quite a few Mexicans ordered Pho. Their menudo is a close cousin.  Just have to make beef broth with bone, star anise, ginger and onion, may be a little cinnamon or whatever your heart desires.

Their appetizers samples, anything like spring rolls, shrimp rolls, pork rolls ect.. are $3 a sampling plate, which usually have 2 rolls in them.  The samples are delicious and a cheap and very good way to introduce clients to new dishes.  This place has some very tasty appetizers to drink with. 

The wait staff is efficient and friendly, including the young hostess who dresses and acts like a cool boy?

Pho N1 is my go to Viet food in LV from now on."}
{"text":"It was a rainy day today and the girlfriend and i decided it was perfect weather for some Pho! We always get rare steak and let me tell you t was delicious  the steak tasted well and there was plenty of it. The large is more than enough for the average person. Service was very attentive and location has gone thru a remodel and is looking very nice   if you love pho go check this place out!"}
{"text":"im not sure what i can say about pho this place was okay, the service was like any other place just kinda okay the food was sub par to me ive had better pho broth before from other places in vegas so its okay the only thing i did love about this place was the portions. as i was ordering i noticed there are no sizes to pho so i was like dang this better fill me up. so after i got my pho i was eating it and i was starting my hangover haha yes i can feel the exact moment it begins. im strange so im sitting there x_x and prob a little drunk still since i couldnt even remember how we got to the hotel. my friends ordered egg rolls and that was a lot of food and prob a entree on its own haha and we didnt finish it. the best thing and different thing i love about this place is they let you order side things like meats etc. my friend had ordered grilled chicken on the side and it was really cheap and it was a lot of food thats what i love about asian places. lots of food for little amounts of money and full of flavor. we were sooo full."}
{"text":"this is the place i tend to eat at when im in vegas and want good vietnamese food.  Very friendly service and good food at a great price. This place has not ever let me down once. No crazy long lines and no wait. Every since person who works here is very friendly and they treat all their customers like they were regulars. I wish more establishments in vegas especially those big hotels hand friendly customer service just like this establishment."}
{"text":"Take your money and find another pho shop! I really wanted banh xeo and they say they don't have anymore, which was a lie because I saw another table getting it later!!! Idk why they would thy do that to customers!! I don't think I'll be returning back to this location!! Bad service!!!"}
{"text":"Terrible service and it takes for ever for the food to come out. So why do we come back so often? THE SATAY IS AMAZING. The beef and beef ball satay pho is hands down my favourite and is the only reason we come back. In fact I can say we as a group have probably gone 30 times in the span of a year during our lunch breaks and still none of the staff recognizes us.

It's ok though cause the satay more than makes up for everything"}
{"text":"This place is my must-stop everytime in I'm in Vegas for their Chè Ba Màu (a tri-color drink). I've had Chè Ba Màu at other Vietnamese restaurants and they were nothing comparable to this place. They use big red beans instead of the little ones or the mushy one. I love their pho, egg rolls (drool.. they make really good egg rolls, too) and their pork chop rice (yumm). 

Don't expect great service or a place to sit around with your friends and chat for hours. It's a get-in & get-out place to fill your stomach. 

I just wish they have one in Irvine. I'm craving pho and egg rolls as I'm writing this."}
{"text":"The 1st day in Vegas and this was the 1st place a local friend recommended. We were in the mood for some Pho, and this placed delivered. We started off with Thai Iced Teas and Fresh Spring Rolls. They were fresh with Shrimp and Mint leaves with a Peanut dipping sauce. I was also in the mood for some Pho, so I ordered a #16 Pho Soup with Meatballs. Everyone else got Pho with extra Tendons and Tripe soups. My Wifey raved about the Lemongrass Chicken with Rice. The Servers were very busy, but took care of us efficiently. Good place and Good food at reasonable prices. We will be back for more Pho when we are in the area again."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of Pho, and usually pho restaurants satisfy my pho cravings, but I just didn't feel it after eating at this place. The soup didn't taste right to me and the meal was a bit pricey for pho. 

I would give this place another shot next time I'm around Las Vegas.

I gave this place 3-stars because the service made up for the reasons stated. My soup cooled down after a bit so my meat on the side didn't cook, so the waiter gave me some more hot soup without me even asking. Now that's service!"}
{"text":"Friday evening and I wanted 7 courses of beef, so I looked at their menu online just to be certain that they still offer it.  The menu still had it so hubby and I drove to China Town to eat this.  When we got to the restaurant, I looked at the special dish section and couldn't find the 7 courses of beef. I asked the waiter and he said they don't offer the 7 courses but they do have the combination protein meal.  

Since we were already there, we chose the shrimp, squid, and beef combination with the special vinegar hot pot.  A plate of beef, with several shrimp and squid was given to us, a burner with a pot of special vinegar and onions, a plate of rice paper, a plate of fresh veggies (well, most were fresh, there were wilted ones), and a bowl of steaming hot water.  This also came with two kinds of sauce, one made of shrimp paste and another with fish sauce.

Overall, the meal was ok.  Not something that I will return to Pho So 1 to have.  Service was good."}
{"text":"Have been coming here for many times whenever I visit Vegas. Don't know why I keep coming back, service is just so so, and  the pho is average at best. The brisket is very thinly cut and full of fat. The soup has minimal flavor. The only good thing is no wait and fast service."}
{"text":"Awesome find. Very tasty food and friendly staff. Broth was great and spring rolls and subs were om nom nom"}
{"text":"Had the #71 (beef with rice) and O.M.G. It was good!! The meat was deliciously marinated and soft & juicy. 

Price wise, it is affordable and you can't beat it when the food is so yummy. 
 
The location is not in the best of areas. For the most part the inside was clean though I was more into my food than how it looked. I do hope they tend to their bathrooms a better."}
{"text":"Whether the weather is cold or hot, nothing can bring me to bliss than having hot hot tea and hot hot soup. This place just fills that void of my favorite things...hot tea & hot soup.

It may be a small, un-fancy restaurant but I can't stop not going to this place! This restaurant is always full of diners. It is well-lit at night and with windows to bring in day light. I always get a seating to a good table, although there may be a few seconds or minutes to wait. But immediately upon sitting and browsing at the Vietnamese menu, complete with Vietnamese language and figures, I would request hot tea first. Hot Hot Vietnamese tea (yes, it is very hot in a tall glass, so be careful..sip it first, don't drink from the glass fast) is served prior to my meals which I enjoy sipping with squeeze of juice from lemon...my senses goes in relax mode! A cordial smiling food staff would take my order in just the way I like it. I always order #35 which is \"Hu Tieu Hau Vi\" (Seafood with Rice or Clear Glass Noodle Soup with or without Soup) with a little addition that I like: chicken, clear glass noodles and with soup (see my photo). I always experience good, timely service. The soup is served hot!!, in a huge bowl complete with a heaping platter of green vegetables, lemon, bean sprouts, basil, mint & green peppers...i like that!, which I place on the soup as soon as it is served. I leave it there for a few minutes to \"heat up\".  In no time at all, this soup is \"devoured\"... I can get a little \"greedy\"-looking as I dig into the soup and have the greatest enjoyment of it. In between my meal, I usually get refills of the tea...wow, because I like their hot tea! The order of Tea is included in the meal that is ordered at no charge. It is so ample to know that at a reasonable price of $7.50 + tax it is a just rightfully sweet $10 altogether, whataaah meal! 

Other favorites of mine I like to order from time to time are:
#1 \"Cha Gio\" (Authentic Vietnamese Egg Rolls) which is wrapped in fresh rice wrapper = $5.25..I love biting into each with a brown dipping sauce,
#10 \"Pho Dac Biet Xe Wa\" (Special combination of well-done brisket, rare slices of steak, tripe & flank tendon with rice noodle soup) = $6.95...the portions of meat are cut large,
#21 \"Pho Rau Thap Cam\" (is Vegetables combination with Rice Noodles Soup) =$5.95...ordered on days I want my vegetarian fix,
#65 \"Com Bi Cha Suon Nuong\" (Shredded Pork Skin, Egg Loaf, Charboiled Pork Chop with Steamed Rice) = $6.95...one of my favorite rice entree,
#87 \"Bi Nuong La Lot\" (Beef wrapped in Hawaiian Lot Leaf) =$9.50..quite delicious,
#90 \"Banh Xeo\" (Pan-Fried Cake with Pork & Shrimp) = $7.95...awesome taste,
#8 \"Ca Phe Phin Sua (Nong Hay Da)\" is a french style hot or cold filtered coffee with condensed milk...this, i like sooo much, the blend of sweetness and bitterness is mouthwatering =$2.95,.
They also serve beer but \"33\" is the Vietnamese Beer you ought to try =$2.95.

The smell of barbecue in the air will fill your nostrils from other diners' choice of Special Dish called \"Dac Biet\". If you order this,it is to be cooked by you on the table, on a Griddle. This is is an array of meats or seafood on a platter as your choice from the menu listed as #80-#81 with a price ranging from$18.95 - $25.95. Especially a great choice for 2 or more dining companions.

This is my go-to place eventhough early morning hours, especially it is open Seven Days A Week from 9:00 a.m. to 3 a.m. 

Restaurant can also be found in Van Nuys, CA and Reseda, CA. 

Website is http://www.phoso1.net

I don't speak Vietnamese nor am I Vietnamese. My father (who's not Vietnamese either) lived and worked in Saigon & Danang,Vietnam because of his American employment there as a Civil Engineer when I was a child. I must have acquired the love for Vietnamese soup. 

But I learned from a food staff that \"Pho So 1\" translates to Beef Soup Number 1. To me, this restaurant is a #1."}
{"text":"i love their portion and the speed of service
sometimes, they are a little slow but overall
great food, and fast service

can't ask for too much at a asian restaurant though - you can't ask for them to smile when they are serving ^^

but hey, anyone who wants to try a pho, you should come here"}
{"text":"Been coming here for almost 20 years! So yummy. it all tastes exactly like my family used to make. 
I've watched this business grow and grow! I feel like I grew up with the sons. :) 

I work on the strip and I've met people who always make it a point to come here when they are in town. I don't need to go into details, if you like Vietnamese cuisine, this is where you have to go."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my first Pho experience but what i fell head over heals for was the vermicelli bowls. I had the bowl with the grilled pork and eggrolls in it. it is full of flavors from the pork and eggrolls and the plentiful mix of veggies in the dish. The serve it with a side of fish sauce which i love to combine into the dish.

The service was impressive. When walking in we looked around for seats and someone came to sit us right away.

The first time I was here i was talking to the server asking about different dishes and he knew I was a newbee to PHO. He broght out one order and made two full bowls for me and my friend. Can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! Good Pho in Vegas. Our group arrived around 10PM, and the place was packed. Our server promptly seated us, and then proceeded to take our order when he saw we were ready. 

I ordered a Pho Chin Nam, and the pho was ready within 5 minutes. The reason why I like Pho So 1 pho so much was that the broth was done right. It was not over MSGed like most pho places. The broth had a lot of flavor in it. In addition, Pho So 1 included plenty of meat. The beef was thinly sliced and was melt in your mouth delicious. The veggies were clean and fresh. Couldn't ask for more.

Pho So 1 makes one mighty fine bowl of pho. When visiting Vegas again, this will be our go to pho spot."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a weeknight, and this place was packed wall- to-wall....
According to lots of Yelpers, this is the spot for Pho, so of course I Get the Combination Pho, but I also gotta have a rice plate too, so I narrow it down to their roasted chicken plate or their grilled lemongrass chicken.

The waiter suggests the lemongrass chicken so I go with that. The wifey orders a Vermicelli bowl asking to substitute grilled chicken instead.

The Pho arrives first...Broth is clean and flavorful, noodles just right... overall, good dish. Lemongrass Chicken and Vermicelli Bowl arrive.
The Lemongrass Chicken obviously has been reheated and the vermicelli bowl has beef, instead of chicken.WTH????

One bite and I send the chicken plate back and ask to order something else...THE WAITER NEVER CAME BACK!

Wifey was hungry so she ate the beef in the vermicelli bowl...Just OK, nothing memorable. Pho KIm Long is still my go to spot with their combination Pho and Roasted Chicken with Seasoned Rice, a winning combination, IMO.....ALOHA!!!"}
{"text":"Totally gross and staff is rude as hell. I just left this place and was annoyed by the fact that this place has 3.5 stars. Service sucked no one took our order for a good 20 min. Me and my boyfriend literally watched staff hold a convo and do nothing while we stared to get there attention. They never brought us water and everyone else had it on there tables. Never gave me a refill my boyfriend had to get up and ask them for one. Now to the food... The chicken in the chicken pho was way too big and tasted so dry and frozen I didn't even eat any of it. The broth was good but everything needs to taste good or what am I paying for? Just a bowl of noodles? Ordered 4 egg rolls that had a pool of grease beneath them. Put mine on a napkin and the napkin was drenched with so much grease when I picked the egg roll up that it saturated through to the table. So I didn't eat those either. They weren't worth the extra raise n cholesterol. Overall very shitty service and yuck food. No thanks!"}
{"text":"pretty good, diverse menu, typical crowded chaos.  the asian spring mountain area has been growing over the years, and the asian food options keeps improving.  got the cha gio, nicely fried, pickled veggies not perfect.  the pho tai had good broth, decent noodle.  hu thieu also fine, but the com plate thit nuong was a little cold and not as good though correct flavor."}
{"text":"It is a shame to called this place Vietnamese food. Rice is not cooked properly, meat is too dried, Pho is too sweet. Dont expect authenticfood here. However, the customer service was friendly tho. I'd give a star for that."}
{"text":"I've been going here for literally YEARS it was considered to our family as a holy grail place to eat authentic Vietnamese Cuisine. It's has everything Vietnam has to offer all in a restaurant. The pho is flavored and seasoned really well and with fresh noodles and meat. They also give you a heaping side serving of fresh veggies to eat with pho. This place has a lot of good filling meals, that you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Am I missing something? I almost feel like the odd ball for not loving this place. Came here on a Sunday sometime around 11AM - 12PM and it was PACKED. It's been at least a good 5 months since I've had pho, last time being in Houston. So I got to share my first Vegas pho experience with Pho So 1. Seeing the crowd, I was sure I was at the right place. 

Well... not so much. We got sat within 15 minutes and you can immediately tell the waitress threw restaurant hospitality out the window and just wanted to quickly get our orders and out of here to turn the table over (...that's the expression right? sounds weird right now..). Anyway my parents ordered regular pho with everything you can think of in it and I ordered Bun Bo Hue. 

Both broths were extremely watered down with no flavor that could satisfy ANYONE's taste buds. Bun Bo Hue is typically supposed to be a tad bit reddish with the chili oil but mine looked murky brown. So sad because I was really craving some good Bun Bo Hue :'[

Hm, I'll have to give this place a second chance and go with something my fellow Yelpers ordered. In the meantime, anyone have any other good pho restaurant suggestions?"}
{"text":"Oh my goodness, the delicious aroma of yummy food that awaits you as soon as you open the door to the restaurant is just incredible.  

Egg rolls were delicious and was served with fresh herbs and veggies. 
Charbroiled pork spring rolls- yummy! 
Bun bo hue was so good and so much too!"}
{"text":"this place is on the opposite side of the of the I-15, away from the strip. it's located right next to a Big Lots and a Lucky's supermarket. in an area where all the other asian establishments are in LV. Vegas chinatown you could say.

we've tried a few other pho places in the area, but for some reason we keep coming back to this one. it's your run of the mill pho place, nothing special. pretty much the pho joint that you'd find anywhere else.

the one major minus of this place is the fact that the pho takes FOREVERS to come out. usually when you order a bowl of pho anywhere else. it comes out right away. for some strange reason, it takes soooooooooo long for it to come out here. 

I mean come on.. 

1)  broth? pre-made. 
2) noodles? pre-made.
3) meat? all ready and chopped up.

what the hell is taking so long?? throw it all in a bowl, pour the broth and serve while it's still hot! no need to make us wait 20+ minutes. i'm still slightly drunk and hung over. i want my damn bowl of pho! what the hell are you guys doing back there, gambling!? well... viet people do love to gamble, and it is vegas..."}
{"text":"This place has always been my favorite pho place, but I stopped going because the restaurant was getting dirty & filthy. HOWEVER, after a few years, it looks like they've cleaned up the place & is in much better shape.

The food still tastes awesomely the same, the prices are good, and they give complimentary hot tea. 

The only negatives: it can get busy (to the point where you're sharing a table with strangers), and you end up leaving the place smelling like pho & BBQ! Lol

I'll definitely be back tho!"}
{"text":"SCOREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE!

Finally, real PHO. I'm so sick of Koreatown Pho in LA. 

Plus, I found out that there is a PHO SO 1 in Van Nuys, CA. I LOVE IT!


Two things to order:

1. Sizzlin beef. It comes with a burner, meat, lettuce wraps, vegetables 

2. Pho with rare beef. I love the price. $4.50? how can you beat that?

HANDS DOWN! ONE OF MY FAVORITES."}
{"text":"I really like this place.  Unlike other Vietnamese restaurants, which can have crappy service, the servers here actually come over to ask how everything is.  The food is always excellent and really cheap.  Even though it's further away than other Pho places, we make the drive.  So worth it."}
{"text":"Had lunch with a couple friends here since we were trying to avoid the long lines and expensive food on the strips. 
Pho was good but not GOOD...ha-ha!!
It is affordable and near the strip."}
{"text":"Got introduce here by my ex boss. Really nice place to have lunch or dinner. Food are great. I'd say A+ to their service. Will come here more often."}
{"text":"Yum! Love the bun no hue ! It's hard to find good bun no hue broth but they got it good here !"}
{"text":"HATE  The trash on the floor.

DISLIKE  The waiter didn't come up to me for about 5 minutes until I flagged him down.  The setup (either rearrange tables to separate parties or force everyone to share tables).

LIKE  The broth in the pho. The mint leaves (I get really picky about how they look). The white meat chicken noodle soup.

LOVE  The meat and seafood combo with vegetables."}
{"text":"Good one restaurant that you have to deal, i came here a lot of time but just try only bbq steak, beef very nice and big order that i can share for three, next time i have to try other one should be nice too
For the BBQ you have to know how to wrap and eat because it's very special food"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch per my friend's recommendation.  We ordered an assorted meat pho, a pick-your-own pho and vermicelli, a  rib eye pho.  The soup broth is very tasty with good portion sizes of pho and meat.  We liked the pick-your-own pho more than the assorted.  The rib eye pho was also tasty but the rib eye pieces would lump together if you didn't  separate them before the hot soup cooked them.  The pick-your-own vermicelli has lots of veggies and herbs (the non-herbs eater may find it a little too much), which gives it a unique taste.  Would definitely come back to try out other things on the menu."}
{"text":"My buddy & I wanted a quick meal after making the 4 hr drive to Vegas.  We wanted something in our tummy before checking into the hotel & going for a swim.  Apparently, summer has ended, but it sure didn't feel like it in Vegas this past weekend.
 
So I had the #62 Bun Rieu for $8.95.  It was okay.  I've had much better bun Rieu from Na Trang in the San Gabriel Valley of Ca. (Look it up, folks).  My buddy had the rotisserie chicken & rice.  He thought the chicken was a bit dry but he liked the flavored rice."}
{"text":"I love me some pho.  And this place is good!

A lot of people on here have complained about the service, but I've never had a problem.  Whenever my husband and I go, the guy at the register always acknowledges us and remembers us.  So much so, that one time the credit card machine wasn't working and he came over to us and said, \"Just pay me the next time you guys come in.  You guys come here a lot!\"  Who trusts people that much?  Someone who is confident in their food and customers.

The menu is huge, but I only ever get 3 things on there because they are so delicious, I never want to have anything else:

#5 - a grilled pork spring roll 
#10 - pho with every type of meat you can think of
#52 - a salad type of dish that has noodles, lettuce, grilled pork, and shrimp

I always say I am going to try one of the \"grill it at your table\" offerings, but that damn delicious soup keeps pulling me back!

Oh, and it also doesn't hurt that the prices are great.  Cheaper and tastier than other pho restaurants I've tried.  

Pho So 1 wins the pho wars in my book."}
{"text":"The taste is so weird 
Service is verry suck
Less food
Really hot
Really dirty
Badddddd
Never come back"}
{"text":"This is an average pho place compared to the standards we have in Sacramento. Their broccoli and beef is the worst I've ever had. I've had the pho here on two occasions and was satisfied both times."}
{"text":"It was my first time and everything was pretty good here. We did the grill at your table set up with beef and strimp. We also ordered Pho, Egg Rolls, and #52. ( I don't remember what it's called) but it was delicious and probably my favorite thing that we tried. There was 4 of us that all shared and there was plenty left over to take home. All in all good place and would totally go back again! :)"}
{"text":"This place has horrible customer service. There was a bug on my plate of veggies and they didn't seem to care or apologize. Will not be returning!"}
{"text":"Not the best pho ever but darn better than most of them.  Service is pretty good too.  I definitely have this place bookmarked!"}
{"text":"I found my favorite pho restaurant!!  Too bad it's 9 hours away in Vegas. =/

Never would I have thought to find pho in Vegas (& without a hangover) but the people that I roadtripped with were pretty Asian, lol.  We ventured to the Chinatown of Vegas that I never knew existed.  Based on Yelp reviews read on an iPhone, we chose Pho So 1, and boy am I glad we did.  Being early in the morning around 11am, we decided to share 2 large bowls of pho, 2 people per bowl.  It was plenty for each person and surprisingly one person had way too much meat than she could finish!  The meat seemed never ending which is definitely a plus in my book.  I usually order rare steak only, but this #12 included some brisket and other stuff.  To my surprise, I enjoyed all those (weird) parts of meat!

The utensils were very Japanese looking but new and clean relative to other Vietnamese restaurants.  Even their bathrooms weren't too shabby!

Later that night, after not eating dinner before the club scene, we decided to come back at 2AM. Lucky for us they are open 5am-3am!  Awesomeness."}
{"text":"This place was open at 1 am. That helps since a lot of other places close down. The menu is pretty standard but there are a lot of items to list and sometimes the server is standing in your back pocket waiting on you to make a choice. I literally was handed a menu, she went and got me a glass of water from 10 feet away and then looked at me, waiting.. Feeling the pressure I wilted and ordered the Pho special.  But just as fast, she was sneaking up behind me dropping of my meal. It was warm, pretty tasty, and very filling.  I enjoyed it and would come again, although I might run away from the waitress so I can have more time to scan the full menu.  

I'll be back although I have to try the other Pho around the Mountain."}
{"text":"Good food we plan to come back. The avocado shake was really good, not too sweet. The young coconut drink also very good.  I had the spicy beef pho #15 and enjoyed it very much. The salad rolls were also very good."}
{"text":"Love this place! Their pho is so good and very good service. Problem is that it's always busy so sometimes it can get very crowded but their food is very good."}
{"text":"My family is kinda crazy. We have 12 people everyone ordered and one of my aunts ordered and left to go look at the stores around the area. My other aunt had changed her order because she thought that is what she wanted. After coming back and finding out that she was missing a part of her meal, she was upset and yelling at her sister about how she changed her order. The restaurant was so nice to give us a steak for free. We didn't ask for it, but they are great  people. I'm not going to lie the water here taste gross. Not like water. The tea was tasted like hit water.  Other than that it was great."}
{"text":"Incredibly cheap, about $7 for very generous portions. Taste was good."}
{"text":"Wow. Can't tell you how disappointed to have to write this negative review.
I have been coming to this restaurant for 7 years, and always considered it to be my favorite spot- until recently.

I'm not sure if the ownership changed or what, but things are definitely different at Pho So 1. They have forgotten about my order twice in a row, the food is cold, servers seem like they don't care. Texting and laughing on their phones by the counter. Higher up management also seems apathetic and doesn't care when customers are ignored.

Killed my favorite restaurant :("}
{"text":"I arrived with my family of 6. We were seated, there was one menu on the table, no one brought us more menus. Turns out we never needed the menus because we continued to sit for 20 minutes, no one ever acknowledged us, except the gentleman who brought us water, 13 minutes in after feeling our stares for some kind of service. He failed to even say one word or make any kind of eye contact to offer help, he just dropped off the waters and took off. We couldn't wait any longer so we left. As our family of 6 stood up, a couple of the employees just watched us walk out, a lost customer for life."}
{"text":"This place serves a lot of meat and the service is not bad at all. The soup is soooooooooo delicious like the real authentic pho taste"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the better places to go for Pho.  I'll always come here after a night of drinking unless it's too crowded in which I'll go somewhere else.  The egg rolls and spring rolls here are one of my favorite.  The rice plates (com bi cha) dishes are also good.  Sometimes the waiters can get confused, but not often."}
{"text":"i went to there yesterday night.  they closed for renovation. .some one know when they will reopen again  ?"}
{"text":"Recommended by local poker players as the best pho in vegas. 
They were not bluffing. 

Huge portions and fresh pho feeeeeeexins. The BunBoHue was amazing. Savoury broth with appropriate meat to noodle ratio. Absolutely worth the trek off strip. 

#1 Vegas hangover cure. 

If only hotel room service was available......"}
{"text":"Great place. I was wondering why they closed, but looks like they are open again, which is good!

I had the classic bun bo hue, which is great for a runny nose. It was very tasty, and the broth was flavourful. 

The service was nice. Waters were refilled often!"}
{"text":"POLICE POLICE POLICE POLICE!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
Everyone, please read my review before coming here.  This place is seriously horrible.  I have actually been a regular here and been ordering the same thing everytime i enter this restaurant.  I literally know how much quantity the dish that i order normally comes out until i have recently visited here. 
Our waitress comes to us to take our order and i asked her a few questions on her menu and she literally says \" ihave no idea\".  I asked are you new here, because i found it odd to not know anything on there menu.   I ordered the beef marinated griddled on your table dish which comes with a side of vegetables.  The vegetables came out not even a half portion of what it should usually come out and complained about it, and found out later that the waitress was the owner.  Isnt that funny?  she has no idea what is in and whats on the menu.  HORRIBLE!
She was the most rude person i have ever met in my life.  Because of her rudeness and not wanting to give us what we pay for and wanted, i did not want to pay for what i had not eaten, i had told her i will pay for what i ate but this is ridiculous because i havent even ate half of what i ordered, and she brings a box and says take it to go.  I immediately got angry and said no, and she called the POLICE! hahahhaa.  The officer was a great respectful man and told me to just pay for it and report this restaurant to the Health department/news to get the on t.v to show them how bad they are and he gave me an event number for the case.  I only give them a 2 star because all there servers are really nice, a bit slow but at least respectful, except the lady owner.  She was straight up rude and needs to be taught a lesson.  By the way the restaurant is so DIRTY.  I really hope they lose some customers and get caught on TV."}
{"text":"I'm not gonna give a star this restaurant..the service so bad and they barely understand English and they rude...red flag...red flag...."}
{"text":"Located in Chinatown. The sign is pretty big, you won't miss it.

I ordered the CHARBROILED PORK, SHREDDED PORK SKIN AND EGG LOAF WITH BROKEN RICE. There were a few pork slices that were all fat, but besides that, the pork was tasty. The shredded pork skin and egg loaf were also really good. The best friend ordered the BUN BO HUE and she really enjoyed it. If you want to try the VIETNAMESE COFFEE WITH CONDENSED MILK, it's very sweet so be warned. 

It's a solid pho place. Food came out fast, service was good, nothing to complain!"}
{"text":"It's alright. Nothing good or bad. 

Mediocre service, the inside of the resteraunt was chilly :(! Normally I prefer room temperature places to eat pho at, especially since the evening was really chilly. 

As for the pho, I ordered pho with rare steak: the portion was small, and there is one size only (I think). 

Soup was warm, but not too hot, and noodles were a bit too thin. Restrooms were messy and full of TP on the floor :("}
{"text":"I remember coming here maybe 2 years ago, after a vegas trip in which I was terribly drunkover (drunk + hungover) and some friends and I ended up here. I didn't have an appetite, but I ordered pho and I just drank the broth. AND THE BROTH WAS THE BESST I've ever had! I drank the entire bowl of broth and was satisfied.

Fast forward 2 years, present day. I was randomly reunited with this place after another vegas trip. Got the noodle bowl with shrimp and pork..ahh perfect seasoning & flavor. Lots of lettuce and noodles. yum.

Ok, maybe my review is bias because I'm from west LA and there's NO vietnamese restaurants..that are good, anyway. But I freakin love this place :)"}
{"text":"One of the original Viet restaurants in town I haven't been in a while. Place has been remodeled - new, nice and clean!!! Had Bun Rieu and Crispy Rice Noodles, my favs  Food was as good as I remembered and service was on point. They have drinks with crystal bobas and it's sooo good! Not your typical chewy bubbles, but a pleasant pop of surprise."}
{"text":"Good food good service . I live 15 min away , In less than an hour I went, got stuffed, and made it back to my bed."}
{"text":"Soups and Gai Chao is good... ambience is not that great... they need tidy up a lot..."}
{"text":"Never judge Pho by it's cover....

If you eat Pho, you know the tables are gonna be dirty, the service poor, floors not swept..... but that's the norm.  Minus all that and get down to the Pho itself.  This place is the best so far in Vegas.... better than the \"best in vegas\" Pho Saigon 8 (they paid off the reviewers, if you ask me)

I had the #10 Pho dac biet (special).  Broth is good n tasty, doesn't seem to be any MSG?  The best meat is the Tai (rare steak) be sure to eat this first....as it is very tender than most other places.... veggie tray had like 9 slices of Jalepenos!  Gotta have my Jalap-penos...tea is served in a glass tumbler HK style but I burned my fingers trying to drink it (should be plastic) 

The menu is more extensive than just a Pho place.... rice plates, bun, bo 7 mon....(beef seven ways)  saw lots of peeps having that.....must be gooood here.  

Topped it all off with a soda chanh to go, sweet n tart and very limey....refreshing.

til next time, good Pho-ing?  Is that a verb?"}
{"text":"Great food. Great service. Hands down the best Pho in Las Vegas. Definitely check this place out you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"Wow this place sure has gone downhill in the worst possible way.  God how I miss the Pho Sol 1 old school days from years ago. This has now become one of the worst Vietnamese restaurants in all of Las Vegas. 

Sure they remodeled and everything looks a bit more modernized but upon sitting down and looking at their new menu, It was immediately disheartening to see not only did they jack their prices up, they decided to go the Ala Carte route with some of the Vietnamese dishes which is so ridiculous especially with rice dishes that used to cost $9.95 are now up to $14.95. 

Our waiter told us they fired all the old staff/cooks/servers and are starting on a fresh new leaf. If this is what they call a fresh start count me out, especially when there are such good and reasonably priced Vietnamese restaurants literally around the corner like Pho 90 and Kim Long. 

The portion was so small for my rice entree dish & meat was full of fat, yet the prices were inflated to the max for mediocre food. Total highway robbery at the Pho Sol 1. Never again!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best Vietnamese restaurant in Vegas. The regular beef pho is on average but the beef stew pho in tomato carrot soup is exceptionally good. We also love the bbq pork on broken rice. It is almost as good as the ones we have in LA. The locals visit this place too so it gets crowded often. It is a cheap and clean restaurant we go to whenever we feel sick of the buffets."}
{"text":"Service was fairly quick & the food tasted decent.  I had the Pho Tai and I thought it was nothing special.  Compared to pho back home in Little Saigon, I would prefer that more."}
{"text":"Whenever my family and I come here, we usually order Bo Nuong Vi(grilled meat).  It comes with the plate of meat and/or seafood and banh trang(rice paper) and rau(salad and veggies).  You get to grill the meat and wrap up the spring rolls yourself.  One order usually fills up 3 of us while my dad usually gets Bun Bo Xao(lemongrass beef and noodle).  Total for the Bo Nuong Vi and Bun Bo Xao comes out to about $40 for 4 of us. The service is alright, the Vietnamese people aren't that friendly, but that's typical in Vietnamese restaurants."}
{"text":"hands down the best pho ive ever had here in vegas!!!! place is amazing n cheap too!! there eggrolls are BOMB as well as there springrolls my fave is Num 56...if you love vietnamese food then surely stop by and get a plate of pho!!"}
{"text":"My family's go-to for Vietnamese food. The pho is delicious, piping hot, and all at a great price. I love getting their bo luc lac is my favorite, soft and flavorful. 

We've gone here everytime we go to vegas, at least once a year ever since I was little. Bring your family in to try!"}
{"text":"I'm giving this a 4 star only becuase it has 5 star PHO, but 3 star environment. service is shotty, they are so busy they dont keep it as clean as they should. I have had PHO 20+  places in LV, and this is the best. Friends I have brought have liked different items as well."}
{"text":"Worse food ever!!  My family went here for lunch for the first time and it will be the last time.  We had never tasted anything like before.  We got the com, pho, bun thit nuong, che, and it tasted really bad."}
{"text":"Where do you go when you want pho for breakfast, lunch, and dinner? 

Day 2 of our family LV trip and my grandpa wanted so vegetables to wash down his colon. So on a cold night, what is better than a hot bowl of noodles (okay, I know what the counter answer is, but we're talking about eats and there might be children reading this).

I got the goodness of beef flank and tendon pho for around $6. Damn good deal especially since you can get this from 9am to 3am! :)"}
{"text":"The place was super busy, but even as busy as it was I was seated quickly.  Service thorughout my dining experience was good for a busy Vietnamese restaurant.  I mean I have been a dead, quiet Vietnamese restaurants and received worse service.

Unfortuantely, the food was not as memorable.  The pho didn't really stand out in anyway.  The condiments were the standard bean sprout, thai basil and citrus.  They give you lemons instead of limes.

I also ordered the pork meat ball spring rolls,  They weren't really pork meat balls, more like pork meat logs cut into planks.  The meat planks weren't that flavorful and because they were logs, grilled and then cut into planks, there wasn't that surface area to get that good charred, smokey flavor.  The sauce that came with the spring rolls was also very watery and didn't compliment the spring rolls well.  

The food is not spectacular, but the service is pretty darn good."}
{"text":"The first time we went to this place we found that the food was amazing, but the service was absolutely terrible.
Me and my friend decided to return to this place because we were starving and craving their amazing pho. When we arrived I went straight to the restroom to wash my hands. I look down at the floor of the restroom and what do I see? A cute little baby ROACH!!! Yes, a roach! Where's its mother I wonder? Probably with daddy roach reproducing more and more brothers and sisters so that baby roach won't be alone. Or maybe they are in the kitchen feasting on the delicious pho (hey, I don't blame them). Yes, it was just a little roach and yes it did freak me out, and yes we all know that when there's one theres probably many... However, when I got back to the table my fatass ordered some pho and eggrolls. I guess I wasn't too scarred! I refused to let the baby get in the way of my dining experience. I'm just glad the pho was delicious!!!!! Might have been the best and worst decision of my life 
Pho= 5 stars
My friend in the restroom=0"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was a little girl thanks to my half Vietnamese half Mexican cousin. She introduced us to this place as one of her favorite spots in Vegas.

That being said I've been here at least 30 times with friends and family and I'm always so satisfied. 

The pho is flavorful in itself, although it's true that there are times that it isn't served piping hot. Most of the time it does come out pretty hot, but when it doesn't it still is hot enough to cook my raw beef shank that I get in my number 11, which is hot enough in my opinion. I personally like to add some lime juice and a little soy sauce cus I'm a salty eater. I also tend to get an order of eggrolls to share with the boyfriend. Always taste so good, can't resist ordering some every time we go there. 

We also like to get the #89, the diced beef salad. That beef is to die for, and half the time I can't decide between a bowl of delicious pho or some of that delicious beef salad. My boyfriend likes to get it as a smaller portion with tomatoe rice when I'm more focused on my pho.

We've tried a few different things here and they all taste pretty good, but the #11 & #89 are our favorites with an order of eggrolls. Thai tea is also great here. 

I've gone to several pho places all over Vegas and most of them are more expensive for a less flavorful broth. Pho So 1 just feels like home. 

Unfortunately they've raised prices recently and sometimes forget to wash the lettuce that comes with the egg rolls. We always get seated right away but service is not the best. They're straight to the point, not really bad but not necessarily good. That's why I only give them a 4/5 even though I love this place so much haha."}
{"text":"Service was all right, the food was pretty good, but the bathrooms didn't look clean at all. I usually check the bathroom to determine the cleanliness of a place and the bathroom was disgusting. The smell of the last occupant lingered for a good 5 minutes and I still felt dirty even after I washed my hands.

Anyway, the food was pretty good. I'm not really a Pho connoisseur so I got the basic pho with beef balls. The server we had was all right. He didn't ask if I wanted a refill on my drink which bothered me because he refilled everyone else's but mine."}
{"text":"Hmm... There's not much to say about this place except that the pho was \"so so.\" the price was average. The service was very minimal, they only came by to take our order, deliver our food and send us the bill. Even when we asked for help, the bus boy gave us a look and said \"I'm not your server, I will get someone.\" Yet, no one came. I wouldn't recommend this place or discourage it... :/"}
{"text":"Got the Bun Bo Hue and an iced coffee here.  Had to stay this is a pretty vanilla pho house.  There's nothing about this place that stands out.  The service is decent, the pho comes out hot, and the prices are reasonable.  The biggest thing i noticed was how small the X-Large bowl of pho was.  I thought it was going to be beastly in size, but unfortunately, it was pretty manageable.  If you're staying on the strip and you want pho, i would recommend trying this place.  It's across the street from Hot N Juicy Crawfish which was featured on Man vs. Food."}
{"text":"Came here after striking out on 2 other Pho places during EDC weekend. 

This place was sizable and pretty easily fit our group of 12. It was close to the strip, about a 10 minute drive so we got in an out pretty quick. The parking is plentiful here unlike a lot of other nearby-the-strip pho places.

The service is what you'd expect at a popular pho restaurant. The workers are all running around trying to take orders, fill drinks, and deliver the food. It takes some effort to flag one down but it's fine, I'm here for the food. 

I got the regular beef pho and I it was fantastic! The broth was beefy and light. The noodles were chewy and plentiful. The meat itself was tender and juicy too! If i had to say, I'd say it was very comparable to Garden Grove pho.


If you're looking for pho near the Strip, definiately try this place!"}
{"text":"My cousins went here a couple weekends prior and said this place sucked. I shoulda figured it'd just gone downhill in the last year. Or maybe I shoulda checked my previous review first. My dumb ass ordered the bun bo hue. Shoulda gone with the fried pho. Maybe that's still good.."}
{"text":"Was in Vegas for only 2 days and was recommended from a Vietnamese friend to come here since we were in the mood for some delicious soupy noodles.  It was like 2AM and luckily this little gem was still open.  Simply put, this will be a must stop for me every time I will be going to Vegas.  

The soup in the Pho is a perfect balance of non overwhelming flavor, freshness, and authenticity.  Servers are very charismatic and prices are very fair.  Only con I can name is the place is a bit dirty feeling, otherwise an amazing meal!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why my parents swears that this place is the best pho place in Vegas...but sure. We always go here to grab pho when we're in town because they like it here. The broth is cleaner than most places that I've had...but it is also bland. I've tried their pho, shaken beef, and broken rice dishes... They all lack a lot of flavor.

A pro about this place is that they give you a lot of meat with their dishes! I just wish they had more flavor..but more meat is never bad.

The soda chanh (lime and soda water) is terribly mixed. Usually one would mix it with hot water first so the sugar dissolves but I don't think they do that at all. In order for me to taste the sweetness, I constantly have to stir the drink and drink really quick from the bottom before the sugar all settles again.

I want to say that I don't want to come back here again but my parents still enjoy it here. Maybe up until I find a better location..."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and my kids loved it. I did not love the service, though.  The waitress was weird & rude. When she took my order she didn't even look at me... She just walked by, wrote what we wanted, and left with a face of ignorance."}
{"text":"The pho here is awesome, there is a line out the door all day long.  Here is why I just give it an OK: they only take cash and you will get MSG Coma instantly.  I can't tell you how many times I fall asleep and feel drowsy after eating at this place!  It NEVER fails, everytime I eat here, it's like someone put a roofie in my pho and when you wake up, you drink a gallon of water."}
{"text":"We always order takeout: #15 with extra noodles and the crispy egg rolls. We have never been disappointed....highly recommend."}
{"text":"This has been my go to spot in Vegas for Pho.  After a long day and night of drinking, this place always hits the spot.  Hot noodle soup with a lot of lime and chili to wash down the alcohol after taste.  

Dac Biet or the Number 1 is what I always get.  It's simple and it has everything.  Egg rolls to start and I am set.  Then when i'm up for it I will add a cup of Ice coffee as well."}
{"text":"We literally went from airport to Pho So1, the parents came in from SF and I knew they would be hungry.  My man is on a \"eating healthy\" kick so he knew my old Asian parents would be just fine with going there.  My dad and I were doing the Tom/Bo Nuong Vi ( shrimp/beef we grill at table and roll ourselves), my man had pho tai ( rare beef pho) and the kids all had pho with no meat.

My mom (being vietnamese/chinese) was SO picky cause you know how old school asian moms are- nothing is as good as theirs. So she finally settled on the banh xeo (crepe like thing with shrimp, bean sprouts, fried and served with herbs and nuoc mam).  I think she complained the whole time that it was a little hard- not as soft as how she's had it in SF...okay mom, but you finished the dish...so it wasn't that bad?

My dad and I thoroughly enjoyed our dish- with the shrimp paste dipping sauce.  I think that's the best part of the dish!!  Yes, yes, I am SO asian cause that dip makes you stink SO bad, but is oh SO good!  Anyhow, they bring out all the condiments to our dish- lettuce, assortment of herbs, rice paper and vermicelli noodles.  We grill up all the shrimp and beef and roll away...YUM! Word of advice, don't cook the beef too long or it becomes really tough..

We also ordered a beef carpaccio dish (Bo Tai Chanh) that was really good, the beef was so tender. 

The place wasn't too busy when we arrived at 7:30pm but next thing you know, it filled up.  It seemed like a lot of people ordered the shrimp/beef dish that we had, but how can you not when first thing you see is people grilling meat at the table when you walk in?

Overall it was a good night.  Service was decent, better then most Vietnamese places, all you had to do was wave to someone at the counter and they were right over.
Oh- and unlike some places on Spring Mountain, they DO take credit cards...I mean honestly I never have cash on me and its always a pain to stop and get cash..."}
{"text":"We've been coming here for a while now and it's always a great experience.  Right when you walk in and get seated, right away you get a glass of water and get a few moments to look through the menu. Once you place your order the wait is not too long. comes out nice and hot and great portion also. the customer service on the other hand can learn how to smile, be up beat, and look like they want to help. besides all that great place to eat!! 

we order number 14 on the menu most of the time. we would recommend it."}
{"text":"Come here whenever in vegas for good quality and affordable price Vietnamese food.  It always hit the spot, especially after wasting all my money on the strip.  After being on the strip, all the food seems so cheap.  Very big portions too.  Definitely a must stop after losing all your money on the strip and need some great tasting food."}
{"text":"Now the original owners have made it back. The food quality  is better than previous Service is way better than before. We have been going there since they first open the restaurant when it was once side"}
{"text":"A must stop for the best food and service in Vegas.  One of the first pho restaurant in Vegas and the fact that it is always busy speaks for itself.  Open till 3 am everyday so it is a great place to have pho to sober up after the clubs."}
{"text":"Was craving pho so I came here to meet with my brother and his friend. I ordered #10 (pho with tripes, brisket, tendon, etc), eggrolls and the red bean drink. Pho had a lot of food in there which was awesome. Eggrolls were yum and I was alright about the red bean drink. It's not the greatest. 

There really wasn't any service at all but I didn't feel like we needed anything anyways."}
{"text":"They are great place always kindness and i love there Pho. I like No.14 and drink coffee 
:) my lovely place."}
{"text":"I thought I'd already found the best pho in Las Vegas last month, but Jennifer L. said that I have to try Pho So 1 if I was serious about my quest. I accepted the challenge.

They were doing pretty brisk business at about 2:30pm, which I wouldn't think is a peak time for lunch. It was a good sign. I was tempted to order the pho dac biet, but I gravitated toward my childhood favorite pho chin nam (well-done brisket and flank) as soon as I saw it on the menu. A small bowl is $6.95, and a large bowl at $7.95, which is probably about par for the course here in Vegas.

It took at least 5 minutes for them to come out with my bowl, which may not be a good sign. The best places will have a broth going and be able to fill a bowl very quickly. However, my worries disappeared when I started filling my mouth with piping hot goodness. The broth is nice and seems relatively clean, and the meat is generous. The portion size is also pretty standard.

There were things that could've been better though. Unfortunately, I think the only upgrade from the small to the large is the amount of meat, not the pho noodles. I started running out of noodles about two-thirds of the way through. I also got a relatively small portion of thai basil on the side, but at least it's fresh. Most egregiously however, the flank meat was hardly cut at all, so I found myself tearing away at the huge slices with my mouth. I did enjoying having a large piece of meat in my mouth, but it's probably too much for some people to handle.

For now, Pho Kinh Do is still the best in Vegas for my money, but I have no problems recommending this place as well. I might even go back and try some of the other dishes on the menu if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"My favorite pho joint in Vegas. Less crowded than pho Kim long and food tastes better too!"}
{"text":"The best Pho in Vegas!. However 3 stars because service is mediocre and fly in my wifes soup. I will continue to eat here because i love the Pho. They have alot of veteran servers but you guys need to be more attentative to your customers."}
{"text":"It pains me to update this review, but over the course of the last few months I feel that the service here has gone downhill.  On one occasion my family ordered their food and everything seemed to be normal.  However, my father's food never came out.  We asked multiple workers about his food and all said they would check on it, but his food never arrived.  When my father went up to the register to ask about his food, the lady working the register didn't even apologize.  It is such a shame because the food here is still good...it is just the service that is seriously lacking here."}
{"text":"One of the best Pho places in vegas to me. Definitely on my top 5. Their menu has a big variety to choose from & they are really fast with your order. They are also open super late! Yes! Only reason why I took off a star is because their staff is kinda limited. Some visits we don't get our water refilled & some days we do. Hit or miss I guess. The place gets super busy for original lunch & dinner times."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pho places in LV. I always order the Pho Tai which is pho brooth with, thin flat rice noodles, & thinly sliced rare beef. The meat is tender & easy to eat. Always a must before going heading back to California! They do get pretty busy. Do not expect too much service from here."}
{"text":"This was the first time I've tried Pho. A coworker suggest it and it was AMAZING. The beef was great, the broth was delicious. I accidentally made mine a bit too spicy, but I dealt with it. The prices were great, $5.95 for a bowl of Flank and Brisket Rice Noodle Pho. You cant beat that. The garnishes, consisting of Thai basil, lime, and sprouts, are fresh and crisp. The service was very fast and friendly. I will definitely come back and try the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"I can't believe how many people enjoy Pho for breakfast here! Maybe it's good for a hangover or for the hardcore Asian gamers? I can't say I met any of that criteria but enjoy a good hot bowl of Pho anytime. 

My order the combo Pho with meatballs added. Upon delivery - a large bowl of Pho with a side of mints, bean sprouts and sliced green jalapenos. The veggies weren't the freshest but the Pho was tasty and Pho So 1 is generous with the portions of MEAT. Sorry I'll never be a vegetarian - I love my meat too damn much! http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/hroo5nOO8b9QhHX0GLg7oA?select=H1AAcyWTM4lB74Y2gENNpg 

I got my carnivorous fix at Pho So 1 and it was  Pho-licious and would definitely return in the future."}
{"text":"So glad the original owners are back at Pho So 1! This is the original pho spot in vegas that I tried and loved right off the bat. My expectations is really high moving here from California and they actually exceeded it. Love their pho dishes and their wonderful customer service. Highly recommend this place if your looking for hearty home style Vietnamese food."}
{"text":"Although this is a Pho place (for soup), I always order Bún bi ch giò and it is amazing.  Yes, #81 was delicious.  What a concept, going out to eat to then cook your own food.  Definitely, one of the better Vietnamese Restaurants in Vegas."}
{"text":"Giving a 4 star for Pho places is quite high for me because I don't like to eat Pho at all.  The longest I haven't ate Pho was about 3 years and when I tried it again, it was okay.  While in vegas, my friends usually wants to eat Pho after the clubs and we usually end up at this one spot because they are open 24 hour or open just really late...which is smart cuz they are making money.  But Pho So 1 was GOOD.  Of course I didn't order the Pho (I never order Pho in restaurants), but I got Rice w/ shredded pork and porkchops w/ egg loaf.  I always order this dish and I must say, eating it here was the best one I had"}
{"text":"I'm one of those people that tends to shy away from anything outside of the realm of normal American food.  I'm down with a steak, burger, chicken wing, or anything without any discussion.  I really avoided going here for a while mostly because it didn't seem appealing to me.  

I'm really sad I missed out on this for as long as I have.  This place is amazing.

It's a Vietnamese place, and it''s good.  It loses a star because there are bvetter restaurants in the world, not because it's not worth 5 stars in the Vietnamese restaurant realm."}
{"text":"This place is consistently good, they broth isn't fatty or salty.

I like their tableside grilling and they have the best damn spring rolls I have ever tried.

The service is good if you can catch the waiters attention (good Luck)

That's the only reason they get four instead of five.

I hate waiting to get things I need like extra lime.

My food is getting cold and I need that extra lime in their asap!"}
{"text":"Whenever I'm in Vegas this place is the spot for delicious Vietnamese food. Typical Asian restaurant service. They expect you to know what you want to order. Waiter give you a menu and walk back to cashier and than comes right back and ask what you want. Lol like seriously what's the point of handing out the menu. I don't come here for service just for the food."}
{"text":"Wow this place is incredibly busy so my review will prob not matter... Lol everything was mediocre. Not terribly bad but not good. Worth the 2-3 stars. 

Guess I went on an off day because my eggrolls looked funny. I ate them anyways since I was hungry. :)"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the pho here. Was my second time here. A friend recommended it. Although I didnt get it 5 stars because they dont put much meat in the pho number 11 is what i usually get. And the service could be better. Wasnt the best service but their pho was good. I have been to other pho spots that are also very good and the service was great so its some serious competition with Pho spots in this city. Also had their Thai Tea and it wad yummy. Usually yummy at most pho spots though. If im on that end of spring mountain i will go to this pho spot again, just hope their service gets better."}
{"text":"I've been going here for 10 years now and despite all the Pho restaurants that have been popping up in Vegas, this one still seems to stay super busy and attract the most customers.  If you go here, you'll understand why...the Pho truly is number 1! :)

Just be warned though, you're not going to get great service here.  The food servers will point at the table you should sit at, take your order without even looking at you, and throw down the bowl of food on the table.  The busers, however, are super nice!"}
{"text":"First day of summer + making it to Vegas within 4 hours during EDC weekend called for a celebration of only one thing: a hot bowl of pho in the Vegas heat -.-

Hits:
* Big restaurant with lots of seating (that still feels hole-in-the-wall) so I'm assuming if there is a wait, it isn't long
* For large parties, they can easily split the tab at the cashier when you're closing out the check
* Decent pho, but nothing extraordinary that stood out
* A server dropped off a water pitcher at our table for us to refill ...Good call!
* A pho place that takes card in Chinatown :)

Lessons Learned:
* Leave the French drip filter alone if you don't want your coffee to drip slower than molasses

I'll come back with friends if they suggest it, but I'd rather go elsewhere to cure a hangover."}
{"text":"Efficient and friendly open spaced Vietnamese restaurant with a hipster feel. Then the food O M G! Pho #7 house special combo. Broth is flavorful and noodles a plenty along with the meats. (And that wasn't even my entree!) My Bun, aka Vermicelli Noodle Bowl with Charbroiled Pork & Beef was also super yummy! Love the fish sauce. The Gua Cuon, aka non-fried shrimp spring roll was good, too. Fast, efficient service. Definitely a keeper in our local book. Hence my review and Yelp bookmark! Highly recommend and we're coming back soon!
(One criticism to owners- pls fix the women's bathroom stalls. Very awkwardly configured. My knees touched the stall door and there's room behind the toilet to move it back. Or even perhaps move the stall door out more. After eating, no one wants a bathroom door that close to her face and knees. Lol)"}
{"text":"This is my 2nd time here (first time when I wasn't a yelper).

Their food is always good. For that I give it 5/5 stars. 

Their service is so/so and the cleanliness of the area and the bathroom could use some help!!!

I had to wave my waiter down just to get attention, and the bathrooms were super slippery and the trash was piling up. As long as they fix all these things, then I wouldn't mind changing my stars to 5/5!"}
{"text":"There are a ton of pho places in chinatown but after hearing that we were heading to eat pho our taxi driver recommended this place. There were lots of people waiting when we arrived, so we had a 20+ wait before getting seated. I ordered my typical Pho Bo Vien aka beef ball noodle soup and it hit the spot after multiple nights of giving my liver a beating. Soup was refreshing and beef balls were yummy. Service was kind of non-existent, they forgot our water until we realized it halfway into our meal, but it wasn't a big deal."}
{"text":"Love this place  lot of fresh vegetable.

big portion

friendly staff"}
{"text":"Addictive like water.

Meat flavored water nothing could be more exciting! Top it with pink meat and make the experience ride down your palate a hot, steamy affair.  Generously portioned & the perfect solution to end world hunger! A complete meal of  breakfast, lunch & dinner in a soup bowl with a hint warmth & tlc.

Energizer bunny prompt service. SIT - SERVE - EAT in under two minutes (don't take my word for this I may have just gotten lucky)

While lemongrass has recently suffered a stint of poor service, its satisfying to find the better alternative during a rare chilly night."}
{"text":"Pho So 1 was a pho so disappointing. This was my second time coming here and you would think that with a line out the door the food would be spectacular. This is the bf's favorite joint for some pho. This was my second time coming here and after the first time I thought it was good. However, I was extremely disappointed with the quality of pho. I ordered the usual pho tai. The broth was watered down....it didn't even have any beef flavor! There was a flavor to it that tasted funny. On a positive note, the egg rolls were good. They are larger than most places. This place is semi clean and the service is what you can expect from a busy place like this. Overall, it is just ok....."}
{"text":"Thit Nuong Cuon (grilled meat rolled with veggies in rice paper) and Pho Ap Chao (pan-fried pho) are the dishes to order here. They're still my favorites after 8 years of patronage."}
{"text":"This is your best value in town for Pho!!

Food is always consistent, and decent. Prices are very good, but when you get the bill,  check it against the menu. They like to sneak an extra dollar or two in there.

Spring roll is good, but if you get it late at night, you know it was made at lunch time, and the penut sauce is not thick, so ask for an extra portion.

The Pho is usually very good, though lateley, they have cut down on the portions of beef in the soup. 

This is not a place to take someone that you do not have a solid relationship with. 
In other words; if you're going on a date, I would suggest Ichiza, to impress, not this place. 

The floor looks like Mr. Clean's been on vacation for two weeks, the bathroom is frequently out of paper towels, and the floor nearby is sometimes slippery. Ahn D is right about the tables being sticky and gross. 

This place has been known to have Roaches who have lived in this place longer than most residents of Las Vegas. 

If you don't get the right waiter, you'll be unhappy. Don't be affraid to yell for a waiter. 
In the Asian Culture, there is almost no tipping, and the service reflects that custom. If you give a 10% tip, you're spoiling the help. 

Again, great for a larger gathering of cheap individuals, or family members you don't want to spend money on. If you come here on a first date, don't expect a second date."}
{"text":"they are quite generous with the veggies, but the broth is totally off. it's very bland and is not full of flavor. it almost tastes as though it's watered down. nothing spectacular with the spring rolls either. 

we ordered a drink, and it was not brought out but we were charged for it. =/"}
{"text":"I just moved here from Cali and today my friends took me to this restaurant. I, myself, had pho which tasted alright. My friend said it was good here so I took her word for it. But yeah I've had better pho. My friends on the other hand ordered something with vegetables on the side. As I was eating I saw something black on the plate of vegetables. I stared at it some more and it turned out to be a huge fly! It was a dead fly that was the size of a bee. I immediately stopped eating due to loss of appetite. My friends complained and they replaced the plate of vegetables with no apologies included. I guess this is normal to them because they weren't even surprised to see it. Eww!!!"}
{"text":"Give me pho or give me death! 

This place is so good. When you are driving around in Chinatown you will notice two things: the mind boggling number of foot reflexology stores and the incredible number of places to get Pho. I can't speak, yet, for the best place for your feet but I can recommend Pho So 1 for a wonderful meal. Delicious and authentic. The #10 Pho Dac Biet Xe Lua is incredibly filling and a bargain. The spring rolls in all honesty could be a meal instead of an appetizer. They are so big and delicious."}
{"text":"This place never fails. Anytime I want a nice bowl of PHO, it's there to deliver. Been coming here for years. Rice bowls are good as well. The consistency of the food trumps the complete lack of service. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I moved to Vegas 2008.. Before i moved further away, i eat there almost everyday but now 3-4 times a month#1 pho in Vegas.. I always go with my husband & my friends.. We like to order #11 #14.. Meatball..grill pork..egg rolls..a bowl of vermicili top with vegi, grill pork ,egg rolls n pour fish sauce on top.. YUMMY!!!"}
{"text":"Decent Pho place in vegas.  Came here on a Thursday afternoon around 11:30am and it started getting packed as the minutes went on.  I love pho ga (chicken) because I love chicken broth.  Not much of a beef person so i got the chicken pho.  To my dismay, the chicken was super dry.  The broth on the other hand was delicious.  My boyfriend thought his pho was okay too.  No other place to get pho than in Westminster back in California!  

NOTE:
-one bathroom
-chairs are dirty since there was so much dust bunnies in the carving design on the backs of the chairs!"}
{"text":"It's 4.5 stars- the service could've been a tad better. It was busy that night and it showed. The server took our order, and returned with our food a few moments later, but then didn't check on us (or refill our drinks either) and forgot to leave the check (I think he forgot about us). It happened to be St. Patrick's Day (thursday) but it's always busy here (and for good reason). 

I've been craving vietnamese food for a while (not my husband's fave). So I had my go-to dish (my favorite!!!), #58- vermicelli noodles (just right), veggies (crisp and fresh), eggrolls (tasty), and charbroiled shrimp (really good flavor). I was ravenous when the food came because I met a yelp friend, Sarah, for dinner, and I think by then, it was after 7 pm (I usually eat dinner at 6 pm-ish). Sarah ordered the same dish. It's $8.25 for the dish. I remember getting extra veggies (before, some years ago) but it's still a good sized bowl- satisfying. You know it's good when you've reached the bottom of the bowl and there's not much left. I've been to a lot of Vietnamese restaurants in town (missing something) but this still remains my favorite. And I'll always order # 58. This is one of the few places that I'll always order the same exact dish. Sarah (my Yelp friend) got the same thing too. It was nice having \"girl time.\" 

Lots of people were getting the grills at their tables, so naturally the place got smoky (made my contacts a little dry) and the next thing I know, I'm smelling the grilled food smell in my hair and clothes. At least, it smells good, huh?"}
{"text":"This might be the best pho broth in Las Vegas. It doesn't mean that it's the best ever or that the other dishes are great. I've unfortunately run across a lot of places where the broth is lacking in LV. Since I'm already a fan of pho so 1 in the SFV, this was a definite yes for me.

Egg rolls seemed soggy and not crunchy as if they were retried or heated after already been cooked. 

Summer rolls were delicious. 

I'll be back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Pho So 1 is a bit of a hidden gem. It is located just a block down from the Asian mall on the corner of 16th and Centre, and is just off of Centre Street. The entrance to the place is actually located on the other side, in the parking lot! I was taken here my first time, otherwise I never would have found it.

It is small and dinky and more than a little wonderful. The service is good, the food is good, and the atmosphere which makes it feel almost like a cafeteria is a little refreshing. It feels authentic, which I like. 

I'm partial to their springrolls (which come cheap) and the giant crispy egg noodle dish that they have which is just delicious. I always end up splitting it or taking half of it home. The Pho is also tasty and delicious, and very slurpable. They use quality beef which I like.

When I was here recently, I decided to vary from the selection of sweet dessert like drinks that they had on order. The three bean soy drink is filling and delicious, the aloe drink refreshing, and the coke with real lime juice is very sweet. I just wanted water... with some lemon. After finally explaining sufficiently (it took a little while) to the gentleman who I think is the owner, I received my water... and beside it, a little dish with two limes! Haha, it was totally cute and endeared them to me forever."}
{"text":"Where to go on a Friday night when you need to make it to National in time to skip the almost always massive line? Why yes, there must be a Vietnamese shop open for some late night eats. We were thinking of going to Shikiji but they were already closed. Our eyes spotted Pho So 1 across the street - decision made, we hustled over and were seated immediately. This is the original location (the second one is out in Midnapore). OG is always the way to go.

The prices are dirt cheap and their pho options come in three sizes (small, large and extra large).

- Vietnamese iced coffee with condensed milk (#32) ($3.99) - my sis and her friend both ordered up a Viet iced coffee. This one, which I've never seen before, was served in a bowl of hot water. Interesting. Drip, baby drip.
- Pork salad rolls with prawns (#19A) ($5.99) - don't fret, there are actually three rolls when you order but my sis is too fast for me and grabbed before I could get a picture. These were pretty standard fare.
- Bun bo hue (#23C) ($10.18 extra large) - I had to order an XL because why not? It's only a dollar more than the large size. The bun bo hue was very good - spicy, fragrant, good depth in flavour and smelled soooo good. The meat was a tad chewy but didn't distract from the main event. I haven't had a chance to try any other Vietnamese places in Calgary yet but this one was quite delicious.
- Pho ga (#16) ($7.88 small) - my sis ordered the chicken pho. Wow, a small costs you less than $8.00! WTF, that's like unheard of in Alberta. The small is actually pretty reasonably sized - she was bursting to the seams after eating her bowl.
- Shredded skin pork and grilled meat ball with vermicelli (#22D) ($10.88) - For some reason, we thought this was a shared appetizer style dish but it's definitely not. It's a vermicelli bowl with a couple spring rolls, meat balls and other goodies. I didn't have a taste but our other friend enjoyed it. Just know it looks different from the menu pic...

Pho So 1 was pretty darn good. The place is bare and minimalistic, but if you're here for food, the prices are extremely reasonable and the portions are generous. That's all I want when I go for pho. Close enough to downtown and they are open 7 days a week (bonus!)."}
{"text":"For someone who loves Vietnamese food I would have to say this is one of the best, if not the best.  Reasonable price, delicious and good service.  What more can I say.  Try it for yourself.  You'll thank me later."}
{"text":"came here since the crawfish place across the street was not gonna have the crawfish ready for another hour. decided to try the bun rieu and spring rolls and a cafe sua da.

the spring roll sauce was watery which ruins the whole thing cause spring rolls rely on the sauce to make them taste good. the bun rieu was not that great, more like a light tomato soup. prob gonna have to go back to give the pho a try. service was nice. coffee was cool."}
{"text":"Worst service in the world. Never refilled water at our table but did at every table around us. We didn't get an appetizer we ordered and they still charged us for it. Soup was luke warm. Definitely not going to return and don't recommend"}
{"text":"Omg I don't even know where to start. I'm just so happy that Pho So 1 just reopened again. I still remember when I first moved to Vegas 10 years ago, Pho So 1 was my go to spot for Vietnamese food. Their bo nuong vi and all other dishes, soup are still the same. Completely new modern, clean look and great customer service."}
{"text":"2nd time here after the place got new owners and I'm disappointed! They previous owners had everything on point and now it's just blahh"}
{"text":"Delicious Pho in Vegas! Perfect comfort food and great service! I will definitely come back with my family and more friends!!! YUMMY!!!"}
{"text":"Great pho, very fresh and huge portions. Certainly worth trying. The interior is a little cafeteria like, but the food makes up for it. Service could be friendlier"}
{"text":"We ended up here late night for a Pho fix and boy were we happy we came here. We all had the same #14 bowl and it was adequate. I liked that it was open late. The portions were ok. I guess it's hard to find a $5 bowl of noodles anywhere now. It's not 1989 anymore. LOL"}
{"text":"The food here is the best by far but I just can't recommend it because the restaurant is so dirty. The bathrooms are disgusting. The floors throughout are sticky. I just don't know how often I want to keep coming here to eat because I can't help wonder how disgustingly dirty the kitchen might be."}
{"text":"The smell of bbq meat permeates the restaurant as you walk in. You scan the smoky room and wonder where the smell is emanating from. 

We thought we walked into a plain 'ol ordinary pho spot but it turns out that this place specializes in bbq. There are little round black grills sitting atop many of the tables, along with a big platter of Vietnamese veggies, herbs, and then a plate full of beef, or a beef + shrimp combo. People grill their own meat, wrap them up in the veggies, and devour. Awesome! Must come back to try that!

Unfortunately, I was feeling under the weather and we stopped in for the chicken pho. This was one of the few restaurants that popped up when I researched \"chicken pho\" on Yelp. The reviews said the chicken was dry. I concur, the chicken was dry but the soup served its purpose and helped keep a temperamental tummy at bay."}
{"text":"Very average food.  Very unfriendly staff.

Bo Luc Lac was overcooked.

Should be called Pho-So-So.....get it?  Because the food is just, so so....

Muahahaha....."}
{"text":"I've been eating here since I was a kid. As I recall, the broth for their pho is flavorful, except that there is quite a lot of MSG (You will be really thirsty after eating the pho). When I go here, I just get their pho. And their portion sizes are quite small.  I haven't tried their other dishes on the menu."}
{"text":"This is one of the good Vietnamese restaurant in Vegas. We came in at lunch time on Saturday but we didn't have to wait for the seats. The employees is fast and helpful. I like the food here. In general, it looks clean, good food and helpful staffs. (4.5 stars)"}
{"text":"Perfect pho place after a long weekend in Vegas.

The broth is amazing (as stated in Momo's review) and is the perfect concoction for the drunkover individual (drunk and hungover at the same time. it happens).

The waiters are friendly (and funny) and were happy to help answer any questions we had.

There was a wait when we got there.. but not to worry! It goes quick."}
{"text":"Love it.  Love it.  Love it.  We come here every year on our annual vacation.  The food is delicious, although it was a bit salty today.  The service was excellent.  The waiters are very friendly."}
{"text":"The pho here was good but they have definitely raise their prices up. The inside of the restaurant definitely looks nicer and cleaner. I ordered a pho to go here and the flavor of pho was good. They have more items you can order here but I haven't tried it. This will probably be one of my to go spots for pho"}
{"text":"I went here when I first moved to Vegas when it was under its old management and it was good in its own right. It's now changed mostly in terms of menu items, and it's still very good. 

We got the beef with woven rice noodles, raw beef salad, egg rolls, charbroiled pork, salted lemonade, salted plum drink, and che ba mau.

The beef with grilled nicely with some char markings and you wrap it in the lettuce, pickled carrots/daikon radishes, mint, and woven rice noodles. The flavor was on point, a little salty from the meat but you get a nice freshness from all the veggies. They have the hot water and spring wraps in a little unit which makes it so much easier to hydrate it. 

The egg rolls were pretty standard but had a nice crunch to it. It kind of reminds me of when my mom used to fry it up at home. You know, **~*nostalgia~*~*


The raw beef salad was probably my favorite thing we got there. It's fresh, vibrant, and you get this subtle acidity from the lime. All in all, a very solid dish and it's a plus because this dish is so hard to find in Vegas. Most places do your typical viet pho, rice, noodle soups, etc, but the new changes to the menu try to give more variety than your usual pho joint. It's trying to introduce you to more Vietnamese food that you may not know about, and for that, I'm so glad. As someone who was raised on Vietnamese food but sucks at cooking it, I'm thankful for Pho So 1 for expanding the menu.


Overall, it doesn't taste exactly like the old pho so1, but it definitely is good in its own different way. Don't knock it down because it's not exactly like the old joint. After all, things change and sometimes it's for the better."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: I've been to Pho So 1 a few times and every time it has been clean and tables are always either all full or at least half of the tables are taken. I take this as a good sign that a lot of Vietnamese eat here too. After all, who knows their food best then themselves?

SERVICE: Walked in and immediately someone greeted me. I asked to see a menu for take-out and they let us sit and even gave us water! I asked the server what rice dishes were good and he took the time to explain several of the things that I had my hungry eye on. Very polite and even smiled which made me feel like I was welcome to ask any questions that I had. Tipped him well =)

FOOD: Steamed rice with Vietnamese noodles, salad, shredded pork, egg loaf and sour vinegar. Under $10 and very good. I didn't like the noodles so much because they have this coarse grainy feel as you chew, but everything else on the combo plate was so good, especially the EGG LOAF! Yum yum yum! Also, add sriracha and the sour vinegar to the steamed rice and you got yourself a tummy party ;-)

Love this place and will frequent it more often~!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars

Pho So 1 is one of our two Pho spots when we visit Las Vegas. The restaurant is located in Chinatown - not too far off the strip. This particular pho restaurant is located inside a plaza with the Asian supermarket.

Pho Tai Nam Gan Sach (7.99): Rare steak, well done flank, brisket, tendon, and tripe. Good amount of meat and soup inside my bowl. Broth wasn't as flavorful as it once used to be..

Weekends are normally packed during peak times. We were seated right away but it took a while for our food to come out."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. I think the waitress was a little grumpy...that if expected nobody is perfect.that did not take away from the great taste of the food. I will always go here! The thing is,i am not that adventurous when it comes to food, my husband talked me into it.don't regret it. Lively lunch time. Also, no tourists! Really like that."}
{"text":"Wow, I got to say this place has been gutted with all new furniture, which explains why they closed down.  When you walk in you feel welcom, it could be the attentiveness of the staff.  That doesn't stop at the door, they continue to check on you and ask if everything is fine.  Shocking right?!  That's a 180 degree turn from what I been used to at these establishments. 

So since service was on point, you all probably want to know how was the food.  Well, let me describe each with a small description.

Roasted hen with noodles - all I need to say is the flavor was non stop! A winner.

Roasted hen with tomato rice - kids loved it and it came with pickled daikon and carrots - YES!

Beef and broccoli with steam rice - healthy choice. Ok....

Rice plate with two items - egg meatloaf delish. Pork had alot of fat; bummer, planning to get the beef next time instead of pork.  

Will be back as this might be my regular stop again."}
{"text":"Pho is my favorite food and this is my favorite regular eatery in Las Vegas.  I eat here at least once a week.  Their pho is the best in town and I often try other places.  There is plenty of parking.  The place is always busy and most of the patrons are Vietnamese people, which is a good sign.  The atmosphere is mom and pop all the way.  (All great Vietnamese restaurants are mom and pop style.)  I usually get the pho tai bo vien.  This is the traditional Vietnamese soup with thinly sliced beef and meatballs.  It has beef broth and noodles.  Everything is perfect: broth, noodles, meat, veggies, & sauces.  Sometimes I start with goi cuon.  These are Vietnamese summer rolls.  Light and refreshing.  I love the peanut sauce they are served with.  This place is not high society and the food is not \"the best I ever had\", but it is consistently really good.  I've never been disappointed."}
{"text":"Never coming back here ever again.

I have been here for years but today I decided to never go back again.

I ordered a #22.. Just noodles & soup & the broth tasted super watered down. I normally get a pho tai though, which I haven't had issues with.

They did give me a lot of noodles in the #22 though but the horrible broth made it unbearable.

The waiter cracked a stupid joke saying \"he doesn't have time\" when my girlfriend ordered shrimp spring rolls & then asked him to come back since she didn't know what else she wanted. (Too lazy to edit this sentence)

She ordered a side of chicken & a side of white rice. She didn't want a whole big order because she said she won't be able to finish it. I had a bite of the chicken & it tasted pretty good.

I finished my water & put it at the edge of the table. Waiter drops off my girlfriend's chicken & rice & doesn't refill our empty waters. After another 10 minutes, I got up & went to the front to grab my own water (they have a lot poured & lined up in a tray)

I paid in cash & was too upset to leave them a tip. The cashier shorted me all 3 of my pennies. I was so sick of this place I didn't even want to leave them that. We just left with our unfinished chicken.

Decided to go to Pho Kim Long & Pho Saigon 8 from now on until both of the places upsets me & then I'll just pick my favorite pho place based on taste alone & not service & begrudgingly go there without expecting much."}
{"text":"Like all Vietnamese restaurants, the service is horrible and the restaurant is simply unclean. It must be due to the lunch crowd on Labor Day weekend and a Sunday. But they had these business card trays that were pretty bad. It really made my day when I read, \"We Speak English\" on one of the business cards. As if we were in some other country where English wasn't our primary language. LOL."}
{"text":"I can't believe that i have never reviewed this place especially since this is the ONLY place in the whole United States that I go to for Pho! I do not eat Pho anywhere else. This is the best Pho ive ever had. I always order the same thing when i come here, crispy egg rolls and the number 10. The superior broth has subtle notes of tea and jasmine along with its rich and hearty mouth feel. Just writing this review is making my mouth water. I always look forward to my next visit. Pho So 1 is the best!"}
{"text":"Well priced Pho

Parking lot, open late, quick service, fresh greens, cash/credit."}
{"text":"Possible bias review... Hangover fixture! We always drive off the strip to this place in Vegas' Asian central. I usually go with the pho after a night of intaking a lot of poison but this time I tried one of their rice dishes. It's number #67 on the menu: pork slices, egg, something else. I also asked for a side order of soup. The pork was a bit salty but hey, it's not like I had my taste buds to begin with. Just ate and ate and it all seemed good to me at that point. 

This place can accomodate big parties which is cool and makes it easier. My friends seem to like their food but then again, their current state at that time was probably like mine. The staff was friendly and fast. There are many pho restaurants in this area now, this is a decent one."}
{"text":"Go in looking forward to the food and you won't be disappointed. With that said, do not pay attention to the atmosphere, staff friendliness, nor cleanliness. :) Great comfort food after a night out of dancing and drinking! Love that they're open 24!"}
{"text":"Awesome place I love the combination #10 pho soup great broth, soft tripe and beef was excellent good job pho so"}
{"text":"Viet BBQ: BE WARE your clothes will smell like Viet BBQ after, other that that its delicious. Its a nice experience, you get to cook your own meat and shrimp to make spring rolls! I advise you to also ask for the fish sauce dip you might like it better than the dip that comes with the Viet BBQ. 

Pho: This is definitely my Pho spot, I love the soup and the portions they give are way more than enough for a small person like me. Not too oily and a lot of green onions and veggies. 

Egg rolls: Are big and fat and delicious, not like pho kim long their egg rolls are a lot bigger you get 4 rolls with this sweet chilli dipping sauce YUMMMMMM

Service: The service isn't the best but its good enough for me. Fast and good service, kind busers and waiters & the wait isn't so bad I usually can get seated right away."}
{"text":"Wow, this place makes awesome pho here. The broth is so flavorful unlike other places I have tried in the past. Customer service was excellent, definitely will come back."}
{"text":"Oh well, I dont know what to say, this place is famous for pho, and compared to other Pho restaurant, pho so 1 tastes okay, I don't expect much from any Vietnamese restaurant in Las vegas though, 
the beef dish cost 25$ is good, ( 7 beef dish courses), 
remember, u live in Las vegas, not Orange county or Sanjose where all the good vietnamese restaurant located"}
{"text":"We came here during the holiday and though the food was very delish, and service was good, they are not very organized.  It was a super busy night that night and LOTS of people out.  I think it was Christmas Day or the day after.

Anyway, we were a party of 16.  The waiter knew our orders and who ordered which, but some people in our party got their food pretty quickly, which was my husband, son, mom and someone else.  Then, it was another 15+ minutes before anyone else's food came out.  I ordered the same thing as my mom, but I didn't get mine for 15+ minutes later, when she was almost finished.

Then, a few more of our plates came out, which was mine, my brother's, my daughter's, my BIL's.  My daughter and my sister ordered the same thing, but my sister did not get her food.  Then, it took another 15+ minutes for my sister to get her food.  My husband, son, mom and someone else were all finished eating.  I was nearly done and she was just getting her food.

They were so NOT organized and I give them a 1 star for this.  However, 5 stars for being delish.  And they were friendly Asians, so I give them a 4 star for that."}
{"text":"The pho is pretty good here but the one critical review would be there there is a strong herb or seasoning in the broth that turned me off that particular day.   The herb plate offered sawtooth culantro, which I don't see alot since it is so expensive. They cater to alot of Korean clientele.  I saw alot of pickled veggies that is offered to the Korean customers for their pho.

The springrolls were pretty good.  My friends raved over and over about how there is actually meat in the rolls and there isn't as much noodle filler.  The rice dishes were well seasoned and the bi (shredded pork skin) was actually shredded pork skin.  The chao (jook or rice porridge) was nasty.  It is plain white porridge that they add chicken or beef to it.  It was so plain and kinda insulting.

The place is very clean and had a basic layout.  The service was very quick."}
{"text":"This place is a must stop place when in Las Vegas. I always just get the bowl of pho. After a long night... this is a great lunch/breakfast  wake up food."}
{"text":"On a quick business trip, I stopped by this location to have some Pho. The restaurant is clean and the restrooms were well maintained. The soup was delicious and you got a lot of food for your money. This is a busy restaurant and if you go during peak times, then it might take a little longer to get your food. I think the service here is how you get service at all traditional pho places ie: you write down your order on a sheet of paper and they come and pick it up when you are finished. There is a quick \"help yourself\" station at the front that has water and utensils so if you are like me and need to be in and out, you can quickly grab what you need instead of waiting for the server (if they are busy). If you like medium spicy soup I suggest getting the Peanut Style Pho Sate (recommended from the server)."}
{"text":"This place is a solid choice for Pho.  I didn't bother reading the menu (opting instead to go with my standard XL bowl of pho with rare steak and tripe), but if I had I probably would have tried the 16V that Sarah Louise mentioned in her review (though I would have added steak to it; I'm a vegetable-loving omnivore).  I'l be back for that...

Things I liked about the pho here included: a lot more sprouts and basil than I'm used to getting; a very meaty and robust (though slightly murky) broth; and the use of noodles of varying width (which create an inconsistency in texture that I like).

A couple of minor issues: first, the tripe wasn't sliced/shredded thin the way I like it.  Instead, it came in somewhat chunkier pieces, which I found  slightly unpalatable.  Second, by the time the bowl arrived at the table the 'rare steak' was well done.  Perhaps the broth was too hot; perhaps the steak was added too early."}
{"text":"Terrible restaurant !!! Do not come near this place!!! Food was tasteless. I have never paid for such disgusting food in my life. I will def not walk in there again. The only reason why I gave them 2 stars is because service was very good."}
{"text":"As far as ph? goes, this place has satisfied every time. I'm remodeling my kitchen and have been forced to eat out more than I'd like. I find myself here at least 2-3 times a week this past month. There are lots of items I haven't tried yet but I can tell you that the pho tai and the chicken pho are great. I usually subtitute the rice noodles for egg. The broth tastes rich and fresh. Good meat portions and fresh greens. The spring rolls and egg rolls are always good too. If your really hungry try the ban xao crepe. Service is super fast even though there are always tons of people here. 2 people can eat well for less than $20. I'd go if I were you :)"}
{"text":"My hubby got the ox tail pho & by far it is one of the best pho broth i have tasted. Not oily at all. We also got the egg rolls which was filled with meat. I ordered the pork rice plate which i loved. I would definitely go back again. I like the wood seating."}
{"text":"My to go place to have The Best Vietnamese pho Noodle Soup! 
The first time I had Phò Sô 1 was the Sepulveda Blvd. in Van nuys, CA location when visiting years ago
kept the business card and came back home to Las Vegas and realized they had a location here 2 Awesome and the same great flavor/quality totally recommend this phò place to all!"}
{"text":"Love it! We always order the same thing. Fresh Spring Rolls, number 12 and number 16 because I like the tripe and tendon. The pho is always super fast and delicious and there is always a diverse crowd. They are my favorite!"}
{"text":"My sister and I were in the area and chose this place based on a quick Yelp search. It was fairly busy when we arrived but we were barely acknowledged when the waitress dropped our menus off. We ordered right away as we were starving, and pretty much knew what we wanted. About 10 minutes after we ordered, I also requested a bubble tea, and the waitress was trying to discourage it, saying \"Uh okaayy...but it's going to take a long time\". I said that was alright as we hadnt even got our food yet, and didnt get it until 45 minutes later. The actual menu items were REALLY good. We shared an order of spring rolls and dumplings and both were AWESOME. We each got a bowl of soup, my sisters was veggie and mine was the well done beef. Soooo yummy!!! I figured they had forgot about my bubble tea (and the waitress never came around after we got our food) so finally we finished up and asked for the bill. It was at this point that she yelled across 3 tables (she was cleaning) to say \"Oh..you want your bubble tea to go?\" I just said no, thats fine. She said \"Ok. Sorry\" and went back to cleaning. My sister and I just laughed at how rude she was. Like I said, the food was awesome, but the service was crap so I wont be back. Many other delicious places to have Pho in Calgary - minus the attitude!"}
{"text":"Delicious pho soups here! Place is under new management do it looks nicer. Food is still yummy!"}
{"text":"I'd have to agree this IS one of THE BEST Viet joints in vegas!

Everytime I go here, I always get the grill yourself beef...i believe it was only $17...they definitely give you more than your money's worth of beef.  My boyfriend & I shared this (he also ordered a bowl of pho)...and we barely finished half!  Not only is the beef alone worth the money...but the veggies are plentiful & fresh and they offer you TWO different dipping sauces!

The wait staff is always friendly here....I asked if they could cook the remainder of our beef for us to take home.  They cooked it, and without me asking, they packed up extra bun (noodles), and the veggies and sauces to go as well.

It's always busy, but never busy enough to where you'd have to wait to get seated...

I recommend going here when you've got a viet food craving in vegas...skip the Asian Plaza with horrible parking/drivers, and just drive an extra minute west on Spring Mtn Road =)"}
{"text":"The original owners are back & I am so happy to see all the familiar faces.  The food is just as good as before. The interior has changed and the bathrooms are super clean. I love the decor! But here's what I recommend ordering:

Egg rolls with Fresh veggies *****

The pork vermicelli rolls*****
(Not a lot of restaurants have these rolls.)

 Table side grilled marinaded steak and seafood*********************** (extra good and so addicting)

Che ba Mau aka 3 color Dessert***** 


Living in Vegas for 20 years and I was sad to see them close for a few months but it was to renovate and improve. Looking forward to returning for more deliciousness!"}
{"text":"Been a loyal customer for more than 15 years, but this time was a huge disappointment.  The restaurant is sooo dirty. The tables were sticky and the chairs are filled with grimes.  The food is sooo horrible now that I can't swallow.  Ordered bun bo hue (spicy beef noodles) and it was all wrong.  You can't put gio lua (Vietnamese Pork Loaf) in bun bo hue and the pork used for springroll is also used for this dish. That's sooo weird.  Not to mention the MSG overload. Felt like they just accidentally drog 3 bags of msg in one bowl of noodle soup.  Overall, tasteless, cheaper quality in food, and dirty. Please hire back the old chef cause this place is begining to run down and hire a cleaner to do some spring cleaning cuz it doesn't look like this place is being clean since the remodel 10 years ago. Like others say, Bolsa 1 and Pho Saigon 8 are just down the street."}
{"text":"I went  here late morning when the restaurant was practically empty in a group of 6. They took our orders and 4 dishes came out a short time later. When we asked when the other 2 dishes (mine included) were going to come out, they looked at us for a second and then said \"oh, it'll be just a minute.\" Clearly they had completely forgotten about them and had to rush back and make them. However, even with a very simple dish of Pho, it took some time for it to actually come out. 

Definitely not impressed."}
{"text":"Super yummy! We've been here quite a few times now. The #1 fried egg rolls are good as always. We usually get the chicken fried rice and #36 crispy fried noodles. The only thing I really don't like is that the plates are SUPER small. Literally. The portions come in big especially the noodles but to stir its so hard to stir them when your plate is tiny. The staff is really friendly and and the service is really quick. Definite must try!"}
{"text":"Every trip I make to Vegas, I stop by this place.  Usually crowded and wait time could get unbearably long but food is consistently good and service is excellent."}
{"text":"Pho So 1 is my go to Pho place! Even their location in Reseda, CA. The lightening fast service is why I go to this Pho place. I don't like waiting 15 to 20 mins just to get a table at other places, and wait another 10 just for them to order my food. At this Pho place they will seat you within 5 mins and they take your orders right away and the food will be ready in less than 10 mins. Honestly the pho in this restaurant is the best pho i've tasted and I don't think any competitors and beat the pho in PHO SO 1."}
{"text":"It's decent. It's pretty good. Bad service. Blegh. Regular pho. I got the Pho Tai."}
{"text":"Another Pho place and of course shitty customer service. If there was a book on shitty customer service they would take the cover. I can't stress how bad the customer service is here. It's really bad, really really bad.
The food however is really good. I would consider this one of the best pho in town. I've had a few places around town, and this might be the best.
I would visit this place a lot more if the customer service was better. I think I visit this place once maybe twice a year.
I consider this the best pho in town, and the customer service is so bad that I only visit twice a year, so think about that statement. That sums up this place!"}
{"text":"nomnomnom.

After eating Pho Little Saigon, we had to try something different. Our friend recommended this place. And yes, I will be coming back if I don't feel like stuffing myself with Vegas buffets. 

We tried #80, which is the beef with lemongrass. You get rice paper, sauces, TONS of veggies (yes...I RIKE!), vermicelli, rice etc. I've never had this dish before and I don't know the name but you cook your own meat and make your own personalized wraps. This way you can judge how much vermicelli, veggies, meat or sauces goes in your wraps.

Service was good too. I usually don't expect the best service at Asian restaurants anyways. I'm so accustomed to nonchalant service that it's second nature not to care. But this place was certainly not the case. If there were bad service anywhere else then it's a different story :)."}
{"text":"This place has pretty good pho. Its a little watery and lacks cinnamon/anise flavor. Nobody really cares about service at Viet places but overall it was not bad, just don't expect much and you won't be disaspointed."}
{"text":"After a crazy weekend in Las Vegas who wouldn't want inexpensive and homey food before the traffic-filled drive home? I didn't even know Las Vegas had an Asian Town in it until my Viet boyfriend took me last weekend. He had the \"Special\" Pho and I had the Bun with Pork and Shrimp. We also shared the egg rolls and for beverages he had Ca Phe and I had the Plum Soda. Everything was really yummy- especially the egg rolls. I would recommend going with a vietnamese or spanish speaking person because the servers speak mostly those languages. Also, word of advice, go BEFORE 11am. After 11 the restaurant is packed with people that just checked out of their hotels. We have to go back and explore a lil more around Asian town :)"}
{"text":"The food is good but the service is terrible. This place can't seem to figure out how to serve more than two people and don't really speak English. On the phone they said, 'Come pick your food up in 30 minutes' which I think is long for a Vietnamese restaurant, that has 2 tables of people in it. I get there with a few minutes to spare and wait for another 30 f****** minutes!! Then the guy comes over asking what I ordered and proceeds to tell me they gave my order to another guy waiting 10 minutes ago. So now I'm sitting here 35 friggin minutes after they told me to come in, and god knows how much longer I will be waiting. The shitty thing is they have really good food but they need to figure out the service side and hire people who know what they were doing...."}
{"text":"The service isn't as great as it used to be. We constantly have to ask them to get us something since they are so busy. Also, the waiters aren't the most friendly people you'll meet. They just do their job and don't ever come back to your table to ask how your food is. 

The portions have also shrunken, but it does fit my appetite's size better. 

This is my favorite place to get pho though. Their food is still the best after trying different places. 

I suggest going earlier in the day because the restaurant does get packed."}
{"text":"Great Foods, Superior Services, Phenomenal Environment. Everything on the menus are um...um... good. Come check it out now."}
{"text":"Best Pho Place in Town.

this place is really good and they have enormous portions.

The one thing this place got right was that the meat they use is actually good.. its good lean meat and not fatty meat.. that is the little part of this place that makes the difference"}
{"text":"Pho is great. The only thing I didn't like is that you have to spend at least $15.00 to use a credit card. Wish I would've known that beforehand so I could've gotten cash."}
{"text":"our go to place on the way home from vegas! Love their pho and their bun. Their egg rolls are also really good. They're reasonably priced and service is quick. Parking is plentiful."}
{"text":"We ordered the seafood pho, egg rolls and spring rolls. The food was good and well prepared for our liking. The only negative i can find is the poor ventilation inside the restaurant with smoke and kitchen smell sticking to our clothes."}
{"text":"I come here pretty often, a couple times a month. I'm not really picky when it comes to service because I understand that they're busy and have a lot of customers to attend to, but their service today was horrible. I ordered my food and only received the egg rolls. I reminded them that it has been almost 40 minutes and I still haven't received the rest of my order and they quickly went to check on it. I assume they forgot to make it, but placed another order for me. After another 10 minutes I see my food being served to the table next to mine who came in 30 minutes after I did. They were going to retrieve the order from the other table to give to me, but the people who already received their food started digging in. I'm pretty disappointed because I was really hungry and was looking forward to eating their food, but at that point I just left. I was going to pay for the egg rolls that I ate, but they said sorry and that they'll take care of the bill for me."}
{"text":"I came here twice during my last trip to Vegas in July.  That's says how much my buddies and I like it.

They have a pretty big menu...ranging from your typical Pho to Bun Bo Hue to Com (rice) to Banh Canh (I think).  Most \"Pho\" restaurant only have Pho and maybe Bun Bo Hue but this place has options.  So it would please everyone in your party.

I ordered the Com (rice) the first time and it was ok - I wished the portion was a little bigger.  The second time, I ordered the Bun Bo Hue and it was pretty good.  Both times, I ordered the Che Ba Mau (3 bean dessert) and I must say, it wasn't that great.  The che (dessert) was a little bland.  I'm not sure why I ordered it a second time knowing what it tasted like the first time around...maybe I was hungry and wanted to give them a second try.  But yeah, it needed additional sugar or sweetening.

This place is about 5 minutes off the strip.  I would give it 4 stars but the Che left a...actually, it left nothing - no taste.  I would come here again, but will most likely skip the che (dessert)."}
{"text":"Service is very quick and attentive. The food is okay. Pho is pretty good, especially considering the area. Probably wayyyyy too much MSG, but that is to be expected. Good sized portions. 

I was very happy with the varied menu. They offer vermicelli, bun bo hue, bun rieu, rice plates, banh hoi, mi, hu tieu, including various appetizers. 

However, I woudln't recommend the Hu Tieu kho (I don't know about the soup one). I didn't like it very much. The clear noodles were flat instead of round, but that wasn't the only reason I wasn't very satisfied. They didn't have some sort of sauce and that chili oil thingy (like at Da Lat). 

Okay pho fix after a night of drinking and/or pill popping. = )"}
{"text":"The last time I was at Pho So 1, I saw a couple at a nearby table cooking their food on this weird round grill type device. I've been itching to try it ever since.

#81 on the menu. It actually comes in three versions. #81A is just shrimp, #81B is shrimp and beef, and #81C is shrimp, beef, and squid. Respectively, they are $21.95, $23.95, and $25.95. That was a lot more than I expected to spend, but I decided to go big and get option C... for combo!

Honestly, it's probably made for two or more people to share. But my cousin ordered the Bun Cha Gio and barely finished that. There was no way she was going to help me. It was all good. I powered through it and actually wasn't even that full by the end.

They give you rice paper, a plate mound of veggies, sauces, cold noodles... all that so you can cook the meats and make some sort of roll. I tried a few, but got lazy. I ended up just eating the meats and picking at the veggies. It was mad fun, albeit extremely time-consuming. I didn't take a photo of the raw food plate, but it really was a lot of meat to cook a little at a time.

Would I order it again? Maybe if I had a few people to share it with. I'm glad I finally got to try it."}
{"text":"Ok so it's a given that the food here is great. My folks are frequent patrons, and although I haven't been here in a long time, I thoroughly enjoyed the Pho like I remember. My one star isn't about the lack of organization tonight because it was so busy. Although, that was a big problem. Our server although was so kind, was so flustered and was running around like the place was burning down with no sense of direction. I would assume it's from the lack of direction and training of management. It's also not about the fact that we were checking in on an appetizer that arrived way late with someone who seemed to be an assistant manager and I watched him blatantly walk away and not check in on our order... hmm at least act like you're checking geez (short skinny, young looking guy, you know who you are ) . But really, the one star is for the man who seemed to be the owner of the establishment. I witnessed this guy, yell, correct, and humiliate one of the servers right in front of the patrons and for everyone to hear. This is a business 101 no, no... I don't know what happened, but you assess and correct employees behind closed doors. The sad part is, I was watching this employee during the duration of my visit and she's one of the few who seemed to be the most calm and attentive out of all the others. To the server with the dreadlocks, I apologize to you in behalf of that man who yelled at you   To business owners out there, people work for you, not the establishment. Give them respect, provide great training tools, keep them happy, and they will be twice as productive."}
{"text":"This is my favourite go-to restaurant for a good night of pho. They're flexible with service, efficient and speedy. Before the meals arrive, each customer's given a glass of hot tea to sip on. We're usually up for the beef flank pho and fried egg rolls (the sauce is awesome btw!). They go hand-in-hand like Noah and Allie from the notebook, incomplete with each other. 

Another thing I like about this place is that they accept requests to change the usual vermicelli to egg noodles (thin yellow). Vegetables are served on the side with mung bean sprouts. Not the classiest nor the most well-decorated place but it's a healthy alternative to the usual burgers and steaks, cheap and convenient. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Good standard Pho place. Cheap and tasty. Really hit the spot for brunch after a long night out the day before. Saw that they even have personal grills available for your table too."}
{"text":"My friends were yearning for Pho, and so was I. He said this place was the best and always comes here whenever he visited Las Vegas. But wait, this place isn't even the highest rated Pho place on Yelp! Hmm, lets see...

I ordered the #10, which was Pho with pretty much everything: rare steak, brisket, tendon, tripe, and flank, and also ordered an Iced French Filtered Coffee with condensed milk.

First things first, I have to taste the broth, and it was good. It had a nice clean taste, but it lacked the fragrance probably due to the lack of spices and herbs. I enjoyed all the meat, especially the tendon as they were big slices rather than small bite-size pieces I'm used to. The brisket was tender and not as fatty, and the tripe was tender too. They give you a good amount of rare steak, and it wasn't the freshest, but still all right. The servers were nice enough to give us an extra side bowl of hot broth to cook the rare steak. I particularly liked the noodles as it was thin, soft, and soaked the broth well. I was looking for the fish sauce, but it wasn't on the table! Whaaat? A Vietnamese restaurant without fish sauce? That's blasphemous! I asked the server, and it was stored on the fridge. That was close! I was ready to give this a 1-star if it didn't have any.

For six people, they definitely didn't give us enough bean sprouts and basil. I can toss in the entire plate, which I did plus some more because a couple of my friends are against bean sprouts and basil.

I waited and waited for the coffee to filter through into the cup, and when I took off the filter, it was barely half full... Plus, the bottom had the condensed milk! Uhhhh, this is not enough, especially when I'm running on fumes. When I poured the coffee into the ice, it was thick! I had mostly condensed milk with bit of extra strong tasting coffee. You failed, sorry.

The service was good. There was an army of people just standing there waiting to serve! They were attentive, and refilled our water and brought whatever we needed in a timely manner. Also, the food came out quick.

Overall, that coffee was a complete failure, but I did enjoy the pho. You receive a good amount of meat and a decent size bowl of Pho. My favorite was the tendons, and the thin noodles make for easy eating and slurping. The broth was light and clean, but lacked fragrance. Would I come back here on my next visit? Eh, maybe. Probably not. :)"}
{"text":"Let me preface my first pho experience in vegas with the following back story.  The last couple of days we had hiked the grand canyon, along with camping out so we were kinda tired of American food. After stopping at the Rio Seafood buffet the night before we were up for a change. 

Good pho in vegas?  No way, but i figured my Vietnamese friends would know better than me. I'll go ahead and separate my review into two parts,  the food and service. 

Food,  the pho was just ok. I got the Pho bo vien which is the Pho with meatballs. I thought the soup was a little bland for me. The portion size was decent and I got a lot of meat in mine, which is good. The price was a little higher than what I'm used to, but its Vegas, not So Cal, so not too bad I guess.The question I asked myself was, would I come to this place if it was located in So Cal. The question is probably not. The food was very average, nothing made it stand out. 

Now on to the service, The order came out pretty quick which i liked, however thats where the service got interesting. We had to ask for napkins, seriously what restaurant doesn't give you napkins to start off ? Someone in our group ordered the rice with pork chop, looked good, but we had to ask 4 or 5 times for a knife. Overall the service was pretty bad, and this is with asian people. 

I was told that with Vietnamese places, the ideal is to get good food out fast and not care about service. This is certainly true about this place, except the food was just decent."}
{"text":"Stepping into this restaurant gives you the perception the food is going to taste good because of the aromatics of this place. But like an Abercrombie store, this smell can be deceiving. 

The pho is satisfactory. The broth came out hot, but nothing special. Noodles were flavorless as well. 

I was sad to see the bánh hi dish butchered. The rice vermicelli was woven just fine, but the choice of meat was just bad. It was like meats off a skewer you find at an American restaurant. The proper way to sautee the meats with some onions and sauce. The meat just was lacking any real flavor. So much failure for such a traditional dish.

Like most Asian restaurants, what is service? You sit down, order, eat, ask for check, pay, and leave.

While the Pho here is satisfactory, the issue with the bánh hi is disappointing. With so many other comparable Vietnamese places, might as well go to one of those other places instead."}
{"text":"The spring rolls were really delicious! The food was good too! The only bad thing was the service...they ignored us and my dad basically had to be our waiter!"}
{"text":"For lunch we shared a bowl of pho tai (rare steak) accompanied by fresh basil, herbs, lemon and bean sprouts.  A liberal skirt of Sriracha chili and I was happy.  We also shared a delicious order of goi cuon (steamed egg rolls with shrimp, noodles and veggies) with a peanut dipping sauce. Highly recommended for anything that ails you."}
{"text":"3/7/18 they are OPEN again place looks pretty remodeling is wonderful staff still friendly and nice food is still great as always Glad your OPEN"}
{"text":"Stopped going here because the owners give attitude when I try to use my card to pay. It's because I'm Vietnamese, and to them, it is ok to ask a Vietnamese person to pay in cash (so they can keep it off the books, not pay taxes, and make more money) which causes a huge inconvenience to me, the customer. They would never ask a white guy to pay with cash if he wanted to use his card. It's 2015, people hardly carry cash anymore! And this isn't the Vietnamese community in Westminster where this is commonplace. I'm sure that you guys already underpay your workers, can't believe they are going to nickel and dime the customers as well. Luckily for me, I've lived her for almost a year now and have discovered plenty of good Vietnamese restaurants popping up everywhere."}
{"text":"Food is generous portion. 
hot tea is good, warm the heart.
Server is friendly and listen to my special request order. 

Other than waiting for a while to find the menu, everything is super.. Pho' 8 can go to the dog house. Pho' 1 comes to the front from now."}
{"text":"I've eaten a lot of Vietnamese over the years. I am not impressed by this place at all. The table where we sat weren't that clean. The tea tasted like the cup was used for holding soup.  The chicken and tomato that I ordered tasted like an imitation Peruvian dish."}
{"text":"You know you like Pho, when you pass up the many buffets in Las Vegas, jump in a car and go for a hot bowl of goodness.  At current buffet prices, pho is a steal of a deal.

Pho So 1 is doing a great job.  My experience with pho has been limited to the San Gabriel area of Los Angeles.  I'd have to admit the pho here was really tasty and they had all the regular add on's I get in Los Angeles:  Onions for one.

One thing I was disappointed in was the spring rolls.  They were not tightly wrapped and the dipping sauce was not very good.  I ended up dipping the spring rolls in fish sauce instead.

They do a good job on the Vietnamese coffee too.

Skip the rolls, go for Pho.  Just so you know this place is not on the strip it's on a stretch of Spring Mountain road packed with Asian restaurants and yes, massage parlors.  There are tons of options, so go explore.

Just remember what happens in Vegas...  stays in Vegas

Except the pho, that I'm telling you about."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere! Delicious foods! Generous portions! Very nice rustic industrial decor!  Highly recommend this joint!"}
{"text":"This is a long overdue review. I've been here so many times but never left a review, so this is gonna be a super looooong novel. 

We usually come here once a week or every other week and order a giant bowl of pho (pho Xe Lua meaning pho with an XL size) and a regular pho. 

We like the broth. My husband hated pho because of the first bad experience, but he really likes it here. I don't like the noodles that they have so I substitute it with the flat rice noodles, which is more similar to what we actually use in pho in Vietnam. 

Service is just okay or even less than average. They drop your water and your food and never come back. They might be back and ask if things are okay, if we get lucky. Sometimes service is bad, today is an example. The giant bowl looks pathetic, feeling like they just put the same portion of a regular bowl into an XL bowl and pour a lot of broth in it. It's just not even close to the amount we usually get. When I asked the manager/supervisor about it, good thing I speak Vietnamese, we argued back and forth and eventually he said it did look less than normal and gave us more noodles, not meat though. 

The charbroiled pork noodles (#47 and #48) are good too. Sometimes the sauce is a little salty as they put too much fish sauce in it and I don't like fish sauce that much. 

Another good dish is #80, grilled marinated beef wrapped in lettuce with noodles. The only thing is that you have to grill it and wrap it yourself at the table. But it's very good and is really a popular dish here. 

#91 the grilled pork meatball is a little sweet and dry for my taste. I enjoyed the first few bites, but eventually tired of the dryness. 

#63, Bun bo Hue is very flavorful. If you don't like pork blood like me, you can ask to substitute it with more beef. 

#95 is just ehhh. It's bland. I wouldn't recommend getting this at all, unless you pour a bowl of fish sauce on it to make it more salty. 

Overall, food gets 4 stars, service is 2.5 stars. In total, 3 stars."}
{"text":"If I could give a lower rating I would. Don't get me wrong the food was good BUT the waiter served us this dish that we didn't order. So naturally me and my friends poked around with the food until the waiter realized he served the wrong table. So he takes the dish from my table and re-serves it to the people next to us... I can't even believe what I just witnessed."}
{"text":"Had a BIG bowl of Pho with a spring roll, and the large bowl was huge. Excellent flavor and the meat was tender. The spring roll was crisp and tasty. The only complaint I could think of was finishing all of the ingredients in the bowl left a LOT of broth - which was good enough I couldn't really complain at all."}
{"text":"Their pho is the best I can find in Vegas so far. However, the rest of their menu is only ok. They make their meats very dry. I was here with 7 of my friends and all said their meat were dry. I'd only come here for their pho and egg rolls. That's it."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to go for pho. I can't say it's the best because it goes up and down through the years but it's still the best for me. The only other option is #8 up the street, heading west right before Jones. My friends and I have been coming to this place for the last 15 years. It used to be true hole in the wall with holes in the wall then they upgraded the joint with LCD tvs, then they removed the LCD tvs. I guess they decided they were too showy. How can you charge those prices and then renovate it with marble floors, countertops, and LCD tvs and pretend to be affordable??? I don't know. I just eat there.

The pho is usually good. Sometimes the meat has a little fat and if the cook is lazy the broth is not 100% steaming hot. Which isn't a problem except I usually like to get the beef on the side. Yes, you can ask for the meat on the side. Where they will put in on a small plate and you dunk it in when you get it.

The restroom, like most Asian restrooms, is a place I often tiptoe around to pee. I am just glad I don't need to sit and can pretend I am a firetruck hose in these instances.

Like most pho places if you go in as 1 person or 3 people, they give you 1 plate of mint and bean shoots, so you may want to ask for another plate if you actually like veggies like me.

The broth is usually good although there were times where it was too fatty and oily for my taste. It usually taste a little more hearty compared to the pho broth at #8. They probably put more MSG in it I assume. Whatever the reason, it's the better broth in town. I heard that they opened another location and took the cooks with them to open the new one so maybe that's why the broth was not what I was accustomed with.

But for $8, and you want a not bowl of pho, you can't go wrong with this place. Just make yourself a firehose if you are a dude and need to donate some to Lake Mead.

Like most Asian restaurants, I usually try to sit away from the door, so I sniff my nose, point at a table somewhere and ask if I can sit there. Being an Asian restaurant, they can usually care less, and say ok.

When you are done, look at the number pasted on your table, go up and pay. Simple as that. No one to come and ask you to take your check, money order, or cashier's check (like a proper French restaurant probably does in Paris)."}
{"text":"It's everything you want in a Pho Place. You aren't going to be wow'ed by service or ambiance but if you're in the mood for some tasty pho in an efficient manner then this is your place. Plenty of parking, plenty of seating, and plenty of food! Careful if you're eating alone because of the credit card min of $15!

I'm from San Diego where I feel we have superior pho (larger Vietnamese community) but this place has a soft spot in my heart and the Prime Rib Pho is a novelty but it fits well with their broth!"}
{"text":"Went there last night with our big family from out of town.  We ordered pho, rice plates, crunchy noodles, shaken beef rice, & rice noodles.  
Pho-The pho came out just lukewarm, and the brisket was very fatty.  I couldn't eat half of it.  Also, the basil was very bitter and there was no other veggies besides bean sprout.  
The crunchy noodle (mi xao don) was not good.  There was not a lot of meat & the 2 shrimp on the plate were TINY.  The sauce was runny and very salty.  I don't recommend this dish at all.  
The rice plate was also mediocre.  The grilled pork was very dry and they don't give you enough rice.
Anyways we will be looking for another Vietnamese restaurant the next time we're in town."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Las Vegas. It's always busy here, but it's worth it! from spring rolls to Pho, everything is great! It's affordable too and good food. They do not serve vietnamese sandwiches here, but they have awesome pho with lots of meat than noodles."}
{"text":"I'm not a typical vietnamese girl, I really don't like to eat vietnamese food.  But when I'm with my family that's all they crave for.  The place wasn't that clean and the table was so sticky that I had to clean it again myself. Everything I ordered on the menu was either not made for that day or sold out. So I end up ordering the fried egg noodles with seafood & vegtables on top.  The noodles was under cooked and so it wasn't crispy and the sauce was very bland.  The chicken salad wasn't even that great either and the spring rolls paper were pretty hard on the spring rolls."}
{"text":"My first review was 3 stars. I came on a busy day and my meal was rushed and there was , as always here, no customer service. Today my husband talked me into going again. 

Lack of customer service remains. They were a bit rude. Maybe they read my last review. Either way , my husband will have to find someone else to go with him. They raised their prices as well. Not. Coming. Back."}
{"text":"Service can be slow. I suggest if you pho regular just order when u sit down. Other than that the pho is sooo worth the wait. The broth is still rich and tasty as ever. Still give u lotsa meat!!"}
{"text":"This place used to be my favorite pho.  After a night on the strip, pho cures.  We discovered this place after meeting some strangers at the Venetian Valet.  They said this place was the best pho they've ever had.  So my gal pals and I headed over and agreed this was place was top 2.  However, it has gone down hill over the years.  I was so embarrassed the last two times I brought people here on high recommendation and were disappointed both times.  Service was slow, and most of us didn't even finish half of the food. It's not the worst food, but i'm certainly not coming back for average pho.  Now, we have to look elsewhere...."}
{"text":"A COCKROACH fell from the ceiling onto my plate as my companion and I sat there chatting after our meal!!!  

I'm a regular diner here having lived in Vegas for over 2yrs.  Usually I get the Bun Bo Hue (one of the best place in town for it) or the generous portions of Tai Nam. No matter how good the food taste, I am NEVER going back.  Definitely will call and notify the city's health department tomorrow."}
{"text":"I go here all the time and I think they have some of the best tasting pho compared to some places. I loved going to this place but the customer service was alright. Nothing too great. I would rate it between the range of below average to slightly average and that's just for their customer service. 

Other than that, the food is excellent.
Or so I thought up until last night.
We had a beef and shrimp barbeque and it came with plates of  different vegetables, noodles, and rice paper rolls to make your own roll. Similar to a spring roll.
Anyways, on one of the lettuce they gave us, it actually had a BUG in it!
What the fuck?? 

That's why I rated this place just OK.
I would've given this place at least 4 stars if it wasn't for what
happened last night.

PS. Their bathrooms are pretty dirty."}
{"text":"This is 4-star Vietnamese restaurant in LV at 1-star expensive scale.   You can enjoy many Viet dishes.   Customer service is excellent.  CD for AZ"}
{"text":"As soon as we arrived someone brought us green tea which was very nice. The soup was really good and the place was clean. On the downside the service wasn't that good. We were never given any water they forgot our drink orders and never came by after bringing our food to check on us, so we just never got our smoothies. They weren't even busy when we were there so the really was no excuse for the lack of service. So we left disappointed."}
{"text":"I have been going to PS1 like forever (since I know it's existed) - every time I visit Vegas, this is 1 of my fav restaurants.  They just remodeled recently and I'm loving the new modern/neat look!!
Food is always amazing - I'd recommend their bo tai chanh salad (rare beef with lime juice salad), besides the pho and bun bo hue (my go-to comfort food)."}
{"text":"Food is good.  Staff is not very attentive.  I like the Pho and the marinated lemongrass beef and shrimp that you cook yourself on a grill at the table.  They don't skimp on any of the sides.  I would definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This is my husband's favorite Vietnamese restaurant. We went here for lunch on a Sunday and they were packed. The reason for the four star is that we waited for someone to acknowledge us and get us seated. But we always expect it when we go here. 

Food is consistent and if your looking for excellent service you'll be disappointed, but you'll get service.

Place is always busy and packed no matter what time we go here, I just hope they keep the place clean."}
{"text":"We usually come here for pho, but tonight I'm treating my love to his childhood favorite , bo nuong vi! 



I still think the seating arrangement is weird, we stood in front waiting 10 minutes before we got seated. 



Food is always great!! 

Definitely reminds me of garden grove."}
{"text":"We came here to celebrate my daughters birthday. I have a friend who loves the place but I am very picky about my pho. We decided to try it. My friend ordered the egg roll appetizers and we all ordered pho. I even got rare steak on the side. Everything from the broth was a huge disappointment. The steak was very low quality. No one finished their pho. Even the ice coffe was gross. The egg rolls were bland. On top of that service was super slow and they didn't have ac running in this Vegas heat. Never again!"}
{"text":"I'm a picky Pho eater. As a Vietnamese, it is my duty to eat it at least once a week so I know Pho. This place is in my top 3 Pho place of all time, if not the top. The broth makes and breaks Pho. Everything else are just complimentary. This place makes the Pho broth that made my knees weak. I ordered the oxtail Pho. One taste and I was stunned how good it was. No need to add any sauce. It was perfect."}
{"text":"My friends and I used to eat here a lot when we were poor starving students. When you're  in the middle of the hot desert and craving for some pho, take your caravan here. The menu is extensive; the prices are reasonable;  and the staff is friendly."}
{"text":"So happy that this place Reopened. When we first moved to Vegas 12 years ago this was our favorite pho spot! And still is! Newly renovated. New menu. Great atmosphere. 
We order the Pho Tai Nam, egg rolls and the Chicken Roti with egg noodles. Everything was delish!  My fav was the Chicken Roti (must try).  
Service was great! Waitress was very attentive. Food came out fast and piping hot. And Our water/tea glass was never empty lol. One of my pet peeve's"}
{"text":"Pho So 1 is my go to place for amazing Vietnamese food. The services is always great and they are always very attentive. The Food is delicious and never disappoints."}
{"text":"Perfect after a night of... Vegas fun. A little broccoli overload in my veggie pho, but it was all so satisfying. Don't ever expect great service at a place like this. The Vietnamese coffee was really good. Would go here again!"}
{"text":"i can only give a 4-star since i only came in for to-go.

i just moved to las vegas and heard several good reviews about this place so i decided to give it a try. i came in around 8pm and the place was packed - keep in mind they open until 3am. 

i ordered pho with meatballs and bo luc lac just to try it out.

i thought it was nice they offered me a seat and handed me a glass of ice water while i wait. i noticed they also sell beer and other beverages, there is a lot a lot of workers so i'm sure you'll get undivided attention if you dine in. i scammed around the restaurant while waiting and noticed a ton of non-asians. they say if an asian restaurant is filled with non-asians then don't trust the place, lol but this place was actually really decent!

my soup was steaming hot even by the time i got home and it was delicious! it was so much food that i could barely finish (and i am a fatass), i thought the broth was on point.

overall, i think this place is pretty bomb and i would prefer this place over pho kim long. give it a try!"}
{"text":"The Pho is great as are some of the other menu items, like the grill at your table selections. My family and I love Pho So 1."}
{"text":"I really love this place. We came here for dinner one night after having been on a search for crab sticks to make spicy crab sushi at home. We were starving it smelled awesome so we decided to try it. The egg rolls were light and crispy and then just by chance we decided to try the lemon grass grilled beef that you cook at your own table and I swear.... this is my fave meal ever. So yummy. The service was fast and it was just excellent and if you order that beef dish and egg rolls for two, then you have left overs. BTW they stay open til 3am most days."}
{"text":"This place has the best Pho in town.  
I don't often go to a Pho restaurant, but when I do... I only get Pho, usually the mixed special with all the flank tripe tendon things in it.  And the place has the best Pho and best broth in Las Vegas.  
Love it!"}
{"text":"i love their rare steak pho. Everytime i feel cold and lonely, this is the place to be. Great food, atmosphere."}
{"text":"Within the past 4-5 months, my experiences at Pho So 1 have been bad but didn't want to rush to judgment until now. 

I have tried Pho several times and other items that I normally ate at Pho So 1 and the food just weren't the same. I finally reached a conclusion: whoever managed the kitchen or whoever the main chef was, they must not be working there anymore.

First of all, the good old day Pho broth at PS1 wasn't great but at the same time it wasn't bad. Now, the broth tastes so bad, I don't come to PS1 for pho anymore. The broth tastes like somebody went to the Asian market and bought the dried pho flavor in a teabag pouch and dip that pouch into boiling water and served that to the customer. It was that bad.

Other food also did not taste the same. Beside Pho, PS1 was also known for their \"Bo Nuong Vi\", which basically allowed you to grill meet at the table. Their dipping sauce used to be soooooooooo good, but now it's smelly.

Another good indicator is the place is not crowded like before anymore. Too bad, because I used to like PS1. :-("}
{"text":"Quick & Dirty: I would confidently bring my parents to eat at Pho So 1 because they hit on how a restaurant should represent our people's food. (I don't say that very often about Vietnamese restaurants, too.) And other peeps feel the same way because I saw mad Viet families up in there, yo. lol. Asian to non-Asian ratio was like 15 to 1.

Things to know:
*****
I. LOCATION & PARKING: Find Pho So 1 in the center of a strip mall off the intersection of West Spring Mountain Road and South Decatur Boulevard (Chinatown). They have plenty of parking.

II. FOOD & DRINK: Sure, they have your rice plates, bowls of soup, and noodle dishes, but they have multiple iterations of each kind (something I've only seen in Cali and Houston). I tasted the following:

*Goi Cuon ($5.95): Pricey, but worth it. I tried both their bo nuong (charbroiled beef) and tom thit (traditional with pork and shrimps) and loved their on-point flavors. More importantly, though, their sauce had an ideal consistency and peanut buttery taste. 

*Oxtail Pho ($13.95): I don't prefer oxtail pho because I don't like the smell as much as shoulder or femur, but I tried theirs. And I liked it! They scoop the scum from the pot, which results in a clean, translucent broth.

I also like how one can order different sides. I asked for gan (tendon) and nam (flank). They cooked both very well. 

*Cafe Sua Da ($3.75): I would probably dock them a star for not bringing it out with the coffee drip and glass of ice, but I can't hate. It tasted both bold and sweet. Kiss me.

III. SERVICE: Fast. No problems there.

IV. AMBIANCE & DECOR: The newly renovated restaurant feels clean and modern, without losing its Vietnamese roots. Also, they have three different sections, and it seems like most of the tables can accommodate large families. 

V. PRICES: Most dishes cost less than $10. And for the amount of food one can get that's a lot of value.

VI. OVERALL: I think Pho So 1 gave me the best meal during my most recent Vegas trip. Thanks for steering me in the right direction, Yelp!"}
{"text":"My mom introduce me to this place on my visit. It was an alright spot it was definitely roomie and big for a pho place. I'm so use to see small areas but this one looked like it was two spots connected as one. 

I've ordered the special combo pho and it was alright. I'm always venturing to try new pho restaurants and know when one will send me flying through the roof in foodgasm. However I didn't get the feeling here. I still had to add more seasoning to the broth so it wasn't as bland. 

However the staff were friendly and didn't complain to take pictures of my mom and I. They even got into a long conversation with my mom which shows they are sociable with their customers. Otherwise it was alright here."}
{"text":"New mgt, poor customer service and quantity of food is half of what they used to serve but prices increased. This used to be my fav pho place.. what a disappointment!"}
{"text":"We were famished when we got to Vegas and hit Chinatown first, we had read about Pho Kim Long and Pho so 1 but decided on this one because they had lots of dishes from the Bo Bay Mon.

The Pho came out barely warm, it seemed to be their problem, many reviewers also complained about this, I complained and they immediately replaced with another bowl with piping hot broth, the broth was amazing, it had the flavor of bone and well cooked beef instead of many pho restaurants using a lot of MSG and some can broth, this Pho is definitely a 4 stars, perhaps even 4.5 stars, the meat was plentiful.

The grilled beef was really grilled, the problem was they used lean beef so there was not as much flambe taste as would have been the case had they use a rib eye or a nice sirloin steak. It came with vermicelli, rice paper and vegetables. We would definitely come back for the Pho, I wanted to order the grilled ground beef wrapped with bacon but either did not see it there or forgot the name to order that, that dish is the best in the 7 course beef. Although they no longer served a 7 course beef as an entree, they had almost all the courses to be ordered individually, this became expensive at $24.99 for 2 for each course.

I would definitely come back, wish I could go back to Vegas already! all the Vegas buffets were lame except the Paris hotel buffet, I would like to go to the Chinese or Korean buffet they have in Chinatown, I have been going to Vegas for the past 24 years but this was only the 2nd time I went to Chinatown, it had grown so much, the only problem was it was far from the strip and the action."}
{"text":"Bad customer service.
We are new to the city and want to have the Vietnamese food.
Of course the food here is not as good as California, but it is acceptable. 
However, the customer service here isn't excusable because the guy who helped us order today did not have good attitude. He asked us kinda rudely and seem like he did not have any patience."}
{"text":"About 3 weeks ago I came to this place to eat pho, my experience with pho was really bad..slow down on the MSG, you don't want to kill the customer before they can finished their food and to day I got vietnames upon noodles (banh canh). Do you think all of your customers is stupid. When you say pork,shrimp, and crab the customer expect everything to be included not missing and say that it doesn't come with it. You charge me extra for it, when I can just get the regular for the figure price."}
{"text":"I only put a star because I have to. Otherwise I would give it no stars. I went in here yesterday to eat with my boyfriend and brother we all ordered a soup. I saw a cockroach in my soup and told our waiter. Barely touched my soup and my boyfriend didn't touch his. They used the same broth since we ordered the same soup. We weren't gonna eat a roach infested soup. On top of that they tried to charge us for 2 instead of one. When I told her I wasn't paying for it she got mad and called us names in Vietnamese. We know a lot of them so we know the bad words in their language. I was disgusted that they even had the nerve to talk shit when they should've been embarrassed. I gave them a tip n everything n they still called us DUMB MOTHERFUCKERS as we walked out. I'm never coming again n I hope everyone knows about there roach problem. I wish I can talk to a corporate manager!"}
{"text":"This is the best Pho I've had in Las Vegas.  In southern California, Pho restaurants are as common as McDonald's and Starbucks, and even those who grow up not being Vietnamese become addicted to Pho.  Being from southern California, I had to find myself a great Pho restaurant when I moved to Vegas.  I have tried practically every place between my house and Chinatown, and can say that Pho So 1 is the best I've had.  

The flavor of the broth is what differentiates a great Pho from an average Pho.  Meaty, spiced, aromatic, and palate-covering are the characteristics of a great Pho.  Pho So 1 has all of this going on in their bowl of Pho.  The broth is meaty and has aromatics even before adding the fresh herbs.  The aromatics seem to come in the form of Star Anise, or Chinese Five Spice, or something of that nature.  Whatever it is, it's great. 
I like to tear up all my herbs, and add them in to stir them around to create a smell that will likely make you roll your eyes at how awesome it smells.  You know that feeling you get when you smell the food your Grandma used to make?  While nothing can truly compete with the smell of Grandma's Bagna Cauda, this aromatic smell of Pho is as close as it can get.  

I usually get a Thai Iced Tea along with the Pho, maybe even some Spring Rolls.  Both are very good, and I would highly suggest them.  

Overall, Pho So 1 is a favorite of mine, and I can't wait to get my next bowl of Pho!"}
{"text":"If you're hungry go to Pho So 1, pho sure! 

I went there for lunch today and it was super busy! Like I'm talking the bus boys and bus girls were sweating from clearing the tables. And all the tables were occupied with a steady cycle of people entering and leaving.  

Let's start off with food! I chose to get 2  veggie options: the spring rolls and veggie soup. Both were really yummy. The spring rolls were flaky and tasty but just a lil tiny, like a wee bit, greasy. 

The soup was ON FLEEK! (I've been waiting to say that about something for awhile-- and I won't use it again. Lol) But actually, I'm slowly converting to a pescatarian diet and I normally would get wor won ton soup so this was my first veggie soup and it was hearty and very filling. 

I have never finished my pho at any restaurant and it was the same here. The portion are really large and the prices are really reasonable. 

Where Pho So 1 went wrong was on my bubble tea. My taro bubble tea was crunchy and I feel like it would have been perfect if it was in the blender for 20 more seconds! I'm going to blame it on how busy it was. 

Another thing that was a bit strange was the method of delivering food and clearing the tables. The pho so 1 staff used rolling carts. It was an atmosphere buzzkill. If you subtract that, the restaurant is quite nice and has cute booths and tables for two. 

I would go again because the service is fast, the staff is extremely friendly and the food is yummy-- I completely understand why so many people dined at Pho So 1 now."}
{"text":"this is just a review for their bun thit nuong cha gio.. or vermicelli noodles with pork and eggrolls.

i've eaten here once before and i don't remember much about it. this time i thought the food was just okay. there were more veggies than anything else. i like lettuce but there was just too much. 

my friend ordered the pork chop and it was the saddest little chop of pork you ever saw. thin and small... and tons of rice and the shredded pork.... talk about disappointment!"}
{"text":"We order take-out from this place probably twice a month. The price is right and the people are always so friendly. The restaurant itself isn't very nice, but the pho is really good and that's what really matters. 

Usually order the combination pho or the pho ga (chicken pho). The crunchy spring rolls are great but the regular cold shrimp spring rolls do not taste too fresh. Check this place out if you are a pho lover like we are!"}
{"text":"My experience dining here wasn't the best. When I first arrived at the restaurant we were seated in the corner, which was fine. It wasn't until 20 minutes later when the waitress finally approached us for the first time after several attempts to get someone's attention. I understand that it was busy but there was no organization on which tables were covered by which server. I had ordered a ribeye steak pho with added beef balls. One woman approached me to let me know the ribeye was very frozen so I changed my order to a Special combination Pho. A minute later, my original server comes to tell me the same thing. Egg rolls come out first-- delicious. My bowl of Pho comes out after and I was pretty disappointed. I ordered the special combination and what I got was just the added beef balls from my original order and the noodles in broth.. nothing else. Communication was poor. Will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"This was our first foray into Vietnamese food since moving to LV.  What can I say?  It wasn't bad.  But it wasn't anything to write home about.  If I could I'd give it a 2.5.  I decided to round up for now.  

We tried pho, bun, and spring rolls.  We liked the spring rolls (though the sauce was a bit watery and too salty).  The bun (vermicelli) was pretty good.  The pork was nicely seasoned but they skimped on the shrimp.  The pho broth felt a little light...could've been more flavorful.  But the worst part?  It left both my husband and me feeling dehydrated and with dry mouths.  Sure signs of MSG overdose.  Yuck-O!  :("}
{"text":"Pho places are always so hard to rate because they all kind of seem the same to me, to be perfectly honest.  The pho here was good, but I ordered mine with rare beef steak and tendon and they forgot the tendon.  The server took my bowl back into the kitchen and brought it back with tendon, but the broth was so hot that my rare steak was already cooked all through.  Their steak is a little tough as well.  Other than that, it was good. Not my first choice, but I'd go back if friends wanted to go there specifically."}
{"text":"I think this place has changed owner now, prices are up and the portion smaller..not as good as before"}
{"text":"Last time I was here everything was good. This time, it was so horrible. First of all, we sat down with no menus,  server came and asked us what we want and gave us attitude because we weren't ready. Then the second time she came and literally  asked \"what you want?\", in vietnamese with a rude manner. I order banh canh Tom cua gio huyet, which has crab in it. The meal came out with no crab, I asked the server and she said it's on the menu but they don't have it. They still charge me $9.99 for it. My boyfriend ordered Pho GA $7.99 (chicken), they used beef broth for it. My mom ordered Pho tai $7.99 and it  was so bland. That were all that we ordered and the total came out $35. Horrible service, horrible food."}
{"text":"Good pho with flavorful broth.  Crispy, delicious egg rolls.  Generous with bean sprouts, basil, mint, lime.  Fast, efficient service.  Would give 5 stars if restaurant had working A/C."}
{"text":"My go-to spot for pho.  They close at 2am most nights if not all, so it's the perfect spot to go after clubbing.  I like to start off with the spring rolls and the ribeye pho for the entree.  Service is prompt and I've never waited more than 10 minutes for my food.  They used to have 2 sizes for bowls but it seems they now only have 1 size.  I definitely recommend their spring rolls.  Something about that peanut sauce keeps me coming back!  Also, don't wait for the server to bring your check, you're supposed to go up to the cashier to pay.  $15 credit card minimum!"}
{"text":"Judging a pho restaurant is pretty easy: try their pho at 9am when they first open and before you add anything to the broth see how it tastes. If it tastes good at 9am the restaurant is very good. In this case, we came to Pho 1 at 8:55am and I was a little nervous as some restaurants like to make their broth at 7am and its honestly not ready at 9am or even 10am. In this case, the pho had been cooking all night and it was incredible. If you like pho I would highly, highly recommend Pho 1."}
{"text":"Not as good as pho kim long, comparable, though. Better than Siagon 8.

Good if you're trying to mix things up.

Feels like a cafeteria, close seating to other people. Pretty busy, and fast service."}
{"text":"I absolutely adore Pho So 1 and I am pretty sure that the only reason I hadn't previously left a review was because I didn't even know what it was actually called until today. 
Probably my favourite things at this little place is the 16V, a huuuuuge bowl of veggie broth, rice vermicelli, tons of veggies, sprouts, and fresh basil(SO MANY BASILS) and cilantro. I do have a habbit of absentmindedly adding way too much hot sauce though whilst chatting with friends. Earlier this evening after a terrible day, I stopped by to get a rice vermicelli dish with veggies and spring rolls (sooo yummy), and the lovely couple remembered I was vegan and packed me up some big helpings of hoisin and peanut sauce when they saw me instead of fish sauce. Although I am not a hoisin fan it was adorable. Two hours later and a couple episodes of TV on dvd, I am cured.
Their salad rolls are also yummy and fresh. And the set up in here is rad. One can always find a table, and its perfect to bring a couple people, a friend for some catch up time, or to come slurp some noodles by one self and read a book."}
{"text":"The decor here is average to below average. Definitely not my thing.

The service is average to good.

The food is awesome. Best Pho I've ever tasted. Come back here often."}
{"text":"just to let you know, their website doesnt work...oh and the first thing i noticed on their door is the \"People Love us on Yelp\" sticker...um, im the 21st person to write a review about them...what liars...what dirty stinking liars...people dont love you if the average review is 3.5 stars...shouldnt have that sticker up or people will find out that they dont really love you...kinda like what im doing right now...no no...thats exactly what im doing right now...you liars...twenty reviews?  a place like falafel drive-in in san jose, ca deserves that sticker because they have like over 550 reviews...i dont care if you think im rambling on right now...either take down the sticker or admit youre liars...oh, and also, its been a year and seven months until your twenty first review has been posted now...thanks to me...luckily for you, im being half sarcastic...you should consider this a lesson well learned...

so anyway...we're seated immediately...usually when i go to a new place with a cuisine i particularly enjoy, i order their most basic dish...i got their large pho with only brisket and spring rolls...my family also ordered this grill thing that ultimately becomes a wrap...they give you a grill, raw meat, spring roll wraps and vegetables to put in the wraps along with a dipping sauce...the service was even worse than it normally is to me...they just, wouldnt remember things...now onto my pho...i think the noodles were overcooked because they kept breaking up and i always always always got small ass bites of noodles!...it was so annoying...and the soup and everything itself just did not taste right...\"meh. i've experienced better\" is exactly what i have to say about this...a poorly earned two out of five stars...the only reason why this place has such good business is because its open til like 3am...i woulve doublechecked on their website but it doesnt work...everything is open hella late in vegas...and yeah i know its vegas with all the casinos and crap...im not retarded...but im talking about normal grocery stores, pho joints and others i cant really remember...and another reason why i give it no more than two out of five stars is because i just drove here from northern california and i didnt wanna eat fast food on the way over here...so it definitely hit the spot and it was enjoyable because i was pretty freaking hungry...

\"people love us on yelp\" HA! dont make me laugh!"}
{"text":"Pho So 1 has become one of my favorites for Vietnamese food in Vegas.  Our first visit, we stuck with the basics...

* 10. Pho Dac Biet Xe Lua \"Special Combo with Rare Slices of Steak, Well-Done Brisket, Flank, Tendon, and Tripe with Rice Noodle Soup\" ($6.95) - A generous amount of food, one of the first times I ever had leftovers to take home from a regular order of pho.  

* 40. Mi Bo Kho \"Beef Stew with Egg Noodles\" ($6.95) - The Husband was impressed with their version of one of his favorite dishes.

Service was good too - tea comes out automatically, unlike some other restaurants we frequent and they are quick to take your order.  Food comes out promptly too.

Within the past week, I've been back twice for this:

* 85. Bo Tom Muc Nhung Dam \"Beef, Shrimp and Squid dipped in Special Vinegar Sauce\" ($25.95) - A platter of raw beef, shrimp, and squid and a pot of hot vinegar broth are presented before you, along with a plate of veggies (various greens, bean sprouts, cucumbers, and pickled daikon and carrots), a plate of rice noodles, rice paper, and a bowl of hot water.  For you first timers, you dip the rice paper in the hot water to get it soft, then you start to load it up with veggies, rice noodle and whatever you cooked up in the hot vinegary broth.  And of course, be sure to dip it in the tasty pineappley sauce thing they give you.  Oh so good!  It's another way for  me to enjoy hot pot - but Vietnamese-style!

Last night we had this one:
* 84B. Bo Tom Nhung Dam \"Beef & Shrimp dipped in Special Vinegar Sauce\" ($23.95) - Same thing, but without the squid.  I just love it because it's light, and you can ask for more veggies and rice paper if necessary.  That dipping sauce has a sweet and sour quick with a fruity twist and just good!

* 89. Bo Luc Lac \"Diced Beef Salad\" ($9.50) - This was a semi-raw beef dish with lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, lettuce, limes, and peanuts.  Be sure to dip this in the fish sauce too for that extra tangy bite!  Yum!

There are a bunch of other items in their Special Dishes section that I'm anxious to try.  It's a generous amount of food though, so it's better to go with a group of at least three.  (I think #s 84B and 85 are decent portions for a party of three, add some eggrolls if you're still hungry.)

The first two times we went late at night, and they had a steady stream of customers.  But yesterday during dinnertime, it was packed!  They sure do get a lot of business here, from the Vietnamese community (always a good sign) and outside as well.  We did have to wave them down for more water, tea, extra condiments, etc.  But it was no big deal since it was busy.  Definitely one of my places to go for Vietnamese food beyond the basic pho.

They are open late too!"}
{"text":"The one star is for the one person who actually provided any service; the host who seated me.  I wish there were 2 separate star ratings; 4 stars for the food. 0 for the awful service and lip service from the MANAGER.

I had the delicious egg rolls.  I've had them before and loved them.  But I had experienced poor service before, which is a reoccurring theme in the reviews for this restaurant.

I was seated right away by the host, a middle-aged looking gentleman wearing a green sweater.  He seated me, took my drink order, and indicated my server would be over.  My server NEVER came to my table.  The host later returned and took my order and periodically checked on me while I ate.

I sat in 1 of the booths along the right wall.  I noticed all 4 booths, including mine, had 1 or 2 customers only each.  The only time a server helped 1 of the tables on my side of the restaurant was when the customer shouted and waved him over; he had to do that 2xs.  No server came to the table in front nor behind me the whole 30 minutes I was there.

The left side of the restaurant had whole families or groups of 3 or more seated at each table and booth.  The servers were plenty busy helping them.  Social bias anyone?

Just before I went to the cashier, I spoke to the host about tipping him directly.  As required, I went to the cashier to pay my bill.  I asked to speak to the manager, who was behind the cashier.  I explained my (and my side of the restaurant's) lack of service.   The manager apologized for the poor service. 

I also explained I wanted to tip the host directly.  The manager explained that the tips get pooled and to leave it on the table.  I explained I didn't want any of my tip money to go to the server who NEVER came to my table.  Then I asked to speak to the host so I could tip him.  The manager said, \"He just left,\" which, I believe, was total bullshit.  I looked around and could not find the host.  I told him, \"Okay.  Then I'm leaving no tip.\"

I left.  Pho So 1 lost a customer.  And I recommend everyone who keeps going back & experiencing poor service, to just stop going.  Their service won't improve until we as customers make a statement (by not eating there).  Customers have the power (cuz we got the moola) to support their business or their competitors."}
{"text":"I love this place so much. Wish they had a location up in Summerlin! Foods always amazing (especially the egg rolls). Service had improved lately. It's probably the only pho place I'll continue to go to!"}
{"text":"Atmosphere: Typical for affordable and low-budget Vietnamese Pho restaurant, e.g., bland colours, fish tank, miscellaneous decoration, bright lighting.

Staff and service: staff were exceptionally inattentive and non-verbal; while I suspect that some staff members did not speak English, there is nothing wrong with smiling at new customers. Further, many tables were walking up to the serving bar to top-up waters/tea-pots (not because this is the \"status quo,\" rather, the servers were unresponsive).

Food and drink: I ordered the Shrimp Fresh Rolls to start and the Shrimp/Grilled Chicken Vermicelli bowl for my main. The Fresh Rolls were extremely cold and hard to the touch, as if they had been sitting in a fridge (and I think they contained pieces of Turkey lunch meat?). the Vermicelli bowl was even more unimpressive - the shrimp was hard (likely re-heated), the chicken was flat and dry and the noodles were cold and clumped together.

Overall impression: I would give a 1/5 but I was hungry so I finished my entire meal - maybe I ordered the wrong thing? To note: there is parking behind the restaurant and ample seating for large groups."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

Friendly service. Large restaurant. TONS of variety to choose from. Great prices. 5.95.

Broth came with a LOT of cilantro and green onions. Veggie plate they give you is packed with really fresh stuff.

Broth was okay. It wasn't the best I've had, but it was good. Broth also did not come out piping hot."}
{"text":"My family and I come here for their Bo nuong vi(bbq beef) best in town. The oxtail soup is amazing too."}
{"text":"Very quick yet low quality service. No table-touching or water refills but a place for a quick bite if that's what you're looking for. The menus are old, dirty, and torn-up. I'd be okay with this presentation if it was cheaper. I ordered goi cuon and grilled pork chop rice platter. Food all came out within 4 minutes where I even questioned the quality of the meat.

The spring roll was great but the peanut sauce was not up to par. The grilled pork chop was disappointing as it was dry and overcooked. It was incredibly thin!!! THIS IS NOT WHAT IS EXPECTED when someone goes out for Vietnamese pork chops... We waited until a server finally saw us and offered us another pork chop. Another one came out hot and was not as dry. I prefer my pork chops thicker so I am not impressed. Perhaps the pho is good here... I'm not sure if I'll return."}
{"text":"Had Pho Tai there and the soup was good the place was ok, i am a bigger PHAN of Pho little saigon. hope this helps"}
{"text":"Hello my Yelp friends.  I have been remiss in my yelping as of late, as I have made a major move.  I now live between 3 locations in the great basin/Mojave desert region, spanning Nevada, Arizona and the California border.  I'm living like the guys on American Pickers, buying and selling collectibles and anything else I can make a buck on.  I also direct the Food and Beverage and showroom department of a small hotel in Las Vegas...I know, how do I do it all?  Hence my lapse in reviews...enough updates,  here we go:

In the miles I put in for work, a lot of meals are on the road.  I have a lot of Hawaii Yelp friends, so I'll start in Las Vegas....the 9th island.  Since leaving Hawaii I most long for the food.  Don't get me wrong, out here I am reveling in the great Mexican food, home made mashed potatoes, and wonderful bar b que.  But one has to go long and far out here to find the elements of what makes the Hawaii food scene so great in close proximity.  I love Vietnamese food.  This was one of my early quests as soon as I got out here.

Pho So 1 is located in the chinatown district of Las Vegas.  The Chinatown here is more of an Asiatown, incorporating Chinese, Vietnamese, Thai, Filipino, Korean and Japanese restaurants, shops, services and industry.  It was 3 months into my move that I finally got a taste of Vietnamese cuisine...what a relief, as I was used to it at least once a week in Hawaii.  Pho So 1 is large by Vietnamese restaurant standards.  It will seat about 150, and is open from 9am to 3am daily.  Business is always brisk to crowded.  I tend to be a late night client and it's always bustling at this time, but I've always gotten a seat without waiting.

My first visit:  Large pho #14 with tendon, lean beef, fatty brisket, stomach.  An order of  what we call summer roll in Hawaii, but is called spring roll out here.  And what we call spring roll in Hawaii is called egg roll here, but is not like the traditional Chinese eggrolls you get at the chop suey houses out here or at Jack in the Box...a little confusing.  I also had my beloved Vietnamese iced coffee.

The \"spring roll\" was a welcome delight.  Every bit as good as the best \"summer\" rolls I've had in Hawaii.  The correct wrap, with the right pull, tenderness and slight chew.  This summer roll is fat with a great balance of noodles, lettuce, basil, pork and shrimp.  Served with a serviceable peanut sauce that I like to enhance with a squirt of Sri racha.  Selicious.

The pho was big.  Copious amounts of meat and meat by products, I would say almost twice the amount at Hawaii Vietnamese restaurants.  Also almost bowl covering amounts of onion, green onion, cilantro on top which I love.  Noodles are also ample.  The broth is mellow but rich with a slight background of anise.  Also served on the side is the usual suspects of bean sprouts, basil, jalapenos and other greens.  I must say the bean sprouts here are pristine white and clean.  The problem is the broth is luke warm to my taste.  This has been the case each time I went.  They do steam the noodles separately because as I break the noodles, I do get a small release of heat, the the broth itself is not very hot...I wonder if this is a mainland thing with lawsuits of people burning themselves with hot liquid.  On a side note, a Korean restaurant I ate at next door to this place would not allow me to take out their ban chan or na mul because of lawsuits....I think the ignorant bought the kim chee and let it sit forever like dill pickles and got sick....that's another story.

The ice coffee came via the tableside French press method, so I waited with great anticipation after a 3 month lack of iced coffee.  Their was a LOT of condensed milk....it really needed it.  The coffee sharp astringently bitter, not the real deal.....if you use all the condensed milk you have sweet coffee milk....sigh.

Something else to try is their Hanoi style pork and egg roll Bun.  I have not seen this style of Bun in Hawaii.  This method plates the dish rather than in a bowl.  Two types of pork are served, the traditional grilled pork slices, sweet and robust, and a \"pork loaf\" grilled that is very meaty, not bready.   The usual veggies are laid out with the vermicelli, the meat kept away from the cold veggies in a separate dish.  The difference is the full leaf lettuce, meant to be used to wrap your meat, noodles and condiment vegetables, fish sauce and hot sauces.  This dish definitely covers the taste senses of sweet, spicy, salt, bitter, sour.  Textures are covered of crunch, chew, squish, warm, cold.  Nutrition covered with protein, carbohydrates both low and high glycemic varieties, vitamins, minerals, fats, sugars....clean and fresh with hints of grilled burn from the meat....pure gastronomic satisfaction."}
{"text":"Great place for Pho. I almost want to go back to Vegas just for the Pho. This was  absolutely wonderful broth! Probably one of the best broths I have had since starting my Pho- adventure! Not too salty, and very flavorful!  Noodles were exceptional. The amount of basil, jalapeno, sprouts and lime were very adequate! Many condiment sauces to choose from as well. I also loved the complimentary hot tea served to you while you wait. Great place I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"very packed.
the pho is mediocre.
and pricey for what it is.

their eggroll isn't that great either. but the fish sauce is pretty good."}
{"text":"UGH NO! 

Today I ordered  chicken pho and when I got to the bottom noticed something brown in  the tangle of noodles I put in my spoon and saw it was indeed a small roach. The BF didnt say anything ( he shouldve) while we were eating but he wasnt touching his water because something was in it as well.

If it wasn't for ordering chicken, maybe I wouldnt have noticed the roach until it was in my mouth if it was with little  brown beef bits like well done brisket. 

 It was also filthy in there too. Sticky bottles, the floor a mess, etc. It was busy, but there was quite a bit of employees so downtime could be used to maintain cleanliness.

NONONONONONONONONO. 

it sucks because they weren't taking our order for the longest time and I decided if they didn't come after this last order they were serving we were going to walk out as 10minutes just sitting there after it's clear we were looking around and put down the menus. I wish I didn't have decent patience today as I could have avoided roach soup.

We didn't pay, but that is not the point. It's the cost of fucking fastfood so it doesn't mean a lot. It shouldn't be happening."}
{"text":"PROS: Delicious, hot food! The egg rolls (#1) are crazy good. I go here all the time and order completely different things each time, and I'm never disappointed. I've tried everything from soup to rice dishes! the taste is authentic and great :) 

it's cheap($13 and below), healthy, and comes in big portions, which I love! 

If you ask, they are happy to tell you what the most popular, most delicious items are. Mainly because the list to order from is pretty long! 

CONS: The service can be either excellent or iffy depending on who is serving you. 

Sometimes getting a table can be a bit of a wait. 

Bathrooms need to be cleaned better! lol"}
{"text":"I was visiting Las Vegas and felt like Pho soup. My friend recommended this place and so we tried it. The food was delicious. The service was relatively quick except for my dish which came late but when it did arrive it was great. I ordered a combined chicken and vegetable pho so that may have thrown them off a bit but it was very fresh and tasty. The staff was friendly and the restaurant was clean and very busy. I would recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"I hate to give such a poor review but the two stars is how I felt; as Yelp puts it \"Meh, I've experienced better\". I go to Vegas twice a year for business and have been going to PHO 87 and really enjoying it, but decided to try something new. With all the reviews I was expecting more. (Almost 4 stars). The pho definitely passed my initial \"eye\" test with rare beef still a little pink and good amount of vegetables and herbs. The rare beef was tender and had good flavor. And the free tea they served with the meal was good, but that was the end of the good for me. This was the first time I had pho where the broth was so cloudy and not clear. The broth lacked any depth or complexity when it came to flavor; it was just beef water as far as I was concerned. And the beef balls were very basic with not much flavor either. I will probably go back to PHO 87 next time or try another place but I won't be going back to Pho So 1."}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken pho! Was super delicious but should have ordered without the cilantro () haha the broth was amazing and the service was one of the best. The restaurant looked great very clean and well organized. Decor was tasteful as well."}
{"text":"The pricing & food is ok.  Their strong suit is that they're open to 3 am.  I really don't know why they're often crowded, especially for lunch on the weekend.  I come here mainly to people watch & because they're walking distance from my place."}
{"text":"I live so close to Little Saigon (down in SoCal) so I'm pretty spoiled with really great Vietnamese food. It's hard to find good, or even decent, Vietnamese food outside Little Saigon and so I was surprised when I found this place. My friend took me here and I was skeptical at first, but this place definitely has decent pho. Each bowl is about $7 and the broth and everything was good. If you're in Vegas and looking for a good pho place, this is the place to go!
NOTE: they only take card with a minimum of $15, anything under is cash only"}
{"text":"After having their food 40 times in the past two years, this is, without a doubt, the best Pho in Vegas.

Talk about consistency.  This place has it. 

Amazing!"}
{"text":"PHO: This is definitely my favorite pho joint--hands down! This was actually the first place I ate pho about 5 years ago. I always get the #10 Pho Dac Biet. Pho with all the good stuff :) The beef is always fresh and delicious. And the broth is always flavorful. I've never walked out of here dissatisfied. I bet Pho So 1's main competition is Pho Kim Long but I much prefer the pho here. 

OTHER STUFF: Other items I've tried are spring rolls and egg rolls, which are both good. And if you have at least 2 people, try the viet bbq (beef & seafood). Its similar to korean bbq where you cook at your table. They use some kind of purple jelly to light the grill which is minimal smoke and doesn't make you reek afterwards. You take the meat and roll it into spring rolls using veggies and rice paper... Fun and interactive food and most of all DERRRICIOUS! My vietnamese friend turned me onto those dessert cups. I've only tried a couple but they're really good! If you have room for an off-beat asian dessert, give those a try (they're inside of the fridge with the beer and sodas.

SERVICE: Dont expect any fancy 5 star service (this is a family-owned asian joint people). But I've been going here for years and they're friendly enough, feed me quick, and refill my drinks when they need to be refilled :) 

TIP: dont wait for the check, just go up front to pay at the cashier. thats how things work here :)"}
{"text":"I used to really like it here, but now things seem to be going downhill. My husband and I came here for a quick late meal, and we were quite disappointed. Ny pork chop tasted super dried out and the pork skin tasted extra grainy that it was like I was eating dirt. However, the rice and the 2 fried eggs fine to eat. (I might as well stay at home and cook for myself if I were going to eat that.) It is the service and carelessness that brings me to this down review. I had to ask for silverware AND the fish sauce two times before it came to me. And my husband didn't even get his vegetables for his soup. We had to ask twice again. And my husband went to wash his hands and he returned with a disgusted look on his face. The men's room had vomit. I understand things happen, but someone should have taken care of it when it happened. That is just so careless. Also, it is an extra dollar to out your steak from the pho on the side??? Even though it is the same portion as it is when it gets into the bowl???? That makes NO sense. I understand an extra charge when asking for an extra side of meat but for it to go on the side is additional charge? I don't know what happened to pho so 1, but my husband and I will NEVER come here again. It makes me sad because now I don't really have a go-to for Vietnamese food when I am lazy to cook at home."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best pho place in the world! I've been going there since I was a kid and still go back every time I visit, all my pho fanatic friends also love it, better than any pho in la or even Vietnam for that matter- not sure what they put in Ye Roth but its addicting! Also the egg rolls, spring rolls, and pork are all amazing! Great friendly staff and nice ambience."}
{"text":"Been coming here more often with some friends since this is their favorite place.

I have been trying a few more dishes here, as well as different mixes of pho, and it has been a better experience.

It is still not my favorite pho in town, but when you are eating late, there aren't too many choices out there.

Give it a shot if you haven't already"}
{"text":"This place is So Pho-king good.  [See what I did, there? ;-) ]

But, really, this place serves some mighty tasty food.  The hubby and found this place through yelp (!) and it was our very first stop once we picked up the car rental.  It's located in a nondescript shopping plaza, and if it weren't for our trusty tomtom we could have very well given up.  Parking is plentiful and the location is centrally located.  

Upon entering, we were greeted promptly and led to a table by the window.  The menu  is fairly extensive, but all we really wanted was some soup + egg rolls.  I ordered beef and he ordered seafood pho.  The egg rolls are served on a bed of lettuce and huge amounts of carrots and daikon.  Oh, I love daikon.  Really refreshing and cut out the oily feeling you get from the rolls.  The beef pho was on point, but I thought the seafood was just meh (though my hubby enjoyed it).  Portion sizes are huge and filling with noodles and broth.  

Definitely a great way cleanse your system - before AND after your trip.  And after a week in Vegas, you're soooo gonna need it."}
{"text":"Bombbbb Vietnamese food in Vegas! We came here because of miscommunication with friends so they went to another Pho place (Bo So I think) and we came here.. we decided to stay here because we were starving!!!!

My friend ordered the Bun Bo Hue and he really liked it. I usually am not a fan of this but I tried a sip of the soup and it was really flavorful. Question though, where was the pork blood? He gave me the pork knuckles because he knows I really enjoy gnawing on them and he looked away and back at me and I was already done. It was really good.

I ordered the fried pork that comes with mint leaves, shiso leaves, vermicelli (Thin and easier to separate. Much better than normal vermicelli noodles IMO) the fried pork which tasted more like shrimp (really delicious), lettuce leaves, cucumbers, pickled daikon and carrots and dipping sauce. It's a little troublesome to make because you have to wet the wrapping paper (spring roll paper) but once you have all the ingredients combined, its fantastic. I found this perfect on the day it was over 100*F outside. 

We also had the spring rolls which were just normal spring rolls. The sauce on the other hand was good. It was sweet and a little tart but mild when I dipped the spring roll.. actually drenched the spring roll in the sauce. I really liked it okay? :)

They have a huge menu. It seems like their specialties are in the back and one is the beef you grill yourself which can feed 2-3 people so I will definitely try that next time I return to Vegas. 

Low reviews because people are ordering the wrong things I think?"}
{"text":"This is a must whenever I visit Vegas. Lots of seating, extensive menu, and quick service.

Pho always hits the spot."}
{"text":"My very favorite Vietnamese restaurant. We have been eating  here for over 10 years.  So quick so fresh so delicious thank you see you in about half an hour coming in for some Vietnamese coffee."}
{"text":"A few of my friends love coming here for pho.  I'd never been here before and so was very excited to try their creation of yummy.  This place can get very busy so be sure to expect a little wait when it is busy.  Luckily, my friend and I came at the right time and was seated immediately.

The waiters were very prompt with tea or water, what ever you desire.  I opted for water.  Unless the boiled tap water taste is not your preferrence, order bottled water.  When it was time to order, I ordered the #58 Grilled Shrimp and spring roll with noodles.  It's not soup, but came with some kind of fish sauce to give it a sweet/salty flavor.

I found this one to be just okay.  I thought it had a soapy taste to it and the mint was definitely overpowering the dish.  I had this dish in Pho Saigon 8 but with beef and found the flavor was much better there for me.  I think if I the soap and mint taste wasn't so prominent in this dish, I would've loved it as much.

I will come back again as my cousin swears by their pho."}
{"text":"the only reason they get a 3 star is because when you used to eat here all the time you expect consitency. I think this place has moved on to bigger and better things and they kept this joint because its well known and produces alot of business. Go to District One because i think the owner is there now and left pho so 1 as just as the second restaurant to be ran by others. i know this because my wife and her family know the owners really well an theyve taken care of us for years"}
{"text":"The food and service can be summed up into 1 word: TERRIBLE; The broth was watered down, the brisket was tough and the service was just crappy. This may be doable if you're drunk and this is all that is open... anybody rating this more than 2/3 stars has obviously has never had really good and flavorful pho... 

This is the kind of thing I hate about moving... you gotta find new places for things you enjoy... oh how I miss Pho-Ever in Gardena...  if you're looking for delicious pho- keep it moving...this ain't it."}
{"text":"Really enjoy going here for my vietnamese food fix. The service here can be better since they are slow and not very attentive but that's nothing new for going to asian restaurants in my opinion. Their pho is pretty good and filling. the soup is on point and flavorful. I ususally come here and order their rice noodles w/ bbq pork and egg rolls since that is one of my favorite viet dishes. They make it bomb here! it is very filling and they give you a lot of meat. 
They also have Grilled beef spring rolls were you grill the meets yourself. I saw people order it and it smelled so good. Maybe I'll have to order that next time 

This is my safe place for viet food in vegas and so I will be back for my viet food cravings."}
{"text":"In my opinion, this place has one of the best pho broths! Their pho is very consistent each time. There's one thing I always must get, their Red Bean Drink. Wow... just try it and you'll want another one."}
{"text":"Pho get about the rest. When I want pho this is my go to place. I went through a pho dry phase. It just didn't sound good, and I was obsessed with banchan and Korean stews. Recently, though, I have reacquired my pho craving.

Yes, the flavor of the broth should be the most important thing, but what earns my favor is an impressive veggie offering. Here is where I have found the #1 green goods when ordering the vegetable option. If you like broccoli, carrots, celery, cucumber... get the picture? How does Pho So garden's grow? With a generous helping of vegetables! No tofu, but the other ingredients are so bountiful and fresh, it doesn't matter to me.

Of course, the broth is good too. Clean, balanced, flavorful. The noodles might be a bit on the mushy side, but not objectionable enough to prevent me from being a repeat customer.

Last night, we also made the plunge and ordered the table top beef griddle extravaganza, which comes with rice paper, lettuce, daikon relish, herbs, noodles-- all to create your own little rolls. When you go to Pho So 1, you will always smell the tempting aroma of grilled beef, and there are only so many times you can visit, before you just have to give in and get one for yourself. At around $20, we thought it was a little pricey, but after seeing the portion, it is enough for 3, maybe 4 people. I was a little troubled by the magenta Sterno gel that was directly beneath the meat, and I thought I detected the faint flavor of Sterno in the occasional bite. I probably wouldn't order it again, although constructing spring rolls is fun and a nice diversion if you don't enjoy your dining company (not personally a problem). It is an experience.  

I will admit the floor needs to be swept a bit more often. My advice: just look straight ahead. 

Regardless, this is still the name I will call out when I am asked, \"Where do you wanna go for pho?\""}
{"text":"This place has been around, and they just recently renovated the whole place, looks good now. The food has always been good here and they did need that place upgrade and it sure did made it a lot cleaner. With that said, its so much better to eat in a place that is clean and more space. I do recommend this place if you are feeling up to have some good 'ol PHo.
Its good! That's PHo sure! Happy noodling :)"}
{"text":"A hit or miss type of place. You could get very good service or a really bad one. They are open until 3am, which makes it a popular place for people to come in for a late night fix. Customer service could be good one day and just not as attentive the other. During their lunch and dinner time they're on it with serving you but for late night (12am to 3am) the service isn't as great. I understand the servers are very tired and over it already but there isn't as much customers during that time and I see them standing around. It doesn't require that much effort to follow through with customer service during the last couple of hours before closing. Also, I seen a roach a couple of times run across the restaurant. When you sit in a booth sometimes the seats, floors, and tables are still sticky, which is why I'm not surprised they had some roaches roaming around. 

For about two pho bowls and a side like spring rolls would cost me $28 without tip but including tax. Their pho tastes good, which is something I recommend you get. However, their vermicelli is about 1/3 rice noodles and 2/3 veggies. There's a lot of mint in their vermicelli, depending on you if you're a fan of it. I'm fine with mint but they load it up with the veggies under your bowl and it made me tired of the dish."}
{"text":"I gave this place 4 stars because of its service which is not considered as good as others. It also took long to get our food done even though the restaurant wasn't busy around 1AM. 

The food is seriously delicious. The beef noddle soup smells so good and you should have tried the oyster dry noddle. If you have stomach or enough friend to share, lets try the \"bun cha ha noi\" with lots of vegetable.

Even though they have a lot of waiters here, they are useless, no offense. They don't even ask us if we want anything else to eat. Moreover, they just through the silver ware on our table instead of putting them nicely."}
{"text":"We found this place randomly because my mom was craving Pho.  For calling itself Pho so 1 (which basically translates to #1 pho), they aren't so great.  The soup totally tasted like they were trying to drown out any other flavor with an excessive amount of star anise.  I will give them credit for the fast service and the very fresh veggies, but the soup makes the pho, and it totally wasn't working for me.  On a high note, they were open early in the morning which is irregular for a lot of pho places, but  I don't think I'll be going here again."}
{"text":"This place was great. I am vegetarian and I just got a simple Fried Rice (#76) it was great, I also tried some and I would definitely say it was one of the best Fried Rice I've ever tasted. My mom ordered #19, the Chicken Noodle Soup. She says that it.was great, but it really lacked spice."}
{"text":"Great pho to end a crazy weekend in Vegas! You can tell this place is pretty authentic because of all the Viet people that fill the place up. 
The soup wasn't too heavy and they give quite a lot of meat. I got tendon in mine and it was good but I wish they cut it up into smaller pieces. Same goes with the tripe because since they didn't cut it, it ended up tangling with all my noodles...so hard to eat.
All in all, pho that hit the spot!"}
{"text":"very big restaurant with lots of seating .
had the shrimp pho and seafood egg noodle soup  . taste was ok .... I like my broth a little less sweet .
good thing about this place  is , that they open until really late ."}
{"text":"Cheap but very good food. I like the make-it-yourself spring rolls called chao tom. The service is almost non existent here, as well as a decent decor."}
{"text":"My first meal in Las Vegas. I was looking for something light at that time, and this place perfectly met all my needs. Really flavorful, light, generous size and great price. Recommend dish No. 10 and 54."}
{"text":"Seated quickly despite a full restaurant and lobby. Delicious food. Looking forward for a second visit."}
{"text":"PHO SO 1
We went here for lunch a few weeks ago to get off the strip for a change, this place was good switch, My wife had Noodle with BBQ pork and shrimp & I had the BBQ beef with salad other people at our table had noodle soup everything smelt so good looked good taste good and was good, a delightful meal all around, in particular I liked the service as they actually checked on you periodically to get more soda, tea, water, napkins ect...Coming from the bay area I am so use to being ignored after the food is served so this really made me feel good to see how the lunch was progressing with great service. Price is very reasonable each dish was under $9.00 if I am not mistaken. You can tell that this is a local establishment with most of the patrons I would assume living or working in the area, another thing is the place has lots of seating with great air-conditioning, I think it was 115 degrees that day but when we stepped in to the restaurant it was a nice cool 70.
Yeah Good Job!

If your in the area this is good pit stop for lunch or even dinner,,,,,,"}
{"text":"I usually never have a car when I', in Vegas but I did one time and I came here for a Pho run. Although it's not the BEST pho I've had I think it's pretty good for Pho in Vegas, where there are plenty of non-authentic Asian food on the strip. The prices were pretty reasonable for pho so no complaints there.

We ordered the Pho Dac Biet and eggrolls... I think I've had bigger bowls of Pho in the SGV but their soup was piping HOT when it came out, which I loved! I hate lukewarm soup... The veggies all looked pretty clean and washed so that was also a plus. 

Overall, I would come back if I had a car, but with it being off the strip, I'm not sure that I would taxi it all the way here and back,,,"}
{"text":"\"Knock knock!\"
\"Who's there?\"
\"Pho So 1\"
\"Pho So 1 who?\"
\"So I Pho So 1 muhfuckas wanna fine me. First ninjas gotta find me. What's 50 grand to a muhfucka like me?\"
AHAHAHA! That was laaaaaame!!!

Vietnamese thits and rolls are what I had here. Egg rolls, spring rolls that gave me fat rolls. \"Are you ready to order?\" Ummm...we just got here, give us a chance.

Egg Rolls:
My friend loves their egg rolls so we got them. They were tasty and they were actually not bad but I just think Kinh Do's egg rolls are better. 3.5/5

Spring Rolls:
The spring rolls themselves seem a bit dry and they're not fresh. The peanut sauce was really runny. 1.5/5

#9 Pho Ribeye Steak:
Their pho comes in either small or large but I wasn't asked what size I wanted. Out comes a small bowl of lukewarm pho. The broth was lacking in flavor so I had to use a lot of Sriracha and Hoisin sauce. 2/5

#54 Bun Thit Nuong Cha Gio:
Charbroiled pork, egg rolls with vermicelli and veggies. This was good. The portion is pretty big. You get a good amount of protein and the noodles weren't dry even after re-heating. 4/5

Sure, they're open til 3am but there's another Vietnamese restaurant (PKL) not far from here that's open 24/7 and has better food. Pay at the counter when you're done but be careful because the floor is very oily and slippery. Gross!"}
{"text":"Being Vietnamese, Pho So 1 is one of the best places to go to dine if you're looking for warm, beefy soup in the middle of the night (it's comfort food to some people).. or at like 2 AM when you're drunk and have nowhere else to go sober up... I have to say out of all of the Vietnamese restaurants in Las Vegas, Pho So 1 is not that bad compared to most Vietnamese restaurants...  (but that's purely personal preference since I am Vietnamese and get home cooked meals.. I'll try to be biased about the food..)

The number 1 thing I always recommend everyone trying if you've never had an experience at Pho So 1 is to try their Bo 7 Mon & Bo Nuong Vi ..

Bo 7 Mon is their 7 courses of beef, a combination of different varieties of marinated beef dishes you can try, each with different veggies and sauces that will compliment the dish. Each dish is distinct because the beef is marinated in different Vietnamese herb and seasonings. It's definitely more ethnic and strays away from the typical Pho that everyone knows more about. Vietnamese people love to drink beer and eat this as a party dish.. so if you're a foreigner, definitely try it for a true Vietnamese dining experience.

Now, Bo Nuong Vi is my absolute favorite thing to order at Pho So 1. Bo Nuong Vi means beef grilled over fire.. so the course itself will come with a portable grill right at your table with hot flames burning over the grill itself. This dish starts off at $20 for beef and you can also add shrimp and squid (definitely recommend).. it's Vietnamese BBQ at its best... The beef and seafood is marinated with lemon grass, garlic and sesame.. You dip the meat into sesame oil before putting it on the grill and once on fire, the smell is absolutely irresistible (beware, you WILL smell like BBQ food afterwards so keep that in mind for special occasions) .. The dish is served with assortments of fresh vegetables, vermicelli, Vietnamese rice paper that is used to wrap everything together, including the meat and eaten sort of like a spring roll (except you wrap it all together yourself), and most importantly the fish sauce and pineapple fish sauce (which is a thicker fish sauce that is both sweet and salty.. a lot of people cannot eat this but if you really want authentic flavors, try it out).. This dish is best if eaten for 2-3 people.. but you can get away with 4 people, however I definitely recommend ordering extra meat, Overall, for 2 people, you'll only pay $10 each and for 4, I would say about $10-$13 per person with extra meat sides. Definitely cheaper than most Korean BBQ!"}
{"text":"So Pho King Good! (Those of you who know how to pronounce Pho will get that!)

This is my favorite little Vietnamese place. I don't know what half the stuff on the menu is, but I had a Vietnamese friend help a sista out.

You cannot go wrong with rare beef pho. It cures hangovers. It's a scientific fact! And it's huge. I don't think I've ever seen anyone finish it!

If you have a group of friends, I recommend BBQ. (I love the steak and shrimp combo). So good and you cook it at your table... it's like camping, but with less bugs and not having to pee behind a bush!

There spring rolls are great and the sauce that you dip it in (not sure what kind it is or what it's made of, but it's divine) has a sweet, fishy taste. I know it sounds weird, but try. You'll be glad you did. You can get the fried, too.

I know this may sound bad, but I think this adds to the awesomeness... When people that are Vietnamese (the natives) are the regular patrons, they must be doing some right.

I am a fan of the Vietnamese iced coffee with consended sweetened milk. Don't drink this late at night. It's extra strong and you will sleep poorly. They had this other drink which had jello and was pink, it looked tasty, but I didn't like it. It was very pretty, though.

Hit up Pho So 1. It will make you happy, Pho sure! :)"}
{"text":"This is my favorite pho restaurant in china town.

They are super quick.
I always ask for extra cilantro, onions, and A LOT of limes.
Other places will not give you \"extra\", but this place spoils me. 
I LOVE IT.

I made a TOGO order of Pho and it came out in less than 5 mins!!
They give you tons of meat and the veggies!"}
{"text":"While most tourists love to go to Pho Kim Long and we locals love Pho So 1.  

Number 10 is my favorite.  Classic combo pho with all the good stuffs! Added extra meat will make me a very happy carnival.  

Service is great & speedy! 

Good food and huge parking lot.   

But let me warn u, please don't use their bathroom, it's quite a disaster."}
{"text":"Found not only one hair but!! two hairs in my beef ball pho hahaha

I had taken a photo and I think immediately when the workers saw, they look my bowl away - sadly the phone which had the photo got stolen.

It sucks cuz this is one of the few places who open late (3am) but their service sucks and clearly so do their quality.

Won't be back."}
{"text":"It was difficult to find a place that accommodate a group of 50 people but this place did it. For that reason, the rating is 2 stars. For food, it's 1 star.

I only tried the the Pho Tai (rare beef) and Com Suong Nuong (Rice & Pork chop). The pho broth had a horrible flavor. It was murky too. As for the rice dish, the pork chop was really dry. Couldn't really eat it. Everyone else didn't enjoy their food that much.

I'd recommend another Vietnamese Restaurant. There are plenty in Vegas."}
{"text":"Not really a very good Vietnamese restaurant in my opinion.  The dining area is clean and big however, the food wasn't that great and the service was bad.

I ordered a rice dish with beef and onions.  On the menu the description only said beef and onions.  I don't like onions (gives me gas) and so I asked for it without onions.  When the food arrived it had onions in it as well as a bunch of vegetables (carrots, etc.) that I didn't care for.  The menu never stated it would be mixed vegetables.

When we mentioned it they did offer to correct it but I was too hungry and we were in a hurry.  They were apologetic however this is a mistake that should not have been made."}
{"text":"Why is it that Chinese and Vietnamese service tends to be lacking when it comes to guest care? They are always packed and it is sometimes hard to get a decent seat. Most of the time I am stuck at a table close to the entrance and the presence of a draft hitting me.

Getting a server to approach you often takes some time. Waving at them will only irritate the best even more. It is best to just sit tight and wait until they are ready for you. With that being said, you better be ready to order once they come around. 

With all the cons, why is it even worth going? The answer, the food. I do like them better than their hectic and obnoxiously busy competition. The grilled shrimp wraps are amazing. They set down a portable grill in the middle of the table and all of the condiments for spring rolls and you just assemble them yourselves. It is absolutely delicious. Their pork and shrimp spring rolls are okay. After eating my mom's there is no doubt that homemade is better. Their pho is good for when I can't have my dad's. I still get thirsty, so that is a sign that I cannot be eating pho at restaurants too often."}
{"text":"I did return. We started with the fried chicken wings which was so good. I ordered the clear vegetable noodle soup. Also excellent. Very happy with the repeat visit!"}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town so ended up here for pho. Service isn't bad and cleanliness is ok. I like seeing clean floors and uncluttered counter tops.  Food came out at a reasonable time and decent. Service was better than most places. Next time when I'm back in town I would eat here again"}
{"text":"Pho so 1 had really friendly staff and serving for the Vermicelli noodle was on point! Would recommend it!!"}
{"text":"So after reading previous reviews about how awful the service can be, I was prepared to be underwhelmed by the wait staff. I couldn't have been more wrong. I was seated promptly and my waiter took my order within minutes of sitting down. My spring rolls arrived in less than 3 minutes. Halfway through the spring rolls, my pho arrived hot and awesome. Lots of sprouts, jalapeños, big slice of lemon, it's on like donkey kong. I was even provided a fork since my skill with chopsticks was presumed to be lacking. Well played Mr. Waiter, well played. The spring rolls with peanut sauce stole the show. I will definitely return. Pho So 1 would have gotten the 5 stars if I didn't have to pay at the register. Everybody's got their thing that bothers them. That just happens to be one of mine. Don't judge me."}
{"text":"The pho ga had good flavor but the chicken was dry. The bun bo hue was good, lots of meat.  Also the marinated shrimp and beef cooked at your table was really good. I wish they would clean the floors a little though."}
{"text":"I do not begin to know what I am suppose to do with that tray of \"stuff\" they bring to the table with our order. I know we can use the lettuce as a wrap, and the mint, basal, and various other greens add some flavor, I have eaten daikon and cucumbers but the rice paper? What's up with that, it was stiff and we didn't get anything to soften it with. 

We had ordered the BBQ pork meatball and a sausage rolls/wraps, it was good but small on the meat side of things. More veggies than anything else, then I also ordered what I thought would be a broth based ramen, but it was without liquid, noodles on bottom topped with veggies and char shu pork, it had been tossed with oyster sauce, but still very dry. 

Perhaps this a place to go with someone who knows how to eat this stuff!"}
{"text":"We went here after hearing about it from someone I knew.  Reviews are accurate:  food was quick, good, and found the service excellent.  Hoang our server was great.  Had the Pho and enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"All time fav pho restaurant, most authentic, mountain like meat portions in pho, fast, always packed, strong cafe sa dau, one of the few places that have 7 course beef. Good fiendly service, best in vegas."}
{"text":"I give this 3 stars for the Pho only. The service here could be much better but I get it. They hire kids w less restaurant experience to get by. But I think that service is the key to getting customers back. 

I may be back not sure. But I did like the pho here. 

Plenty of parking, prices are a bit high for what ur getting but food comes out pretty quick."}
{"text":"I've heard a lot about this place from other Yelpers, but I've also read the stigma that comes with this place: Long waits, bad service, bringing out wrong items....  But people claimed the food was good, so I decided to toss myself to the ring and see what happens.

I'm not a major pho fan.  My experience largely extends to cracking jokes of the \"Pho real\" variety (yes, this is what I do).  For all the concern, however, none of the problems listed in reviews really happened in my experience.  Fast service, it sometimes took a moment to get the server's attention, but they were attentive when you did, they brought out something that we didn't ask for... not as a mess up, but they had an extra and offered the side dish for us to try just because.

The food itself?  Again, pho is not my usual first choice, but it's good to break out of the comfort zone, and to all credit, the food was tasty.   It was all well cooked, flavorful, and diverse.  I enjoyed it, felt full, and had a pleasant lunch.  Really, that's all I want from a dining experience.

When the check came, the price was not bad at all.  Two people for less than $20 is NOT a bad deal.

If I have another experience like this, I'll gladly return here.  As I said, pho is not usually my first meal craving, but the experience that I had here will ensure that it won't be my last."}
{"text":"We have been going to this restaurant for years. We drive all the way from summerlin to come here at least 2x a month because it is our favorite pho restaurant. I must say that the quality of food and service has been going downhill for the last several months. Today we were told that they couldn't cook our meal because it was too busy and that we had to order something different.  It was a simple beef dish. Not complex at all. Asked to speak to the manager and was asked to comeback after the holidays. Are you kidding me?  With the poor quality of food. The dirty restaurant. The sometimes bugs we see crawling around and the absolute poor customer services this was the final straw. We won't be returning to this restaurant again."}
{"text":"All I can say is wow. I don't know if this place got new management but the service is now top notch and the entire interior was redone. Not only that but the food is bette than ever. This place had closed for a few months. Prior to that I had left a 1 star review. Great job and keep up the great food and service!"}
{"text":"Have been coming here since 08' when I used to live in and out of Vegas/San Diego. I take my family and GF here all the time, the waiters know us, and my uncle is a celebrity with the owners LOL. This pho joint is typical. Although I prefer my Vietnamese food only in SD and Orange County.....this place is up to par. 

I always get the crispy rice noodles with beef/veggies, my only addiction there, and maybe pho only when it's a cold day. My GF only gets her usual bowl of pho with the brisket and tripe which she does like so it ends up in my mouth instead :) 

Service is okay, A mix of vietnamese and hispanic waiters, not a problem though, thats what makes this place authentic! hahahaha. Vietnamese owned btw. If you need something, always ask for it, don't expect them to bring you anything without asking, that's what I learned.Gets crowded here sometimes, so be ready to wait if you come around a bad time.

Actually going there for dinner tonight! LOL CHEAP AND GOOD Vietnamese food? hells yeah!!!"}
{"text":"I've been to many different vietnamese restaurants in this city but I always go back to this place. 

I don't know what it is about this place that I love so much but I JUST DO. I LOVE PHO SO 1 !!! 

No need for me to recommend anything because everything is so yummy; but I do always get their red bean dessert. the bean's texture is excellent. 

GO THERE NOW"}
{"text":"Of course going to Vegas with my Vietnamese family meant getting our pho fix on at least once in Vegas during our stay, this time, it was on our way out from Vegas. This is one of the better pho restaurants in Vegas, they have everything on their menu and reasonably priced too! Their service is kinda sucky, but I guess that's understandable since this place is packed all hours of the day until closing. I guess this place is the place to be when you need your pho fix. Obviously they're not as good as what you can find in your mom's kitchen or possibly out in Bolsa but its decently priced and tastes good enough. This is obviously a come-back place. duh. lol."}
{"text":"I grew up eating here, but I think it's slipped a bit - not sure if there was a change in management, but the service is lacking. Food is still great though!"}
{"text":"Favorite pho venue and clearly one of the VEGAS locals top choices. Always busy and in an older location so not fancy, but food is always good. Additionally, food comes to you pretty fast once ordered. A great place for lunch, dinner, or anytime."}
{"text":"Decent pho place. The satay (15) pho is probably the best thing on the menu. Good decor and toilets."}
{"text":"Me and my girls were driving around Chinatown in hopes of finding a Pho Restaurant that would be open at 3:30AM.  We found one off Yelp, but it ended up being closed.  Determined to find some grub, we saw a sign that said \"Open 24 hours\" and we told the taxi driver to get us there quick!

One of the girls walked in first because it looked like they were closing.  After a little convincing, they let us in--as long as we just ordered Pho Noodle soup, they'd serve us.

We ordered our Pho Noodle soups and waited patiently.  They were incredibly friendly and attentive to our table.  Even though they were closing, the servers kept re-filling our waters and making sure we were okay.  The pho was PERFECT and totally hit the spot.  As the workers were leaving one by one, the people left were told to make sure we were taken care of.

They came over to ask if we needed a taxi and called one for us.  The owner wouldn't let us walk outside of the restaurant until the taxi came because we were a group of 4 girls. We, of course, left a very nice tip and went on our way.  

Prices are incredibly affordable and service was AMAZING to say the least.  I will be headed back to Pho So 1 probably every time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"If I could write 0 stars I would. I bags to flag down a staff member to get service. Had to walk up to the till to give her our order. Took 30 mins for our dinner to come out. Then I had to flag her down again to get some more fish sauce, which never ended up coming out. 
Worst. Service. Ever. Would never go back. You guys really need to get your act together."}
{"text":"The Pho Dac Biet here is a good size.  For $10, they give you a good portion of meat,.. more then an $8 bowl of pho in the OC Cali.  The prices are fair here and the food is okay.  

My friend had the Banh Canh and he said the soup was watery and didn't taste like the right soup (like that from hu tieu).

As for appetizers.. I tried the egg rolls and they weren't bad.  The spring rolls are abit undersized but they are okay too.  

I'd recommend coming her for a quick bite of vietnamese food."}
{"text":"By far my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Vegas.  Great food, great prices, and they're open late.  My personal favorite is their rice vermicelli bowls, and they're always accommodating to my customized request of beef & shrimp combo, which isn't on the menu, but it never seems to be a problem.  Plus their beef is so thinly sliced, just the way I like it.  So if you're looking for good eats, especially late night, do yourself a favor & check these guys out..."}
{"text":"They certainly operate at their own pace and demeanour. You order food, you get food; period - no extra points for personality or ambience. 

Seafood has been hit and miss on the soup so I ordered extra this time; came with 2 shrimp and they wanted to charge extra!!

Took an extra 20 minutes to get them to remove the extra charge. Last time I think I will go here. 

Too bad, used to be so much better."}
{"text":"Food: 4 stars
Service: 2 stars, (including the rude cashier)

After having eaten at this location numerous times, I was craving their vermicelli bowl, so made the trek to Chinatown.  The restaurant was about 75% percent full when I arrived shortly before 9pm on a Saturday night.  After looking at the menu, I decided on my favorite option, Vermicelli Bowl with charbroiled pork and an egg roll.  It came out in less than 10 minutes, and the pork was piping hot atop cool noodles and chopped romaine.  I added the requisite fish sauce, hoisin, and of course a good dose of Sriracha. Yum!

My only issue with the bowl was the pork was much fattier than I remember, which left some remaining in the bowl when I was done.  This is rare for me, considering I usually gobble down the whole thing.  Despite this, I highly recommend ordering.

It really does only take one employ to spoil an otherwise good experience.  When I went up to the cashier to pay for the $9.99 bowl, I noticed a sign that said $15 minimum for credit card payments.  I handed my card to the cashier and he pointed out the sign, then asked, don't you have cash.  I looked at the two bucks in my wallet and said, \"not enough to pay for the meal\".  In a huff, he said \"fine, I'll take the card, but only this time\". I considered lecturing him about needing to instruct the servers about mentioning this to patrons when they order, but decided against it; not worth it.  After I signed, I thanked him and he said nothing in response. Wow! Unacceptable.  Think I'll find a new Pho restaurant in the valley."}
{"text":"So the family drove all the way to Vegas from LA to eat at a subpar Pho restaurant.  This is so typical of an Asian family.  So we walked in with a party of 15 and it took 10-15 minutes for us to get seated.  I understood that as this is not a normal sized party.  I ordered the spring rolls with shrimp and pho xe lua.  First off, I noticed how much more they charged here compared to LA.  
The spring rolls were just ok.  Didn't have much flavor to it.  The dipping sauce did help, but still not that good.  My pho came out and I wasn't sure it was mine because it was a regular sized bowl.  From my experience, xe lua is supposed to be an extra large.  I thought that's why I paid extra for it.  I even asked the server and he said that the xe lua was the same as the dac biet.  
I was confused, but I still ate it and didn't make a big deal about it.  When I took my first bite, I was underwhelmed by the taste.  The soup didn't have that much flavor even after putting in the hoisin, veggies and lime.  The noodles wasn't fresh tasting like I'm used to.  I forgot to mention that the food was luke warm.  It's not piping hot like it's supposed to be.  The meat was just ok.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  
All in all, I would not come back to this establishment if I am ever in Vegas and craving for Pho.  There are so many other choices to choose from, and this one really bites.  The thing that really confuses me is that this is part of a chain and there is one located in Van Nuys that taste better than this place.  Food quality is definitely lacking at this Vegas location and they need to re-evaluate their whole business strategy."}
{"text":"Meat was very hard like rubbery. Ordered large but it seems like small portion...just in a big bowl. Ordered egg rolls and they came out all burned. Don't go here.  Not worth the money."}
{"text":"Best and fastest serving pho I've had in town. And everything else on their menu is amazing as well! Great prices and awesome servers."}
{"text":"When we got there everyone was great! The server knew his stuff and knew the ingredients of every item on the menu. Going smooth till they delivered my bowl of the veggie plate #21 which was a warm/cold dish so it has alot of fresh ingredients.  Well, It wasn't so fresh when I seen a bug  crawl out of my bowl right when it was delivered. I didnt cause a scene so my family was able to eat in peace. We were a group of 8. I calmly told him theres a bug in my bowl please remove this dish from the table all I got was a sorry.  He still charged me for my spring roll appetizer which i refused to eat because I was disgusted and the waiter said he would see what he can do. nothing was taken off my bill and no Sorry from management.  We paid anyway which was bull shit.  I feel this is a result of a greedy owner/manager to make sure they dont lose business. I sat there and just drank my beer that was full price. unreal. bad business and DIRTY DINING. THIS PLACE NEEDS NEW MANAGEMENT! ILL NEVER GO BACK."}
{"text":"First time at Pho So 1; the pho is good. The customer service is not so friendly and unorganized!!! We wait forever to get our grilled beef that never come.

Waiter has bad communication skill; doesn't want to accommodate the customer request. I know he's busy but it would be nice to be nice. Even the cleaning boy was much nicer with a smile on their faces.

The floor is slippery! Be care when you walk ... Even the workers slipped on their own floor. Safety first don't they practice this?

Yes! Overall, I would never come here for Pho again! Too bad their chef is good at what they do but OMG! Their management style need to be fix ASAP! Even if the food is good but service is always to be determine of a happy customer!"}
{"text":"As I said in a previous review what makes pho amazing to me is the broth and this place is the tits! The staff is super friendly as well! I ordered a beer (33) and somehow they put in two orders for me. When the second one came out the boss said it was on the house. Most places would have taken it in the back and put it on ice until someone else ordered one.

I'm a fan pho sho!!!"}
{"text":"The pho here is a bit better than Pho Kim Long's pho, even though it is more oily. I haven't found a better place than this so far. The service is always good when we go here. The vermicelli dishes like bun are pretty good here too (I love pouring all the fish sauce they give in it! hehe). 

Anyone have any suggestions of a better place in Vegas?"}
{"text":"Best pho in town!  not the cleanest place but the broth for the pho is delicious.  Also the grill for the lemongrass beef and shrimp is good if youre not in the mood for pho."}
{"text":"This place is a delightful treat! I am from out of town and I have eaten at many pho restaurants around the world. This one is by far the most authentic I've had. The lady in the front was a real peach! Service was quick. FOOD WAS DELICIOUS! Clean environment. I am a new resident to Canada and I found my regular pho spot."}
{"text":"THE BEST PHO IN LAS VEGAS!!!!!

I order the same thing every time - #14 Special Combo, rare slices of steak, well-done brisket, flank, tendon and tripe. 
Describing Pho makes my mouth water. But really, I've tried as many Pho restaurants in Vegas (because this is so hard to get to and it's so inconvenient) but honestly... if you want Pho you have to do it right. 

The broth is perfect - not too greasy but OH SO flavorful. 

The service is hit or miss... you have to make sure they don't forget to put in your order. If they put in your order right away you will be staring at your bowl of heaven's broth and noodles in no time (about 5-10 mins). However, my order has been forgotten a couple of times.. but not worth docking stars. The taste makes up for it. 

MUST GO!"}
{"text":"I like how this place opens late.  Usually busy and the smells of all kinds of foods are linger in the air and your hair/clothes... but it is all good.  The foods here are pretty decent. I won't come here to eat pho but their bo nuong tom vi  (self serve grill of thinly sliced beefs & shrimps) roll it as a spring roll with the thin paper rice. The dipping pinnapple sauces are to die for! That is the highlight of the dish. Their com tam or com dishes are pretty delicious along w their varies of vermicelli bowls. Their grilled grounded shrimps w sugar cane is juicy and good.  Always come back here for more of the sinky pinnapple dipping sauce."}
{"text":"You probably did not know this, but they have oxtails.  It's not on the menu.  Just ask one of the servers if they still have oxtails for the day because it's a daily limited item.  If you had oxtails at California Hotel in downtown, then you will want to try these.  Simmered in broth from the beginning, most likely over 6 hours.  It's extremely tender and flavorful.  Remember to order with Pho broth only.  Eating with noodles will be messy for you.

As far as the rest of the menu, everything is true to Vietnamese flavor.  No fusion here, and that's a good thing.  Everything is also very reasonable in price.  You can be full and satisfied for under $10, tip included.  

As for the service, it's better than most vietnamese restaurants.  Here's a tip.  Walk in, make eye contact with a server and signal how many in your party with your fingers.  After seating, you will be handed menus and probably forgotten about.  Once again, after you made your decision as to what to eat, look up, make eye contact, hand raising if necessary, don't snap fingers, someone will rush over to take your order.  When it's time for the check, go to cashier and tell him/her your table number (located on the chopsticks box).  Or you can ask for the check, up to you, but being Asian, I usually limit my eye contact to two times a day.  

One last thing, this restaurant does grilled meats extremely well.  These meats go into noodles, dry or wet, and also rice.  Cannot go wrong with these.  Many others do not bother to grill as it is very time and space consuming in the kitchen.  

I hope this review helps with your dining decisions."}
{"text":"Coming from Utah I always make a stop here when commuting to California. I was first introduced to this place a few years ago. I thought It was just like any other pho place until the food came out. I ordered eggrolls and the pho dac biet (special). When the eggrolls came out they didnt skimp out on the vegetables that came with it. They were cooked to the perfect crisp. Luckily I didnt get too full off of them because the best part was the pho. It came in a decent sized bowl, the broth was good and the portions of meat were just right to the amount of noodles. This place is my favorite in the area. I've tried a few places around here and this has to be my favorite place."}
{"text":"I like this place a lot! It's inexpensive, the staff is generally helpful, and it's a pleasant environment."}
{"text":"On the plus side,  this is authentic Vietnamese food. The place is packed with Vietnamese so you can bet that you are getting the real deal. Having visited Hanoi, I can attest to how the pho is nearly identical to what I sampled in the homeland.

On the negative side, you don't go here for the ambience or the cleanliness. Don't expect to be pampered by the service and it might get pretty smokey in there from all of the tabletop bbq going on.

If you prioritize the authenticity and quality of the food over all else then you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The ownership has clearly changed here. None of the staff had the attitude in any way to serve or satisfy anybody. They all have a daggering look as if there is a serious problem almost on a personal level collectively from the whole staff. We received a beef stew with two fine edible pieces of meat and the rest literally fat. When we asked the first waiter to take it back they just left the table and another waiter came by and asked what was wrong and continued to argue and proclaim the fat is there to savor the flavor,  which I understand, I asked is the fat supposed to eaten? (sarcastically) No. The problem isn't that there's too much fat on the meat, there is no meat. Jumping straight to it he said he would take it back with no refund. I will never come back here ever again I don't know how service gets any worse. On top of It already, it smells terrible in here and the bus boys cleaning random kitchen utensils in buckets on the front tables. I guess it does get worse. Don't come here."}
{"text":"Pho So 1 is my go-to pho place because it's close to my house, opens late, is affordable, and is consistent in their food. The service is meh but I don't go there to be waited on hand and foot. The food usually comes quickly too.

I always order #14. The pho always comes with good helping of bean sprouts, basil leaves (they're basil leaves, right?), lime slices, and jalapeno slices. The base broth is always yummy but I tend to spice mine up with chili and siracha as well.

When I'm with others, we usually get egg rolls because it's 6 dollars for four and a massive heap of vegetables. The egg rolls are always hot, crisp, and fresh as well.

I once had the grilled meat and shrimp the first time I came here but I can't say much about it because it was about five years ago. I remember having fun though so that probably means the food was good as well!

In the winter, they also serve complimentary hot tea, which I don't think should be served in plastic cups, but oh well. I still enjoy it nonetheless."}
{"text":"My son loves this place broths and rolls excellent place to go with family... It is always good to experience different kind of Vietnamese food is delicious"}
{"text":"This place is the best Vietnamese restaurant that I have found so far in Vegas. For only being in Vegas for a few days for a mini vacation, we managed to came back for 5 times during our 3 days trip. I truly recommend this restaurant for anyone who wish to eat authentic Vietnamese food while on a vacation. This is a better place to eat than to eat at one of those 24 hrs Vietnamese restaurant. I will definitely go back when visiting Vegas."}
{"text":"Solid pho thats open late in Vegas. The broth doesn't have alot of deep flavor, i think its missing or doesn't have enough allspice or clove. They do give alot of meat, which is good because when I get pho, I want almost equal meat to noodle ratio. The service is fast and courtesy. I would recommend this place when craving something soup-y after a night of clubbing and drinking."}
{"text":"This Pho So 1 is one of the most crowded pho spots in Las Vegas!  The weather for pho in Vegas was a perfect chilly 44 F degrees.  When we arrived at the restaurant, the wait time was about 15 minutes. The major complaint about this place was the service from the host that sat us down next to the blowing fan...it's cold outside! The host did not want to move us :o, which was rude. 

On the other hand, the eggrolls where really delicious--crispy on the outside and soft on the insidee with a lot of veggies. The waiter accidentally place the plate wrong that one of the eggrolls fell on the table and he brought us 2 more on the house!

The flavor of the pho was very good, one of the best I've tried in Vegas and I've tried about 3 pho places thus far in my lifetime. However, it does not compare to the one in Denver :D."}
{"text":"I very much enjoy coming here on cool fall and winter days for a warm bowl of Pho. Staff is always helpful and friendly. One of my favorite places."}
{"text":"My friends and I usually head to this place to get our pho.

Service is okay. Sometimes they get to us in a timely manner and other times I just want to throw something at them just to get their attention.

I usually order #11 and it's pretty good. I guess since I don't think I've really had any amazing pho that it's hard to compare or judge.

I do quite like the noodles so that's good enough for me. I don't really wanna try the other things on the menu because it sounds like a risky choice, but eh, we'll see."}
{"text":"Their food is always good, BUT their service is declining big time! These new servers don't want to do anything and when we called one of them over they try to call another server to help our table and the other server tried to call ANOTHER server over while they were all just standing around in the back talking!"}
{"text":"Pho So, Pho So le mio. Sta 'nfronte a te! Sta 'nfronte a te! (Trust me, sounds much better when Pavarotti sings it!!)

Wife wanted to try Las Vegas pho. I told her not to get her expectations up, because it wasn't likely that Las Vegas pho would be any better than Little Saigon pho, or real Saigon pho, for that matter. Probably better than Fargo pho, though. 

Pho So is in Las Vegas' Chinatown area, a little to the west of The Strip on Spring Mountain Road. It's in a crowded strip mall, and depending on where you enter or leave, what day and time it is, it can be a nightmare!! Took 10 minutes to back up and get out of the parking lot: about a total of 30 feet!! 10 freaking minutes!! Hell, real Saigon pho isn't worth that!!! Well, maybe if the waitress was naked....., but I digress!!

So we had a few spring rolls and some pho. The pho was so...so. Pho So had so so pho!! Get it? Bwahahahaha! Hold on, let me catch my breath! 

It's much like any Vietnamese pho restaurant, and I've been to a few dozen, in Little Saigon and real Saigon. And Phan Thiet also. About $27.50 went into decor, and maybe double that for furnishings. The food's decent, but seriously, it's not worth 10 minutes to move my car 30 feet. Treasure Island opened some pho place, and next time I told my wife we'd go there. The pho is probably half the quality at twice the price, and yes, it'll take 10 minutes to get there from the parking lot, but at least we're moving!!! Yes, some In-N-Out drive thrus take 20-30 minutes to get through, but dude!! In-N-Out!! It's worth it!! Pho So isn't. If you go, don't go during peak dining times."}
{"text":"A couple of years ago I would have probably gave Pho So 1 five stars but lately the broth doesn't taste the same or the egg rolls look like they have been sitting in the back for 30 minutes. 
This is still my favorite Pho Restaurant in all of Las Vegas. I always get number 11 (pho tai) and usually the fried egg rolls. Add some Siracha and your golden."}
{"text":"Once upon a time my friends called Pho \"stinky feet soup\". After
hitting some of them in the kidneys, punching a couple more in their
throat and poking all of them in the eyes with my ninja moves, I step
back and said \"DON'T YOU DARE KIDS..DONT YOU DARE\"

This spot is my favorite pho place in town. In a city that is packed
with pho places, its hard to find a general  and universal \"best\" but
this is my personal favorite. The broth is delicious and the portions
are generous. the cold noodles plates also are very good, and the
appetizers which includes the egg rolls are LE awesome.As in all pho
places you get your food very fast .Also there is never a wait
time.Servers are usually from Vietnam which means that sometimes you
can encounter some challenges when trying to place your order (thanks
God for the numbers on the menu!).

You may ask what makes it different and in my opinion the best?.
Honestly I am not 100 percent sure. It's the broth I think, but
sometimes I think it's the meat, and others I simply guess that the
owners have some mind control devices around the city..who knows..All
I know is that it tastes delish."}
{"text":"It was my first time eat in a restaurant without leaving any tips. Bad service and I will never go back again. They forgot my order and keep me waiting for a half hour. Just a simple noodle soup. What a time wasting and money wasting place."}
{"text":"I Love this place they have the best steak spring rolls and hot jasmin tea. Best pho in town not including my girlfriends moms pho!! The service is ok, but the food makes up for any miscommunication."}
{"text":"Great pho at a great price. Wonderful service too. My favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Vegas now. I eat here every week."}
{"text":"Service is superfast, however the servers look like they don't wanna be there :) 
now to the quality of the pho, I've had #21 which is vegeterian pho , it was super LOUSY 
I ate here several times and this is the worst I've had however once it was delicious so it can be hit or miss . With so many pho places in town i'll steer away from this place for a while ..."}
{"text":"Want pho? Get pho? Pho so 1 is the best for late night pho and a good meal after a long night of being on the town, partying hard, or just getting off of work. The broth warms you right to your soul and the portions are always very generous. The staff is very accommodating and give great service. The large menu is a plus and a minus in my opinion. If you are familiar with the food it is a welcome assortment but for someone like me, it gets confusing. The restaurant is clean and the staff makes quick work of a finished table. Overall a great pho place. Go try it out for yourself and tell me how it was for you!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the pho and egg rolls here. I also love that they have the tabletop cooking device to cook your beef and wrap it with banh trang and whatever else you please. 

My only complaint is the bathroom, major turnoff which makes me question the state of the kitchen. I just try to never go in there now haha. 

Slow service, but is general norm for a lot of asian restaurants. Food is most important and it is definitely good here."}
{"text":"We ordered the Bo Nhung Dam, which is like beef spring rolls that you make yourself so I cant say how the Pho is. 

Taste - it tasted fine, very basic, very healthy because its so easy to make and 90% of it is just greens.

Price - EXPENSIVE. Our food came out in small portions and refills costed extra money! 

2 stars because it wont fill you and if you want it to, prepare to pay extra"}
{"text":"Been going here a lot lately because its fast, and good. Delightful flavor ( I almost always order Pho Tai Chin with a Thai Ice tea). Since its good everytime I thought I should probably write a review. My friend orders the lettuce wrap shrimp on sugar cane and she loves it! 

Definitely not a fancy restaurant, but good food and always busy."}
{"text":"My wife and I found this through a recommendation of a local.  Looking to find a cheap and good lunch away from the strip, this hit the spot.  We both had a bowl of pho.  The broth was very good and not too salty.  We also had the fried egg rolls, which were also very good.  All in all, if you're looking for pho off the strip, this is the place to go to."}
{"text":"Best Pho in Vegas. Broth tastes consistent and is rich in flavor. Love that its open till 3 am. Other food is great too: bun cha gio thit nuong,goi coun,   

Only knock i have about this place is when it gets busy (full house) getting seated and your order taken can take a while.. but the good food/prices ease my mind :)"}
{"text":"this place is good. i like comming here for vietnamese bbq. they have the rice papers you dip in water and you can bbq meats and shrimps. Havn't found any place that serves that yet... bbq gets a 4.

i had the pho here once... it wasnt bad... i would give that a 3.

service here isnt bad, i give it a 3, but the main thing that is goood about this restaurant is the BBQ~!

on big vegas weekends they dont serve bbq b/c it smokes up the restaurant too much and takes up too much time...
they would rather serve more people and get them in and out than for people to take there time bbqing and smokin up the place...

but i can't blame them... THATS BUSINESS! :)

FINAL RATING 3 1/2"}
{"text":"It's sure been a while since my husband and I have been here. So happy to see the original owners are back! 
We had the nuong vi. We grilled beef and shrimp at our table and rolled it up. It was delicious. My toddler also loved the three-colored dessert! 
They renovated the place and it looks awesome. Great service. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So apparently the owners of this place are the ones that opened District One on Jones. 

I. Just. Don't. Get. How. 

The Pho here is gross. It just tastes like MSG."}
{"text":"The more pho I eat, the more I find myself wanting to come back here!!!

Cheaper, better portions, more flavorful, lovely noodles.... and open till 3AM;)

I'd take some now!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular at this place. By far one of the most reasonably priced, quick and attentive service, and filling vietnamese food you can get in Vegas! I usually get the eggrolls, springrolls, and vegetable pho tai every single time. One great thing about the eggrolls here is that they are filling and they don't skimp you on them! Other viet restaurants have eggrolls that are too small or not enough. Pho so 1 gives you a generous portion, and their service is insanely quick! You typically don't have to wait longer than 7 minutes before you either get your entree or appetizer out (and half the time your entree will be out before your appetizer because they are quick!) The best thing about it is they are open until 3AM, so this is the perfect place for me to go after work when I'm in need of hot soup, hot tea, and a healthy alternative to after midnight dining. :)"}
{"text":"We've been going to this place every time when  we in vegas. The food was ok with typical kind of Vietnamese foods. But last time i went here The waitress was messed up all the orders and been ruled to us. Serviced here was very bad and careless to the customers, i went to the manager to complainted but she not even listened to the customer complaints  but defended back for her worker. I was very disappointed with this place And wouldn't come back and wouldn't recommended to anyone to this place."}
{"text":"Pho was like any other place. Their menu online is old as the prices are different once you are at the restaurant.  Bathroom was not air condition, suffocating. Food was average pho."}
{"text":"Ate here on the 5th of May 2018 and i had great pho. As did my friends, but my wife... She got a bland bowl of noodles that tasted like it was very heavily watered down. Hence the 4 instead of 5 stars that I would have given this place. The meat here was good, the noodles were also really good, my broth was well above the average of pho places I've eaten. Despite my wife's pho, I'll likely return to eat here again and see if that was just a fluke."}
{"text":"Service Sucked.
Food Sucked (Pho broth was loaded with MSG and barely any other seasoning..it was like chicken broth + msg, chicken was dry, rice was funny tasting, and the Cha (meat cake) tasted GROSS.)
You even failed to get our order right even after 3 different people at our table repeated it. 
FAIL"}
{"text":"Not a pho expert but had a really satisfying and cheap lunch here when I was tired of the strip. Service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Delicious!  My favorite pho place in Vegas hands-down.  Great menu and service, always bustling with the locals, and will fill you up.  The broth is flavored just right, the noodles are perfect, and all of the toppings are delicious.  There is usually a wait on the weekends, so be prepared to wait a little bit.  HIghly recommend."}
{"text":"I hate to give two stars because the food is good, you get a lot and it's cheap. Also, they have a good variety of cold Asian beer.
But the service is...........
The waiter dropped off our food and we never saw him again.
When I went to find him after 25 minutes, I asked for more iced tea and some to go boxes.
His snappy reply was something like, \"We are busy and everybody wants something!\".
When I went to pay the check, I discovered they had charged another $1.50 for the iced tea refill!  
When I asked why, the cashier said, \"Well, we have to pay for the ice!\"  I told her I could give them the recipe for ice and they could save a lot of money, but she didn't seem to get the joke! 
Our bill was almost $70.00, so to charge for a refill of one iced tea seems a bit much! 
Keep in mind that we were a party of four guys, all ex-cab drivers, and when we get good service, we tip way too much! 
But not this time. 
If I come back, I guess I'll order it to-go!"}
{"text":"Service is friendliest of all Pho restaurant I've been to and I've been to alot.  The food is great and the price is reasonable.  When we were eating pho there were other tables that order grilled beef that you grilled yourself at the table.  It smelled delicious.  I might try that next time I'm back in Vegas."}
{"text":"My favorite spot for pho in Las Vegas so far. The broth alone in pho is off the hook and everything else that comes in pho is a delight especially enjoying it with an ice cold beer. Spring rolls are fresh and tasty. Its called Pho So 1 because its the number 1 spot to go for Pho and vietnamese food. Good and fast service."}
{"text":"My favorite Vietnamese restaurant  in Las Vegas. Staff is friendly and greet you right away.. restaurant is clean. Food is fresh. I always order vermicelli noodle with egg roll and shrimp and fresh spring rolls. By far the freshest but it's in china town so I don't visit often."}
{"text":"Im a san gabriel valley LA resident, so ive had a ton of pho places.. this place is on par with a good one from home. Prices are fair, portions are good, lots of MEAT in the pho, goodsize rice plates as well.

i recommend this to anyone craving this type of food. they're open till 3am or later i think.. 2 thumbs up..

i almost forgot, i had their fried eggrolls, they were good in size, came with greens to wrap/eat with them.. they were wrapped just tight enough, and were packed with a good filling. they came SUPER HOT(which is a plus)"}
{"text":"Best Pho in vegas. Must be something amazingly addicting in their broth, because lately it's all I can really think about. Going to start calling it phocaine lol. I normally get Pho with Brisket only and no pasta, I'm really only there to get loaded on the most delicious liquids. The broth, amazing! The jasmine tea, double amazing! The thai tea, would be triple amazing if only they had boba and the serving was bigger. It's never really enough. The Cabernet was also delicious despite it being sutter home?? The only downside is the fresh spring rolls I order when I'm with company didn't come with peanut sauce, and when I do request it, it's not as amazing as it should be. A little to much soy sauce not enough peanut. Other than that I suggest trying this place over any other pho restaurant in town. Everyone seems super friendly and will go the distance to make a custom order if you have picky friends like me ;)"}
{"text":"DUDES! I'm here. March 25, 2018-11:45 am. They're open, baby...\"\"@0.  Remodeled into a millennial industrial chic environment of greys and blacks....nice! They've upped their game....now looking like a trendy Japanese Ramen Restaurant.....Pho recipes definitely upgraded....very tasty, indeed! Quality ingredients and service staff that can speak English, eh?

Update 04/22/2018:   We woke up this morning craving Vietnamese  so we drove the 20 minutes to Decatur & Spring Mountain  for food...and yes at 10:30 am they were already open...only a few diners this early so we had a choice of seating...and got a table facing a wall mount TV  monitor with an ESPN 3 broadcast of women's lacrosse--it was great---not like a lot of other Vietnamese pho shops where the TVs are turned on to Vietnamese soap operas, pop  star singers, or real estate agents advertising homes.....

.....Instead of ordering our usual fresh spring rolls we ordered fried egg rolls, and what a treat----beautiful visual presentation if their just fried (not microwave reheats) egg rolls with a very subtle sweet n spicy  dipping sauce--yum---I ordered the small bowl of pho  but I still couldn't finish it---a guy one table over ordered a large pho and it was the size of an aircraft carrier---but then again he was a young man with a very healthy appetite...I still am amazed on how this pho outfit has reenergized what usually is a standard-operating bowl of pho---if you try their pho you will never go anywhere else...

.....my wife ordered her always favorite Vietnamese fish soup---and folks they put chunks of fresh fish in it as well as those delicious dried scallops....

....also, they remodeled their restrooms...now they're spiffy clean places....no longer the restrooms from a derelict freighter"}
{"text":"LOVE this place.  we love #48, charred pork on vermicelli noodles and vegetables.  the price for meal is great, and apps are good too.  we also love that its open late."}
{"text":"I absolutely loved the pho. The owner was very attentive and checked in on us a couple of times. Food is a little too salty but not too bad. I don't reccommend the salted lemonade though, I wanted to try something new but it was crazy salty.. not for me.

Besides that, the broth was amazing"}
{"text":"Food 3/5
Service 3/5
Cleanliness 3/5


3 Stars meaning that it's just pho. Nothing crazy but not bad at all! The place is clean and looks great. A good place to stop by if you're wanting some pho or hu tieu. Other than that, expect nothing but satisfaction and good pho !"}
{"text":"Awesome restaurant that I have been faithfully going to for about 8 years when it was much smaller. Usually busy but they manage to turn over tables pretty quick. My husband usually orders the # 10 which is Pho with no meatballs. The broth is something that I have not been able to recreate at home. I usually order the # 54 which is marinated pork with fried eggrolls over a bed of lettuce with mint, daikon, bean sprouts that is topped with chopped peanuts. You can request it with the peanut sauce but I prefer their fish sauce that has a little kick and is slightly sweet! Decent prices, we usually spend like 20.00 with a Thai tea. The only reason I marked 4 instead of 5 stars is that some servers are better than others."}
{"text":"Found this place on the way to buy groceries for our hotel stay. Ate here all 4 days in Vegas. Great food, great staff, friendly attentive. Will be our first stop next time in Vegas."}
{"text":"I understand that it was busy that morning but the young waiter could've acknowledge us as we waiting for someone to take our order. We got there before the other table and he by pass us to take theirs. How rude!!
I just wanted some Pho' and get the hell out of there because there's other things on my agenda that day."}
{"text":"Broken rice with grilled pork is super dry, tasted like it was left over from a day before. It's not worth it for how much they charged."}
{"text":"We just received massages across the street and worked up a good appetite for hot soup. Busy place but sat quickly and soups were on the table in little time. We didn't know to pay at the desk so we waited around until we asked. Very good!"}
{"text":"I used to go to this place all the time but the last time I came and ordered Bun Rieu, I was very disappointed. The soup was bland and flavorless and it was $9.25! WTF! So overpriced. Not sure if I'll come back anymore."}
{"text":"Wow. We have a Pho So 1 in Las Vegas Nevada. This is the first out of state Pho So 1 than the ones found in SoCal. 

Unfortunately, the majority of the Pho So 1 restaurants in SoCal still dominates on their taste in food than yours. Sorry. 

Here are my reason & suggestions for further improvements: 
1. Your restaurant is way too crowded. I think it's best to have one of those call for reservations. This will hopefully organize the restaurant. 

2. Disadvantage of crowded restaurant would impact the quality of the foods. Overcrowded customers can cause the crew to make the foods in a rush & food done in a rush of course would have poor quality tasting. I do recommend about having a larger crew than you currently have. \"Hire more soldiers\" to serve in your kitchen. 

I feel your foods is ok; the pho tasted like the Pho So 1 from SoCal. Though, I felt it was done in a rush, especially on crowded days. Therefore, I think if you have \"more troops\" to do the work, especially on crowded days, it would be doable. 

Overall, 3/5 stars from me. I might come back in the future. Follow those 2 suggestions above & I'll assure you that you'll improve Pho So 1 of Las Vegas. 



P.S. To the \"founder\" of Pho So 1 who's reading this: since you have successfully open 1 Pho So 1 restaurant outside of Southern California (i.e. Pho So 1 of Las Vegas), I do have further suggested locations of other additional locations you can open up Pho So 1: 
1. Reno Nevada
2. San Francisco California
3. Oakland California
4. San Jose California
5. Phoenix Arizona
6. Honolulu Hawaii
7. Hilo Hawaii"}
{"text":"Very consistent, whenever in town always my choice.
One of the best pho places!
Thanks."}
{"text":"Been back a few times since my last review way back in 2009.  For me this is still the best pho place in Vegas (like their broth), even though it is still not as good as a lot of pho places in OC or Cali. But it is only a 10-20 minutes drive for most living in the LV and not a 3+ hours pho pilgrimage.

Anyway, I was sick the past few days and once my appetite has finally returned, I wanted something easy to ease my tummy into, and I remembered ordering their porridge the last time I was really sick.  So I scan the menu for the porridge section, and they have a few listed, but I think only 2 without pork blood. So I was debating between the Beef Porridge or Shrimp Porridge (which in the Chinese translated portion of the menu stated that it has both beef and shrimp, but I found out that is not the case).  But the waiter was kind enough to ask the kitchen to make it a special order so my porridge order will have both beef and shrimp.  That is a plus in my book for customer service.  The porridge came out piping hot, with strips of ginger, cilantro and fried onions, and have diced up bits of shrimp and a lot of the beef (the ones used in pho).  But it wasn't what I had in mind (the Chinese version with minced beef), but the porridge itself was good and I think I would be happy with just that.

I also ordered their Beef Salad, not knowing exactly what it is, and it turned out to be a plate of veggies (the kind used in making Vietnamese Spring Rolls) with the traditional Vietnamese herbs and strips of beef.  This is definitely a healthy dish, with lots of crunchy veggies that can really tire out your jaw from chewing, but the flavor was lacking. Although I will say that it is refreshing, with all of the mint and basil leaves. Personally I will not ordered this particular appetizer again.

They also have a special Bun entree that is not in the menu, which includes pretty much all the topping in the Bun section.  My friend ordered it the last last time I was really sick, and it looked great and I am sure that it tasted great too, but the only way to get it is to specially ask the waiter for this special order request.  I will for sure order that the next time I head back and after that maybe try their hot pot.

Decor - 4/5 I like the new look. The flat screen TV anchored to the back wall plays a constant stream of local advertising, which helps remedy boredom when dining solo or when your dining companions are just not entertaining as the reruns of ads.

Food - 3/5 Overall a good bowl of pho, bun and most appetizers.

Service - 4.5/5 Being receptive to custom orders is a good thing.

Price - 3/5 I think it is par for the course."}
{"text":"The best pho in Las Vegas for sure! I wish that I knew about this place when I used to live here a few years ago. I would have came here at least once a week! They have a pretty extensive menu here and pretty much do everything from pho to 7 course beef. I give this place a solid 4 1/2 stars! 

I ordered a special combo pho which had all of the goodies as I usually do for pho. The broth was excellent! The noodles were cooked perfectly and the meat was great! We also ordered some appetizers as well. We ordered a side of egg rolls which were nice and tasty! We also ordered the special beef salad which was also really good as well!

I am pretty sure that I will eat here again if I'm craving Vietnamese food out here!"}
{"text":"Pho Ga (chicken pho soup) and crunchy egg rolls were both awesome! The broth was delicious and the prices were less expensive than other pho places. We'll come back here for sure!"}
{"text":"I was expecting to wait forever and a day to eat some pho...especially after waiting through the lines at other pho places in the area. However, we were seated right away. Many of the waitresses don't speak English, and they had to call their one and only loyal Latino employee to help us out. That's fine though; he was cordial and nice :) Our orders came fairly quickly and we dug in right away:

Pho tai: The broth is AMAZING! So flavorful!! Much more so than the diluted sewage water we get at the other pho places in the surrounding area! Honestly, I didn't get to try the noodles or meat as my bf GOBBLED IT ALL UP!! It must've really been just that good...

Luong sam bo (something like that?): We got this instead of the red jelly drink that my friend originally ordered, and he said it was way too herbal. Probably wouldn't try this one.

Shrimp spring rolls (goi cuon): Yummm...very traditional. Tastes like the way I remember it at home :]

Pork skin spring rolls (Bi cuon): I liked this more than the shrimp, but that's just because I love pork skin. You really can't go wrong with the spring rolls; just the right portion of veggies to pork!

Red jelly drink: Don't know what the name is, but the pic is on the menu! It was okay...a bit diluted and the coconut milk was watered down...jelly was decent though.

3 Color drink: Again, very diluted even after I took out all the ice. The cup was small compared to most pho places, and honestly it wasn't very impressive. Green bean was not the mushy sweet goodness I remember it being, and the red bean had some weird flavoring to it. I definitely would not get this again; not when I've been spoiled by the good stuff everywhere else!!!

Overall, 3.5 stars, but 4 since the pho is a big YES PLEASE GET IT! Spring rolls are delicious as well...just avoid the drinks...you'd rather go to Tea Station or even Lee's Sandwiches down the street."}
{"text":"Ive been to many pho places ... but the taste of their broth doesnt top this place... pho so 1 broth is extreamly flavorful"}
{"text":"My go to place to satisfy my craving for Vietnamese food. They have delicious pho, great rice dishes and vermicelli. Usually has a good amount of customers, but today during lunch it was super packed. Thai tea is made pretty well. Pho has perfect ratio of noodles soup and meat and the portions are just enough to satisfy the craving, but not too much where I feel like I'm about to explode. The water actually doesn't taste like faucet water.
Another good thing is the plaza has a good amount of parking. I would probably come here more of it wasn't so far from where I lived."}
{"text":"An over hyped Pho restaurant that did not even come close to meeting up to expectations. 

Everyone from Summerlin to Henderson has been telling me for months that Pho So 1 is the best Pho in Las Vegas. It might be the busiest Pho place in LV, but it is not close to being the best.  

The Pho was practically like boiled salt water. The broth was obviously rushed in preparations and served premature due to the overwhelming amounts of people rushing in the door.  I much prefer places like Pho Sing Sing where you can tell that they boiled the bones for over 20 hours because the broth is very oily and strong. 

The vegetables in the spring rolls tasted like the cook collected the grass after he mowed his lawn and brought it to work with him.  

The service wasn't bad, they just didn't give us any service in the first place. After they brought us our food, we never saw another server again. I hate restaurants where you have to flag down the staff to get service. This is also one of those places where the servers will pretend they don't hear you so that they don't have to do extra work. 

The restroom was horrible, even compared to horrible Chinatown standards. All I wanted to do was wash my hands and instead I had to witness a moment of horror! Two of the Spanish speaking cooks were having a conversation in the bathroom while one guy was taking a sh!t. The worst part was that the stall door was open and they were giving each other eye contact during this conversation. Let me remind you that one guy is taking a sh!t during this conversation. I so f*cking hope the guy washed his hands."}
{"text":"I live in So Cal. And my wife and I regularly visit the Pho So 1 by our house in Van Nuys. Best Pho around in my opinion!"}
{"text":"it was your standard issue pho...i got the beef ribs pho and i added a crap load of schiracha (sorry i cant spell) and jalepenos and basil...it was decent but seeing how im from california and i get pho from westminster (read- little saigon) ive had better...but when im in vegas and i reaaaaaaaaaaaalllllllllllllllly want pho i have a place to go....now (i didnt want to end the review in a rhyme!)"}
{"text":"I tried this place twice, Both times, I didn't get seated right away I had to hunt someone down for a table. I was over in Vegas for a week. First time I got Fried noodles with veggies, it was quite the portion. I felt like by the time I was full, My plate was still.  The Soybean drink I got tasted like pineapple which was weird. Lol. 
Second time I went there, I ordered Hot pot, it was pretty good. My coco Cola tasted like windex though.. but overall I would come back."}
{"text":"First and last time here. My family and I were seated  on a sticky table and chairs are dirty. There was 4 of us but only 3 glass was given. We all ordered pho; broth had no taste. I added ingredients and paste... still had a hard time finishing my bowl. The server visited our table one time just to fill water. Also, we ordered fries for my daughter, they had to squeezed the ketchup bottle just get some out. My husband paid at the counter and they ask for tip. It was such a worst experience ever. I gave 2 star because at least the young lady server was nice but that was about it."}
{"text":"I used to come here very regularly, but it's been a minute since I've been back to Pho So 1 and I have to say they have remained consistent. The food wasn't as good as I remembered but it was still really solid and service was on par. We were served quickly and our server was friendly.

I haven't tried their pho recently but the vermicelli bowl was good and had lots of fresh veggies, which made it all the better."}
{"text":"Horrible service and rude lady didn't want to split my check  because she was simply \"too busy\" to do so. She told me that it was a small bill anyway and to figure it out. They may get a lot of business, but sure enough, horrible service will drive their clientele away. I'm sure they'll be closing their doors soon."}
{"text":"We waited for 30min with no menu and no water. I understand they are understaff at the moment but at least welcome every guest that comes in."}
{"text":"I came here because there was a wait at another pho place down the street. I ordered pho and the broth was good. It did not leave me quenching for water after so that's a good sign. They gave me a heaping amount of meat in my order! And I asked for 2 plates of onions and they happily obliged. 

Lots of meat & onions = winner for me. I will be back if I want pho next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"I kid you not, we came here 3 days in a row straight for lunch! Yes, it's that good, consistently good. They have an extensive menu with many Vietnamese dishes that you can think of even though it's called Pho So 1. They have pho, hieu tieu (which was the crowd favorite), grilled plate, bun bo, rice and vermicelli noodle dishes, etc. Many of us ordered the pho but I thought the broth was a little off for me. I do like the bun bo though, lots of flavor. The girls who ordered the nem nuong or grilled beef, it came out on a huge platter! Prices are fair too. Complete your meal with a ca phe sua da phin (french ice coffee with condensed milk) like I did on all three days!"}
{"text":"Dont eat here its nasty and they recycle their food.. The only good thing about this restaurant is its damn cheap hhahaha if you are cheap and want cheap quality of food then you eat here you cheap ass hahahah"}
{"text":"Food was ok.  Their pho is good but served in plastic bowl, what a turn off.  Their shaking beef was dry and no taste.  It was a busy night but there should be no excuses, here.  They have some hispanic server who only know what being taught to them about the Vietnamese language and English.  There was a language barrier that I feel for the guests there with these hispanic servers in a Vietnamese restaurant.  I was charged a gratuity of 15% with 5 guests or more.  The lady cashier didn't want to give me the receipt for some reason, doubt!  She gave me short in change and didn't care to handle the transaction.  If I knew I would not put extra tips on the table.  The server was a nice guy with so much to do.  Free iced tea refill but he never came back to check on us.  How can a restaurant with a least 120 guests dined in with only 2 true servers to handle!  I would not not here again to this Mom and Pop restaurant."}
{"text":"Service is fast here n the pho is good along w other dishes on the menu. Recommend pho, wraps, n the beef stew w bread."}
{"text":"I come here every time I visit and always get their spicy beef soup (bun bo hue). I haven't found a place that makes it as good as they do.  Portion is huge so I recommend sharing and they put tons of authentic meats in there which you never see anywhere else. Absolutely delicious!! They renovated since I was there last and it has a great modern and clean look. Great service as well. We will be back!"}
{"text":"the pho is awesome here thats probably why its so packed!! they also have little grills for you to grill meats with certain orders i think but never the less it tastes so good! one of the waiters here are especially attentive to your needs and always gets you what you need right away!!"}
