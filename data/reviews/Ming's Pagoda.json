{"text":"Went here last night with a friend...OH MY GOD!
I moved out here from Jersey when I was 11 and this is the best Chinese Food I've had in 14 years!  This food struck home for me from the first bite! I was a little kid again, sitting on a telephone book for sunday dinner
We ordered the pork fried rice, sweet and sour soup, wonton soup, and (goodness it bugs me not to remember the name) a spicy dish with zuchinni, chicken, shrimp, water chestnuts, and peanuts.
For drinks we ordered two iced teas. These were not you Lipton powder variety either! These were a delicious slightly earthy Oolong that complemented our dishes very nicely.
The service was fantastic, attentive without hovering. Our waitress guided us through the menu patiently and, had my budget allowed for it, I'd have ordered all of her suggestions they all sounded so good! I was torn between the soups and the pork eggrolls for my appetizer and wound up ordering the wonton soup(divine!) and a little while later we were treated to a pair of eggrolls on the house!

This place is wonderful, Totally recomend it.

GO. THERE!"}
{"text":"Not really a big fan of this place.  Egg rolls are bland.  No one at the table cared for them.  Entre was Luke warm when served.  Place smelled musty when we first came in.  Service was good however.   All in all I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"Can't possibly rave about how wonderful this place is! I've been coming here with my family since it opened 15+ yrs ago and I still haven't found a reason to complain. Everything keeps me coming back for more, from their affordable prices, family friendly atmosphere, attentive service and ABOVE ALL, their ridiculously generous portions! My husband and I will never stop ordering the combination dinner #4 (for ~$8, you get pork fried rice, mongolian beef and bbq sliced pork). Also recommended are the orange chicken, sesame chicken and beef with broccoli. Trust me, few other places will leave you more satisfied for the prices you'll be paying ;-)"}
{"text":"this restaurant is small, not fancy, and good quality. they have a separate bar with cheap drinks. the food is very good. they give you a ton of food and the prices are cheaper then other places. i can't eat rice due to medical reasons, and this is the only place i know of that i can order a large meal at a chinese restaurant and there's no rice automatcially mixed into it. my particular meal is a large meal of vegetables and different meats. only $8. it's enough for 2 people. all the meals come with rice but its served on it's own plate, so if you're not a rice lover, it's really a good way to go. the service is good and it's a super extensive menu. good all around place."}
{"text":"We ordered egg rolls, their specialty fried rice, three separate meals including beef and broccoli, cashew chicken, and Mongolian beef. None of it was edible. This has to be our worst Asian food experience ever."}
{"text":"Mings is awesome. We order out from there at least once a month. The portions are huge and I haven't ordered anything I haven't liked yet. The wontons are a miss but I never order them they just give them to me free since I order more than the $25 required to get the free order. 

There has been a couple times that I think they had a different cook. Reason being was my order was over cooked a few times. They always say it will be an hour to deliver and we get our food fairly quick usually 30 min. 

The website has improved but is still lacking. They don't have all the options on there when choosing a family meal as they do when you call. Hopefully they will improve that part of the website. Now a days most people use websites to order food so if the site isn't great that is a negative."}
{"text":"I loved this place the first couple times we went. However, the last and only time we went I ordered the calamari. It came in a big heaping portion as they usually serve but I noticed a black spot so I leaned in and sure as heck, there was a dead roach on my food. Needless to say we will never go back. How disgusting!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery from them for the first time. Surprise! the entrees come not in those little cardboard containers most Chinese restaurants use, but in medium- sized clamshells. Wow! What huge portions! I ordered the brocolli beef, crystal shrimp, chicken fried rice, and a large wor wonton soup and 2 liters of soda and my total came to under $34, The food was quite good; the brocolli was cooked to perfection, the beef tender and flavorful, and the chicken was shredded in big hunks versus being cubed like most places. The shrimp was tender and quite good. The wor wonton soup was OK, but the snow peas were disappointingly mushy-- probably a casualty of the hot soup.
I'd say this much food would easily feed a family of four and the menu has a lot of other dishes I can't wait to try. Give these folks a shot, you'll be glad you did!"}
{"text":"Ming's has been there for roughly 20 years...and now I remember why. The food was delicious. I ordered 2 separate meals (lo mein and mongolian beef) expecting to eat one the next day, but there wasn't enough left; I couldn't stop eating. Delivery took 50 minutes but the polite lady who answered the phone let me know it would take that long and it was absolutely worth waiting for."}
{"text":"To whom it may concern, 

Your establishment was recommended to me by Yelp, and I was anticipating a delicious lunch today. However, my experience fell short of what your reviews seemed to suggest. 

I decided to order your Kung Pao Shrimp lunch special. Believe me, I have been to quite a few Chinese food establishments, and I've had a really good history of being served some exquisite Kung Pao Shrimp. Anyway, the wait time for my lunch was excellent. I was quoted a wait time of 15 minutes, and received my lunch within 10 minutes. So far, so good. When I opened up the Styrofoam container I was greeted with the lovely sight of fried rice, and of course the Kung Pao shrimp itself.

However, when I began eating, I noticed that there were only 3 shrimp. Confused, I sifted through the excessive amount of peanuts and celery. To my dismay, I didn't find anymore.

It appears that the full 15 minutes should have been utilized to prepare, cook, and include the appropriate amount of shrimp in a lunch entree, which to industry standards, is about 8-10 shrimp.

Please take this into consideration as to not disappoint your future (and maybe even present) customers."}
{"text":"I used to like eating lunch here until the day 2 cockroaches crawled on me. In the middle of the day. It was months ago and I still feel a chill down my spine when I drive by."}
{"text":"Don't waste your hard earned money. Bad or rotten food gives you trips to the john."}
{"text":"Good above average food, quick and they have good prices and a nice delivery service."}
{"text":"Just tried this restaurant for the first time! The food was delivered quickly and it was perfect. I ordered for one but I could have fed 3 with the portions. Great flavor and great customer service from the order taker to the delivery driver."}
{"text":"I ordered chicken curry, NOT GREEN PEPPER CURRY!!

BIG disappointment when I got my styro home.
The chicken bits were small and not very plentiful.
I had to SEARCH for them among the LOADS of green pepper chunks.

This was like finding your burrito was stuffed with lettuce or your sushi double riced.

I WAS ANGRY.

I doubt I will ever be back, since weekday lunch isn't possible and that's probably the only good deal to be had.
I should've checked my styro while I was still in the parking lot in my car.

Review downgraded to ONE STAR for the possibly illegal Chinese gal with glasses who struggled with the calculator.

OH YEAH and my 80-year-old German mother makes better chicken curry!!"}
{"text":"Best Chinese style food I've had since I moved to Phoenix from the east coast. I've tried a couple of places but they were always disappointing. This is a menu I will for sure be keeping!! The egg foo young my boyfriend order was great, and the dinner combinations are huge! This place is a great choice"}
{"text":"I was being my usual indecisive self about what to have for dinner last night, when the girlfriend frusteratedly pulled in to Ming's. I have seen this place at the foot of Shaw Butte Mountain many times but never eaten there and I am glad that we did!

We were greeted possibly more enthusiastically than I have ever been greeted at the door. This was one friendly server and must have had something to do with management or ownership to be that excited to be there. He was indeed our server as well and the enthusiasm and friendliness lasted the whole meal.

The food had flavor. Not an overall mushy Chinese dish whatever flavor either. Each piece of each dish was individually flavored yet well tied. The tiny little corn on the cobs tasted like corn, the pea pods like pea pods and Jesus H. the shrimp tasted like shrimp, not the thawed shrimp textured blandness that you often get from an inexpensive meal.

We each had soup and an eggroll then shared pork fried rice and two other dishes which were all delicious and totalled less than $30 dollars. amazing prices.

The only down side really was the scallops. they were a little chewy, but hell they were $7!

The decor is average chinese food place but there is a seperate bar attached which we did not get a chance to check out but may be in the near future."}
{"text":"This is a great little hole in the wall place.  I've been there about 6 times and the worst meal was average or above and the best has rivaled the best American Chinese I've ever had.  Every meal has been well worth the money.  Ignore the cocktail happy hour signs, there is no liquor license.  They have the normal inability to make their spicy dishes actually spicy and the egg rolls are average.  Apparently delivery is a great deal of their business, but they don't deliver to my address :(.  The front of the house staff hasn't changed in a year (a good sign I think).  

Ming's Pagoda has become destination dining for me and should be on your list.  I look forward to my trips near Camelback and 19th Ave."}
{"text":"I have to give only 2 stars because the fried rice that came with the meal tasted stale, blah and the egg rolls filling was pink (I've never seen that before in an egg roll). I'm sorry but, I love my rice and if something as Simple as rice is not good at a Chinese restaurant (a main staple) then it makes me think twice about returning. I liked the lemon chicken but, again it was not the freshest and the lemon sauce was more like a syrup. I do have to note I received my meal via delivery that may have had an impact on the quality. I don't think I would give them another chance."}
{"text":"Don't let the run down building/neighborhood phase you.  Overall, the food is really good!  Each time I've been here, I've had the Ming Family dinner & be prepared...it is A LOT of food!  It easily serves my entire family of 4 with plenty of left overs. for lunch the next day.  The Sizzling Rice is fun & tasty, as is the Pu Pu Platter.  My son LOVED the Tangerine Chicken (not so spicy, as requested)!  I enjoyed the Pork Fried Rice and so did my daughter.  My husband's favorite is the Mongolian Beef.  For us, there's something for everyone!!  I almost forgot...the service was top notch as well. 
I guess the only thing I'm not a fan of is the beef.  Although my husband likes it, I thought it was a bit chewy & gristley (I know...it's not a word)! Give this place a try.  It's better than most of the other Chinese joints in the area."}
{"text":"Seriously, this food was delivered hot, fresh and tasty to our hotel! The House lo mein is delicious, plenty of tender beef, chicken and shrimp! The Orange chicken is round balls of fluffy fried goodness packed with insane orange flavor and a little orange zest to brighten it up!  The crab puffs are sweet and amazing! And all 3 dishes only 27.00 with delivery fee! What! Oh yeah I said it! And the delivery guy was prompt and friendly! I don't know anything about the actual building it came from, but for fast, fresh, delicious delivery, this is a must try! Eat and live well! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give them no stars. The second time I ate here, I found hair in my food.  After I told management they seem to not care or comp that part of my meal.... After a while we decided to try to eat here again, sadly I shouldn't have done that.  My third visit was cut short because yet again, I found another unwanted hair.  Last time I would ever set foot in that building.  Disgusting.  Beyond disgusting!!"}
{"text":"You walk in the front doorway and it smells like someone urinated there, every time I've walked in, not just once. Tables are sticky, it's dark, floor is disgustingly dirty, look up at the air vents and you'll wish you hadn't. The picture I posted is the stuff on the table, dirty sticky and unfilled. Not like they're busy and don't have time to clean things. It's just creepy in this place. 
The positive thing is their lunch special is cheap and good. Portion size is decent. You just can't think about what the kitchen or the cleanliness of anything including the cook and food prep area is like behind the kitchen door. I'm surprised health department hasn't made any issues about this place. 
But like I said, cheap Chinese, that's why I went."}
{"text":"Although I have yelped Mings Pagoda several times over the past few years for whatever reason I've never been able to find a single review. Considering that in the 3 years we've lived in the area we have never seen a single person at Mings I wasn't about to order with a recommendation'... didn't even know how they were still in business. 

After perusing the following reviews we went with the egg rolls, wontons, Broccoli and Beef, veggie fried rice, and terryaki chicken. As a former New Yorker who has never actually visited china I can tell you that our meal was the best Chinese food I've eaten since moving here 11 years ago!!! As mentioned below each portion is an ENTIRE clam shell of meal! I should also disclose that I was super hungry so everything probably tasted better, right? 

Egg rolls were good, nothing special but then again not gross which may sound odd but you probably know what Im talking about. Wrapper was crisp and not at all soggy. Stuffing was exactly what you would expect. Would order again! 

Wontons...so so. Just basically fried puffers but that's kind of what I was expecting. Nothing special, wouldn't order again. They had something on the menu called crab angel somethings? Might have to try those next time. 

Terryaki chicken......AMAZINGLY DELICIOUS! Ok so maybe not enough to rock your world (off its axis) but very tasty ala panda express Mongolian chicken without the weird fatty bits in between chunks. All white meat and delicious. 

Beef with Broccoli's! The flavor was spot on, the broccoli may have been slightly over cooked but I might just like broccoli crisp. It wasn't limp and my boyfriend seemed to enjoy it! The meat was tender and sliced thin which is what I prefer in my beef and broccoli :) 

Veg fried rice was superb. I was expecting frozen veggie style mini chunks but the vegetables were actually whole vegetables! Zucchini, corn, carrots, it was really great! I added a little soy and easily called the fried rice the best part of the meal! 

+ Of course, white rice which did not disappoint. 

$26!!!!!   $26 dollars delivered!!!!!  

The only thing I was 'bummed' about was the 'duck sauce'. My boyfriend calls it sweet and sour? I miss east coast duck sauce :( I'm so excited to have found an alternative to fast food style americano chinese food!!!!! I'm never stepping into pai wai or its more expensive big brother ever again"}
{"text":"Great food/great price/fast friendly take out.
We use this family restaurant for those times we want a quick/good meal.
We really enjoy being able to order and pick up very reasonably priced food...and quickly!
The ladies there are always super friendly and they make you feel like this is \"your\" family restaurant.  
Is it the most flashy place?  No. But all of us who live near there aren't looking for flashy. We just want good food!  Ming's delivers as well!!"}
{"text":"The sign for $2.99 teriyaki bowls lured us in. The prospect of egg drop soup sounded even more tasty, so I ordered that with the teriyaki bowl. The lemonade was really gross, so I ordered a soda instead. I think there's something weird going on with their soda dispenser. 

The egg drop soup was so good, with a heaping portion of crunchy wontons. My friend's orange chicken was spicy and tasty. The waitress was attentive. Pretty good for pretty cheap. Conveniently across the street from the post office, I'm pretty sure I'll go again."}
{"text":"This place was open on Christmas, so I went there due to hunger. I ordered the west lake soup. It was so bad I couldn't eat it. I ordered a seafood platter, very little sauce, and not nearly enough rice. There was hardly any one in there. And I sat with nothing to drink for a good portion of my meal. ..I won't be back. But I was glad to get something to eat at christmas."}
{"text":"Great egg foo young, Szechwan pork, and orange chicken. Large portions with each entree. Makes for good group or family dinners."}
{"text":"Great food but beware of ordering for delivery. We love their food and have always had it delivered. But our last experience with them has turned me off completely. We spent $50 and tipped well, when I realized that they forgot our sweet and sour sauce and wraps for the moo shu pork I called, the lady on the phone apologized and said she'd have someone bring it. By the time he got there we realized our soup was missing too.i figured I'd let him know and we'd go from there. When the delivery guy got to my house he rang the door bell then proceeded to bang on my door while yelling at me to hurry up. I had to put down my new born baby first. I let him know that they forgot the soup and joked that maybe they just forgot a whole bag. He snapped at me and said no several times. He said he'd call his manager and have them call me. I never heard back from them. By then we were done eating and it was time to get the kids ready for bed so I didn't bother. We were loyal customers and always spent at least $40 there. But after that they have lost our business. I doubt that they'd make it right, because the delivery guy treated me like I was trying to rip them off. That's right I'm going to give them $50 plus tip then try to take them for $3 worth of soup. I expected more since we have been loyal customers for years now. Next time I'll go somewhere else, there's plenty of places that deliver in my area."}
{"text":"Food is amazing and super fast. 
The staff is friendly I  absolutely recommend this place"}
{"text":"After not visting this place for as while, my family and I vistited Ming's (a long time favorite of ours) only to find it under new management. I have to say as good as Ming's was previously this new cook and staff has only made it better. We had Kung Pao Beef, Seseme Chicken and Fried Rice...each were absolutely delicious, surpassing the same meals at this establishment previously. The staff was friendly and attentive (not that that was ever an issue here). I did notice their taven was closed. If you've been before and liked it, I suggest go again and LOVE it."}
{"text":"When craving Americanized Chinese food, we go here.  My husband gets the orange chicken for himself, my kids love their beef tofu soup, I opt for the stir fried veggies with tofu."}
{"text":"While the service was very good the food quality was underwhelming.  Menu options are mainly heavily fried which really makes the experience a not so pleasant one.  Prices are about the same as competitors in the area which I may add gives the feeling of being in the hood.  Overall I'd say there are many better options in the surrounding area."}
{"text":"i ordered delivery here for the 1st time thru the website. i'm chinese-american and from boston, so i have VERY high standards w/ my chinese food, and every place does it differently.. so i got the pot stickers (a staple for me), house fried rice, and chicken lo mein. the pot stickers were more steamed than anything and didn't make me spit it out but i've had better for sure elsewhere.. i really miss my boston pot stickers/dumplings! the chicken lo mein was alright, and it was nice they didn't have a lot of the extras that i take out when i eat this anyways (the greens and stuff). the house fried rice isn't the best tho and didn't really have a lot of meat variety in it like i thought it would... also, the way they do chicken is odd! i'm not used to that. it's like chicken bits/crumbs fried in a fryer or something.. i'm used to chunks of chicken breast..... so i'd just like these lil things changed if possible and then i'd be fine w/ ordering from here again if i needed to :)"}
{"text":"I WILL NEVER, EVER, EVER EVER EVER eat from this place again! Very disappointed with not only my food, but with the customer service. The lady was very rude and even dropped a \"whatever\" to me over the phone when I called and said I was missing an item from my order. Eventually, a new delivery guy can and gave me that item.  I was so over this place I just gave it to a homeless man.

My food had a weird smell and taste.. So, with that and with the customer service, I will definitely not be ordering from here. Hopefully the change a few things around. 
As to the owner: Good luck with your business."}
{"text":"This place serves huge portions for a small price! We always get it delivered and we get the best service! Their fried rice is amazing as well as their egg rolls and sweet and sour pork. One entree will feed 2, easily!"}
{"text":"The portion sizes ARE big, BUT the meat included (whether shrimp, pork, beef or chicken) will be MINIMAL.  So all their fried rice dishes are mostly rice and very little meat or fish.

Also, the fried rice is very dark brown and not very appealing.

The beef & broccoli was almost ALL broccoli, and the beef was slimy and thin.

The eggroll tasted very strange - I couldn't put my finger on what that flavor was.

The Sweet & Sour chicken was very overly breaded.  The breaded chicken came separate from the sauce, which I think someone here referred to as \"radioactive\" probably because of the unnatural bright red color.  The sauce was overly sweet.  So if you like sweet sauce full of Red Dye poured over bread, go for it.

Everything that had been fried in oil tasted like the oil was very OLD.  Usually when ordering Chinese food to go, you smell good smells in your car as you drive home.  The smell of their food was not very good - it smelled like heavy, old oil.

The place had old furnishings.  The cleanliness was \"okay,\" but the air vents in the ceiling had visible dirt around the ceiling paint.  One of the waitresses was getting ready for the dinner crowd by SWEEPING the carpet...

The hot tea I drank while waiting for my order (short wait) was good.  

WHY IS IT SO HARD TO FIND GOOD CHINESE FOOD IN PHOENIX!?"}
{"text":"Yep, I'm yelping Ming's Pagoda. 

A favorite for my circle of friends for years, Ming's never disappoints. Food so fast, you'd expect a shy on quality, but it never happens! The staff is always polite and attentive and the food is sooooo goooddd.

The value is huge too! The prices are very reasonable. I don't want to use the word cheap since there isn't anything lacking in service or taste. 

Always helps to have someone who can order off of the \"special\" menu, too.

AWESOME for groups~"}
{"text":"Wanted to like this place since it's just a couple blocks from home. Deserves two stars for over-the-top, stellar service and the fact that the egg rolls, won ton soup, and Mongolian beef were VERY delicious. 
I recommend avoiding anything with chicken as it lacked flavor. The breading is not crispy and the chicken is dry. Fried rice lacked flavor and did not taste fresh either. We probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"I enjoy there Mongolian beef with the house fried rice. The portions are more then fair. I also love there hot and sour soup.  Not to expensive and I suggest you give them a try."}
{"text":"Good food and great deal. The portion size is huge and its not expensive at all. I was pleasantly surprised (especially in this particular neighborhood!) Great Chinese place!"}
{"text":"i came here because my car was getting worked on nearby and the staff recommended this place while they fixed my vehicle. the atmosphere was ok. the place could use a little update. you can tell its been there for awhile. i ordered the eggrolls and chicken fried rice. it was good and filling! i would come back here if im in the neighborhood again!"}
{"text":"Disappointing.

 Im going to start my review of Ming's Pagoda on a positive note.  The service at Ming's Pagoda was quick and the staff  was accomdating,  the food however was not good. 

The egg drop soup was thick and lacked flavor and the wontons were stale and challenging to chew. On my first visit to Ming's Pagoda I had the lemon chicken. The lemon chicken was very disaponting. The coating was crunchy but the chicken was dry, not moist at all, and there was just to much lemon sauce placed over the chicken.

My lunch companion had the chicken lo mein.  The noodles were somewhat greasy and once again the chicken was dry. The fried rice, eggrolls, and fried wontons were equally disappointing.

Not the best restaurant experience."}
{"text":"Did not eat at restaurant ordered delivery they said 50 min arrived 40 min everything was hot we ordered the 4 person food more like 5 or 6 person meal egg drop soup wonderful. chicken and pork sweat and sour comes with souce on the side. The broccoli beef and compo chicken. Also comes with wongton and eggrolls. Everything delivered 46.00 very friendly. My wife loved everything but the wondering was a little dry / hard. Then that very good."}
{"text":"I've been coming to Mings for a few years now and its the best Chinese I've had in Phoenix. The portions are big, the prices are cheap, the flavors are great, and the service has always been fast and friendly. I especially love the lunch specials that come with an entree, soup, egg roll and fried rice all for around $5. I highly recommend the Kung Pao beef and the crab angels are the best I've had."}
{"text":"Had delivery this weekend. The fried rice was cooked in old oil. Disappointed it's usually great. Sesame Chicken, Beef and snow peas consistent. Delivery was fast, food was hot."}
{"text":"Since we've moved to this area we've ordered from the Ming's Pagoda twice. The food is always hot fresh and delicious! I won't even order from anywhere else. Some of the best Chinese food I've found!"}
{"text":"Throw Back Alert

This place has been a N Phx icon if you will for 20 years. The decor reflects that too. 

The service and the food kicked ass. 

We had a Poo Poo platter, where they still have the flaming pot to cook the beef skewers, along with the normal items.

We had a terriaki chicken plate and an orange chicken plate. Both were really good. I preferred the Orange. 

We had a ton of left over... order to share as the portions are HUGE. 

The price is right too...bob~"}
{"text":"I love \"Old School\" Chinese/American Joints... and Mings is one of the last of it's kind... This type of Food should have it's own category, and does in my book, so having said this I can tell ya Ming's IS a 4.5... When I was a kid this was the only type of Chinese Cuisine available... I will miss this Joint when it,s gone..!"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service. The good is fantastic!  I'm torn between 3 and 4 stars because the food is fantastic. Portions are good, prices are excellent. I love their meal deals. 
Now the reason I am torn. The restaurant atmosphere is not that great. It's like they only have a swamp cooler. It's hot and sticky. 
Go for delivery!"}
{"text":"I ordered from this place January 16, 2018.  I paid with 2 $5bills and the lady refused to take my money and wanted me to get different $5bills.   Even after she ran the counterfeit pen across them and the ink came back yellow.  I found this ludicrous and refused.  I got my money back and went elsewhere.  I am sick of the lack of customer service in these times.  If I were you.   Go somewhere else.  Mr. Wong's is at Peoria and 19th Avenue."}
{"text":"I have passed by countless times over the years, never stopping in because I thought it was more of a bar/lounge type of place from the outside. Finally stopped in for lunch and it was great.  The hostess/server is super friendly and attentive,  the food was NY style Chinese and delicious. The food came fast and hot.  The prices are super reasonable. It reminds me of some of the little places in NY Chinatown.  Clean. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a place based on price, look no further. I was there and got the lunch special for $5.50. You get an incredible amount of food for the price- soup, your choice of meat, fried rice, egg roll, and two fried wontons. The egg drop soup was my favorite part of the meal. Was not the best Asian food I have had, but you cannot beat the price."}
{"text":"I drive all the to this location miles from my home just for Chinese food done right. The food here is fresh and authentic. I truly love the friendly service and quality food. The best deal for your money are the daily lunch specials!!!"}
{"text":"Epic disappointment. $50 purchase and we would have been better off with fast food. 

The Orange Chicken is close to flavorless and worse, the breading is somehow both stale and soggy (worst I've ever had - not even a HINT of vinegar, crushed red pepper, garlic or ginger). 

The Moo Shu Pork is also devoid of flavor and the pancakes that come with are thick, dry, and stale. 

Ordered the Pao Chow Beef EXTRA spicy - it was not even mildly spicy. The beef was riddled with fat and the opposite of crispy. 

The pot stickers were soggy with thick fleshy wrappers... innards were almost flavorless. 

Honestly even frozen dinner Chinese food is better than this. Never again."}
{"text":"Have to judge on what I ordered...Shrimp Fried Rice... It was pretty d*^m good.   We ordered SFR with the extra shrimp & I was impressed with the amount of shrimp & the size of the order.  & they use real shrimp... not those fake baby shrimp."}
{"text":"I've never had such bad Chinese food ever. I've eaten Chinese food in an airport and at a mall food court that was much better! Even Safeway's Chinese is more edible! We got the #1 (sweet and sour pork, egg roll, and pork fried rice) and the #3 (house special chicken, egg roll, chicken with veggies, fried rice). The egg rolls were terrible - my husband took a bite and SPIT IT OUT.  They had an odd minty taste. The house special chicken was strangely cut pieces of chicken with a spicy black pepper brown gravy sauce. They even managed to mess up the sweet and sour pork - very dry pieces of pork with a radioactive sauce. We had a buy one get one half off coupon that they didn't apply. The only thing good I can say is the portions were huge -- which made for a lot of wasted food. The only edible part was the fortune cookie - probably because they didnt make it! Never going back!"}
{"text":"Our usual Chinese takeout is closed for vacation so we gave Ming's a try. Food was so-so, not much on taste and flavor. Portions are huge but portions can't make up for lack of taste. Can't wait for my usual takeout place to open again."}
{"text":"So yummy!! The Egg Drop soup Was so fresh and so was the potstickers and seasame chicken. LOVE THIS PLACE."}
{"text":"Most filthiest Restraunt I've been in. Even as you drive up on the outside it needs fresh paint. Then when you go in just look at the inside and you will see it all. After the few years of going here I thought they would have cleaned and fix it up but nope.. I can only imagine what the back kitchen looks like where we do get the food from? I would hate to see it!! No thank you!!
Also I came in to order only 1 minute of lunch special but I was told No I could not have the lunch special! Goodbye Mings!!!"}
{"text":"I used to have decent food here several years ago, but it's gone way downhill. The atmosphere is lonely and sad and feels like it's dying a slow, painful death. The sweet and sour sauce was, as near as I can tell, comprised of 30% sugar, 30% corn starch and 40% red dye #8. The egg rolls were also inexplicably bright red inside! The food was not bad but not great; again, corn starch seems to be in good supply. I'd choose to go elsewhere if given the choice."}
{"text":"I remember walking here with my friend back when we were kids and I also remember how much I use to love it. Then I moved to Glendale and never came back...until recently! 

Upon arrival, it looked exactly the way I remembered it to. Big place, lots of seating, and almost empty...(nostalgic). Apparently, its more popular for pick up orders. Anyway...
We take a seat and I am screaming on the inside eager to order! I always get the same thing, the beef lo mein. My friend got the kung pao chicken and we got a plate of veggies to share. The lo mein was as delicious I remembered it to be and the veggies were crisp and tender. So good! The kung pao chicken was good too, it just needed some more sauce. The peanuts gave it a nice crunchy texture to it. The portions are huge and the prices are low. For being 110lbs, I eat a lot and I finished my entire plate..I think the waitress was surprised because I always get the \"where does it all go?\" look. Hey, it was delicious, what can I say!?

I can't believe its taken me over 12 years to come back here! Needless to say, I will be coming back for often! Definitely my favorite Chinese  restaurant...yes, better than PF Changs gross ass food.

P.S. Their lunch menu is great! $5.50 for lunch!? Yes, please."}
{"text":"Ordered pepper steak,  sweet & sour pork,  pork fried rice & egg rolls. Now I have to tell you that I have been ordering from this place for over 10 years and this time I was very disappointed.  The egg rolls were very greasy, and the pepper steak was tasteless. Even the fried rice was not up to standard. The only thing I can say is every time I order it is as if they have a different  cook.  I was really looking forward to having Chinese food and was so bummed out that the food was not their usual fare."}
{"text":"Rice is so so. It's a hit or miss but that sesame beef, omg that's good! Big potion sizes.. place is a bit ran down, so I recommend  take out or delivery."}
{"text":"Driven by here 1000 times and finally stopped in. Food was good and tasty (Pork & Veggie and Crispy Pork). Portions can definitely be split among two. Egg rolls were hot and crisp. There was only one other couple in the place but they seem to do a good amount of takeout. 

NOTE: THERE IS NO ALCOHOL - ignore the \"cocktail lounge\" sign out front."}
{"text":"Not the best, but it's good. Tried the curry chicken for the first time. Wasn't very hot as I thought. I recommend putting some sweet and sour, spicy mustard and red chilli on it... Turned out tasty."}
{"text":"I ate here last night and it was delicious! The service was great too, always made sure we had our drinks full and our food came out at perfect times! Tasted authentic and delicious!! Will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"Per 1st time Delivery/eating from here. After a long debate I gave this place a shot. I ordered on line, typical items. Wonton soup, egg roll, pot stickers,chicken fried rice and a beef broccoli. After submitting my order&payment the ETA was 40 minutes. We live about .5 miles away. 
Delivery took very close to an hour. Delivery guy was friendly, professional all that can be expected.
Egg rolls were tasty. Pot stickers flavorful. Wonton soup...broth was tasty, mushrooms and broccoli I had to take out and cut them up. The Wontons themselves I could not bare to eat... the filling in the dumplings were sour... as fermented cabbage, which I like....but just not the flavor for a wonton. I have never experienced this type of flavor for this dish. Im not a picky eater but for the first time I had to say no. Even my daughter couldn't deal with it. So No to the Wonton soup. Beef & broccoli was alright.. kind of bland but hey every place has the right to cook the way they like. The chicken fried rice was very good. Lots of flavor, not greasy. So take what you can from this review, given we've never dined in... but we will order the items we enjoyed in the future.  Bon appetit"}
{"text":"I love this place and order from here all the time! I love the owner and she is the sweetest thing ever. She remembers things about my family and always gives him the cookies he loves. Mings is old school and the atmosphere is very family friendly. I always get the shrimp lo mein and have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"I'm visiting from California and was craving good Chinese food. Based on reviews, I chose to try Ming's Pagoda (takeout) and I was extremely pleased. The portions are pretty big and of course, delicious. I'm obsessed with their hot sauce! I will make sure to eat at Ming's when I visit."}
{"text":"One of the best things working in this restaurant's favor is its location!  It's at 19th Ave and Cactus where there's several apartment complexes yet no nearby stores or eateries.  (One can only get food from Circle K so often, you know?)  So for sake of convenience alone, I've been quite a frequent customer!

But of course, that's not the only reason I eat here regularly - it's one of the best (non buffet style) Chinese restaurants around.  The main waitress is one of the friendliest in the Valley always greeting you with a big warm smile and just very polite and poised all around.  They have wonderful daily specials for $5.50 as well as other regular lunch specials and whether you're ordering one of them or a standard item from the menu, you get lots of value with very generous sized servings!  You won't leave hungry or unsatisfied!

My favorite dishes are their orange chicken and the poo poo platter.  Most of the time I order something for take out but every now and then I'll eat in.  Plus they deliver!

I'm very happy they're here.  They're definitely a bright spot of this intersection and hopefully they're here to stay."}
{"text":"AMAZING. A cute family owned restaurant with HUGE portions and great prices. They know us by name and we bring all our friends and family here when they visit. More American Chinese food than authentic, but top notch nonetheless; Lunch special is where it's at. My favorite items are the sesame chicken, sweet and sour chicken, and the orange chicken :)"}
{"text":"Dined here after work and ordered the Shrimp with Snow Peas & Mushrooms, Orange Chicken and a side order of Pork Fried Rice. The Shrimp dish was very colorful with plenty of snow peas in a dark gravy. It was very good & worth ordering again in the near future. The Orange Chicken dish was sweet, spicy and had chopped onions in it. Besides having a different color & taste, it was good and worth reordering. Now, the pork fried rice was nothing special. I've had it at other restaurants and found it to be more flavorful. Not here though. Tasty, but could use some peas & carrots in it. Besides that, my waitress was very attentive & even the cashier asked me how was the food. I recommend Ming's Pagoda and look forward to try something different on their new menu.
Till then, CHEERS!!"}
