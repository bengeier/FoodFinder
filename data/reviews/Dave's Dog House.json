{"text":"Pretty good hot dogs. I've been here a few times and the boston dog has a bit of a sweet and savory taste to it. The mac n cheese in the mac n cheese dog is very bland tasing though, I ended up scooping it off of my hot dog. The prices are pretty high too. The bread is definitely the best thing here.
They've also been closed at random times when they should've been open too... Out of the ten times I've tried to go here in the last month or so they were only open three times for some reason..."}
{"text":"I work in the area and always past by this place and decided to stop in with my boss.  All I can say is WOW, the hot dogs are so delicious, Butter toasted buns and the dogs come from Boston and the chili is so good, fries are ok, but the dogs is where it is at, but the only reason they didn't get 5 stars is because of the price, it can be expensive, expected to pay like $12 for a combo meal."}
{"text":"This play is my favorite food place on campus. It's buns are especially my favorite and the staff are super helpful. I would eat everyday if I could."}
{"text":"Back during my Freshman year I would come here late at night for a great late night snack. Dave's was in walking distance to my dorm, and after a few minute walk, I began to smell something good. That's the smell of freshly grilled hot dogs! My favorite was the #2 (2 boston dogs, fries, and a drink) or the #6 (3 sliders and fries). The hotdogs come on a fresh toasted bun, and they are cooked to perfection. The french fries are delicious, with the right amount of salt and being golden brown to make the perfect late night french fry. My favorite thing on the menu were the sliders. They were delicious. You would expect to see manufactured patties straight from the freezer, but these are fresh ground and appeared to be hand formed. 

If you want a great lunch, dinner, and an amazing late night snack, Dave's is where it's at."}
{"text":"The purpose of this is to respond to DRAKE S's  comments. ASSUMING you are really a legitimate customer, and not an employee that got recently fired --then, I am very sorry to hear that you got this impression on your visit.  I really am not sure when you came in  and what the circumstances were; but I assure you that this is not the case.  The Dog House crew, as I can speak for all of them, are apparently happy to be where they work.  I am not sure why you can be so definitive about your comments, since we have employees that keep on coming back to work for us for years.  Previous employees even come back to help out or even just to visit.
Finally, we have implemented the \"ticket policy\" to ensure that the customers are being given their orders accurately."}
{"text":"Dave's DogHouse is one of the best hotdog places I've been to. This place is perfect for people with big appetites; the serving size is just right--you're not too full or still hungry and it's absolutely delicious. The service is fast, the staff is awesome, and the atmosphere is inviting. It's definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"One of the best places on campus for lunch. The sliders are great, I think they grill the patty with mustard, which gives it a lot of flavor. The hotdogs are consistently good, and the fries aren't bad either. I don't visit a lot of hotdog places, so I'm not sure if this is unique to the Doghouse, but I love that they grill the buns with butter, which is something I've never seen before.

The only things I can say weren't up to par were the seadog, which I found to be very fried without containing much fish, and the chicken sliders, which were just kind of bland.

If you go during off times you can get your food quickly, but it can take ages during lunch when a huge line forms out the door."}
{"text":"If you're not a hot dog lover you need to try this place before you rule out all hot dogs. This place will have you craving a hot dog all the time now. 2nd visit 8n a week!"}
{"text":"The food is good, but the service blows. I have never ever ever bought a $9 meal and have had such terrible service. The manager looks like she hates being there and couldn't care less how happy you are when you leave. (Also, a tip jar for the manager is SO tacky) and the owner was there when I ate there and he just looked like he had no idea what he was even doing there. From the moment you walk in you can tell the employees hate being there. Probably cause they do, and everything about the place is just so poorly run. On a final note, please tell people to keep the receipt if it is such a big freaking deal. Probably never going there again. And I WILL tell people to not go there."}
{"text":"I used to frequent Dave's a few times a week. The owner is a retired accountant and the problem with his doghouse can probably be traced to his penny-pinching roots. Originally, I would have given this place 5-stars, there was a guy named Jorge that worked there all the time and ensured that the sliders, dogs, fries, whatever you order, was top-notch quality and cooked perfectly. Long story short, Old Dave the Accountant started pinching pennies and hiring teenagers and burnt out ex-janitor types and sure enough, the food quality and perfection started to go down hill. The few times that I've been back since, the fries have been burnt or soggy, the sliders overcooked and dry, and the service lacks any charm. 

Bottom line is, as great as the food can be here, there is no one that works there that cares enough to make sure that its great every time.

{"text":"I wanted to enjoy a Chili Dog from Daves last Saturday, so I drove there from my place in North Central Phoenix, they were closed no sign on the door or windows with hours. I then got home and checked on line and found they were only open Mon-Friday 10am to 12am (midnight) so I decide to drive there again on Wednesday for lunch as I entered the freeway decided to call to make sure they were open, NO ANSWER from Wednesday noon until Friday I tried at 11am, 12 noon, 2pm 4 pm 6pm. WHAT HAPPENED TO THEM, on Saturday they looked like they were doing business."}
{"text":"These people are high.  This place is very expensive(for hot dogs), you don't get a lot of food, and it's not very special.  Chuckbox sells dogs just down the way, and Ted's is in the same city.  Do yourself a favor and check the food out before you order."}
{"text":"This is nice little place right across from Arizona State University and they have really good hot dogs.  Their menu is pretty small, basically consisting of chili dog, Chicago dog, chicken wings, and chicken sandwich.  Their chili dogs are really good and the fries are better than your average fast food place.  They do deliver in a limited range.  They have 2 TVs (17\" inch ones) to watch the game.  They also have beer.  It's a tad expensive but not too bad.  Nice place to get lunch."}
{"text":"What has happened to Dave's? A favorite stop when on campus but today it was terrible, tables outside (the only place to sit) were discusting, bird crap all over. Employees making no attempt to clean even when there was no customers. Certainly unsanitary, probably against many health department regs. No supervision, really a disappointment for a place at ASU!"}
{"text":"Finished the devil dog challenge in less than 10 mins. Excellent place for hot dogs."}
{"text":"Pretty darn good dogs worth the price. I had a pulled pork BBQ dog with coleslaw and it was amazing it was around $5 but I also had a drink. It wasn't just a wiener and a bun with toppings. It was quality you can taste."}
{"text":"This is my favorite hot dog ever. I like to try multiple versions before I make my final decision.  This place will always have a special place in my heart. I liked to get the chilli cheese dog with nacho cheese. The bun is toasted and grilled with butter. It tastes like garlic bread and biscuits made a hot dog love child. They sell halal meat so if that is a concern that is also alleviated. If I get the chance I would jump at the chance to own a stand. I think it would make money anywhere you put it. Can't wait to go back to AZ to try this gem."}
{"text":"I was excited to go to this place... I hadn't been in a while and I got a coupon for a free dog! Sounds great, right? The coupon had no expiration date and I received it a month before. I got to the counter and they literally would not let me use it. What!? The woman was saying that the date in September ( the date it was when she gave it to me) had anything to do with when it supposedly expired.... Needless to say, I didn't stick around.
So disappointing....."}
{"text":"Oh em gee...
someone just dumped mac and cheese and BACON on top of one of my already favorite things to eat - a hot dog. 
This place is the most for a quick, simple bite. 
I will admit, I was defeated.
I got about 5/7 into this beast and could go no further. 
Challenge accepted. 
Soooo. very. good."}
{"text":"Mmmmmm.  Delicious.  Need I say more?  OK, then try the Mac 'n Cheese and Bacon Dog.  Mmmmm.  All freshly made on the best buns ever!"}
{"text":"I wish I could give this place 0 star rating, but unfortunately I don't have that option. After months of this place being on my list of places to try I finally had the chance today. First of all this place is buried so deep on campus it took forever to actually find it even after asking 3 officials. We had to pay 3$ for parking and after walking to its location we realized it was closed.. even though YELP showed it was open, google maps showed it was open, and google internet showed it was open. Wasted my time and my money for nothing. I will never even attempt to go to this place again. I'll stick with TED's!"}
{"text":"Just grabbed a hot dog from the cart on my way to class and it was surprisingly good! I've never had one on toast before and they used melted nacho cheese instead of a slice of cheese. I'm definitely going to stop by their cart more often  
*Pretty messy so you're not gonna look cute eating it, just saying."}
{"text":"I have been going here since my freshman year. It's 5 years later, and I made the drive from LA to have these delicious hot dogs again! I've never been disappointed with the food or the staff here. Maria is amazing! She gets to know her customers, and she cares. She's a big reason why I've come back time and time again. She makes the best grilled cheese sandwiches!"}
{"text":"Dave's Dog House is top notch and absolutely delicious! Been going there since I was a kid and they have only gotten better and better. Doggie style fries are TO DIE FOR! Hot dogs have that amazing snap when you bite into them and I could eat just their Texas bread buns  by themselves. Definitely a place to make a regular. And they are opening one at the Staples Center in LA Cali!!!"}
{"text":"Ok, first off you get 3 stars for knowing what a Chicago dog is. Plus they hooked it up for me! 

These ladies are serious about great dogs. Extra points for great sanitation practices and a clean environment. I'm talking even the grill top was clean and the fryer area (underneath and along the sides) were clean.  That takes effort.

OH, you probably want to know how the dog was...Excellent. The bread was a nice buttery Texas Toast that somehow stayed together. The Dog was flavorful, the reloush (I have no idea how to spell it) was spicy.  Best damn food on campus."}
{"text":"Hands down the best hotdogs in Phoenix. The Texas toast sets it apart and everything from their chili to their sliders is top notch. They also park a cart outside sun devil stadium before and after games! It's not a cheap meal but it's worth it!"}
{"text":"Grilled cheese made with garlic butter. That's all I have to say. God speed. 

Oh, and proper frito pie in the bag. The manager/owner is lovely and her staff are wonderful."}
{"text":"This place must have *just* opened after I graduated from ASU.  Pity.  On a recent visit to PHX, I spotted Dave's Dog House and was lured inside by the delicious aromas emanating from the tiny storefront.  The friendly lad behind the counter asked if it was my first time to the Dog House and, after I confirmed it was, he proceeded to give me his \"spiel\" (i.e., the low-down on the different dogs on the menu).  All of the hot dogs are kosher, except for the Polish dog.  I chose the Boston dog, which is simply garnished with mustard, relish, and onions, allowing the smoky sweet flavor to shine.  The friendly lad gave me a couple of sample sides for free, just for fun; I liked the baked beans, though I thought they could have a bit more spice, while I thought the chili could have used a wee bit more salt.  On my next visit, I think I'll try the Mac and Cheese dog, which, as one can guess, is a hot dog covered with macaroni and cheese (and bacon!)."}
{"text":"This place has really good hot dogs and AMAZING CHEESE FRIES! It's my go to greasy food because it's right on campus. Plus the workers are really nice and very helpful!"}
{"text":"I walk through this dog house nearly every day between my classes, but I finally have a chance to sit down and actually order something. The original hot dog bun and tons of side garnishes are larger than most of the dog places that I have been to. The combo of 3 mini burgers are also delicious with chopped bacon on top, but drink size is usually smaller. I like it, just not as much to give it 5 stars based on my personal reference."}
{"text":"Break out the antiacids - well worth the splurge of calories and disaster it will wreck on your tummy and diet. I don't think you can make a bad choice off the menu - they have mac and cheese on a hot dog for Pete's Sake! The bun - ah yes, the bun, smothered in butter then grilled. (Vegan's faint!) The perfect hang over food - sits on ASU campus off Forest Mall on the western side of Hayden Library. Even Dr. Crow loves it, so the rumor goes. You will definitely want a nap, Tums or lettuce after this, but it's sooooo worth it."}
{"text":"Place is fantastic with super friendly staff. Food is delicious. The macaroni dog is the best."}
{"text":"Dave's Dog House has one of the best grilled cheese sandwiches I've ever had out. If I'm going to be paying someone else to make a grilled cheese (something I consider extremely basic) for me, I expect it to be good, and Dave's certainly is that! It's my favorite place to snag some junk food on the Tempe campus."}
{"text":"Very convenient hot dog place on campus very get hotdogs chili dogs excellent the German dog is also excellent they have very bomb Frank and beans as well as side dishes such as chili cheese fries and the environment is great.  Also since most of the people who work there are affiliated with Arizona State University they are very nice and their service is above par."}
{"text":"I tried the chicken sliders, which are supposed to come with chicken, marinara sauce, and mozzarella cheese. Unfortunately, I was informed well after ordering and paying that there was no marinara sauce (the ole' bait and switch), so I was forced into having BBQ sauce instead. Nevertheless, the food was pretty good and had a nice grilled flavor. A nice touch was that the bun was grilled and the cheese was nice and melted. 

The cashiers are very friendly and nice. There are a ton of people working the grill, yet the output seems very slow. All vistors pay and get a number up front, then wait 5-10 minutes for their food. Considering that this is basically a stationary food truck, I would expect numbers being shouted and food flying out the door fast and hectic, rather than piles of customers standing around waiting for their orders to roll out one by one every few minutes. 

The prices are outrageous for what you get. It is reminiscent of a sports stadium or airport approach. The shop is knowingly overcharging, just because it has an audience due to its location right in the middle of a college campus. 

Although the food was reasonably good, the long wait, bait and switch, and high prices make me doubtful that I will return. There are too many better lunch options in the area."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for lunch as it is close to where we both work. 
The pros: people were nice. I ordered the most basic hot dog with french fries and it was good. 
The cons: quite slow service despite the fact that there were only few customers. Also don't be too picky with cleanness."}
{"text":"Dave's is legit. I was having a tough time finding a decent hot dog in the Valley, but then I found Dave's. And these dogs are more than decent; they're downright tasty. The dogs are all beef and flavorful in their own right; but they grill the buns too, which just pushes things to another level.

Tried their fries too. Liked 'em. They were crispy, but not greasy. Didn't even need ketchup.

Will I be back? Duh, this is now my favorite hot dog in the whole Valley!"}
{"text":"Amazing food!  Consistent, great customer service.  Congrats on the Staples Center location!"}
{"text":"This review is long over due. I remember when Dave's Dog House was a little off campus by Barney's boathouse. Then getting Dave's from their cart after long drunken nights on Mill and ASU Football games, which I don't really remember too well. Now being on Campus, they have found the perfect spot. The go to is the Boston Dog. I get mine with ketchup instead of mustard, just because of an incident a few years ago with Mustard, I will spare you the details. Try their specials they have rotating and get some tots while you're at it. This place has been and will always be one of my favorite places to eat at ASU."}
{"text":"Tomorrow I walk for my diploma and let me say...this place got me through the late nights in Architecture school.  Of course I changed majors, but when Ron and I had to stay up till 5am working on models and drawing this place was a lifesaver.  While they have a pricey menu, you have to take in account their outsourcing wieners!  I would say to eat what you get there, and don't chance the meal getting cold before you get to your destination.  Plus the restaurant in itself is great! On the walls there are funny little comics and newspaper clippings that give this place its true character.  This place definitely needs more than 10 reviews. Try this place ASAP cause you'll be sorry if you don't.  Then you too can be a witness to the deliciousness"}
{"text":"Some of the best hotdogs I' ve ever had!   The buns are heated on the griddle and come out buttery and crispy.  The hotdogs themselves are toasty on the outside and a whole lot of divine goodness on the inside.  My only complaint is that it takes a while to get your order, since the store is always packed.  Actually I would also like to see some indoor seating as well, but I doubt that it is possible due to the facilities. 


Bun:5
Hotdog: 5
Timeliess: 3
Facilities: 3"}
{"text":"Delicious food! Decent prices. Your only option for seating is outside so I wouldn't go on a hot day.  The food ispretty heavy in the best possible way, So don't over order (you will be satisfied with the portions)  and don't go expecting to get a light snack.  Great for a quick lunch on campus to keep you full for a while.  Plus they take M&G which is cool."}
{"text":"Brought a friend here when she was visiting from the East Coast--seemed appropriate. ;) Food was great and the service was even better. The french fries are oh so good."}
{"text":"For all of my high brow tastes, I am a self-proclaimed hot dog addict - I always have time for a hot dog competition that involves me and a line of the bun-swaddled treats.  You don't even have to slow me down with mustard - I'll take them any way they come.

Dave's Dog House is pretty excellent for a hot dog jones, and damn convenient for anyone at ASU.  The place churns out exceptional dogs with natural casings that pop when you bite into them, the way that pantheons of dog-dome (like Gray's Papaya and Nathan's for you NYCers).  Top that off with buttered and griddled buns and crisp fries and you are in for a treat.  I like the Boston Dog myself - just a bit of onions, mustard and relish to dress things up, but you can partake in chili or saurkraut as well and make it a party.

Dave is shy of the 5 star rating for me because they can be a little slow at times, and not due to large crowds per se, but due to organization.  It often seems like they're training new employees on the job and your order will take a good 5-10 minutes to come out even though only you and one other person are waiting there.  It can be trying if you are in a hurry, but not so bad that you should skip this place.  Also, their chili is a little strange - on a hot dog, it's one thing because there isn't too much.  But on, say, chili fries, you notice how the texture resembles paste.  I almost recommend that you don't sully your experience with the odd chili and just focus on the hot doggy goodness.

Also, if you are around after 4pm, the place has really good Happy Hour specials that rotate monthly, from $1 sliders (on griddled brioche, no less) to $1.75 corn dogs (fried to order).  Well worth the price if it's your first time at Dave's."}
{"text":"A true testament to \"everything's better with butter\", in my book, Dave's Dogs even beats the beloved Ted's Hotdogs. I know, I know. It's shocking, because Ted's is amazing. I know! But seriously, Dave's is better. The bun is amazing, so soft, yet buttery and crisp from the skillet. I loved the chili here too. Absolutely delicious. A+"}
{"text":"My boss is from Indiana near the Chicago side.  He sometimes gets me to eat hot dogs when we go out for lunch.  He prefers Ted's but I'd have to say this is my favorite place to sit down and devour a wiener.  Dave is a cool cat.  He's retired from the music industry, look for his gold record on the wall!  He has all kinds of funny signs up everywhere.  There are 2 TVs which are always tuned to sports channels, but not being a sports fan the appeal is lost on me.  They do always have some decent 70s rock and pop going which usually puts me in a good mood for dog consumption.

There are 2 kinds of dogs: Boston dogs and Chili dogs.    Boston dogs come dressed in mustard, onions and sweet relish.  Chili dogs come with onions, mustard and chili.  Ketchup is available over by the drinks.  Do yourself a favor and save it for the fries.  I've never seen it happen there, but I can just imagine someone putting ketchup all over their hot dog in this joint and instantly bursting into flames.  Oh well, that's what they get for not being a true believer. The dogs themselves are custom made back east according to Dave's secret recipe.  I don't give a shit what's in them, they're delicious.

The fries are decent, but nothing to write home about.  Everything else on the menu isn't worth mentioning.  It's not that it sucks, it's that the hot dogs are what makes this place.  So don't puss out.  Get a dog and enjoy it."}
{"text":"i'm no hot dog expert so bear with me.

i liked the boston & chili dog.  the meat was good & tasty.  the bun was grilled and buttered which also was goo.  the fries were better than average.

i love the free refills.  the place is small but clean.  the have a tv with sports on all the time.

i still need to try the doggie style fries, reuben, mac & cheese and onion rings.

the only time we go to this place is during the summer when not very students are on campus."}
{"text":"The food is not bad. The prices are reasonable but the staff here are paper tray nanzis. Had to carry a huge chili dog in a small paper holder. Basically everything fell out if it into my shirt. They won't give you an extra little 1 cent paper tray because it is against there policy."}
{"text":"I remember when this place was located on University but dont remember ever stopping in. If I had known what I was missing, I wouldve been there everyday!

Dave's is located on ASUs campus, south (about 4 blocks) of the Forest and University intersection. This is a very small place w/ limited seating. Luckily, this is a college campus so there is seating everywhere outside. Theyre open til 10 M-T and close at 7 on Fridays. They also deliver, though their delivery area isnt noted on their website.

Now for the good stuff: the dogs. I had perused the menu online before hand and man do they have some good stuff. My husband opted for the Mac & Chez dog (a campus fave). It cames covered in (what tasted like) Kraft mac and cheese and real bacon. He *throughly* enjoyed it. I believe his exact words were \"This is the picture of culinary perfection\". It did look ridiculous.

I opted for the Boston dog (mustard, onions, and relish). When it came I realized I had ordered wrong. I had been salivating over the pics of their Beantown dog (baked beans, mustard, and onions) online and mustve been flustered after my bad day. The lady who brought out my dog was a doll. She brought me a side of baked beans to put on my dog AND a sample of their chili. Made. My. Day. It was so delicious and messy, I want to go back right now! Their chili is awesome. Next time we go I need to remember to order a side of it. The actual dog was the perfect size and had just the right amount of snap.

And Dave's has THE best hot dog buns. Theyre New England style hot dog rolls (they look like a flatter version of a loaf of bread),  my fave! These really are the best rolls. Theyre easily toasted and hold the monsterous amount of toppings so so well. Not to mention theyre delicious.

If you have some time whil in Tempe, park on Univ. and Forest and verture on down to Dave's.

Be warned though, since their locations are exclusive to ASUs campus theyre closed during breaks and most of the summer. We found out the hard way so you dont have to! I grew up w/ these rolls."}
{"text":"I just stopped for a \"wurst\" and that's what I had. Plain and simple. Maybe I'm spoiled by Ted's... but this was just ok to calm the noon pangs. Being inside ASU campus, there are not many offers, so this is good for a change from what's available at MU."}
{"text":"Dave's rules! I have been enjoying these gourmet dogs since Dave opened his first dog house (2005?), in the now torn down east-most Arches. I always go for the Chili Dog, but have also tried the Boston Dog which the wife likes. The buns are buttered and then grilled, and even a simple side of fries are always fried just right. This is just a great place worth driving across town for. I am lucky though, as it's only a few blocks from me. Come enjoy!"}
{"text":"Before I went to Dave's Doghouse I was the kind of person who stuck my nose up at hot dogs. To me it was just backyard grilling food not worthy to pay a premium for. Then I finally went to Dave's. The hot dogs are down right delicious and the options are extraordinary. The thing that really brings these little guys together is that delicious roll that the dogs are put in. This place is probably my favorite place to eat on campus and I recommend it to everyone. Especially try the Barbecue Dog and the Mac 'n Cheese dog."}
{"text":"Probably one of the best hotdog places I've been to. I got the BBQ dog, the Reuben dog and the Mac and cheese dog and my buddy got the Boston dog and the Reuben. Neither of us care for the Reuben that much but either way the way that they make their hotdogs is fantastic. They use Texas toast hotdog buns buttered up and crispy and the dogs themselves are quality. They cut their fries fresh as well with salt garlic seasoning and what I think was Parmesan. Definitely a good hotdogs but wish they were open on the weekends though"}
{"text":"I've experienced better, much better. The prices are too high, the food is mediocre. I went here once when I had a coupon and I wouldn't go back. It smells bad inside, the food just wasn't good and I was just thoroughly disappointed with the experience."}
{"text":"Dave's dog house is amazing! Great places to go for lunch, not only is the good amazing, but it's on campus and makes you want to be back in college. I'd recommend the Mac n cheese dog with bacon, delicious!

Also, if it's your first check in they give you a boston dog for free!"}
{"text":"The beantown dog is my favorite. Idk what exactly they do to their buns,  but it's amazing.

This last time I visited I ordered a reuben dog and a corn dog. After paying and waiting a few minutes they told me they don't have them on the menu anymore. So I got the Mac and cheese dog. Even though it sounds great, its not very good. 

Also I assumed they made their own corn dogs, but it turns out they get them frozen. I could tell because when I bit into it, it was still frozen"}
{"text":"Kind of hard to find if you aren't from the area but definitely worth the struggle when you get there. I had the Mac and cheese dog. Top 3 best hot dog I've ever had! Best in AZ I've ever had! If you are close definitely stop and try it! 

They only have outdoor seating so it's a must to go on a warm day. They also have a frequent buyer card so if you get addicted you don't have to worry about it breaking the bank!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely legendary.  Best chili dogs on the planet -- amazing meaty dogs, toasted buttered bread bun, gloriously greasy chili.  Even the fries are perfect.

I have to take issue with another reviewer's claim that the other menu items aren't any good.  The sliders are almost appallingly greasy but taste like pure heaven.  Even the marinara chicken sandwich is delicious.

There's a fantastic backstory to this place, too.  Dave has somehow kept the Dog House open ever since the complex sold off to greedy hotel developers without making him a fair deal.  The entire strip is vacant now except for Dave's -- and thank God this place is still standing.

Ted's is nothing compared to this.  Dave's will change your life."}
{"text":"I stopped by the ASU location this morning as I hadn't eaten breakfast and was hella hungry. 

I was quickly greeted and ordered the breakfast sandwich with hash browns. I had to wait a little bit for it, but you can watch them make the food and could tell it was being made with love so I didn't mind. In hindsight I don't know if it was worth the $4.05 including tax, but at the time it was bombtastic. I texted my friend and told him it was great in that \"I'm going to have a heart attack\" kind of way. 

Anyways, I'll definitely stop by for a hot dog sometime...I'm glad there's finally a food place on my side of campus!"}
{"text":"Went here all the time when I went to asu. Good hotdogs just a bit expensive hut that's to be expected."}
{"text":"Love it! My favorite thing there is grilled cheese!!  definitley recomendable they! Their customer service is excellent!!!"}
{"text":"Still my favorite hot dog in Arizona, Its a great little break from the health world. The sliders are damn good too. Damn its 8am, now Im craving Dave's Dog house."}
{"text":"Buttered Buns!  

Need I say more?

Yeah sure, why not.  The regular dogs are a good size but if that's not enough for you, they offer a \"pounder\"!  yikes, not for this gal, but maybe for you.

The Boston dog comes with mustard, relish and onions, which is a good combo in my book.  But then they put the grilled dog and all those condiments in a buttery toasted bun.  Now that's just yummy.  Seriously.

I read another person's review that said the french-fires were too greasy and I must correct that - they are in no way greasy - they were perfect in every way.  Yes to the fries."}
{"text":"I used to be a slave to this place when I was a student at ASU. I was bummed when they closed the location across ASU because I wanted to try the 1 pound hot dog challenge and win a t-shirt (not sure if they even have that anymore). When I found they were re-opening on campus I was stoked! I was a senior and ate there many times again. I knew I wouldn't be on campus anymore soon and had to take advantage. I was right, because I haven't returned since. I wish it were at a different location because campus parking is a female dog. The bread is like a piece of perfectly buttered and toasted goodness; and the hot dogs are SO good (HQ). I like to get the chili dogs or boston. The sliders are really good too. I like this place way better than Ted's, hands down. I need to make another stop here and reminice my college years! OPEN ANOTHER LOCATION!"}
{"text":"Dave's has pretty okay hot dogs, but their prices are astronomical for what  you get. Some reviews mention its pricey thats an understatement be prepared to mortgage your house or sell a kidney for these dogs. M vote not worth it."}
{"text":"Dave's Dog House makes unique, tasty hot dogs. They have a delightful, back-east bun that's more like a piece of thick, foldable toast. The dogs are high quality and flavorful, and priced well. The fries are alright, but sadly nothing to write home about. 

They've since moved ON campus, just off the Gammage Parkway loop, so it's a bit trickier to get to from Mill during school, but they're a much better dog than some of the other options available on Mill."}
{"text":"I had the Reuben for lunch. It was okay but the cheese wasn't melted and there was a bit too much thousand island dressing. The Sea Dog was for dinner. It was just okay. Nothing to drive out of my way for. I did like the toast they used for the bun. Took a little searching since I wasn't familiar with the campus and I had to pay for parking a short walk away."}
{"text":"Probably the best hot dog in the PHX area, just wish they had better hours & were easier to find. Took awhile to wander around the ASU campus until we found it.

The New England style bun might not be for everyone, but i like it. Dog itself has good flavor & 'pop' when you bite into it. 

Tried out the chili dog, boston dog, corn dog, & fries.

Chili was tasty, topped detroit coney style with mustard & onions. Definitely come back for that again.
Boston was alright, pretty simple, nothing amazing. 
Corn dog was right on par with the rest of the food, enjoyed it. Crispy batter crust & moist inside. 
Fries were zesty & flavorful with natural texture. 

Overall a good place & worthy of expanding to a few more areas in the valley."}
{"text":"This place is the beeez neeeez. The dogs are addicting. They dunk the buns in butter and grill them up, which adds a great flavor/texture on ma palate. The only gripe i have is that each dog is gonna be around 4-5 doll hairs. It's not a huge issue, but as a poor college student, 5 dolla make you holla for one dog can be murderous to the wallet. The fact that one hot dog is not enough, will force you to go back to spend more. I've been doing this on the daily and now i'm broke as a bloke. Gonna get back on it when the loans come in."}
{"text":"I've had Dave's bookmarked for a while and finally had a chance to check it out today.  FIrst of all, it's no longer on University, it's on Forest, south of its former location, within the hallowed halls of the ASU campus.  Keep walking past where the road ends, and it will be on your left.  Easy to miss unless you're looking for it.

I opted for a #5, which is a Boston dog, a chili dog, fries, and a drink.  Probably not the healthiest meal i've had of late. I really liked the unique \"bun\", and the Boston dog was probably my favorite of the two.  Good wiener, good condiments.  The chili dog was very good, if not outstanding.  The fries were just average.  Overall I really liked the joint and will almost surely be back, though when in the area it's awfully hard to avoid The Chuck Box.  4 solid stars on the Brak-o-Meter."}
{"text":"As far as on campus grub goes this place is top class. The Boston Dog is a classic here; in my opinion it's their best menu item. The reason I'm so high on this place is that for an on campus establishment it's actually reasonably priced paired with quality food. They are definitely known for their hot dogs but they do have other items (the sliders are good) and are now serving breakfast (haven't tried it yet). If you're ever on campus and looking for a spot to eat, I would recommend Dave's anytime."}
{"text":"I used to eat here almost everyday freshman year until it started making my face oily and me tired in the middle of the day. The dogs are amazing just very greasy and probably not the best to eat in 100 degree heat when you have walk or bike everywhere."}
{"text":"This place is great!! My boyfriend and I ate here yesterday, I had the mac and cheese hotdog and he had the chili dog. The mac and cheese dog is huge! So delicious but the best part is the garlic toast bun! It was slightly difficult for us to find not being familiar with the area and the place def needs AC. When we left because it was so hot the owner even gave us waters for the road! A great experience for us out of towners!"}
