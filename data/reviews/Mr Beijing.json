{"text":"stop by and tast best chicken wings i ever had mmmmm !!!!!!"}
{"text":"Just discovered this place and I love it! When we get delivery they are always super fast! I have also stopped by on the way home from work and they are so friendly. 

I am a shrimp lover and Mr Beijing do not disappoint, generous portions, always seasoned perfectly. 

The portions are huge so make sure you are hungry! 
I had some friends stop by my place for a \"hangover day\" last week where we all just wanted to eat and watch movies, and everybody loved Mr Beijing! 

It is fast and cheap and tastes great."}
{"text":"I always order the beef pan fried noodles. They are so good! I especially love the sauce!"}
{"text":"I ordered food from here a couple of times now. I am vegetarian and picky, so it usually makes it difficult for me to order take out food. But, this place is amazing! Not only did they show up within 15 minutes of my order, it was all absolutely correct. I even put in special requests. It is amazing, i would keep writing, but i need my hands for free for fork usage."}
{"text":"EXCEPTIONAL CUSTOMER SERVICE!!! I have ordered from this establishment for delivery, take out and also dined in for about 5 years!! The food is amazing and the staff is so friendly! The shrimp egg foo young is to die for!! I recommend this restaurant to everyone and have always gotten  great feed back!! Thank you for being personable and treating people right!!"}
{"text":"this place is awesome.  really good eats, esp for the price.  the food is always fresh...and it is one of the only places i know that will consistently make it spicy for me (legitimately spicy).  and they have some dishes i have never had before (i.e., tomato beef and green tea beef)...or at least never had they way the prepare them.  they also have an array of vegetarian dishes (the ma-po tofu is delicious).

hard to beat the lunch special....big portions, no extra charge for the rice, and a cup of soup.  on top of that, the people are always friendly and they deliver!

i absolutely recommended it"}
{"text":"I wish I could give it less than one star too, all the item looked exactly the same. Mongolian beef, garlic chicken and the chow mien. Very little meat in either dish and nothing, but shredded carrots, celery and onions and mushy. Fried rice was not very good. Sadly no leftovers for the morning, had to throw it.

I have ate in the restaurant previously and it was okay. But this was not. It was a waste of $25 including tip."}
{"text":"I have to say...when this restaurant first opened, I was thrilled because it was close to my house and the owners were Soo charming :) the food was freshly made and delicious!! But, within the past few months since the restaurant got new owners, the food has changed :/ while they kept the menu the same, there is a big change in taste. The new owners seem nice, but I just don't like the new food. I used to recommend this place to all my family and friends, but now its just not the same :/"}
{"text":"First time here and I was really impressed.... First, it was somewhat adventurous for me to order Pad Thai in a Chinese Restaurant, but it was really good.  The sauce was just right.. Not too overly sweet, and has a little kick of spiciness. Loved it! My friend ordered Mongolian Beef.. and it was really delicious as well.. Beef was really tender, the sauce is just right but for me, it could be more spicy. Overall was great and the food came out really quick. Not a fancy place but definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"In for a conference, I decided to order takeout. Yelp rated Mr Beijing highly. Food is tasty. Ordered Szechuan Chicken and disappointed in the quantity of chicken. Very disappointed.  Also ordered wonton soup. Wontons are so over cooked they disintegrate upon touching. 

Food is tasty, just underwhelming in presentation. At $22 it's priced in the high side."}
{"text":"Ordered orange chicken, Mr Beijing rice and fried shrimp. Instead I was delivered orange chicken and 2 fried rices. When I called to report the mistake the woman on the phone simply said \"we'll the shrimp fried rice cost more than fried shrimp\", as if she had done me a favor. Smh the worst part came when she said they'll send the shrimp out but I had to give the rice back. Call me crazy but that made me instantly feel as if they may throw it back in the pot and reuse it smh. Never again for me"}
{"text":"Delicious & very reasonable !! We got delivered to Planet Hollywood hotel.   Yes, they deliver to your hotel.  It was so good , we stop by here before heading home to California.  Even more delicious in person.   this new find"}
{"text":"Service was good and delivery was speedy. The food was beyond flavorless. Very disappointed that I spent my money on this food. My friends and I were really looking forward to having this for lunch."}
{"text":"Pretty decent chinese restaurant. The service is pretty good and they have a nice selection to choose from on their menu. The food I ordered came out hot and was actually pretty good. The price is affordable and is pretty good considering how much I got. Really cool place to check out for sure."}
{"text":"I stopped here while in town for a convention and I must say that for the price, my meal here was a far better value than meals I've had on the strip for twice as much $. This place is very small and although it mostly does delivery and take-out I enjoyed the cozy atmosphere and decided to eat-in. I ordered the General Chicken, a favorite dish of mine, and this place cooked it perfectly and added a good bit of pepper to kick it up a notch. Also, this was a quaint family-run small business which was evident by the manager helping a grandson with his homework as I walked in- the same manager was very friendly and struck up a conversation with me which was much-appreciated. All in all a highly enjoyable meal and atmosphere, wish I lived in the area so I could come back often!"}
{"text":"Great place lunch special is the best $5.96 . Family owned. Great customer service. If your looking for a great place for lunch definitely a place to go eat."}
{"text":"Excellent food, friendly staff, large portions for low prices. This place is freaking legit."}
{"text":"Great family owned restaurant. Everything is homemade and absolutely delicious! Our favorite vines food in Vegas. Casual atmosphere and the family that owns it operates it and does the cooking as well. Highly recommend Mr. Beijing"}
{"text":"By far the best spot for great food HUGE portion and a family owned and operated local business. I'm a VIP Host here and seen plenty of imposters when it came to my favorite food.. 

Owner is super friendly and she always takes care of me when I stop in.

Clark the Shark Approved ^^^^"}
{"text":"Love their Egg Fried Rice... Soo yummy and the owners are so sweet...i always make a point to eat here at least once in my Vegas trip"}
{"text":"The food here was very good. The fresh egg rolls were the best part. Very tasty. I had the dinner special for less than $10 and couldn't finish it all. The only reason I gave 4 out of 5 was there could have been more chicken in the main dish. The veggies were all very good and fresh but it was hard to find pieces of chicken throughout. All in all, highly recommended, I would just make a point to ask for plenty of meat in the entrees. I ate in the restaurant itself so I cannot speak for their delivery service."}
{"text":"Perfect.   It's exactly what I think of when I think of Chinese food. The staff is friendly and they serve the food quickly.  It's never crowded.  Clean and the food is prepared how Chinese food should be.  I hate soggy general tso's and this place had the crunchy fresh General tso's.  I'm going here weekly."}
{"text":"The lunch specials are quite good. If I could change one thing it would be the ability to have a basic wonton soup. The specials have hot and sour soup and egg drop only. If you want a wonton soup it has to be the super soup er won ton. I live close but I'd rather go to H.K. in Chinatown"}
{"text":"After reading all the positive reviews, I was excited to find something other than PF Changs or Panda near my job to satisfy my Chinese craving. Yes I could have gone to Chinatown to fulfill this need but I wanted to venture out and see what else was around me. So I walked into to this cozy little joint with an open mind and taking into account what the rest of the Yelpers recommended. 

First off, lunch for $5.95 is a deal considering the portion size of their lunch plates! The owner and her son? were very nice and accommodating. She gave me a schpill about how they make their own soy sauce, garlic chili paste and chili oil. Wow this place sounded really authentic and made me look even more forward to trying their food! So on to the food..

First up, you get your choice of egg drop or hot & sour soup. I settled on egg drop. When the cup came out, I noticed how hearty the soup looked as it had peas and carrots, chunks of tofu and egg strands. This has to be good right? Wrong. The soup was flavorless and really thick. I thought adding their homemade soy sauce would help. Wrong again. Their soy sauce had no sodium. That's ok, there's nothing a little Sriracha won't fix.

Next, my General Chicken with Chicken Fried Rice plate appeared. Again pretty big portion size. Bite into the chicken..ouch I almost lost a tooth. These suckers were overcooked. I thought maybe the rice would redeem the meal. I do have to give the rice kudos because it was actually pretty decent. It was moist and fluffy. Actually had a good flavor to it. If you added soy sauce or chili, it would suck it right up. 

So overall the atmosphere and service were great. I was disappointed in the General chicken and soup. Maybe I came on a bad day? But I felt that the fried rice did redeem the meal. Perhaps on my next visit, I'll try a different dish to see if it changes my opinion."}
{"text":"The sesame beef was tender and crispy (A good combination in my opinion!) but too much vinegar - to the point that's all I could taste. The fried rice is so so - it's decent but I give it five out of 10 stars compared to other better fast food Chinese restaurants."}
{"text":"I'm all about service.  Just so everyone knows, tipping is OPTIONAL.  You get tipped for the customer service you provide.  You pay for the food that is served to you.  
When the food was delivered, the delivery guy did not say \"hello\" nor did he say \"thank you\" when he received a tip.  What a jerk.  I will NEVER order from this restaurant again.  
Inconsiderate delivery boy, pulls out hundreds of dollars in cash and doesn't say \"thank you\" when he receives a hundred in a tip.  p-u-n-k"}
{"text":"I discovered this little chinese spot a few months ago.  I planned on going to Jack in the Box but decided to give it a try.  The food was awesome and for 6 bucks is a great value for lunch.  I've been to about 10 other small chinese food spots throughout Vegas and the food quality is subpar compared to this place.

Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Was great decent priced and the lunch special was huge only could eat half.  The eggdrop soup was on point. The iced Tea delicious.  Love it.  Definitely ordering here again.  Delivery was fast.  Nice helpful staff.  You won't regret it.."}
{"text":"Quick delivery! I typically enjoy Beijing's Chinese comfort food but this particular time was kinda off. The food came really hot as if it were cooked at my door! That was great. The fried rice was slightly flavored with styrofoam and the Thai tea was awful. First time it happened but I may not repeat!"}
{"text":"Cheap solid chinese food from a mom n pop store. Exactly what I look for in take-out chinese. I'd absolutely come back here."}
{"text":"We went here twice in 2 days as a group of 5 while visiting Vegas, for lunch and dinner, so we got to try quite a few dishes. They were all very well cooked and the portions were larger than we could handle, all at a surprisingly low price. The service was quick and flawless, and we were waited on by a very kind lady who was part of the family that owned and operated the restaurant. Overall, we had a great experience and we would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The best food Ever!!! Great prices  and alot for the money. 
I was able to get two meals from my one serving. 
Singapore noodles and Curry Rice - both extremely delicious! 
I will definitely be returning  
A wonderful meal for date night!"}
{"text":"The price was right and food was delicious.  For 9 bucks and super friendly service and owner/staff.  Visit this place when you want a bite to eat 'off strip' !"}
{"text":"This is another husband and wife team that delivers !, you cannot beat the prices here, and the fresh food. good fried rice, the soups are the only thing from 5 stars from me. 
I have seemed to settle in on the General chicken, I also have Mr. Beijing make me General Beef, same dish just beef instead of chicken, Extra spicy. which is always fun for me. the kitchen is right next to the dining area and the frying peppers usually cause a few people to cough !"}
{"text":"I don't like to make negative comments but I was very very disappointed with the way they treat customers. Not sure about food which may be good or not. Anyhow I when call to order, it was nice and simple until it was 1 hour and half late, I understand it could be busy from time to time and business can be out of control. What ever it is you don't treat customers like this. I.e I was slammed off the phone type of rudeness. Already late, didn't offer to give discounts, I waited and waited, called more than twice to check order, guy finally came but didn't to come to the door and ask me to come down and when I said I couldn't he slammed the phone, I called the manager, she then slammed the phone on me and refused to pick up when called again. They may be busy but a quick word thank you or I'm sorry I will offer something to compensate will be better than slam. I don't think I can get the money back for this at all. Rude and unprofessional behavior. They can act like this because I already paid for food and tips. Unbelievable"}
{"text":"Best chinese food I've ever had! They delivered to our hotel room right before closing time and exactly on time even though we ordered a ton of food. The mandarin chicken is a bit spicy so beware. The sweet and sour pork was perfect. The orange chicken was deelish. We also ordered fried rice and chow mein without knowing that they would include white rice as well. I wasn't crazy about the egg flower soup. A bit flavorless. And they didn't include plates. No worries however. We used the lids of the combo plates. And yes it overfed 6 adults. We gobbled it down! Yum! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Really good lunch specials... You are given a choice of two soups, and the entree potion size is huge! Its a total mom n' pop joint.... so the food is authentic. Would def recommend this place to my friends."}
{"text":"Awesome americanized Chinese food (which is what I like - guess i'm not a real foodie). Lunch has it: big portion, hot, quick and cheap ($6). The owner and waitress is super sweet and efficient.   Best of all this place is consistent - good every time ( I have been over 10x)! Not sure why consistency is always an issue when looking for good asian but this place is def the best!"}
{"text":"Food was fresh and crispy. The rice was hot and sticky, not instant! We had the general tso chicken and Hunan vegetables. Seasoned well and not greasy. Best Chinese food in Vegas"}
{"text":"We looked up a goof Chinese restaurant on yelp in Vegas and this one popped up. We decided to try it for lunch my family and I were there for the CES SHOW anyways everything good we're 2adults 2 teens and a 10 yr. Old at the time of getting the check my husband noticed it wasn't adding up? Why you ask.... Well when he asked the lady told us that we had a party larger than 4 so they applied a mandatory 15% gratuity?!! WTF right I asked her to show us where in the menu or their establishment it said that? All I got was a Ummm well it doesn't but we get people who don't tip. Again how is that my fault I added? She then said well you have kids. To which I replied yes I do grown that I served not you. She had no excuse for what she did other that I've been up since 6am and the people have been here to eat didn't tip me so I added a mandatory gratuity to your table. I explained that when I worked for The Butcher Shop we bad to show and mention that prior to service and if they planned on doing that they should update the menu.  We paid what was asked but plan on not going back. I honestly think they saw my hubby and I in a suit and tie and saw $$$ signs. 

Dear owner you shouldn't take out your frustration on your customers especially if they're not the ones you have beef with. We were going to leave a $7 tip but after being told that we had to pay for other peoples tips we d ecided to just leave the mandatory $5.95 .
The food was good but the I don't like owners taking advantage of nice people. 
The next day my kids wanted Chinese needless to say we went elsewhere. 

Bottom line my advice to you is beware ... You never know if the owner will decided that she's not happy how the night went and tag on an extra tip to your bill.

Enjoy"}
{"text":"My favorite beef chow mian here at mr Beijing is always good. The chef remembers me well and always cook the way I love. This place is the best. Love it."}
{"text":"I had a great experience at this restaurant a little off the beaten path. It's the quintessential hole-in-the-wall that has a ton of delivery traffic so it is loved by locals. While the dining area is small it is unique and enjoyable. The Manager is super friendly greeting you with a smile at every opportunity. The food is fantastic, and leave room for green tea ice cream."}
{"text":"I have had the avocado smoothie here twice ... It is very healthy and tastes out of the world. Must try ..."}
{"text":"Quality of the food was top notch.  General tso and egg drop soup.  Fantastic!


The lunch special is all week."}
{"text":"It's disgusting!

I'm 42 years old and this is some of the worst Chinese food I've ever had.  We we're staying in Las Vegas on 10/23/14 and called in an order for delivery.  It took an hour and a half to get to use and the place is just down the road.  It was cheap quality and bland.  

Don't waste your money."}
{"text":"The hot and sour soup smelled so bad that we didn't eat it. The eggplant tofu has mostly green bell pepper in it. And they give you a menu that says that if you order more than $30 you get a free appetizer but they would not honor that or any other free coupon that is on the menu"}
{"text":"The place is nicely decorated. I was greeted by a very friendly woman who immediately sat me down and asked for my drink order. 

She promptly brought me water and asked if I was ready to order food. 

She took my order and my food came out pretty quickly. 

I got veggie chow mein, cream cheese ragoons, and fried rice. All were decent--none were WOW

All in all, if you're looking for friendly and fast service and decent Chinese (??? I think sorry) food then this is your spot. Super close to UNLV too 

Side note: it's a terribly small (and full) parking lot but luckily someone pulled out just as I entered."}
{"text":"Worst place ever. Will never return. Over cooked food and refused to re-cook or to offer refund. There customer service sucks. Don't eat here."}
{"text":"Fast delivery and good food!!!! I ordered lunch at work today and the guy showed up within 30 minutes!! Dishes were still hot and yummy! The chow mein was"}
{"text":"Off the strip but not far.  Totally worth the wait for fresh delicious  food! Will come back every time I am in Vegas! Very easy on the wallet too!"}
{"text":"5-star.  I am a regular here.  Great food, huge portions, good prices.
Owner lady is excellent and remembers your name if you order there regularly and makes nice small talk.  Delivery is quick and accurate if you order out.
Great customer service, great food, great portions, great prices.
What more can you ask for?
A hidden gem in Las Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"The cream cheese ragoos was the best part of the dinner special i ordered everything else was sloppy and basically spaghetti noodles tossed in some bland Asian sauce and little meat. Wasted 10 bucks and had to throw away my food."}
{"text":"The only good thing about ordering at Mr. Beijing was the fast delivery. Egg Foo Young was forgettable. It was deep fried and dry. Looked more like vegetable fritters. Sub-par to say the least. Lo Mein was bland, you need to pump up the flavor.. I won't order here again."}
{"text":"This place doesn't need another bad review. This is fast Chinese-American food. I think I should have just gone to Panda Express when I'm short on time. No surprises at Panda Express. 

I wish I had just tried anything else.  But i asked for a recommendation of a dish from the  waitress.  She recommended General Tsao chicken.  The General Tsao chicken is exactly like eating a bag of candy.  Its too sweet.  I asked for a tea with little sugar.  They give me a tea full of sugar.  

Someone in this place has a sugar addiction. With Diabetese on the rise, this restaurant would be one of the culprits.  You can't please everyone, but Asian people don't eat Chinese-American food.  We prefer Asian food, food resembling food found in country of origin.  

Please don't turn meat into a glossy, shiny, ball of syrup and sugar.  

I don't think the people working there even have a clue about the differences. 

I've asked for recommendations from other restaurants in the past and they made wonderful recommendations. I don't get it. 

Unfortunately, food east of the 15 is just worse than food found west of the 15. 

Anyway, just my 2 cents."}
{"text":"Great Chinese food and massive amount of drink choices for teas, slushies. Chicken fried rice is phenomenal."}
{"text":"I work in the retail industry and we always ordered from them, not just that the food is pretty good for Chinese take out, and the portions are quite generous but the owner who takes the phone orders is very friendly. I would have given them 4 stars for all that, but recently, the delivery charges have been changing from $2 to $3 to $5, back and forth, making it unpredictable as to what you are paying for. There are plenty of places that charge way less, if not no charge at all but I am still a fan of good service and quality, so I still give them a decent rating..."}
{"text":"Where can I start? First trip to Vegas and we were craving some really good Chinese food. I looked on yelp and seen Mr.Beijing's had great reviews, ratings and prices. We went in as a party of 7 around 8:45 at the end of January with a ton of questions on what the menu items consist of, look like and are served with. We were all very undecided. Echo was our server and she was the BEST. She was very patient and friendly. We apologized for all the questions and she replied \"Take your time it's no problem, it's your food that you're going to eat we want you to enjoy it\" very sincerely.

We will be back every time we are in Vegas from now on!

Good food, Good prices, Great service. They know what they're doing!"}
{"text":"The food was ok.  It took FOREVER to get here,  they were over an hour late.   Then they said that it was my fault!   I ordered through yelp,  and used the my location option.   How would I know the address of my hotel?   Oh yes and the eggroll was so small you couldn't see it and soft not crispy!"}
{"text":"Because YELP reviews were good for this place I decided to give it a shot & I fuckin regret it. Yes, REGRET! $30 bucks in the GARBAGE! 

Anyways, ordered food for DELIVERY on YELP. Called 'em & was told it will be delivered within the hour.... ok sure. An hour and 45 min LATERRR I got the call from their driver to come down to hotel lobby & grab my food; oh man wtf. I DID NOT******* want to leave HOTEL ROOM THATS Y I CALLED FOR DELIVERY!!! UGH 

Food:
PORK FRIED RICE -- GROSSSSSSS, I threw that shit out!
GENERAL CHICKEN -- tasted like sweet & sour chicken to me \"/ and it was way toooo chewy, it was like chewing gum @ one point.
CREAM CHEESE WONTON -- sad excuse for cream cheese wonton, like a fingernail sized cream cheese inside big ass wonton wrapper

DON'T WASTE UR TIME/MONEY HERE. So not worth it. ZERO STARS if that was possible."}
{"text":"EPIC failure on chinese food! 
So weird nothing resembled the description on menu! 
We were staying at Alexis park resort across from Hard Rock and limited on delivery options...we ordered Beijing beef,lobster shrimp and small chow mein. As hungry as we were we ate some of this food. The Beijing beef dish was nothing as described it stated it was stir fried with fresh tomatoes and onions. well the dish we got had bell peppers,mushrooms in a unappetizing brown gravy,this is really bad when your signature dish with restaurant's name was disgusting! If u have ever ordered Lobster shrimp before at any chinese restaurant u know what to expect. NOT here... it more resembled egg drop soup! Wth!  
Waste of money and appetite killer is what this place is!"}
{"text":"Mr. Beijing is simply amazing. I got to know the new owners from my Mother in law. They have really improved the taste and quality. We ordered the Orange Chicken, Cirspy Beijing Wings, Chicken Fried Rice, Curry Noodles with Beef, Chicken, and Shrimp, and Iced Thai Tea to drink. 

The Orange Chicken is crispy, flavorful chunks of chicken deliciousness. It has such a sweet and succulent tangy sauce. Truly amazing. You'll never like Panda's orange chicken again lol. The Chicken Fried Rice is so light and fluffy. The veggies crisp. I didn't even put soy sauce on the Fried Rice like I normally do cuz it's so damn good. The Chicken Wings were amazing. They were marinated and had such crispyness and flavorful bites. Truly outstanding. A nice aletrnative to Buffalo Wings...which they also have. The Curry Noodles were great. Very light and perfectly spiced. The meats were tender and you can taste the different meats...not all combined as one flavor. The Thai Tea I never had before. It was so fresh and creamy tasting. I was so impressed, I drank 2 big glasses. It's great for the heat hear in Las Vgeas and as a nice sweet treat.

I must say Congrats to the new owners and thank you for being such great people. Your food is truly amazing and I look forward to eating at my new FAVORITE Chinese Restaurant Mr. Beijing"}
{"text":"If you like curry, this is definitely the place for you. They have red, brown, and yellow curry (my personal fave). Friendly people and quick service to boot! I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Reasonably priced lunch specials.  Garlic shrimp with fried rice and soup was very good."}
{"text":"MOST OUTSTANDING establishment in Las Vegas, over the past 2 years I can say that they consistently treat me with the upmost hospitality and have always been generous in portion size and more than fair in pricing. They go above and beyond to make you happy, and always remember you, and in my case my order. Thank you for every amazing experience!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place with the old owners, love this place with the new owners.  Is it the best Chinese food I've ever had? Heck no.  Is it a huge plate of comfort food in a nice atmosphere for cheap? Heck YES!  Reliable, consistent delivery as well.  Grab a family meal, eat for a few days.  It's like every Chinese restaurant in Vegas (outside of Spring Mtn Rd) follows the same formula with the same menu, same coupons, and same 2 family dinner specials, but this place just does it better.  If I want the type of dinner experience that I'm used to from growing up in the Bay Area, I go to Spring Mtn -- If I want a typical Vegas local take out place, I go here (or Chopstix for close to my work).


To the lady upset about a tip being added:  Um deal with it?  I'd hate to see how you fare in a country where this is the norm (try most of Europe).  Rate the food and the service, not a small idiosyncrasy that, by your own admission, saved you money in the end."}
{"text":"I was disappointed in this place. I saw the good reviews and overall 4 star rating so I gave Mr. Beijing a shot.

I placed an order and asked for a 3pm delivery. The driver was late and not very friendly when he finally showed up. Part of my order was a diet coke and it was warm. Not like it wasn't very cold anymore but more like it was never cold to begin with. You'd think that a person placing a to go order to a business would want a cold soda and may not have a cup and ice. I mentioned it to the driver, \"oh it's warm?\" And he just said yes. Like \"duh!\"

The general chicken was too spicy for me to even eat! The standard temp is \"medium\" so I can't imagine what it would be like if I asked for it to be spicy! I also ordered the chicken Lo Mein. It was decent. I wouldn't order it again but since it's the only thing I could eat from this order, I had to make it work."}
{"text":"Yums!!

Cheap comfort food, AND THEY DELIVER!!!!!! THEY. DELIVER. Stayed at the signature over the weekend and was desperate for asian comfort food & did not want to take a cab to china town.. so I went to eat24 and discovered Mr. beijing!! 

The portions are huge, salty msgy and delicious asian food!!!"}
{"text":"I couldn't even get passed a phone call. The woman who answered the phone couldn't take my pick up order because she didn't even know the menu or what I was ordering. Was really excited to try the place, but ended up very disappointed."}
{"text":"Mr and Mrs Beijing were awesome. Attentive service. Delicious well made lunch specials for $5.95!! Not ur typical ghetto Chinese food. U can tell they take pride in there lil restaurant. I could eat this everyday. See u tomorrow at lunch!"}
{"text":"I was pleased that they delivered to the hotel I was staying in. The food was okay, by the reviews I was hoping it was going to be better.. The fried rice didn't have much flavor and the orange chicken was okay but was a little soggy. But all in all for the price it was decent but nothing to brag about. I wouldn't order from here again. There are defiantly better places."}
{"text":"I ordered general tso chicken and tomato beef. The general tso was way so salty and the tomato beef had no tomatoes. I will definately not go back"}
{"text":"I just had the rudest experience on the phone with one of the workers here. They were about to close, but she offered if I wanted to pick up an order and once I asked about the menu, she said \"You know what never mind, it's late and I have kids. They have school tomorrow.\" And then she hung up. I understand that they're closing, but it was very unpleasant of her to offer and then rudely interrupt me while I was trying to order. I've never even eaten at this restaurant, but this first impression has already turned me away. 

It was also unprofessional of her to mention her personal life to a customer and use it as an excuse to deny service. I am so upset and won't even try ordering from this place again."}
{"text":"Was craving some Chinese fried rice and came out to find pretty good Chinese food at this hole in the wall spot. Totally a great bang for your buck which is weird to say in Vegas. Great family owned business. Will come back again"}
{"text":"I go here on my lunch break for their lunch specials. It's $5.95 for an item of your choice, soup (either egg drop or hot and sour), and fried rice. The portions are huge and I can only usually finish half of the lunch special and save the rest for dinner. So it's a great value for your money. I usually order the General Chicken which is a crispy fried coated chicken soaked with a nice sweet and spicy sauce. Only order the egg drop soup, the Hot and Sour was not very appetizing when I tried it. The food is definitely better quality than a panda express, but its not the best chinese take-out style food i've had. The service is excellent and the lady who works there is super friendly and always smiling. If you're a UNLV student, come here for some good chinese since its close."}
{"text":"So I was looking for a new Chinese place in Vegas and Mr. Beijing came up and I am glad it did!

The owner is super friendly and very courteous to the patrons. This place is tucked away in a shopping plaza surrounded by other restaurants and the seating is limited, but get an order to go and you will not be disappointed! 

They have the best sweet and sour sauces I have ever had and all the food was very fresh, flavorful, and steaming hot (literally)! 

I got cheese wontons, egg drop soup, and cashew chicken lunch special and for the price you can not beat this! Everything was perfect and the portions are huge! I did not want to eat it all, but it was so darn good I stuffed it all down and wanted to order more!

Please stop in and try them, this is my new favorite spot while in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This is the best Chinese place in Las Vegas! If you ever get a chance please check this place out. I've been going here for a couple of years and the owners wife still remembers me and my family. Lunch special is $6 huge portions and you also get soup. The hot and sour soup is the way to go. Also order a side of chicken wings. I've brought many of my friends here and they've enjoyed it just as much as I have. I don't really write reviews but for Mr. Beijing it's a must. Echo (the owners wife) she is great!  Always enjoy having lunch or dinner here! It may be small but the food will blow your taste buds."}
{"text":"I just moved to the area from the east side where I had already established my favorite place to eat Chinese food. I always compared other places to that one spot and none compared in taste. I didn't feel like cooking and started to map the closest places to me. Mr. Beijing popped and I immediately noticed they had the family dinners available. Ordered Dinner A with chow mein and mangolian beef, spicy. Delivery arrived timely and I had the BEST greeting! \"Here's your delicious food!\" That was awesome! And, I must say... the food WAS delicious!!!! The only thing is the hot and sour soup needed a bit more flavor and sourness but I added some lemon and garlic. Overall, it was excellent and I definitely will be re-ordering from Mr. Beijing as well as recommending this place to others."}
{"text":"Meh. Decent Chinese food. Nothing to brag about."}
{"text":"Great Salt & Pepper Shrimp! Kinda spicey, as there are peppers in the mix, but the balance of heat-to-flavor was quite nice.  Mr. Beijing Lo Mein did not disappoint. Fast and friendly delivery.   Still recommend!"}
{"text":"Ordered general tsos and gave me stirfry. Refused to refund and called me a liar. The service was terrible. Too bad because the food looked decent."}
{"text":"I ordered while in Vegas the food was so good and delivered ahead of schedule. When back in Vegas, I'll place another order with them. The only reason for the 4 stars instead of 5 is because they did not deliver with anything to eat with... and it was delivered to a hotel. I think they made an assumption that we have something to eat with. Here's the list of what we ordered:

General Tso's Tofu (Lunch), 
Kung Pao (Lunch), 
Shrimp Lobster Sauce (Lunch), 
Salt and Pepper Tofu

It was all too Yummy!!"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times and it had been good but nothing really blew my mind. Today I tired one of their authentic dishes and it was really good and I was glad I tried. It was shredded pork stir fried with dry bean curd. Loved it and def a must try!"}
{"text":"Some friends took us to Mr. Beijing today for an early dinner and WOW what great food!! We started off with the fried pork chops, chicken wings and chicken lettuce wraps. Then soup was served, my wife and I had the egg drop soup, and our friends had the hot and sour soup. For the main meal I had the Tomato Beef and my wife had the sweet and sour chicken, our friends had the broccoli beef and kung pao shrimp. this whole meal was insanely great!!! The owners are a husband and wife team that seem to pour their hearts into the food and service, and it truly shows!!! I will be recommending Mr. Beijing to my friends and family for sure."}
{"text":"Fast, super cheap and delicious. 

We stumbled upon this place for lunch before visiting the Nuclear Testing Museum across the street. $5.95 for lunch specials!! Why not? Completely worth it. 

The lunch special comes with your choice of their soups available, a choice of steamed rice or fried rice, and the entree itself. My assumption was that it would be a smaller portion because it's so cheap. NOPE. Generous portions for the price. We were seated quickly and our orders were taken. 

The cooks were having their lunch break, however, they got up and cooked our food once our order was out in. Good work you guys. We could hear and smell it from our table. Our dishes were out fresh, quick and hot. 

I normally upload pictures of my food, but I was so hungry and finished it all before I could remember. 

Looking for a cheap place before your museum visit? Go here and definitely worth the lunch price."}
{"text":"Good food.  Free parking.  A $5.95 lunch, including entree, rice and soup.  I had the Mongolian beef.  A pile of food with just the right amount of spice.  What's not to love."}
{"text":"Ok so after some drinks the night before this place rocks. It's cheap and quick until you have to pay and then it takes forever. Hello people this is not fine dining it's fast food Chinese. Find some help, clear your tables and for darn sake take my money. Food is ok. I like Panda Express better if that says anything."}
{"text":"Had a good experience. I had the hot and sour soup an the mapo tofu. They were great for the price just a bit to oily. Other than that It was ok. Good for the price."}
{"text":"My Favorite off the strip Asian restaurant , the food is always fresh , family operated , great prices."}
{"text":"This was the worst food i have ever eaten! Panda Express is 100 times better then this place! First off we order a lunch special said it came with a egg roll and soup. Didn't see that at all! After getting the food we did not even bother to ask. The chicken was questionable. Note to self can't try every Chinese restaurant!!! My sister and i left looking for something to get the horrible taste out of our mouths!!"}
{"text":"With the restaurant being close to the strip and UNLV, I was a little surprised that it was relatively empty the times that I went. The lunch specials are such a good deal considering what you get for an affordable price (choice of entree, soup, and rice). The owners are really friendly and it's clear that they put a lot of effort towards the food and service.

It's good to know that I can get authentic Chinese food near where I live and the location is excellent. The only issue I have with the restaurant is that I wish parking was more accessible. From the times that I've been here so far, it seems like a toss up as to whether or not you get a decent parking spot near the restaurant. Other than that I do recommend Mr. Beijing as they really do cook up some great food daily!"}
{"text":"Me and my boyfriend attempted to order take out, which we have from them at least five times and maybe as many as ten.  We were told they don't deliver to us.  We explained they had in the past (this comes up every time we call) and it always gets worked out.  This time, we were told we had to spend at least 40 dollars to take the order.  We explained that was ridiculous and they had delivered in the past.  We were told that the driver was busy and to make our order a \"priority\", we needed to at least spend $35 (the amount dropped $5 during this call somehow.  What a joke.  We understand it's Christmas Eve, but don't lie to your repeat customers."}
{"text":"I came for the Chinese wings which weren't bad.  There were topped with a schezwan  pepper corn, thinly sliced carrot, jalapeño, sliced onion and garlic mixture and was very tasty on its own.  Next time I'll be back to try the food."}
{"text":"This place is okay. It's not the best Chinese food I've had, but it'll do in a pinch and plus it's close to UNLV. If you're on a budget you can't beat their lunch combos only $5.95 and their dinner combo for one only $8.95. With the lunch combo you get an entree item, fried rice, and soup. With the dinner you get an entree item, choice of noodles or fried rice, an appetizer, and choice of soup. Between the two soups they offer -egg drop and hot& sour- I'd go with the egg drop. Both times I've gone I've had the General Chicken which is pretty good, so I'd recommend that. The noodles aren't bad either.Overall this place is good; great prices, delivery, accepts credit cards, and close to UNLV. Try it out!"}
{"text":"The price is definitely right for Mr. Beijing, especially for lunch. They provide a gracious amount of rice, an entree, egg drop soup, and the always popular fortunate cookie. 

Unfortunately nothing really stood out to me. The fried rice was pretty blah-zay. The Orange Chicken I got with my lunch special was good quality chicken, but over battered and the breading dominated the flavor. The egg drop soup was probably the highlight of the meal as the broth was really tasty and there was a generous amount of egg in there. The service was really good as I chatted with one of the ladies in there while waiting for my food. My order didn't take much more than 5 minutes to come up which is a touch concerning considering they don't serve their food buffet style like Panda Express. It's almost like what I ordered was precooked, warmed up, and boxed. Really a 2 1/2 star review, but I'll round up in this instance. 

In a pinch for lunch I wouldn't hesitate to give Mr. Beijing another try, but I definitely wouldn't go out of my way to make this lunch stop."}
{"text":"I dont recommend this place for delivery :(  
won tons were under cooked and the garlic chicken seemed more like a celery dish with the lack of chicken. General chicken had too much breading and not a lot of meat. O well."}
{"text":"Delivery was easy and came very fast. The food was good for delivery to the strip. Chicken tasted fresh and not just heavy sauce. Beef Fried rice is great!!"}
{"text":"Probably the worst Chinese food I've ever had. vegetable spring rolls were good. Unfortunately the rest of the dinner was not good. The egg drop soup was slimy, I wouldn't even touch it. It honestly look disgusting. The combination fried rice was ok at best. There was virtually no flavor. The general tso chicken was more crunchy batter than chicken. The shrimp & broccoli was again ok not great. Boba was undercooked and hard. Service was slow, very inattentive. I waited close to 10 min for more faucet water and still had to ask for it. Honestly 1 stars is more than what should be given but The appetizer was good and the price is cheap. Will not be returning."}
{"text":"Ordered the $8.95 dinner special which came with hot and sour soup, two vegetable egg rolls with sauce, General Tsao's chicken, and lo mein.

Hot and sour soup was perfect but had a bit of a strong soy sauce flavor to it. I didn't even put soy sauce in it! Egg rolls were perfectly crunchy and fresh. The General Tsao's chicken was cooked perfectly but it was completely drenched in the  spicy orange-style sauce which was okay. The chicken pieces on top tasted perfect but the ones on bottom ended up tasting like Chinese fried chicken mixed with Fruity Pebbles cereal. The lo mein was fine and tasted excellent with Sriracha brand sauce. This place is a five-minute walking distance from the \"new\" Baymont Inn&Suites (formerly Blackstone Inn/Holiday Inn). Get your Chinese food fix here, or other restaurants in the same strip mall. Total meal came out to $9.67 after tax."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. I'm a former professional black athlete who is from New York and has eaten a lot of Chinese in my time. This restaurant goes up there with the best. Service is awesome food is awesome and prices are great. I love it and come here once a week for lunch."}
{"text":"Great food, huge portion and owner is a sweetheart!  Glad I found it while going to AT&T store a few doors down, will go back for sure :)"}
{"text":"Disgusting dog food and service. They tried to rip me off by saying this is \"how it's cooked\". Fuck that! My dog wouldn't eat this garbage. Beware!!!!!"}
{"text":"This place is a wonderful gem! The portions are generous, the food is delicious, and the prices are remarkably less than most places of the same or even lesser value. The atmosphere is very comfortable and the staff make it charming and home-y!! I am always welcomed in with warmth and open arms by Echo, the owner, who is always as sweet and as friendly as can be. As a vegetarian, I love that there is a long list of tofu dishes and the vegetable plates are a treat, too! Oh, and if you're in the area, they deliver!"}
{"text":"Got take out from here tonight and it was a great value for the dinner combination for amount of food.  However, the fried rice was mediocre and the wonton soup was pretty bland."}
{"text":"Hard to believe this place only has two reviews on Yelp.  We were in town for the Mountain West Basketball Tournament and wanted to get away from \"The Strip\" and find something to eat before the game.  While driving around the UNLV area, we noticed Mr. Bejing in this little strip mall type place next to a pizza place and a sandwich shop.  We got there just after 4pm and their menu said the lunch prices ended at four.  The server said we could still get those prices so that was great.  My friend had Kung Pao chicken and I had chicken and broccoli.  The food came out quickly, was piping hot and tasted really fresh.  Everything from the service to the food to the prices were great!  I had some hot and sour soup that was very good as well.  We really didn't want to get gouged for another meal in our hotel or around The Strip and felt like we hit the jackpot in finding Mr. Bejing."}
{"text":"Traveling from out of state and was looking for Chinese delivery. Ordered sesame chicken, fried rice, and wontons. Wontons were very good. They were filled with lots of cheese and weren't fried too long. However the sesame chicken was incredibly bland and soggy. Worst of all, the fried rice tasted like an abundance of soy sauce and cigarettes. It was disgusting and I threw it out. 

Gets two stars for good wontons and on time delivery, but I still won't be ordering again."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, good delivery! You can't ask too much from this kind of business so for us they were great in all aspects!"}
{"text":"Pretty solid Chinese food, the portions are large and the lunch specials ($5.99) before 3pm is pretty nice. I seem to order the Orange Chicken or the salt and pepper pork chop the most often.. The egg drop soup is a must as well."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery and I would have to say this is not a recommended place for Asian food. Did not mind the 45 minute for delivery, but the food from the rice to garlic chicken to the soup was disgusting.  More vegetables then meat. Paid $33 and barely ate anything."}
{"text":"Crab Rangoon has nothing in it, nearly no fillings at all and it's sweet and not delicious. Spring roll is the size of my thumb, so small. Curry chicken tastes like syrup, sweet as if sugar was the only seasoning in it. Will not visit it again."}
{"text":"Ate here twice. Why? The first time was right before they closed and i wanted to be fair. Turns out their quality of food is just not that great. Panda has better food. I got the shrimp kung pao with fried rice instead of steamed. The rice was stale and without flavor. The kung pao had ild veggies in it and the shrimp were bot only tiny, but there were three in the whole dish. Flavor was not any better. Disappointed. Their soups (egg drop and hot sour were poor too.   The cost was $13 (delivery that took 1.25 hours) plus $5 tip. P.F. Changs has a delicious shrimp kung pao for the same amount... Wont be back!!"}
{"text":"Really tasty food for a very low price! Best time to go is for their lunch special!you get a large quantity of food for $7!the staff is super friendly too"}
{"text":"Horrible.  Did delivery. Food was prepared incorrect (ordered sauce on side).  Called and owner  said it was correct despite being able to picture it.   What was given was greasy and saucy.  Dumpster it went.   Never again"}
{"text":"Waiting for the possible food poisoning to kick in...

I should've gone with the 1 star reviews instead of giving this place a chance. The 'server' was very rude. He came over to take our order and the phone rang and he ran to answer it without saying a word. Stayed on the phone then did a take out order before returning to our table without apologizing.

Attempted to order Boba drinks but was told 'we only have basic flavors like strawberry and stuff....' okay so although you have 20 flavors to choose from I  can't order what flavors are on the menu unless it's basic? Decided to go with the beef and broccoli lunch special and the sweet and sour chicken. Beef was definitely boiled and chicken was ok I guess? Like I said, waiting for the food poisoning to kick in. Almost hoping I do get sick so I can throw this shit up instead of letting it sit in my stomach.

In the end the food was unbelievably gross and the staff were assholes."}
{"text":"First time ordering, I live rite down the street & delivery still took long but the food was all hot n fresh even though I ordered 20 mins before they closed. Good flavors n decent portions for the family meal A well worth the money I feel."}
{"text":"Good delivery option, expect 1 hr delivery. Had the pork dumpligs they were ok the sauce was great! Had the Kung Pao Chichen excellent dish very spicy by the way,  the shrimp Pad Thai was also excellent good balance on the sweet and  spicy taste, finally the fried rice was ok nothing really great. Big portions"}
{"text":"We are here from LA, where it's hard to find good, Americanized Chinese food. Well, we are glad that we came upon this gem in Vegas! The honeydew Bobo tea was delicious. The egg drop soup had peas and carrots, which was different, but good. My husband loved his Mongolian chicken and hot and sour soup. My chicken and broccoli needed to be spiced up a bit, but overall it was good. We are definitely going back when we return to Vegas!"}
{"text":"On time delivery 
Good prices and large portions 
Hot and sour soup was good. Good size portion for $2.50
Mr Beijing Pan Fried Noodles were excellent. Nice and crispy noodles. Flavorful sauce with beef, chicken and shrimp. Pour the sauce over the noodles and let it soak in. Then enjoy as soft and as crispy as you like. 
Disappointed with the Lemon Chicken. Only because I am used to Lemon Chicken being thin breast meat lightly breaded. It was the chicken like you get for Orange Chicken, breaded thigh pieces. I'm sure that people that like Orange Chicken that way would really like it. 
Good prices for large portions and rice is included with entree. 
Friendly delivery driver on time."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! Decided to order some Chinese food delivery. Ordered Kungpao Chicken and Singapore Fried rice noodle. Food was exceptional and price is good too. Delivery was very fast! Good job guys, definitely will order again!"}
{"text":"I've grown up eating Chinese food, and this place is one of the worse that I've had. I had them deliver my food, as Im only 10 minutes away, it took them 90 minutes to deliver. Not only that they forgot part of my order. 

Prices are cheap and portions are generous. Sorry i prefer quality over quantity. Even Panda Express has better Chinese food."}
{"text":"Ever since I moved to Las Vegas I have felt like I have struggled to find good Chinese food. Sure, there are good places on the strip, but when I don't want to spend that much for a meal and want it delivered, I choose Mr. Beijing. The food is decent...not bad, not great. I don't order from them that often, so I guess that is okay. Their prices are good even though when you order through eat24 you have to order like $18 worth of food so I always have left overs."}
{"text":"Not the best to be honest. Owners kid running all over the place, I know he is a kid, but I'm trying to stuff my face over here.. I guess I had the wrong thing, but garlic chicken should not be so hard. Not the worst I've ever had but not the best either.."}
{"text":"If you are waiting at Signature Flight Support and your stomach is growling, this place is great! The food is delicious and they deliver!

I recommend cashew chicken and fried rice with fresh made watermelon juice for your beverage. It's more food than you can eat for less than $20 including delivery."}
{"text":"Excellent service and food! From out of town and wanted to try a local Chinese restaurant. Had the sesame chicken and was not disappointed! Large portion size, crispy chicken, and great service. I'll come back if I'm back in Vegas."}
{"text":"Very good food ~ huge portions, reasonable priced! I would definitely order from them again! We ordered noodles, orange chicken, egg rolls and crab Rangoon and got two meals out of it and still had some left! (Two people) Delivery time was what they said when we ordered the food, actually alittle faster!"}
{"text":"Not that great of taste. Good size portion and price. Wish it tasted a little better. Maybe it's what I ordered. I don't recommend the sweet and sour pork. The pork tasted like it was fried in old oil and the vegetables were not cooked enough. The chow mein was nothing special.. I don't see myself reordering"}
{"text":"$5.95 for lunch is a bargain, especially when the plate is heaped with food.  But the heap was bland (kung pao chicken), the hot and sour soup unremarkable, and the potstickers i ordered separately, nothing to write home about.  The inside of the place is bland.  Come to think of it, bland is the best way to sum up my impression.  This is NOT a destination spot for Chinese.  But if you're walking along the sidewalk and the burger joint next door is closed and it's 105 degrees, they sure, try it out, they do have a/c...

Won't be back."}
{"text":"Service was excellent! The lady was soo nice and sweet. Food was great and fast. Well priced. Nice find in vegas. Found place on yelp. Recommended."}
{"text":"The noodles were okay, everything else was not good.  Super oily and the meal was low quality.  Not a great dining experience."}
{"text":"Lady in the front takes forever to make a boba smoothie , I waited 20min after ordering and paying to get it. However there papaya is very good."}
{"text":"Very good food! Mr Beijing noodles and lettuce wraps were great."}
{"text":"The food here was great! Large portions and the owner Eckho was a pleasure. She took time to answer our questions but did I mention the food?! Try the curry ! And the broccoli beef bomb! Above all else the restaurant was clean and homey we enjoyed our dinner. I recommend this restaurant for dinner or lunch.  by the way the prices are Amazing! Cheap and worth every bite!"}
{"text":"I have been a here a couple of times for lunch.  Both times were while I was in the area for a business meeting.  This last time was a mixed bag.  The food was good but service was sub par.

My boss and I each ordered a lunch meal and a cup of water.  Our soup came out fast enough but we were never brought our water.  We were still waiting for our water when our meals came out.  And now, if the water situation wasn't enough, we were waiting on utensils too.  No napkins, forks, knives, spoons, water.  Craziness.  We had to ask again for our water and then for our utensils.  They seemed to be short staffed which could help explain the lack of service.  There were two guys in the back cooking the food and one girl upfront taking orders in person and over the phone.  She was on the phone an awful lot leading us to believe it was a personal call at one point.

When we had our utensils and were able to eat our lunch, it really was good.  A good portion of rice and entree for the $5.95 it cost.  And the taste was on point.  I had hot and sour soup and red curry chicken.  The soup was actually hot and sour and had my sinuses feeling it.  The curry continued the trend.  It was all served hot and fresh which I can't in good conscience complain about.  Disappointment was never related to the food.  It was all about the service, or lack of."}
{"text":"For a place that advertises a cheap quick lunch I was completely blown away! Almost immediately after I ordered they came out with egg drop soup Full of carrots peas corn and tofu It was very good, light on salt so easily pepped up with some Soy sauce just like I like it. I ordered the Mongolian beef. It was perfectly seasoned just spicy enough to tingle my palate. It came with a generous serving of fried rice that was very good.  I ordered lemonade with my meal and I was initially concerned because it was taking a little while to come out, it even came behind the soup. However I was quickly surprised and made very happy when they brought my lemonade out. They normally do not offer lemonade and they freshly made some just for me! What amazing service!!! Two very sweet ladies were serving the tables and I watched As they kept a close eye on each table and repeatedly asked to make sure everything was okay and brought extra napkins etc. absolutely AMAZING service. I will be back over and over again."}
{"text":"This small family run business is great. It is clean, the staff are friendly and the food is fast, fresh and delicious.  They deliver and you can order online. We are happy to skip the commercial chinese restaurant down the street for this place any day."}
{"text":"I have been craving quality Chinese fast food for a couple of months now.    No that is not an oxymoron, QUALITY and FAST FOOD can be a great combination.  Oh yea and reasonably priced, there no since in overpaying for sh***y food, granted people pay for sh***y food everyday but that's none of my business.  So on to this review...
As stated above I have been craving quality Chinese fast food for a while now, I live walking in Chinatown so it should be easy to find what I'm craving for right????  No, not really, now don't get me wrong they have great Chinese restaurants in Chinatown, but I am and was more looking for the \"Cali-Style\" Chinese fast food.
FYI: IF YOU HAVE NOT DOWNLOADED THE YELP APP TO YOUR PHONE, YOU NEED TO RIGHT NOW...ok download it after you read this review.
Coming from the gym, I pull up the Yelp app and do a search for Chinese food that was somewhere in the area of the gym.  Mr. Beijing's pops up, what caught my attention was the highlighted orange message that read ONLINE ORDERING.  Ahhh Shiggy, I can order my food before leaving the gym parking lot and by the time I drive to the restaurant my food will be ready??  Yes, yes this is what happened, I ordered my meal at (via online) at 8:11pm, I got to the restaurant at 8:21pm, the lady at the front asked if I was there for PICK UP.  I said yes, I walked over to the side to sit and wait for my food.  My buttocks barely grazed the seat before the lady yelled out PICK UP READY.  Wow, I didn't even get a chance to check-in yet, all I could say was \"Whoa, that was fast, Thank You.\"

I ordered the SPECIAL DINNER C, I promised that's the name.  

The SPECIAL DINNER C comes with the following:
- choice of entrée (multiple options)
- egg drop or hot and sour soup
- choice of fried rice or chow mein
- choice of one the following: egg rolls, cream cheese wonton or friend dumplings

All for $8.95 w/ tax it comes out to $9.76, that's right under $10.


So I got the Orange Chicken entrée w/ fried rice, egg rolls and egg drop soup.  Like a kid waiting to open presents on Christmas day, I couldn't wait to get home to unwrap that plastic bag, and flip open the lids of those styrofoam containers.  And like the happy fat girl that I am, I started to do the happy dance.  Yea Buddy, flipped that 1st lid and \"POW\" a massive amount of rice and orange chicken.  More than enough for one person more like enough for 3 people.  Next lid flipped, Egg Rolls \"POW\" ok, more like \"Chime\" (2)egg rolls, with sweet and sour sauce., and the last, egg drop soup, no adjective for this one, it was egg drop soup (I'm not an egg drop soup fan, it's not my thing but it came w/ the meal.)

Looks can be deceiving, it looked super yummy but I had yet to taste it. 
Fried Rice - Fluffy, not greasy, not sticky, good flavor, the peas and carrots were not mushy, still had firmness to them, in addition to that fresh diced onions were in the dish as well.

Orange Chicken - this is always a hit or miss at Chinese fast food restaurants for example: overcooked, chewy chicken with soggy breading drowning a some kind of orange like sauce. NOT THIS CHICKEN here, yes, the chicken took a dunk in orange sauce but it still had crispiness to the breading.  A nice crunch when I bit into the chicken, tender and juicy.

Egg Rolls - Light and crispy, flaky, in my opinion no sauce is needed.  I wish I had ordered extra, they are that good.

Egg Drop - I didn't try the sorry

Overall experience, awesome place, I cannot count the amount of times that I have driven by this place.  Heck, I didn't even know it was over there but thanks to the trusty YELP app I came across this gem.  And that's why I am giving them 4stars.  I really enjoyed the food here, but the true test will be when my mom comes and visit, she is a Chinese fast food connoisseur, but for me it's still 4stars.  This is just my opinion, try it out and tell us what you think."}
{"text":"Mr. Beijing does well to fulfill your craving for Chinese food. Cheap lunch specials- less than $6 for rice (fried, brown, or white) and an entree. Includes hot n sour soup or egg drop soup. Portion sizes are huge! Well worth your money. Vegetarian options are available. They also offer a large menu of boba drinks. 
The lady taking orders has always been very nice and pleasant. 
Located in close proximity to UNLV's Stan Fulton Building. They do deliver- even to Lied Library for students too busy studying to go get food :-)"}
{"text":"The three stars are for the good service, the food was not so good. I was intrigued by the $5.95 lunch special, but the portions were small, and I have had far better food at Panda Express. Parking in the lot is a joke and the area is not the best. I have seen other good reviews, so maybe I ordered the wrong thing. Extremely impressed by the service though, and I am quite the sucker for good service."}
{"text":"Mr. Beijing delivers!! Just @offthestrip this place has cheap food and great chicken.
The fried rice was ok but I've had much better and the wontons were good too.
For late night delivery keep this place on the list."}
{"text":"I placed my order through Yelp. My order never arrived. I tried calling the restaurant and no one answered. I called yelp and have been on hold for more than an hour."}
{"text":"Love this place, food quality is alright, but their delivery team is amazingly quick!"}
{"text":"Wow, I don't know what happened to this place. I used to come here all the time after school, but now that I've graduated from UNLV, I came to visit this place after about a year.

I always order the general chicken and during my recent visit, the food did not taste as fresh like before. The chicken tasted kind of dry and the sauce was really thick and not as thin as it used to be. Service was also bad during my visit. The guy that was there wasn't really attentive and there was a lack of interaction with the people there. 

Disappointed from this visit not only because the food didn't taste great like it usually does, but because their service was really lacking.."}
{"text":"I have always stop by at Mr. Beijing for my lunch and in my opinion this is the best Chinese food spot around UNLV area. I love their Mongolian beef n shrimp fried rice. Their delivery frame is spot on when I don't have time to stop by at the restaurant."}
{"text":"I order religiously from this establishment, at least twice or more a month. Every time I have placed an order it is always for delivery. The woman that seems to always answer the phone has always been extremely pleasant whenever I have ordered. I live very close by so delivery for the most part usually takes around 30 minutes to arrive. The delivery people have always been very friendly as well. My food arrives each and every time exactly how I have ordered it. The Thai tea with boba is delicious! Whenever the craving for Chinese hits me, mr. bejing is my go to spot!"}
{"text":"This restaurant can't be argued against when looking for Chinese delivery in Vegas after a long day. Not wanting to go out, and just sit in my hotel room, this was the place. The food was super hot when delivered (sooner than expected), and more than I could eat. All in all, I can't complain"}
{"text":"The short form- The delivery was really quick, the food was amazing, everything was cooked perfectly tasted amazingly delicious.  Great value for the money, I'll definitely be back. 

The long form- I've been searching lately for a good Hot and Sour Soup.  I was pleasantly surprised to find on the Eat24 site that this establishment offered one made with chicken, not seafood.  (Don't get me wrong, some of the seafood ones are great, but not what I'm looking forward to devouring.)  This soup was everything promised and much more.  I felt like I was on a magical journey to flavor town.  I have been searching for this, and I finally struck gold.

Pad Thai is traditionally a Thai dish, not Chinese and their Pad Thai was nowhere near my usual Thai specialized restaurants I frequent.  Theirs was still good, and the chicken was cooked to perfection.  It missed the spice and some flavoring I expect from my Thai places, but it was far from a disappointment.  It was definitely edible and if I need something to make a delivery minimum I won't hesitate to get it again.

The Chicken Fried Rice was amazing.  Very flavorful and so god it didn't need any extra soy sauce to flavor it.  Again the chicken was cooked to perfection, plus the veggies to rice ratio was great.

So far I have not had a place that compares with Mr. Beijing in the year I've been in Vegas.  Though I'm always up for new places, it is nice to know I now have some place that has amazing flavors and quick cheap delivery when I'm looking for something familiar."}
{"text":"Orange chicken HAD to have been from yesterday and just warmed up.  Actually tasted like sweet and sour chicken.  rice was even stale.  how do you make stale rice?  Blech. wasted my lunch hour and $10.00."}
{"text":"Considering the price the food really lacks flavor. We had hot n sour and egg drop soup, garlic chicken, Mongolian beef, & chow mean. We didn't enjoy any of it. Also the atmosphere is very depressing and no music."}
{"text":"Family business always have a soft spot in my heart. Big mama runs the show she is nice and speaks fluent English no accent. So I can see this place being a pleasure to order from. Yes they deliver it is a $2.00 charge. I ordered out and it was fast and smells delicious. Lunch specials are great! Under $6 for lunch from 11am-4 pm.  Mama Beijing I will be back"}
{"text":"Nothing really special ... go to the mint indian place instead .... it wasnt horribly bad ... it just wasnt really great ...what threw me off was it wasnt very traditional ....they gave me thin noodle for chow mein like a super asian/ white dish fusion :|"}
{"text":"Great food and friendly service. Our food arrived hot within 45 minutes of ordering. I highly recommend ordering delivery from Mr. Beijing. My favorite dish was the chicken rice noodles. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Man if i could give it 6 stars i would this place is amazing and cheap were talking appetizer 3 alacart   Items white rice and desert for $31.00 we eat there and brought back half of it so you know its a deal when that happens   Service was out of this world felt like i was a family member."}
{"text":"Lunch special is definitely worth it hefty serving and freshly made I ordered the garlic chicken soooo good! Small and cozy in here and good service"}
{"text":"The food hasn't been as good lately, and they stopped accepting coupons.  Bummer!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch at 11:30.  I ordered General Tso chicken lunch combo. Came with soup and rice. Very reasonably priced.  Food was very tasty. My only complaint was that I tried to substitute brown rice for white rice (and pay the extra $1), but I couldn't get the waiter to understand my request. I just gave up and settled for the white rice"}
{"text":"This was the best Chinese food I have ever had!  The amount of food you get for the low price you pay is terrific!  I loved the cashew Chicken I had and they have bobo tea.  I had sugar free Jasmine.  It was amazing!  This is not too far from the strip and very much well worth it.  I will go here every time I visit Las Vegas!  Thank you Echo."}
{"text":"Good lunch if you need something cheap and easy to swallow. Dont order the soup."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas visiting, and our first day there we were hungry and wanted to relax a bit after driving found this on yelp and they delivered to our hotel so we tried it out and surprisingly the food was pretty good and fast delivery !"}
{"text":"Food made me vomit and unidentifiable meat!! So, Im a black guy (not the favorite of Chinese) so I wasnt expecting the royal mat from this place but being I am a cab driver, that has gone into Mr. Beijing, to let fares know I was waiting outside and the fact I (USE) to stop in on slow tip days to grab a bite, I felt, maybe, the quality might improve over time.  First of all, I am greeted by the nice lady with a look of disgust each and every time we have crossed paths.   That not deterring me, one night off work and hungry, gave this a place a shot for dinner. MISTAKE.  That was a bitter day that ended in me being bed ridden for 3 days thanks to a classic case of food poisoning.  I mean sick yall as a dog, no pun.  I say no pun because I am determined I ate dog for dinner that night.  If it wasnt dog, it clearly was something other than chicken, as I passed on the last portion and instead tried to decipher what exactly I had eaten.  I am a cab driver and a black guy, that has had plenty of people screaming rude things to me but I never let that cloud my judgement about the value of the establishment and I dont want you to feel my review is based off dislike.  It is truly beyond comprehension the Nevada Health dept has let this place stay open especially because I complained personally to Clark County about the awful case of food poisoning I got.   If I ever eat this food again its because a gun is being held to my head or Ive got a million dollars on the line, other than that, Im good on Mr Beijings. In this case I give -5 stars."}
{"text":"This food is the nastiest food I ever tasted in my life disgusting n when I called to tell them it wasn't good they hung up on me if U have money to waste on nasty food then go head b my guess n buy from here"}
{"text":"The food was great, and good service. My personal favorite is chicken and broccoli because it was delicious, and it benefits me.

The chicken was tender, the broccoli was yummy. I like eating it with rice, and I would come here again and order my second favorite dish, \"mala chicken.\""}
{"text":"I don't know why this place is rated so badly! Definitely a nice place to eat at if you're bored of everything aorund UNLV.

Location: Can be easy to miss if youre not paying attention, it kind of blends in among the other stores. But just look out for some asian props and you'll see it. 

Vibe & layout: Went around lunch time on a tuesday and were seated down immediately. Really chill place nothing special.

Customer service & food: Our waiter was super super nice. Letted us know about some specials they had and options. My friend ended up going with the lunch special for orange chicken? w/fried rice and egg drop soup, I went with the garlic chicken w/fried rice and egg drop soup. For the price definitely a great bang for your buck place. Egg drop soup was on point. Personally I liked my friends order than mine, I'm not too much of a veggie person and didn't know mine came with a whole bunch haha. Loved how the food was steaming hot when it came out too :)

Protip: They do delivery!"}
{"text":"This used to be one of a handful of places I used in my previous apartment for a quick dinner; whether it be delivery, or a quick run-in as it was really close and on my way home. One thing I particularly enjoyed & appreciated was the very friendly staff & solid service; one cpuld easily tell that it was truly family owned. Even after a few in-person visits, the main owner & cashier knows you by name after only a couple visits; even over the phone. In fact, upon my first visit, she actually aked for it first - before I'd placed my order. Little details like that makes an incredibly ardent difference for me.

Buuuuuut ......

It's definitely a hit & miss menu. I tried a handful of times to give the menu a fair chance after each order garnered one well done item, which works I suppose, but will it be worth it to the average customer to keep chugging along, \"Good Dish Log\" in hand, just because somebody may greet you personally? Actually, to be rather brusque - would even personal touches like that matter at ALL to somebody looking for chinese food in a city with a copious selection similar - and possibly better?

That doesn't mean everything is bad. The curry is always well done, though per usual with curry, one may need intestines lined with adamantium in order to get through what I consider sizeable portions. In other words, be just cognisant of the color of the crayon you pull out of the box; as it were.

One of my personal favorites almost anywhere I go are lettuce wraps - and they're an easy A+ at Mr. Beijing; easily on point with PF Changs - yet for half the price. 

The more popular items, such as Orange Chicken, General Tsu's Chicken, and Kung Pao, are again, hit or miss. They can be bland, to be sure - nothing to necessarily write home about - and yes, the battered dishes can be left soggy. Whether that's to be tacked up to not frying enough, too much sauce, elongated sitting time, or what have you - it was a commonality through most of the dishes; most of the time. Think of it as the 'Nachos Syndrome\" - the top (or in the case, the bottom,) is pretty likely to disappoint - but most of the time it's forgiven given the actual portion of substance is satisfying.

All in all, there was nary a time of regret after ordering. Are you willing to give it a try or two in order to find that handful of dishes you like? If so, you'll find it worthwhile, and get a very warm welcome and an old fashioned personal touch while doing so."}
{"text":"I went today for the first time in the last time I will never ever go back to this place the guy snatched my money and he was very rude had a bad attitude when he gave my food the rice tastes like water in the chicken was hard and it tasted like water no flavor or seasoning at all how are never ever eat there I made him give me back my money he got really upset started yelling at me but because it was another customer there he calm down and gave me back my money"}
{"text":"I called from my hotel and asked if they delivered, yes was the response.  After a 45 min. quote, I finally got my dinner 1 hour and 40 min. later!! (no exaggeration, I called twice to make sure they were coming).  Delivery guy told me delay was because I was so far away (what? I gave address when I ordered).

Then I opened the food: Shrimp in Lobster sauce ended up being shrimp in egg drop soup.  I have had this dish multiple times all over the country, this was bad.  I called after two big disappointments and was told I could get another dish delivered... no way I'm going to wait another 1.5hrs for bad Chinese food.  Lady was nice, but she is oblivious to the poor quality of her food.

Stear clear of this one, there are sooooo many choices out there."}
{"text":"It's 8 pm at night and I'm craving for some wonton soup. Without a whole lot of thinking, I put in a delivery order from Mr. Beijing for a wonton soup, chicken lettuce wrap and a ma po tofu. I'm sad to say I really hated all three items that I ordered. The wonton soup had a cloudy broth that was way too salty while the ma po tofu was drowned in this semi thick sauce full of overcooked peas. The only thing I felt edible was the chicken lettuce wrap. I will not order from here again."}
{"text":"I wish this place could get NO stars ! The only thing good here was the soda I ordered. I ordered the honey pineapple shrimp with pork fried rice and the rice tasted nothing like fried rice. It was orange and disgusting and the shrimp has a thick glaze and a weird taste. When I told her that the rice was bad she had an attitude and kept asking why was it bad. . I eat Chinese food all the time and never have a problem. I am so disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was very good, service was quick. Did I also mention tasty? The lady working seems a total sweet heart. Decor was nice and prices fabulous. Will seek out next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Small place but the food is great and the prices reasonable. My favorite dish is the Mr. Beijing Egg Foo Young."}
{"text":"Pretty good spot but not everything on the menu is good. I haven't tried everything but based on what I have tried, here's what I do/don't recommend:

Get: beef & broccoli, orange chicken, general chicken, chicken wings, ma po tofu

Don't get: sesame chicken, eggplant tofu, dumplings"}
{"text":"We came for lunch today, I ordered the sweet & sour pork, and orange chicken.  Both were delicious!  Service was speedy and  everyone was very friendly.  Great portion, and quality!  We will absolutely be back when we are in town next time!  :)"}
{"text":"Great food with very good delivery. The spicy dishes are very spicy but also full of flavor. The portion sizes are large enough for left overs and that says a lot because I can eat quite a bit. I have ordered from them many times and will do so again in the future."}
{"text":"Visiting Vegas and woke up with cravings for Chinese food, looked up for one close to my hotel. Ordered my meal on line, food was delivered at my door nicely warm! Ordered the Mongolian beef along with other things and I will give them 5 stars for flavor, how soon they got my order and it was delivered right at my hotel door!"}
{"text":"If I could give a lower rating I would. Nastiest food I've ever had. Only good thing was the fried rice. Everything else was terrible. Took almost two hours to get here. Wouldn't feed this to my dog. Meat was mushy and sour."}
{"text":"3 star for the food/atmosphere but definitely a 5 star for the service.  She was so gracious and I knew immediately she is the owner.  She had suggested stir fry baby bak choy which is just made for me (I am Chinese) so I immediately agreed to that without looking at the price.  I also ordered a Beijing Curried dish but that one was way too sweet for me (I had to be reminded that Northern Chinese like their food seasoned much heavier than what I am used to in Taiwan and Japan).  She knew I was not able to finish it.  I like her so much that I've ordered another dumpling to go (this is the Southern style dumpling with light dough which I found a little disappointing because I was hoping for the Beijing style dumpling with heavy dough.  She knew I am not a local (locals looked differently and dressed differently).  It was so kind that I will definitely return.  Tipped her $7 dollars for a $30 dollar meal..I bet she liked that."}
{"text":"Cute little Chinese restaurant on East Flamingo just west of Swenson.
Lunch specials are all $5.95 and there are about 12 different varieties to chose from.

It looks like I am eating all this food I post lately, but Im actually feeding my neighbor who has done a lot of nice things for me lately! Me? I sample the food, but really cant eat too much of all that sodium.

So, the 'hot and sour' soup was really good with a few pieces of tofu(which I liked). And his entree was the 'orange chicken' with steamed rice(which wasn't on the lunch menu, but the waitress gave it to him anyway). And, that was pretty good, but he said the rice wasn't up to par. 

But, hey! For $5.95 and all that food, Id say it was a pretty good deal.

Nice place, was clean and kinda old school 50's diner-ish. 

Give it a try if you're in the area. I will go back and they deliver as well."}
{"text":"Great little place! Food is good quality at an affordable price. The fried rice is excellent! Better than some of the more expensive places around the strip! Family dinner with soup, fried won tons, 2 entrees and fried rice was more than enough for a family of 3 at a reasonable prices."}
{"text":"In this case, the Yelp general rating and reviews here have let me down.  Nothing about Mr. Beijing was above average, I'd actually put it a little below average. They meet about what I expect for this kind of place if they are not preparing food to order.  It all tasted like buffet food that just came out of a warming tray.  The service was incredibly fast which is telling that they weren't actually cooking it to order. Stale & flavorless, barely warm, and didn't look particularly appetizing.  Generally sesame chicken is not quite so yellow, it looked more like lemon chicken with sesame seeds, but it was definitely an attempt at Sesame chicken, but the meat was stale and had an odd flavor and the sauce didn't taste like what I've come to expect and again, was mostly flavorless. The most surprising thing to me was the white rice, it was actually undercooked and crunchy. Or maybe it was dried out and overcooked from sitting around too long.  I have never had a low-end chinese restaurant screw up white rice.  I'll at least give them 2 stars because other than the rice it wasn't inedible.  I probably should only give them a single star because in my home city, a 4 star rating on a place like this would be a neighborhood favorite that cooks everything to order, and a place producing food of the quality I experienced at Mr. Beijing would only be visited by folks who don't know any better. Vegas seems to have high end overpriced places o' plenty, so I expected the standards for lower end stuff to be a bit higher.  I'm disappointed that I was wrong about that."}
{"text":"The wait staff were very friendly! The lunch specials are big portions! Two could easily share! Sweet n sour chicken and Cream cheese wontons were excellent! I would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"overall, not horrible. 
the worst thing we had was the chicken and broc. it was pretttyyyy bad, the broc tasted undercooked and just had either a prefrozen taste or a fridge taste. i couldnt tell, just was not edible. 
the kung pow chicken was actually pretty good.
the garlic chicken however, not so much. the chicken was passable (minus the bone/cartlidge thing i got) the veggies were pretty bad though.
overall i wouldnt recommend it. its pretty hard to find and a homeless guy wanted to wash my car windows \"for $100 dollars\" so... yeah, im not going back."}
{"text":"Mom and pop operation is good. Their specialty drinks are what I'll come back to."}
{"text":"Food was dank af but they forgot to give me the two orders of rice I ordered. When I called to complain that my rice was missing they generously offered to deliver the rice to me however it has now been 40 minutes later and the rice has not arrived. The restaurant is 15 minutes away. Despite the rice drama, the General tsos chicken that I had was very yummy and flavorful. I did enjoy the chicken but it wouldn't been a lil better with some rice. The egg drop soup was not the best I've had.
***Update: the rice has arrived. All is well."}
{"text":"Friendly service by owner but gave me food poisoning and spent a day puking followed by a week of stomach pains!  Never going back!"}
{"text":"I got delivery here, took them a hour to get here, they couldn't find the place, the driver called me and didn't speak English, so that was a huge pain in the ***. I drove out to the gate to find him in my Apts, he wasn't there. They forgot the chips for my soup that I specifically asked for, they didn't understand me in the phone. I wish I didn't pre tip them on my credit card I will never do that again. I'm my opinion tips are earned. There food was bland. I threw out the hot and sour soup cause it was to spicy and way to sour like I am eating a cup of vinegar and well I just didn't like the taste. It's sad people own restaurants and don't take pride in what they do. If your going to own a restaurant and sell food to people, make good food, and do good service. Learn English I know people may think that sounds close minded but I'm not trying to make a living in china not knowing any chinese. I'd never do that and if I did go to china id know enough Chinese to get by. They didn't understand anything I was saying and if u have ordered delivery before for a Chinese restaurant u know how annoying that can be. Waste of money and time I really wish I never ordered from them."}
