{"text":"This is definitely the better of any Chinese restaurant, take-out & delivery!!! I use to to drive to Peoria for Chinese food but they went under new ownership & went down hill.  Chef Panda's food is original, cooked right, very delicious & Not greasy at all!! Will always come here in our local city when we need our Chinese food fix for sure."}
{"text":"I find these poor reviews interesting, as I have frequented this establishment half a dozen times now, and I have had nothing but excellent food, and great service, I wish everyone could enjoy what my family has from Panda Chef! The first two times, I had the food delivered, and it was within a reasonable time for a Thursday and Saturday night.  I've had the take away, and the food has always been hot and fresh waiting for me when they said it would be.  I have eaten in with my daughter, and she loves the Orange Chicken! The orders have always been correct, and hot and fresh.  But it's about the food here! The Orange Chicken is excellent, crispy, not sogged out by the sauce.  Tons of flavor, and is now always an order for us. The egg foo young was exceptional; large patties, firm, with tons of large chicken pieces in the gravy. I've had the chicken, the shrimp, and the Combination, and all where full of meats and vegetables.  My wife loved the broccoli beef (I'm not a fan personally, but it was good). I have also had the Chef Special Happy Family, and oh wow! Pork, beef, chicken, shrimp, in an excellent sauce! One of my favorites! I have a list of their Menu items that I am working though every time my family eats out for here.  This has become our go to Chinese food place, and even though it's further than the other two closest Chinese food establishments, this is the best place for us! I even recommend it to all of my friends! The portions are always large, the have to tape the container to keep all of the food stuffed inside!  My wife and I are currently waiting on an order of Cashew Chicken, the Orange Beef (really excited about this one), and Chicken egg foo young! I will update with the tasty descriptions as soon as we eat them!"}
{"text":"I'm not easily impressed trying new restaurants, but WOW! This place was so good I felt compelled to log into yelp to write a review. I'm not exaggerating lol, easily the BEST Chinese food I've ever had. We ordered it takeout, and they have the option for online ordering which is really cool. The delivery guy was very humble and super appreciative for our order. I was very impressed!!!"}
{"text":"I will never go back to Panda Express after eating at Chef Panda! It was truly delicious, the orange chicken is actually chicken, great sauce, actual noodles for the chow mein. There was so much more food for the same price you would get at Panda Express! Best Chinese food in surprise!"}
{"text":"This is our second time ordered picked up from here. Both experience were very good. The older man, I assume is the owner greeted me with a warm smile. The guy who took my order over the phone was excellent. The price is good and the portion is big, we ordered BBQ pork fried rice, orange beef and egg rolls, they were all delicious, food was hot and fresh. We have enough for leftover. Definitely a great Chinese take out to go place. I used to order from Chen wok, they were good, but chef panda is even better especially they are on my way to home from work and they are even faster then Chen wok. Love this place."}
{"text":"Delivery menu was on our door when I came home from work so we thought why not give it a try. Delivery was fast and the food hot, fresh and it was really good."}
{"text":"This place is so much better than Chen wok. It is amazing and huge portions for a great price. Will never order from anywhere else"}
{"text":"This review was actually for panda express NOT Chef Panda. Dont know how that happened but my apologies."}
{"text":"Great customer service! The food is fresh and delicious! Highly recommended if you are looking for a satisfying meal!!!"}
{"text":"Always great here. Staff very sweet.  The food is some of the best Chinese I've ever had in Arizona."}
{"text":"Something has changed in the past year. Food has gone from awesome to blah. Won't order again."}
{"text":"Our second trip to Chef Panda - the food is meh - 1st and 2nd time.  My husband ordered Mongolian Beef and I the Hunan Beef.... We sampled each other's meals - and decided the same brown sauce on the Hunan was on the mongolian beef.  They tasted identical.  They were generous in the portion, generous with the vegetables but overall flavorless until we doused it with soy sauce and chili oil.  Ordered the egg rolls also - which was freshly prepared but contained very little on the inside of the egg roll... it was a great spring wrap with not much wrapped inside of it.  Tried the eggdrop soup which was good but not awesome.  There is no ambiance here.  Someone commented about the chatty owner... I'm not sure they were at the same restaurant...  We saw three men ( We called the grandpa, Dad and brother - but who knows who they really are) it was the cook and two other men that definitely had connection to the restaurant...No one ever said anything to us (except the girl that took our order and delivered it and later did say goodbye when we left and brought us white pepper from the kitchen for our soup).... The men never acknowledged us though all three were in the dining area at various time and/or eating on break.  If you just want to pretend to eat chinese - come here - but there is no chinese flavor happening here..it was bland brown gravy/sauce.  I saw pics with people eating off plates - those were obviously the \"at home diners\" because we ate out of styrofoam box.  We will stay with Nang-Jing, a local restaurant in Sun City for the price will include eggroll, wonton , tea and crumbles for your soup all included in the price.  Nang-jing has modest size plates with all the trimmings,lots of flavor and at a great price.  They will remain my \"go to\" place for chinese."}
{"text":"Not good at all.. We ordered two lunches and the overall presentation was bad and the taste was poor, it was not fresh, the people were nice, but the food was poor."}
{"text":"I ate here a few weeks ago but have been slacking on my Yelp reviews lately. This place is just too good NOT to review. While I was happy with every aspect of my experience, I would have to put the customer service as the #1 thing that impressed me the most. I went in with my six-year-old son and ordered carryout. He asked me if he could play a game on my phone while we waited, so I handed it over and he started playing away. An extremely friendly gentleman came up to us and said that technology was fun but it was also nice to play with physical toys and actually gave my son a super cool light up spinning toy!!!! I asked one of the staff members what his name was and they said it was Patrick. He wasn't just nice with us though. He had a genuine smile on his face and greeted all of his customers as though they were long lost friends. One of the local pastors came in with his family and Patrick greeted him with a \"Hi Pastor ____.\" Another woman was raving about some kind of soup that Patrick recommended that cured her child of the cold s/he had. This guy seriously remembered everyone. As far as the food goes--delicious! We ordered the orange chicken, teriyaki chicken and sweet and sour chicken along with some lo mein and fried rice. Everything was hot, fresh, delicious and prepared quickly. The prices are reasonable as well. We went there again after our first visit and will be back many, many times in the future."}
{"text":"The food is mediocre at best.  We ordered Kung Poa, shrimp with vegetables, and crab puffs.  The kung poa was very bland, the shrimp tasted funny (as in old and frozen and then heated and thrown into the dish at the last minute) and the crab puffs had no crab and very little cream cheese (and were burnt).  The sauces tasted very similar as if they only had one base and altered it very slightly for each dish.  We will not be going again."}
{"text":"Tried for the first time today. I had he Kung pao chicken it was not that good. The sauce was good but chicken was rubbery"}
{"text":"Wonderful food, great prices and really fast Enough said its great place. I order out here maybe fives a month"}
{"text":"Just ordered from chef panda for the first time.  I initially ordered delivery but was told it would take 75 minutes.  I understand it was 630pm on a Friday, so I decided I would do pickup instead.     When I arrived my order was ready and bagged up, I asked if all the sauces were there and they said yes.  I ordered general tso chicken and orange chicken for my wife.  Upon getting home, the order was almost right... except my orange chicken.  It didn't have any sauce on it and appears to be the same chicken used for sweet and sour chicken.   I called and spoke to a girl who said that is how it's supposed to be for them (I've never seen orange chicken this way).  However, there was no sauce in the bag which they told me there was.   When I asked what thery are going to do aboujt it I was told that I can drive back to them to get sauce, otherwise there was nothing they could do.    This poor customer service just left a horrible first impression.  They do delivery and could have offered to bring it out to fix the issue they created.  Im let down and frustrated that my wife's meal is now tasteless chicken without any sauce (aka she now gets general tsos which makes me even more mad.... ha!).   We will try somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"Their food is great and their staff is exceptional! I highly recommend Chef Panda. Their customer service is phenomenal. You get tasty food and they make you feel like a valued customer.  You don't get that many places nowadays. Thank you Chef Panda!"}
{"text":"We usually go to Panda Express my husband really wanted Chinese food so I went with it. I'm so glad I did so much better than Panda Express for sure we got the orange chicken for our kids and teriyaki for ourselves and the soup was like egg drop soup but with corn so good!! Next time we are getting the chefs chicken to mix it up! I'm excited for our next trip! Customer service was amazing they were so nice and friendly. Keep up the good work!!"}
{"text":"We ordered from here (Delivery) last night, we got the Crab Puffs, Chicken Pad Thai, Shrimp Lo Mein and the Pot Stickers.  Outside of the Crab Puffs being a little less Crabby and Puffy (wish there was more filling) the mean in all was great!  I only gave them 4 stars because the Crab Puffs, otherwise it was a great experience.  The delivery driver was LITERALLY at my door the at the time it was supposed to be delivered based on the text message I got; I paid online and through that system it sent me a text message.  I will definitely eat (from) here again!  Great Experience!"}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. I ordered the orange chicken lunch special and it was still crispy even with the sauce. Best orange chicken I've had. The wonton soup is awesome too. Best service too. The place is clean and authentic. New favorite spot."}
{"text":"Good food, great service, and good price. The food is fresh and well seasoned and arrives quickly."}
{"text":"Everytime I order from this place, I am NEVER disappointed. They go above and beyond. The delivery drivers are ALWAYS amazing and the food is piping hot! They care about their customers!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place over the weekend. My family actually really enjoyed it. We ordered orange chicken, moo shy chicken and teriyaki chicken. Large portions, friendly staff and great prices. Definitely better than panda and other local Asian restaurants."}
{"text":"honestly the food is pretty freaking great but I gotta give it four stars cause lately they've been really messing up my orders, like when I order white rice and they give me brown.... sucks"}
{"text":"This was our First time trying Chef Panda and it was so delicious! The nice cashier was super friendly too we will definitely be going back! The Orange chicken comes with the sauce on the side which was new to us but was actually very delicious! Also the LoMein noodles have so much flavor! Good, fast and friendly service!"}
{"text":"Been to chef panda twice now and both times the food was delicious.  Sweet and sour pork was cooked perfectly.  The almond chicken was good too. Orange chicken was great!   **Update: All good things must come to an end. So the beginning of the end for Chef Panda happened when I ordered delivery for me and the kids. We have ordered delivery before and been very satisfied-- not this time. I ordered the usual for the kids-- orange chicken and low mein. For myself, I ordered the Mu Shoo Pork and hot and sour soup. When the meal arrived everything looked fine until I started to unpack the food. The low mein was fine but the orange chicken seemed to have been over cooked to the point the pieces were like small stones deep fried in batter with orange flavored sweet & sour sauce. The Moo Shu filling was delicious-- but if memory serves me, Mu Shoo is supposed to have crepes. There were no crepes with the order. The hot and sour soup was overly spicy and overly sour.   So I thought, hey, everyone can have a bad night so I chalked this experience up to that. **sigh** it appears that is not the case. My wife and I stopped by to order food to-go. We were going out that night and didn't have time to cook. Stopped in and ordered dinner, I had the sweet and sour pork and my wife had one of the beef dishes-- I forget which one. We arrived well before three others and were served last, even after we asked about our order. The food came out and was almost inedible. The sweet and sour pork was, once again over cooked and my wifes dish had too much sauce-- the beef was drowning in the sauce.   So bummed...."}
{"text":"Great food and great delivery. The gentleman who delivered my food had great customer service. My first time eating here and I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Moved to Surprise from Glendale we were sad not being able to order from our usual spot. But we have found our new favorite place to get Chinese food. We got 3 lunches and crab puffs! Food got to the house fast and hot! Just what we needed from a long couple days of moving and unpacking! Good portions I got the orange chicken it was tasty not spicy like the usual orange chicken. Looking forward to trying everything!"}
{"text":"I wasn't going to order thanks to the 1st review but I am glad I tried it after all. The orange chicken was crispy and sooooo good and the portion size was more than enough!The chicken broccoli was good as well, lots of chicken and veggies. Orange chicken is my favorite so far. My husband and I will definitely be ordering again! Finally good Chinese food that delivers! Chen wok is disgusting!"}
{"text":"The food was good, it's a step up from panda. Had beef and broccoli and beef lo mein, good flavor, fast delivery."}
{"text":"Say word! We're originally from NYC and Chef Panda is as close as one gets to a taste of good Chinese food out here. East coast style. For a to-go place, it's explosive and tasty food has no comparison in the area. The owners? Great people who support the community."}
{"text":"Fast, reasonable, and tasty! Chef Panda is great! We ordered their shrimp lo mein, bbq pork fried rice, and the orange chicken. It was delicious! We will definitely come back and the staff is great."}
{"text":"The lunch special are all I can write about ,  I have ordered all of them by now. Usually they are a  tad greasy, but very  tasty. My fav is the amazing chicken, I usually don't eat chicken.  Pay the dollar extra to get the lo mein  it's worth it . The owners and staff are very nice , and they go out of there way to provide good service."}
{"text":"young american girl working on the register was on her phone when i came in. when i walked up to the front she was at a table so i didnt know she worked there, she looked like a customer. i had to approach first. then i came to ask if they were hiring and her tone was really rude. she said \"no were not\" very bluntly and rude. customer service goes a long way. if youre not hiring youre not, but you dont have to be rude about it. how about a \"sorry not at the moment\" with a kinder mannerism. i felt highly disrespected and walked out feeling really unwelcomed. what if i was a customer?"}
{"text":"This is our go-to spot for Chinese delivery. The Orange Beef and Low Mein are the best in town and my husband loves the egg fried rice.   Not only is the food great, the staff is super polite and the owners are great people."}
{"text":"I ordered for delivery on 7/5. It showed up and was a disaster. Several containers were BADLY leaking all over the place. It was a total mess. They had to have known because there was a huge puddle collected on the bottom of two bags. The Moo Shu pork came with 2 yes 2 pancakes for a pint of filling. WTF? Taste was so so at best. Rice SUCKED. Not a huge fan of any Chinese restaurants in the area now I can add Chef panda to that list. As I said in an earlier post, If you want great East Coast Chinese food, Go to Kowloon in Saugus, Ma. If you want great West coast Chinese food go to Hon Lin in San Bruno, Ca. Nothing else measures up. I know there are great Chinese places in NY, Ca, and of course the famous Ruby Foo's In Montreal. I guess great Chinese food is harder to find outside of NYC, The bay area and possibly Hawaii. Oh well it is what it is."}
{"text":"I've been ordering from Chef Panda since they first opened. Last nights dinner and service deserves a review. First, their food has always been amazing! So flavorful and great portion amounts. We have tried the orange chicken, the Mongolian beef, the house fried rice, pork fried rice, chicken fried rice, spring rolls, curry chicken, sweet and sour chicken, crab puffs and last night the chicken pad Thai. They have all been amazing! I used their online ordering system and it's very easy to navigate with more space for any extra instructions. My daughter has a peanut allergy and they are always so accommodating in regards to this. Their customer service is amazing! They are so friendly and the establishment is clean all of the time. The delivery is very fast (under 40 minutes for us). I could ramble all day on this place. Best food in the area hands down! I recommend everybody give it a try!"}
{"text":"My family and I all ordered different dishes again this evening, and they were all great! Our order even included a few complimentary items for sampling that we will definitely order in the future. Anyone utilizing the yelp app to decide whether or not you want to try a place based on reviews don't let any commentary left by a person by the name of jeff c dissuade you this guy thinks he knows more about the restaurant business than anyone and alot of his posts are ignorantly written and spiteful,  just click on his name and click on more about him and read not only his posts but why you should read his post answer, and I quote,\" because I know more about the restaurant business than you do\" JOKE. Don't let the the self absorbed biased reviews of one fool change your mind about your dining preference unlike him you have a brain try chef panda and decide for yourself you won't be sorry."}
{"text":"They had a coupon in the entertainment guide so I decided to check it out. I went to use it and they wouldn't let me and claimed they had no knowledge of the coupon. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"First time ordering from Chef Panda,  was pleasantly surprised, food was hot, fresh and DELISH. Delivery was quicker than expected. I will definitely order again"}
{"text":"I have ordered from Chef Panda twice for the lunch special. The food is amazing very tasty and the delivery service is amazing. The delivery guy is the best very nice and on time. The second time he remembered my 7 year old and brought her a gift! Best place ever all around definitely ordering here again! I order the orange chicken spicy with fried rice and I have never had it better anywhere else. I also ordered the house fried rice and the flavors are amazing the chicken and beef and shrimp all great love it!"}
{"text":"Mongolian beef, mushroom chicken and lobster sauce shrimp are good. The crab wontons are okay. Good service good food, a favorite if in the Surprise area."}
{"text":"Got take out for the first time, the food was good , the Orange chicken was very crispy and flavorful fried rice was good so was the moo shu pork egg rolls are very small and just ok we had the food delivered and it arrived hot in a timely manner delivery fee is only $2 portions are very generous. Will not hesitate to order from them again. Good place!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today, tried yet a new place. Both of us were disappointed, first the place is very small, I would say really mostly for takeout. Man behind counter was very nice but very slow. And no ice or drink fountain. $1.00 for winco water. The 1.99 for 24 kind. So I guess the price was for chilled. First off egg roll was so small, wondered what was in the tiny bag and no red sauce at all to dip it in. Husband had lo-Mein. He said not very good and didn't finish it. I had cashew chicken, not great either. For the price you can get more at other Chinese restaurants that we usually go to. And to top it off both our stomachs are in an uproar, I had no breakfast so I can't blame it on anything but the Chinese food. Another disappointment, why does this place have 4 stars????  So now, we won't ever go back, and I am off to find something to make my stomach stop hurting."}
{"text":"Great food and such a nice atmosphere.  Derrick who waited on us was so very nice -  The food was delicious! Super fresh - We had a great time -"}
{"text":"The food is great... but the people who work in the front need some grooming... kind of nasty"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Asian food and am always down to try new places. I just don't understand why there are no places here in Surprise--ok--Saigon Kitchen IS the exception--but no other places in Surprise that can do Asian cuisine. While the portions here are VERY generous, it really doesn't matter how generous if the food is just meh. The service is nice, the prices are good and they try really hard to please, but you can't get past the meh food."}
{"text":"Food is always pretty darn good. Never felt like I didn't get what I paid for and that's a plus. Living in L.A, I got the opportunity to scout out some really nice mom and pop joints that bring you that real Chinese food. My test for a good Chinese restaurant is always order the walnut shrimp. If they don't make it you probably walked into the wrong joint. If they do and it's great you got a winner worthy of the list. Chef Panda makes my list of Chinese food joints I would always frequent and not be disappointed.  Price wise they are very fair, and if you're smart you'll catch the lunch specials which is actually a lot of food for the money.  They deliver and the longest wait time for me has been about 45 minutes, and in the middle of lunch hour so that's pretty good.  It's the only place we eat old school Chinese food in AZ, and if they're not open we wait lol. 5 solid ones for this place."}
{"text":"tried this place after flyer left at my door , was great food and not bad prices at all!!  one of my fave places now in surprise"}
{"text":"Dis-gust-ing. New place and we love Asian food so we thought we'd try this place out. Mistake of EPIC proportion. Crab Angels = good. Egg rolls = meh. I've had worse, I've had better. My husbands cashew chicken was completely tasteless and watery. His thought \"a turkey sandwich has more flavor.\" Seriously, all we could taste was celery.  My lemon chicken = OMG nasty. There was gristle rolled up into these nasty little fried balls of crusty greasy lameness. I spent the next 48 hours in my bathroom thanks to Chef Panda. Never, ever, again."}
{"text":"I used to love this place. The orange chicken was amazing. But ordered tonight and everything changed. The sizes are smaller and packed differently. But worst of all all the food was extremely flavorless. I order the general tso's chicken and orange chicken. They went from having the best orange chicken to possibly the worst I have ever had. Do not eat from hear. Sorry hate leaving this but lesson learned. Don't change something that was already good. They said they have a new cook....he or she needs to learn how to cook"}
{"text":"Tried this for the first time last night. Not only was the delivery quick the driver have my wife a Halloween mask and said \"sorry I missed you last night\". Food was the best Chinese food I've had in Surprise yet.  2/9 Ordered again and loves it. Great delivery driver, awesome service. Will continue to support this local business."}
{"text":"The food was fantastic! The portions we generous and the service was even better. We ordered many items and all of them few delicious. We will defiantly be coming back soon.  Thank you Patrick for your great service and the kids thank you for the glasses."}
{"text":"Linda's place first opened, we had a slight problem with our first order of sweet and sour chicken. We started to try them again. It turns out things have improved. I've tried ordering them through GrubHub and Uber Eats. And both times the food has been very good. And they cooked each order to your specifications."}
{"text":"my family loves this place! their portions are well worth the money! we can feed our family of 5 on 2 entrees! sesame honey chicken is delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Disappointed.. So close to our home & had mostly great reviews, but our experience was less than satisfactory. We ordered veggie fried rice, egg rolls, orange chicken, and teriyaki chicken with sides of teryaki and extra sides of sweet and sour. We were told it would be 35 minutes for delivery. We waited over an hour for our food to be delivered (we live about a 30 second drive from the place), & all of the food was cold. The egg rolls were very tiny but good, had they been fresh and warm I'm sure i would have loved them that much more. We did not receive any of our extra sides of sauce. The orange chicken was very spicy and not orangey tasting at all.. And the veggie fried rice was crawling with mushrooms which were not mentioned when I initially called and asked about the ingredients. Sort of ruined it for me. We might try this place again some time.. Maybe not delivery and just egg rolls and teriyaki chicken though. & The staff was nice, that's a plus."}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times, but have never left a review. The staff and owner are always very friendly and helpful. I usually get the orange beef which is my absolute favorite from here. Today I went for lunch and decided to try something new. I got the Amazing chicken and just like its name, is amazing!"}
{"text":"FINALLY!  Good Chinese take out/delivery in Surprise. Sweet and sour is BOMB! They give you lots of food for the price.  The owner is a really nice guy too!"}
{"text":"Holy smokes!  Was about to go out to eat, and found a menu in my door! Decided to take a shot and so glad I did!!!! Amazing food and quick to my door! Definatley will be ordering again"}
{"text":"Wow! I love this place. The food is amazing, it was fresh, and how lovely is Bailey! She was so accommodating and attentive. The chef special chicken is a must, and the chicken fried rice is amazing as well. I won't take a star off, but the egg drop is mediocre at best. Everything else was so amazing it didn't matter though. The place is a ma&pa type shop it's not very decorated, but they provide really cool book and stuff to look at while you wait for your food. I will be coming back here. The price was also good for the food we received."}
{"text":"This is our second time ordering from here and this time was just as good as the first time!  Patrick, the owner is so friendly & the staff is great too!  We ordered sweet & sour chicken, pork fried rice & wonton soup....it was delicious!  We'll definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Just Somewhat Average  This was my first visit to Chef Panda. The restraunt is clean and the staff are accommodating   On this visit I ordered egg drop soup, chicken egg foo young, and bbq pork (appetizer). The soup was one of the best that we've had. The portion size for the bbq pork was good, although it didn't come with rice and the pork was somewhat overcooked, I really didnt care for the taste.  The Chicken Egg Foo Young was just kind of average, not bad and not anything special.  Will possibly return for soup and ms a different entree."}
{"text":"I just moved from FL, and I have to say, there food is absolutely amazing. I have been there like 3X in a week. The service and food was excellent."}
{"text":"This place has the best Chinese food I have had since moving to Arizona, and we will definitely be back. The egg flower soup was delicious, and the pork fried rice was amazing. Also, that tangy sweet dipping sauce for the egg rolls was the best. Thank you for the wonderful food!"}
{"text":"Been looking for a good Chinese place to get my fix. I'm from California so this was my first visit. When you walk to the entrance they have picture of some of their popular items.. kinda makes it seem like that's all they have on the menu but their menu is actually pretty big. The lady was nice and attentive when servicing us.  Everything is made fresh to order and doesn't take very long. My fav was the Garlic shrimp!"}
{"text":"I used to hate Chinese food, hadn't ate it for 15 years. I met my fiancé and of course he loves Chinese food. We moved to surprise and he found this place and brought some home and it was the best tasting most favorable Chinese food he ever had. I thought he was just trying to get me to try it so we could have it more often but he wasn't kidding. It is literally the best, and we now come at least twice a month. Everything is made fresh to order and hot! Try it out! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Ychhh. Ordered beef and broccoli, egg rolls, wonton soup, moo shu pork and spare ribs to take out. How can I say this? Everything was weird. The broccoli was so overcooked, it was inedible. The beef was slimy and tasteless. The egg rolls are minuscule. I've rolled blunts bigger than these.  The wontons were just small slabs of under cooked dough with no meat inside. Who puts cucumbers in wonton soup? The spare ribs were big and meaty but what was that wet brown sauce they were swimming in? The moo shu was OK, thats why I added an extra star, but the Hoisin sauce was watered down. The fake duck sauce was awful. I'm tough on chinese restaurants. I compare them to the better Chinatown places in Vegas, NY, Philly and San Fransisco. None in the west valley that I know of, ever come close. But this one is a distant last place."}
{"text":"HI PATRICK  Best Chinese food in Surprise and the food has gotten even better since the new chef arrived! Sesame chicken, House chicken, Amazing chicken, Mongolian Beef, Walnut Shrimp and Vegetable Beef are some of my favorites! I have dined in and had it delivered and it is always Fast Fresh Food! The menu is amazing with so many options. The location is great and always super clean. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Chef Panda is a hidden gem. Best Chinese food in Surprise hands down. I absolutely love the house fried rice, the bbq pork, and most of the chicken dishes. The dumplings are also worth a try, too."}
{"text":"So tonight was the third time we ordered from chef Panda. We have been surprised with the food being pretty good for delivery and even told neighbors and friends. Unfortunately tonight - a Monday - we placed our order at 5:20 and was told it would be 40 minutes. We called at 6:20 asking where our food was and was told they would be contacting the driver who left at least a half hour ago happened to be the owner Patrick. They called back saying he would be here soon...when our food arrived Patrick delivered and I told him we were concerned our food would be cold, we literally live a 5 minute walk from their store. He said our food would be good. When we were serving our food my husband fears were true --we paid $51 for cold delivery. I called back, briefly spoke with Patrick and he stated that the food was delivered within 40 minutes- which was not correct. I told him my husband had to heat it up in the microwave. Patrick was unwilling to make the situation better saying he can't come and pick up the food and reheat it and re deliver...my husband was very unhappy and I told Patrick we would not be ordering from him again and Patrick said OK and hung up."}
{"text":"We stopped because of a flyer that was left in our door. We are very happy for the flyer.  We ordered food and it was wonderful. We will definitely be back and they deliver which is plus. SO good"}
{"text":"I'm a big noodle fan and the noodles here aren't that great, the portions were small for the prices. The owner was very friendly and the place was very clean."}
{"text":"Decided to go here for a consolation substitute dinner. The place is empty and looks like any other fast food American-Chinese food. Ordered Chef Panda Beef and Seafood Chow Fun. Very surprisingly, they were very good with generous portions. The Chow Fun was one of the best I have had and my husband loved his beef dish. It seems like majority of people order food to go or delivery. Service was fairly quick. Very happy that there is a great Chinese place here in Surprise. Will be back here for more."}
{"text":"Found out about this place from a co-worker. Was a little tired of the same ole same ole so we decided to try it.   It's set in a small strip mall off Bell and Reems in the NW Valley.  You walk in and there are tables on each side. A lady at the front takes your order and you sit down with a number and wait for your food.   It doesn't take too long before the food is at your table. We shared the good sized portions. The food was delicious."}
{"text":"Sub par in my opinion. Got chicken fried rice. The chicken was dry. My husband got a combo meal. He also got fried rice, it was only rice with soy sauce. There was no meat or veggies."}
{"text":"Just moved to town and hoped to find a good place to order from. So good, they knocked it out of the park! No need to look any further! Everything was great"}
{"text":"I have ordered twice and each time the delivery has been quoted 30 mins and has been over 2 hours. I called and the response I got was it is busy. I will not be ordering again from this place, nor will I be recommending to anyone."}
{"text":"Since it is new and we are always looking for good Chinese food, we tried Chef Panda.  Sorry we did!  It is obviously set up for take out, as they only 4 combination meals to eat in, if you wish to.  We ordered their House Chicken; it was served in a styrofoam take out container.  Admittedly it was full of fried rice and chicken (maybe enough to serve two), but both were essentially tasteless!  The kitchen looked like organized chaos!  We will NOT be returning!"}
{"text":"We had the chef panda chicken, salt and pepper tofu, mushroom chicken, and the buda bowl. They were all delicious and still tasted fresh despite the 20 min drive home. It's a great place for take out and we look forward to trying more from their menu."}
{"text":"The food was fast, hot and delicious. We had a special order that was right on spot. They included a little taste for free. Will for sure keep calling them for our home delivery Chinese!"}
{"text":"Ordered Chef Panda tonight.....HAPPY we did!!!  Delightfully DELICIOUS.....the chef was kind enough to go off the board and STEAM our chicken and vegetables (to PERFECTION I might add) and sauce on the side.  Definitely A+ dinner tonight.....THANK YOU Chef Panda!!!!!"}
{"text":"Wanted some good Chinese food read the reviews and decided I would try it...This is literally the worst Chinese I've ever had.  I ordered the pineapple chicken and it has no flavor, it's sitting in a \"sauce\" I guess and the sauce is like oily water. I also ordered the fried rice, it too has no flavor. I typically would finish a meal because i spent my money on it, but I took a few bites and threw it away. Still after just a few bites, I feel sick to my stomach. Pretty upset that I wasted my money, should have just went to Pei Wei."}
{"text":"Love Chef Panda! We ordered for the first time last night and the food got there fast and it was HOT! The delivery man called my husband by name and was so so nice. He even brought a singing Santa hat that my 1 year old loves. Their sweet and sour chicken was crunchy and you could tel the sauce was homemade it wasn't that thick red sauce that is usually served at other Chinese restaurants. Their fried rice is really good too! The food wasn't greasy or oily and it tastes just as good reheated the next day. (Pictures are after we had eaten half, pretty good sized portions!)"}
{"text":"Home sick, so I ordered the hot and sour soup for take out........when it was brought to my door......omg, hot and steamy as if I had taken it right off the stove myself! Tasty? Uhhhh ya! Thank you everyone @ Chef Panda! You definitely have a regular with me and my family, and thank you for helping me feel a little bit better!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! First off we come in with our kids, and the first thing I see is a warm welcoming smile from an older man. He then proceeds to give our children the cutest rattler toys! Very kind! We then start ordering we got the orange chicken dinner  with lo mein and cashew chicken with fried rice. Let's start with orange chicken special, it was very good, all white meat chicken breaded and fried crisp, the sauce was good and it was not too sweet, the lo mein was chewy and had good crispy vegetables in it. It had good flavor and our kids ate everything, that rarely happens by the way. The cashew chicken also was good and it came with fried rice. The vegetables in the cashew was crispy and meat was tender, the rice was very good! Not oily at all and the flavor was delicious. This new cook knows his food and we are very satisfied with our meals, we will be back!"}
{"text":"Food has gotten better, the first time I tried this place was 2 years ago, I was hesitant at first to give them another chance but I'm happy that I did, I ordered egg drop soup and crispy chicken and shrimp with vegetables and rice, it was very delicious,  it's the best Chinese restaurant in surprise, I'm glad the owner improved their dishes."}
{"text":"The food is fresh and delicious! We finally found our Chinese spot. Everyone is very nice and friendly. Definitely the best Chinese place in town. The kung pao is delicious !!"}
{"text":"I loved this place. Beef Chow Fun outstanding and Chicken with pea pods. Both sauces are really delicious.   The best!  Cena Bojarski"}
{"text":"I lived in northern NJ for a couple of years (which in my opinion has the best Chinese food out of any state) and this is the only place in Surprise, AZ that comes close. I have had the privilege of meeting the owner and his employees. They are hospitable and make very good food! I do not get Chinese food from any other place. Good job Patrick!"}
{"text":"First time customer. Very friendly cashier. Ordered Kung Pao Shrimp and was disappointed with the brown sauce. It was sweet! Ingredients were fresh but I think they are inauthentic food. Probably to suit Americans but this American wants true Chinese food."}
{"text":"The staff here was EXTREMELY nice and helpful.  The food was definitely made fresh and tested great.  I highly recommend this place for Chinese take out."}
{"text":"Very good,  ate teriyaki chicken,  house fried rice,  special chicken,  spicy chicken.  Girl working there is nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Delicious and hot food, beautifully packaged and delivered within 20 minutes!"}
{"text":"Didn't feel like cooking tonight so we called grub hub and ordered from the Chef Panda. I had the twice cooked shrimp, my wife had the chicken curry. Both dishes were incredible, prices reasonable and grub hub delivered on time as always. I would highly recommend both the restaurant and grub hub."}
{"text":"I've been there many times and I've never had a bad dish they each seem to get better tasting each time. And they have great lunch specials. I would highly recommend this restaurant to anybody that likes Oriental or Chinese food!!!"}
{"text":"First time here...ordered chef special, chicken house rice, and Mongolian beef. The food was fresh and delicious. The owner was very kind and even gifted me a Mardi gras mask for Halloween. No military discount and rice could use more moisture. However, portions are family size so it's best to share. This is a great new find, fresh and yummy. We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Delicious food! If I were to compare it to San Francisco Chinese cuisine, I would say it's a pretty good competitor.  The boss is super nice and makes great conversation with the customers. Hard working employees and the prices are great! For only $5.99, I got myself a pepper steak lunch special and my mom shrimp with lobster sauce for only $5.99 too!!"}
{"text":"Chef Panda has some really good food. I especially like the Hong Kong noodles. So convenient for takeouts."}
{"text":"Chef Panda is the best! They went above and beyond tonight to get me my order even with technical difficulties. It came fast, delicious and was exactly what I wanted. Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Called them just before 3pm to get lunch specials delivered for a family of 5. They said lunch specials where over with. Spent $36 at another place. I'm sure they were way to busy around 3pm to git r done."}
{"text":"Wanted Chinese food today, usually order from Chen Wok, took a leap and ordered from Chef Panda and I'm glad we did, this food is awesome!   It arrived hot, not lukewarm but hot. The egg flower soup had so many fresh vegetables in it and tofu you could actually see and taste, the steamed rice had a pleasant hint of jasmine water and their egg rolls were the bomb! The price was reasonable and the service was fast, way less than the hour we were advised. I didn't mention any of the coupons they offered but they gave me the extra specials regardless.   I also have to say Derrick who took my call is the best order taker I've every dealt with, he was the most pleasant, helpful and energetic person, and an asset for this new business in Surprise. The delivery guy (didn't get your name, sorry) was stellar as well. We will be a repeat customer."}
{"text":"We will not be returning. We ordered wonton soup and egg drop soup. Neither had any flavor! The salt and pepper shrimp were very salty and had a lot of breading."}
{"text":"We recently moved to El Mirage which has very limited delivery options. We tried Chen & Wok which we were more than unimpressed with. We tried to order online (Chef Panda) but it said my address was out of the delivery area. So I called and double checked. They told me they would deliver to us. The food came in the time frame promised. The man who delivered our food was one of the nicest delivery people I've encountered. He gave us a free pair of Minnie Mouse ears which was pretty awesome and original. The food was packaged as if it were very precious cargo. He even said \"thank you for letting me serve you\" before leaving. The sauces were in separate containers, as was the chicken and sides. The chicken was impeccably cooked, the low mein was delicious. Nothing was weighed down by a bunch of oil. This was by far the best Chinese food I've had in Arizona."}
{"text":"Pretty good variety. Good prices. Definitely give it a try. I prefer this and Chen wok over panda express any day."}
{"text":"Went to Chef Panda for the first time today. What a great place. Amazing food and LARGE portions. Wonderful experience. The owner is the nicest guy and very personable, made the experience worth coming back on his own! The prices are also very reasonable."}
{"text":"Wanted quick carry out for dinner, decided on chef Panda. Not a wise decision! The Mongolian beef was extremely bland and soupy,  the steamed rice was dry, and the fried rice only comes in one size large so you are forced to buy more then you really need. The young lady who took my order was very nice and courteous, and it only took a few minutes to get my food and take home. I really wouldn't recommend this place there are many more choices in surprise area for Chinese food."}
{"text":"We order Chef Panda often. It's always fresh and delicious. I believe it's the best Chinese in Surprise. Tonight I ordered through the app and it was so easy. I recommend trying it!"}
{"text":"Excellent shrimp and crab puffs would recommend to this for anyone who loves real Chinese food this afternoon was great feel the real traditional food there."}
{"text":"First time going... Pot stickers aren't very good... Just plain.. The General Chicken had hard dry peices... Wont be going back"}
{"text":"Fast food Chinese at best.  If you dine in, your eating out of styrofoam plates and cups. The food is bland-NO flavor. The soups were watered down. The salt and pepper shrimp were excessively breaded (60% breading 40% shrimp)  We will not be returning, your better off going to Panda Express!"}
{"text":"Great service. Speedy food both in delivery and also pickup. Not your east coast Chinese American food but I'm already used to that difference here. But this is good food. I like the spring rolls and shrimp fried rice. Hubby likes the food a lot. Very polite staff. Nice place to drop by when you need quick good food."}
{"text":"Very good! We were in the process of moving , hungry for lunch so we found this place. Ordered easily online, delivery did say it could take an hour it ended up taking about 35 min , the food was piping hot the man that delivered was very nice. We got teriyaki chicken , fried rice, beef and broccoli, lo mein and egg drop soup. The soup was a little on the bland side but good everything else was excellent. Prices were great! We will definitely eat here again"}
{"text":"I'm giving it three stars because delivery was really fast. The only problem is the food was not that great. It was missing something and the potsticker were gummy."}
{"text":"As a lover of Chinese food, I had to try this new restaurant. It's also very close to home. Service was great. Owner talked with us about some decorating they would be doing and what we thought. He wants to be involved with the community, which Surprise needs. I ordered pork fried rice and egg Foo young to go. Both were good. I do prefer more gravy with the egg Foo young and I'm sure they would accommodate if asked. The prices are good too. Next time I want to try their lunch specials and taste their variety of entrees."}
{"text":"Best Chinese found since moving to Arizona! Great pricing too. The Mongolian beef lunch special had just the right amount of everything. I will definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"My wife and I just moved here and tried the closest Chinese place.   We got sesame chicken and egg rolls. The egg rolls were quite tasty, however they forgot to mention these were not typical egg rolls; these were about 3 inches long.   The chicken was way over cooked. It was crunchy and did not go down well. There was also no sauce on the on the chicken. I'm not talking a little bit of sauce. It was crusted onto the chicken.   We will not be going back here.   The one bright spot was that it was delivered quite quickly."}
{"text":"Ordered food for the first time tonight based on recommendations through FB.  Everything was tasty. We had BBQ ribs, fried wontons, fried rice and sesame chicken. The delivery took a little longer than we expected and they charge a delivery fee. All in all a good experience. We will be ordering from here again soon."}
{"text":"My new Chinese delivery!  Especially on a lazy night when you don't want to leave the house or cook! Fast and reasonable! Very nice guy that delivered!"}
{"text":"Excellent Chinese food! I took my family to this place, once we get our entrees everybody at our table was too busy feeding there mouths or not even on there phones & it's nice to experience how quiet our table is & that's a sign how scrumptious the food is! Small place but the food speaks for itself, the sauces they utilize aren't as strong or drenched all over their entrees like most places. The only thing missing is a good fresh brewed ice teas & hot teas. Definitely our new place to get Chinese food & I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"So far loving it! I've been getting the orange chicken lately and it's the best I've had in surprise, hands down! Beef fried rice is also a must! The delivery is always on time, if not early, and always greeted with a smile! This is my favorite Chinese in surprise after trying almost all of them!"}
{"text":"We had the house chicken,  sweet and sour pork,  and garlic chicken. All were very good and the portions are huge. Will be choosing this place again!"}
{"text":"After several very good orders (3 great orders) sadly tonight's order took a hard turn for the worse. What was quickly becoming a new favorite very quickly became a we will never call again. The Long wait and cold food could have been fixed with good customer service.... but that didn't happen either... the owner Patrick personally delivered the cold food then refused to make it right.   Let that lack of customer service speak for itself   50.00 for cold food and a owner who thinks that it's ok to not fix it. If you decide to try and the same thing happens to you ...... you have been warned"}
{"text":"This is good fast Chinese food. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. They seem to have a new pretty girl taking orders every week but these sly old dogs know what they are doing in hiring cute girls to take orders. They aren't always the sharpest knives in the drawer but they are nice to look at. Probably the best part about this place is that they will deliver to Desert Oasis rich is over 10 miles away! Another smart move, as no other place delivers this far out."}
{"text":"Heard of this place on one of the Surprise FB pages I follow. We hadn't really found our \"go-to\" Chinese spot. Stopped by to check out the menu and order take out after work. Everyone was very nice & friendly. They even gave my son a little toy while we waited. Place was clean & food was ready pretty quickly.   We LOVED the food. Great flavor & not too greasy! We will def be coming back  They also deliver!! Minus 1 star because portions are smaller than competing Chinese food places but over all we were very happy with our experience here!!   I think we've finally found our go to Chinese spot"}
{"text":"I always make a review when I go places for the first time, and let me tell you... My FAVORITE food is Asian cuisine, so I always love trying new places. Today, my husband and I went to dine in at chef panda in surprise. We ordered $23.00 worth of food, and while we were waiting, the cook and front desk person began engaging in a yelling match with each other. I was embarrassed for the poor girl, it lasted about 15 minutes. Then after we received our food (25 minutes later) my husband gets about half way through his meat and rice... And FINDS A COOKED FLY!!!!!!!! My husband is a cook at a restaurant near arrowhead, so he knows things like this happen, he didn't complain, just told the staff of the issue, and they did NOTHING but said sorry. We threw our food away and left. To top it all off... their AC was broken. We were the only customers there, I can't believe the service and integrity of these people. I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"First time and last time. Probably the worst Chinese food I've had. It's sad that the best thing was the steamed white rice. I had teriyaki chicken. It was dry and so hard, there were times I thought I had bit into a bone. My husband's pork fried rice was the worst we've ever had. The only edible thing were the crab puffs. We only ordered from here because the place we were going to order from didn't answer their phone. Should have ordered a pizza instead."}
{"text":"Best Chinese food in Surprise!!! Very tasty and worth it. Delivery was fast too. I have lived here in Surprise for 10 years and have tried every Chinese place in town. Chef Panda is by far the best one of all. Very happy!"}
{"text":"This is our go to Chinese delivery for sure! The food is always on point, the driver is always super sweet and friendly. Best Chinese I've had since I moved to Arizona."}
{"text":"The closest thing I have found to East Coast Chinese food here in Arizona. We ordered once and we weren't thrilled with the food but every other time it is fresh and piping hot when delivered."}
{"text":"Very good food.  Best sesame chicken I've had in a long time.  Their shrimp in lobster sauce is also great.  Easy in and easy out and the portions are large.  Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"I order from these guys pretty regularly. Foods decent most of the time. Today I ordered the chicken pad Thai and I gotta say, It's terrible. Not the right noodles. Not the right type of chicken. No peanuts. It really wasn't even pad Thai. Like I said decent food just don't order pad Thai if you except it to be authentic."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been looking for a Chinese restaurant to deliver to our location with great food.  We found this at Chef Panda when I Googled food delivery near me. I have a wheat allergy and their rice noodles are rich tasting. We had the Pad Thai.  Here is the most amazing thing about Chef Panda.  One of the items we ordered was missing.  I contacted the restaurant to let them know.  The owner got on the phone and said he'd bring it himself.  I was overwhelmed at not only the quality of the foods but also the service to the customers.  THANK YOU CHEF PANDA!"}
{"text":"Ok, here we go... Awesome food! Yes, I said it and I will say it again, Awesome food! I have only eaten at this place twice, once for delivery which was about 5 days ago and today 06/10/2016 in which I picked up my order. The place is very small. A great place for takeout or delivery. The gentleman who gave me my order was very friendly and suggested other items for next time. This review is about our experience 5 days ago.  The delivery was good; we did not have a long wait. I think it was like about 30 to 35 min. We ordered the Family Style Bean Curd (which is my favorite at this place) It had big pieces of tofu and plenty of large vegetables in a nice brown sauce. Second, we tried the orange chicken and that was very good. The kids ate that up really quick! I only got three pieces. Next time I'm going to have to order 2. Next was the beef chow fun, and that was fun to eat not to mention very tasty. Next was the vegetable fried rice. This was another hit, big vegies and the rice was perfect. The last one was the chicken lo Mein, this, according to my family was super good. For me, the noodles were larger then what I am used to in a lo Mein but never the less it was pretty good. Give this place a try. I do not think you will be disappointed. Sorry there are no pictures, food went to fast to take a pic"}
{"text":"This food was amazing. The orange chicken was phenomenal. I'm glad I came across this place while I was taking my son for his hair cut. So friendly. I will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"So we went here for dinner tonight. We usually go out once a week and eat out so we were dining in. We were the only customers in the place so our food came out quickly and it was hot (temperature wise - 5 STARS) I had beef skewer which was really good (5 stars), I also had the spicey beef (it was good but could have killed me) EMPLOYEES PLEASE ASK THE CHEF IF YOU DO NOT KNOW WHAT COMES WITH YOUR FOOD. This item had mushrooms which could have had SERIOUS health issues had I not seem them in the FOOD! Other than that the spicy beef was ok (3.5 stars) The person who had the kung pao chicken said it was bland and the chicken rubbery (1 star) and the other party got shrimp and noodles (dont know how many stars but he wasnt complaining). OK RESTAURANT OWNERS GO BUY SOME SILVERWARE AND PLATES AND SERVING DISHES AND SERVING SPOONS. Our food came out in a bunch of to go boxes. I was like - uh... we were going to eat here! They provided paper plates. Problem is since there was no serving spoons we had to dump the contents onto a small paper plate. This was extremely messy and I think I spilled more sauce than I got onto my plate. Also consider giving guests napkins (they had them in the kitchen)"}
{"text":"Chef Panda opened a few days ago I was a little excited because there isn't a lot of delivery for chinese in Surprise. Well that's where the excitement stopped so first there is no website and good luck trying to find a menu online. I ordered an American Chinese staple General Chicken because its a little hard to mess up or so I thought .The sauce was sour the batter on the chicken was soggy no flavor I said white meat I got dark and I asked for rice but no rice came.I also ordered pot stickers I don't know why they thought thickening hot and sour soup to make a dipping sauce was a good idea but that's what they gave me. So I called this place back let them know that I didn't get any rice. I also asked if they could remake my dish I asked for it spicy and asked if they could make my chicken crispy.He then tells me he doesn't fry the chicken and asks me how to make his chicken crispy smh He proceeds to tell me he will tell the cook to use less water so the chicken is crispy ? I'm guessing this place doesn't make their own chicken they get it in bags and steam it. Stay away from this place it was terrible."}
{"text":"Super fan of Chef Panda! I've eaten here about 3 times (take out) and have always been happy with my order! I know they recently went through some management/chef changes so there are some differences but it is still my favorite Chinese take-out in the area. The owner and employees are always friendly and give you that \"small business\" feeling. Food it always quick and delicious. I can only vouch for the Chicken/Broccoli and General Tso's Chicken - Both delicious!"}
{"text":"Sweet and sour chicken. Nummy, not greasy. Huge to-go portions. 1 order will easily feed 2. I wish I could give 4.5 stars. I don't have a good reason not to give it 5."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery for the very first time. Food was amazingly delicious and portions were huge. The only negative is that they forget one entrée but when I called about it, they were very apologetic and and offered a free item and had them both delivered immediately. Food was delicious. I will definitely try the again."}
