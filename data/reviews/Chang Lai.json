{"text":"This place is very good! They cook everything fresh so be prepared to wait for your food especially if there are lots of orders ahead of yours but in my opinion one of the best places at this food court."}
{"text":"Noticed this food court stall opening a few months ago and decided to try it out after my Taiwanese friend said it was good. 

Each dish is $6.99 plus tax and comes with a bowl of white rice. You order what you like and then the chef makes it fresh to order. They give you a choice of chicken, beef, or pork for some dishes. The food is comparable to what you'd get in a Chinese restaurant, seems to be super authentic, and is pretty tasty.  

If you're brave enough to try it, Ive heard that their intestine dish is extremely tasty as my friend comes back every week for it. Overall a nice place to grab a quick no frills lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Chang Lai is one of the stalls in the food court of the Le Faubourg center on St Catherines. Best attribute is its cheap food - I got the beef countrystyle with white rice for c$6.99. Portion size was ok, generally to the small side. Beef was tasty and fresh. Another positive is that it is one of the few stalls that are open on Sunday (Indian Place and Yuki Ramen as well). If you're in the area and don't have a lot of money to spend and want some authentic Chinese food, go here. My order took a while because there was a few orders in front of me and there are literally 2 people (one cook) at this place"}
{"text":"I really had to try this place after seeing it as the ROTD (review of the day for newbs). I've seen it before on the way to getting my Thai food. It's a small kiosk, what appears to be a man and cooking on a small gas wok cooker and his wife manning the cash register. Food appears to be Taiwanese/Sichuan. I say this as there is a decent amount of garlic and when you order she asks you do you want it spicy or very spicy? My selection was spicy. 

So I ordered one order of pan fried dumplings and a braised eggplant dish plus a country style pork with vegetables dish. What's seriously ridiculous is that each dish is $6.99. Sure it's a food court but they serve this with rice and for this price I question a) how they can make a living at this price and b) how good spicy Chinese food can be so cheap. 

Here's the deal on the food: 

1) pan fried dumplings- pork and corn with a very nice soy dipping sauce with sesame oil and a healthy amount of fresh garlic. Delicious interesting that there was corn in the dumplings and the pork was good not greasy or too fatty! 

2) country style pork- pork with peppers, onions in a very spicy thick black bean infused sauce that had a good amount of spice and flavour over rice. A bit more heavier on the oil side but delicious none the less. 

3) braised Asian eggplant with chicken, peppers, onion celery. Asians love to eat eggplant braised this way.  I can't explain it but you must try it. There is something about the soft texture plus the melding of vegetables, some mixed chicken plus a bit salty but thick sauce that tastes fantastic. Again this dish was a bit heavier on the oil side but over rice was really damm good as well. 

Downside of this place? The fact that it's very small, they can't handle high volume so I'm a bit hesitant submitting this review as if they become more popular the wait will be longer and my guess is the prices will go up. I know selfish but sometimes you question whether you want to keep a secret or share with others. I share as I'd like to see these two do well! I asked how long for my food. She said \" ten minutes\". Because there were a few orders before me it was almost twenty when I received it. 

Come check it out. If you see a few orders ahead of you and you don't have time, there are other great places in the food court especially Bangkok. If you have the time sit back as you are in for a very inexpensive gem treat that you will enjoy."}
{"text":"All the dishes are 8 dollars. Cash only. 
They are genuine Chinese dishes, especially the pan fired meat dishes with rice. These kinds of dishes really require a bit of skill: a strong arm to lift the wok to flip the ingredients, watch the color change and know the frequency to scrabble the ingredient. Not to mention the heat from the gas stove can finish the dish in a minute. That's really something."}
{"text":"What could have been a good looking, potentially tasty, and relatively cheap meal turned out to be worst chinese option at the Faubourg foodcourt. 

Prices are set at 6.99$ which is 8$ after taxes. It's still cheap, but quantity and quality don't measure up to others at the foodcourt. 

Allow me to justify the previous statement: Take a look at my photos and compare to those on the menu (other yelpers have posted them). We all know McDonald's photoshops pictures of their food, but the guys at Chang Lai probably stole theirs straight from the internet.

Indeed, the food tastes just as average as it looks: chunks of badly chopped celery, green pepper, and onion are stir fried in a wok. Throw in about 3oz of meat. Stir another 2min. Voila. 

The chicken was tender and tasted chicken, but didn't blend with the veggies (hard for chunks to release flavour in a 5min stir fry). And the supposed 'braised chicken' had not been braised, it was probably just coated in starch. Asked for spicy, got something that could have been 3x hotter.

The pork intestine has its chew and unique flavour, but the supporting flavours failed to blend in. Again, the spiciness level was underwhelming.

The only reason I'd go back would be when I'm in a pinch -- no waiting line and, as I mentioned above, it's a less than 5min stir fry."}
