{"text":"Food average,  processed. Bartenders terrible security awful all around bad experience would not recommend to no one now there cooking off a food trailer and taking it inside the worst by far"}
{"text":"The food here is great..... But is it worth your safety? No, people are constantly robbed or shot at outside of this bar. I guess the owner doesn't feel the need to have police there Thursday-Sunday. It's a nice place to dine, but don't get too tipsy because you need to be on guard when you leave. It's usually an late twenties early thirties on weekends mixed with an older crowd. But don't go without tight back up or you will be sorry :-("}
{"text":"Great place to chill and relax on a Sunday . I've heard of terrible things happening there , but I've never experienced any drama there. The food is good especially the firecracker shrimp. The drinks are overpriced and the bartenders aren't very attentive. Great live bands on Sunday's ."}
{"text":"The food was exceptional but the service was horrible and slow. I had the chicken Alfredo which was delicious my friend had the shrimp scampi which was also really good. But once again SERVICE WAS HORRIBLE we waited 35 mins for our food then when we it came out they brought my friends plate First and then brought my plate out 10 minutes later. Then when we were late ready to leave it took them 20 minutes to give us a box for our food. So like I said the food was delicious but the service was horrible!!"}
{"text":"The name is defiantly misleading. This is just your average neighborhood bar. The menu seems interesting until you are served average food at best. You would think having called themselves a wine bar there would be a great wine list, NOT happening. Your options for wine are red, white, blush. Good luck with that!

I said it was good for groups but that is only if the handful of large tables are not already occupied."}
{"text":"Everytime I come to this establishment the barmaids are so rude they have attitudes. They make you feel guilty about ordering your food. The service is horrible but the food is great. Black own black business need to do better"}
{"text":"The Chicken Alfredo was so good!! The bread was good too! It was about a 30-45 min wait but worth it."}
{"text":"Place is two small, they have great music that draws a big crowd but the venue needs to be renovated to compensate. There security is questionable and may be pocketing some of the money from the door. The place does have beautiful women that come there and a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"My go to neighborhood bar. The food is absolutely delicious and the live music is some of the best in Cleveland. A real gem with an unwarranted bad rep. Tilapia Alfredo and scampi dinner are both extremely delicious. Drinks are pricey..but oh well."}
{"text":"It's hard to rate this place . I love HWAG, and have been a loyal customer for over 3 years . Their food is absolutely AMAZING . From the many versions of Alfredo , smoked turkey chops , or simple chicken and fries , everything tastes excellent . 5 Star food at a 2 star price . The atmosphere when dining in is mellow. At one point they had a band on Saturday nights , but now there is a DJ. They have good drink specials , and the margaritas NEVER disappoint . 

The reason why it is difficult to rate , is because of the service . It seems like ever since they took on \"Uber Eats\", and other food delivery companies , the wait time for to go or dine in orders has been outrageous . On any given Friday or Saturday night , you will see a TON of people standing around the bar by the kitchen waiting for their food . Two weeks ago my boyfriend and I dined in . It took us a long time to get our food , and his Alfredo sauce was runny and milky . A couple of weeks before that , my friend and I dined in , ordered at midnight , and didn't get our food until 2 in the morning when it was closing time . As soon as we got our plates , they turned the lights on , and it took another 30 minutes to flag someone down for \"to go\"bags . Not to mention my food was brought out with no cutlery . I'm actually in my vehicle writing this review , because my boyfriend is still standing in the establishment waiting on food I ordered at 11:40 PM. It is now 1:12 AM , and he still hasn't come out . According to him , there is a young lady in there screaming because she ordered ahead , and still had to wait an hour for simple fried chicken and French fries . I'm not sure if they need more cooks in the kitchen on those nights , or less delivery chains under their belt , but this is getting out of hand ."}
