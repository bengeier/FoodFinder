{"text":"The food here was really great. I had the chicken Caesar salad and my boyfriend had the vegan burger (which he loved). The sweet potato fries were also on point! Cute little diner like feel with a great view of the strip..."}
{"text":"This was by far my least pleasant dining experience in Vegas. Everyone knows that Vegas is full of distractions and so you can safely assume that I wouldn't waste the time to write a negative review unless it was an exceptionally bad experience. 

The decor in the restaurant is misleadingly casual. This place is just as expensive as everything at Caesars Palace, yet it's less of an experience/atmosphere. When the food arrived, it was lower quality than a greasy diner. The sandwich patty I ordered was not even cooked and looked like mushy cat food on the bun. After sending that back, another plate with substitute/powdered eggs and half a potato was brought to our table. This was basically the equivalent of a cheap greasy diner $2 breakfast plate, but was unfortunately priced at over $20. With a bill close to $70 dollars for such low quality food, I recommend that you take your money elsewhere. There are plenty of delicious places nearby, so if you're going to spend that kind of money on a meal, you might as well go somewhere with tasty food."}
{"text":"Just ate here. Awesome food. Awesome service. The burger was amazing. Price is a bit higher but the portions are huge. Walked in here rando mly."}
{"text":"Bad service. Way over priced even go Vegas

Ordered Club sandwich and fries . Got Sweet potato fries that were cold. She said she will replace them. We were  almost done when we got another order of sweet potatoes fries but they were hot. 
Sandwich was a step below Dennys.

Sandwich & soda $20 before tax and tip. 
  
Never again for me."}
{"text":"We stumbled on this restaurant while walking on the strip, and I'm glad we did! The Ahi Tuna Salad was nice and light but very flavorful. Definitely leave room for dessert, the carrot cake was great and beautifully presented."}
{"text":"Guess who's in VEEEEEEEGGGGAAAASSSSS!?!? Lol! Happened upon this location and fell ABSOLUTELY in LOVE!!! One of the few outdoor locations in Vegas that has amazing outdoor heaters during the \"winter.\" The bartender named DIANA is AMAZING!! Her Fireball Delight is quite delicious! Make sure you stop by and see her! Her personality is a delight and she is worth visiting! :)"}
{"text":"This place is just terrible, from the beginning to the end. The Waiter was rude from the beginning and very slow. I understand in Las Vegas oftentimes a Waiter is extremely busy, however this restaurant was near empty. No excuses for the delay in service. When the food did arrive, it was terrible. Caesars Palace recommended this restaurant as \"family friendly\" and great for kids. 1. They do not have a kids menu. 2. The \"steamed vegetables\" were cold and hard. I ordered a sandwich and the meat tasted days olds with no flavor.  I would not recommend this restaurant to the homeless man on the corner! AVOID!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I came to this place for a quick bite before going to Absinthe. When I looked at the menu, I didn't see anything that I would want to eat at the time so I thought I'd just order an appetizer and a drink. We received a great service from our server who was very attentive. She suggested that they have \"mean mojitos\" there so I asked what would she recommend and she said that her fave was the Blackberry Mojitos so I ordered that. When I had my first sip, I thought it was good but tasted like there's no alcohol there but a few more sips later, I was buzzed! I loved it! I also ordered the Boulevard Nachos and it was so bomb! The steak was soooo good 
And it was a HUGE portion! Even hubby enjoyed it and he's not the type to eat nachos! Hubby had the Stripside Sliders and Island Mojito he said his was good too. I tried his Island Mojito and I wasn't a fan (coconut). I wish we had more time to finish our meal and order a dessert but we had to run as our show was about to start. But will def go back if ever we go to Vegas again!"}
{"text":"Replaced Serendipity outside Caesars. Smaller portions and more expensive. Nice service."}
{"text":"What a joke!!! 3 buttermilk pancakes for 19. Something!!! But hey, it includes free coffee or tea?!?! Ok it's vegas, and I might pay $50 for a steak, but not 19+ for 3 pancakes!!!"}
{"text":"Surprising random found while walking down the strip the night before. 2 for 1 Happy Hour all day and the checkin got us here but Nicks service and food will have us back again. He is very personable, polite and down for a laugh. 
My fiancée order the chicken and waffles and they were fluffy and flaky. The house potatoes with eggs and sausage were tasty, as well.
A great little find good for groups and right outside Caesars Palace."}
{"text":"Stopped by today to get out of the madness of a conference and was pleasantly surprised. I was looking for a casual lunch with a few colleagues at a restaurant that had a view of the strip.  

I had the BLT with a side salad and was very happy as it was a large portion.  We split the texas fries and the onion rings to start.  Huge portions!  My colleagues had the chicken panini, seared tuna salad, and a salad with steak.  Everything looked amazing and the tuna must have been from Nobu!

The desserts were definitely the best part.  The Carrot cake looked like it was from a french pastry shop and the cookie dough Sunday was amazing. 

I will definitely be back to the tuna salad and the carrot cake, and the view!"}
{"text":"Used to be Serendipity,  don't be fooled... The menu has been seriously downgraded,  it's just offering a very limited,  standard coffee shop type breakfast menu.  But they jacked the prices through the roof.   $28 for Eggs Benedict?  $20 for a Denver Omelet? This spot is off my list."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the friendliest staff that go out of the way to make sure you are satisfied with your need. Came with my family and they are all pleased with food and service. Totally recommend this restaurant. Location is great and prices are great! Our waitress Barbara is the sweetest and ensures drinks are always filled and that we are delighted with our entrees!"}
{"text":"Food was great at reasonable prices. Unfortunately, the chicken in my caesar salad was dry. Not dry as in \"slightly overcooked\", dry as in \"you could nail it into the wall\"...  All in all a good place to enjoy non-junk food but with major minus points due to the \"chicken accident\"."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious! The portions here are huge. Even my husband couldn't finish his food and he ALWAYS eats everything on his plate. The waitress we had(Laura) was nice and friendly and made sure we were okay and kept our drinks filled."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  I thought it was going be as good as it's predecessor......It introduces itself as a American Diner but nothing American stands out.  

Before there was a restaurant called Serendipity.   Serendipity had it's own style that targeted a lot of customers.  In Las Vegas if you don't have something unique, or different then you might as well close the doors.

Prices are reasonable only becsuse a drink is included  with your order.  Average cost per person is 20.00 and that includes the beverage (non alcoholic).

My wife and I ordered eggs benedict.  Poached egg on a warm English Muffin with a bland tasting hollandaise sauce.  Basically something you can easily make at home.  The breakfast potatoes also very bland and over cooked.  Used a lot of ketchup and hot sauce.......

I'd only recommend this place if you have a Groupon and / or 25 % Yelp discount.   If you neither I'd personally recommend Hexx or Sugar Factory. 
 
There is zero decor or food that stands out here.  

Service was great"}
{"text":"Had a blast here! Was on a conference and stopped in for lunch. Great food and cocktails, quick friendly service. Travis was our waiter. Very attentive. Suggested the steak Cobb salad. They also have a great patio if you're into people watching."}
{"text":"Will not be back. Food was just terrible. The calamari was inedible and ended up sending it back and not even paying for it. Chili was the worst chili I ever had. The nachos were oily and unflavorful.... charged me $5 for a small cup of lemonade... service was terrible. Waited around way too much considering the restaurant was empty inside and still had seating available outside as well. Bottom line, they were not busy whatsoever. I had a 25% coupon (thanks to yelp) and our server made a big deal about us getting the discount. So terribly disappointed in this place. Don't even know my servers name because there was no name tag and no introduction. BTW I paid almost $40 for a hot dog and nachos. I thought maybe it would be gourmet and super delicious, boy was I wrong. Worst restaurant on the strip."}
{"text":"The staff was not the friendliest and did not work with any sense of urgency or care for the customers."}
{"text":"Burger was good and tasty, if a tad over cooked.  Fries were unspectacular.  Enjoyed sitting outside.  Good place for a quick bite on the strip."}
{"text":"Awesome food and the service was excellent! Stripside is definitely a new add to my favorites list in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Hubby had The Stripside Breakfast & enjoyed it. I ordered the Eggs Benedict which were just OK. Couldn't see the ham as it was very modest in size & it was paired with spicy potatoes. I love spicy, don't get me wrong...but with classic eggs Benedict? Eh. 
To me, both our entrees had undercooked eggs...but hubby said his were ok (I could see jiggly whites )
Every meal costs 19.66. Breakfast includes beverage. 
Service was very good ... 5 stars for service."}
{"text":"They have a good amount of selections! Reasonably priced and large portions, definitely enough to share. The outside seating is great since you're right on the strip. Good atmosphere, great service. I definitely recommend the steak nachos and Jamaican bbq wings!"}
{"text":"My Girlfriend and I have walked by this throughout several visits to the Las Vegas strip, but we had never stopped or tried it.  On this trip, we decided to look for a place to have lunch and it was the discovery of a new favorite place!

We got seated outside immediately!  The waiter was awesome, attentive, and super great with customer service.  

If you are a people watcher, then this is a perfect spot (Especially sitting outside).  We had the french dip and the Philly cheese steak sandwich.  Wow, we could not stop commenting, in between bites, on how wonderful the sandwiches were.  They were absolutely without a doubt thee best sandwiches we had in a long time!  I have absolutely no complaints!  Keep up the great work!

The added bonus was the 25% off the bill coupon got from Yelp by checking in!"}
{"text":"Diana (bartender) is amazing!! Let her make a fabulous drink for you! The fries aren't half bad either! Will def be back!"}
{"text":"Food was pretty good (a bit salty, though) and not too expensive for Vegas. We ordered the huevos rancheros, French toast, steak and egg, and build-your-own omelet. Our server, Barbara, was so sweet!"}
{"text":"Asked to sit on patio table. Told us the server was very busy we should sit somewhere else on the patio. We agreed. Server never came. We decided to try to go window instead. They opened 20 minutes late. Ordered carne asada fries. They said they could do them without cheese and meat. So just fries basically. Could only do hot dogs. Actively tried to get us not to eat here."}
{"text":"I was looking for some coffee and a desert and thought why not try this place with a great view of the strip.  Located on the property of Caesar, but not inside the casino, you will find this place near the corner and directly across the Flamingo.  The view from the strip is good, but you will also need to deal with the sounds and exhaust of cars driving constantly.  They weren't really set up as a casual coffee place but instead a cheaper dining experience when you compare it to the restaurants inside the casino.  It served my purpose but the coffee and desert was nothing to write home about them."}
{"text":"Met here with the girls for a moms day coffee date and it was so wonderful! Our server was so kind and was patient with all the kids and babies!"}
{"text":"I had breakfast and coffee here because it was close to the hotel. I had an omelette with 3 ingredients, a waffle and a latte. The coffee was weak. The eggs and waffle were just okay considering how much the food cost. I will be exploring other breakfast restaurants."}
{"text":"This is in the old Serendipity location. Same overall look. Food is American/ diner feel. We came on a Friday, around noon, and it was pretty empty. 

We sat in a booth. They have both inside and outside seating. The menu has a lot of breakfast, lunch, and dinner options. Many of the meals include a soda or regular drink, and most of these meals were $19.66. I choose the Classic Benedict. It was a good portion size-3 eggs/English muffins, and crispy home fries. More than I could finish. 

My friend ordered pancakes, which were Huge, and sweet potato waffle fries. The fries come sprinkled with powdered sugar and were super yummy. Basically tasted like a dessert. 

For drinks we ordered a prickly pear margarita, mule mojito, and raspberry mojito. Prickly pear was ok, tart and our least fave drink. The mule was tasty and I found it to be a good mix between the mule and mojito. The raspberry was sweet and refreshing. All drinks were around $15 each. This is vegas, and we definitely overpaid for our food, but its to be expected. The hotel, Caesars Palace is heavily promoted Stripside tho, and was giving 20% off coupons. The checkin on the Yelp app tho offers 25% off- a much better deal. 

Overall the food was decent and prices slightly high. Visited once, dont need to again."}
{"text":"Great breakfast food and our server Laura was friendly and did a wonderful job making sure we were takin care of."}
{"text":"We noticed a billboard \"all day Happy Hour, 2 for 1 drinks on the patio\" we went in and sat down and ordered our drinks.  Then we were told weekends are excluded.  Strange!! .... we took a photo of the sign and there was no mention of weekends being excluded even in the small print.  Suggestion 1. make this clear on the sign or 2. remove the sign at weekends or 3. cover the sign at weekends.  Be clear otherwise you are guilty of misrepresentation."}
{"text":"My husband and I sat outside on the patio bar area, we had impeccable and attentive service, our brioche French toast was so killer we looked up how to make it, and our steak and potatoes were delicious. My favorite part of my breakfast was my spicy bloody Mary that was phenomenal. However, the margarita to go was too sweet for my liking. Overall we had great quick and tasty drink and breakfast!! Also! Who can hate when there's a 25% coupon! Thanks again!!"}
{"text":"Came here with my family and nephew for dinner and was definitely not impressed! We ordered nachos, chicken strips, a Caesar Salad, and a chili dog. Don't know if I will be returning."}
{"text":"My review rating is a mix of both however it was beyond a 5 star because of Barbara (our amazing waitress). We shared eggs Benedict which was okay and nothing to brag about and our son got a regular 3 egg breakfast. Lots of food. Endless mimosas for me!  we went for Memorial Day wknd 2017 (I know a late review but this is how much I wanted to review Barbara). She was outstanding from second one! She treated us like we were family and was a genuine person. She loves people and interested in others holiday plans. I wish more people could have her attitude about life! And I wish I could have her service anywhere I went. Just because of her I would visit again and have breaky! Thanks Barbara for an outstanding experience!!!"}
{"text":"Our waiter barely came to the table. Food was cold and soggy. And it wasn't just goood or tasty. The French fries was good"}
{"text":"Food was good.  Not great,  we will not crave it or probably go back.  But it was good.  

The service was not very good.  It hurt to leave 20% honestly."}
{"text":"Come on!  Try a little!  I know you're a tourist spot and likely won't see most of your guests again, but at least put a smidgen of effort in.  How can one make a pizza inedible?  Pizza is pretty easy, no? I boxed it up and gave it to a homeless person.  Some women sat down at a table near us and I told them they should just leave before they drop some bank on a lackluster meal."}
{"text":"The food here is good and the drinks are good as well. I ate here twice during my stay. 

Both times I came and asked for an outside table the hostess' both told me they didn't have a table seat available. This rubbed me the wrong way because neither of them explained the waiting process for getting an outside seat when there multiple empty tables. 

The food takes so long to come which I just don't get. I didn't know it took so long to make a burger. 

Overall, this place is good and convenient. I used a Groupon one time and a 20% discount from Caesars Palace the other time."}
{"text":"Our waitress Heidi was great. The chicken and waffles, sliders and Cobb salad are all good choices on the menu."}
{"text":"Excellent food! Their steakhouse burger, milkshakes, and cheesecake tasted amazing. Everything was super flavorful. The staff was very friendly and the service was fast. You've got to try this place. Worth every penny!"}
{"text":"This is a diner. On a Tuesday night between 6 to 730 this place was completely empty except for our table. We were a party of 10. Our server was very friendly. The service was good. This food is basically diner food, mainly fried food and fast food. I had the fruit plate which was very vague, came with yogurt and granola which was good. My husband had the chili cheese dog. The hotdog was a foot-long. However no matter how big a hotdog is, unless it's some kind of gourmet sandwich at a fancy place, I expect to pay less than the $22 this place charges. The menu is extensive, and I get that this is vegas, it was still way too pricy. The Gordon Ramsay restaurant has cheaper burgers! Anyway, unless you just want a quick bite or can't find reservations anywhere else, i would skip this place."}
{"text":"The food here is so amazing!! My husband and I loved it. We had the pepperoni pizza and Chicago dog. They were a lot bigger then what we expect, so definitely enough food. The pizza was sooo amazing! We were not disappointed at all. We sat outside which had a nice view of the strip. The waiters were really nice as well."}
{"text":"Cool view of the strip , although it smells very gross like eggs & nasty water outside...

Breakfast was good although they give you a side of over cooked potatoes.... VERY pricey. Our server was rude & seemed she just wanted to rush us out. The water was gross & I couldn't even drink it so I ordered an iced tea and it was $5. :O guess that's Vegas prices for ya! Chicken & waffles was tastey. Check in on Yelp to save the 25%!!"}
{"text":"Great view to people watch indeed if thats what your there for.We wanted a quick pit stop for food. What we didnt expect were 2 big roaches.Yes I said roaches.We were not even 1/2 way into our drinks & wings when something caught our eye.Immediatley called our waiter to comment to him what we saw.His response indeed was not what we expected.He said its expected since we are outside.We could not understand how casual he was about it.Never bothered to ask if we wanted a manager or anything. We were so disatisfied with the entire expierience quickly asked for our tab & walked out leaving.Would never recomend this to anyone except to the citys health inspector."}
{"text":"Best chicken and waffles ever. Come here and get the breakfast. Best brunch I've had in a long time. Would come back here for the food and the great service!"}
{"text":"The Boulevard Nachos are the absolute best nachos! I love eating on the patio and the service is great. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The portions were great. I am  actually full. This is the 1st restaurant here that my wife and I have eaten at that had great service and nice portions for the price. The server Judy was awesome. The atmosphere was decent. The restaurant is clean and the tables are spacious. The unsweetened tea was great. Most restaurants restaurants that I have eaten in have horrible unsweetened tea."}
{"text":"Literally the best French toast I've ever had (next to my mom's, of course). The bets after a hard night of drinking. Good food good people watching. Nice wait staff. I'll go back in a heart beat."}
{"text":"Our server Laura was awesome, this is a cute little place to grab a bite with great views of the strip. The nachos, and the salads are very good."}
{"text":"This restaurant it outside of Caesar's Palace and provides nice outside seating with an okay view.  The menu was good with some nice options and the quality of the food was fine.  The best was the service and the margarita's. I had the blood orange and it was fantastic.  Very casual and overall a nice experience, but I wouldn't rush back."}
{"text":"This replaced Serendypity. Smaller portions. Food isn't as good as Serendypity (they tell you it is the same chef and that might be true, but it doesn't matter. This is all just basic diner food now.

This almost has the feel of eating in an \"I love Vegas\" t-shirt shop. 

Prices are the same or more expensive than Serendypity (for example, two shakes with like a 15% tip came to about 40 dollars. For two shakes. Decorating a mug doesn't justify that price for a shake that doesn't taste any different then a Dairy Queen shake). 

The staff is very friendly. 

But, I wouldn't recommend this place--there are too many better options in Vegas. I am a little skeptical of all the 5 star reviews because there has been a push to make this place work and overcome people's disappointment with losing Serendypity, and so I wonder if those reviews are from staff or friends of staff. Who knows. 

3 stars because the food isn't horrible. Just basic and overpriced without any actual experience . Nice location and friendly staff."}
{"text":"Came looking for Serendipity and was very pleased with both food and service.  Dion our server was incredible, food was off the chain.  A little pricey but very well worth it!  Definitely a must try..."}
{"text":"As if eating alone at a restaurant isn't hard enough, being completely ignored by the wait staff for 20 minutes makes for a real treat! I was seated by the hostess inside the restaurant where about 5 tables were taken. Servers continuously walked by and not a single one even glanced at my table. Finally a busboy noticed I was frustrated and said he would send someone right over. Another 7 minutes go by, and I still had not even been brought a glass of water. I decide I've had enough and walk out, but first I stop by the hostess station to politely inform her of the situation. You would think she would apologize and offer to have someone come take my order, but all I got was \"oh, no one came?\" as she looked at the door for me to leave. 
Fabulous customer service!!"}
{"text":"Wish I could give zero stars. Food was not good, and the latte was so bad I could barely stand it. So many more places in LV to go- really sad we wasted time on this one."}
{"text":"Had the brioche French toast and it blew my mind! Perfect amount of fluffy and sweet! Travis service was amazing and he was so attentive. Had the all you care to drink mimosas for only $25! On the strip, or basically anywhere, $25 for all you are to drink is awesome!"}
{"text":"Food went above and beyond my expectations, wish I didn't get as full as quick as I would have ordered more if I could,m. A must go to next time I make a trip to next week, my server Laura was phenomenal. Texas fries are to die for!"}
{"text":"Nick is a great server, the food was better than we expected, this place is doing much better than Serendipity ever did. We hope to see Stripside Cafe to stay successful, great job in transforming this restaurant from the place it once was."}
{"text":"Great service (fun and lively server Laura? Lauren? Sorry too hungover), solid diner food and conveniently located right on the Strip- what else do you want?? Make sure to check yelp as you may be eligible for a \"check-in\" promotion - 25% off when I visited!

Happy dining...."}
{"text":"A good location, right on the Strip outside Ceasers, with good amount of outdoor seating. The food itself was pretty standard; had a decent Denver omelette with uninspired side of overdone breakfast potatoes. Expected a bit more for the prices here.

Decent option if you need something relatively quick in the area, but nothing too memorable."}
{"text":"Food is good!!  just came at a bad time... service was ok. They didn't have enough staff but Karen did great work when she had time to attend to us.. not her fault, staffing was bad."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service with over priced below average quality food.

Waited in line at the outside to go area and were told that they ran out of wings but the inside had some. Asked the manager if they had wings and he said they did so we decided to dine in. Took our orders, waited for about 30 mins then the waitress tells us that they actually don't have wings. After telling them that we wanted to cancel our orders, they \"magically\" had wings again. After waiting another 30 mins, the food finally comes out and the quality was below average for the price. 

They had one server (who was great and helpful btw) serving the whole restaurant, while they have 3 staff members hanging out at the gift shop doing nothing."}
{"text":"We stopped by at night for a banana split and fries. The $6 fries were the crinkle-cut fries you cook in the oven. Not joking. And the $12 banana split didn't have strawberry ice cream like it was supposed to. There are too many good options on the strip to bother with this place (and honestly I wouldn't bother even if it was the only option)."}
{"text":"This place wasn't \"bad\". I ordered the Buffalo chicken wrap and it was just ok. Nothing special. Nice beer selection, slow wait staff. Go elsewhere, don't waste a Vegas meal here."}
{"text":"Recently made a trip to Vegas for vacation anticipating the traditional visit to Serendipity for another taste of unsurpassed greatness. Suffice it to say my hopes and dreams were shattered only to find our favorite stop to be long gone and replaced with a new Caesar's restaurant venture. Stripside Cafe is a nightmarish shadow of its predecessor akin to the poorly packaged imitation store brand version of your favorite quality name-brand products. Nothing about this place is original. The décor is even the same only dirtier, faded, and worn. The menu offerings are patterned after a typical American diner with all too familiar comfort food cravings and hangover nursing grease drippers.  Don't let the rundown appearance and simple menu fool you, the price tag is way outside the realm of a divey American Diner. They are proud to offer their \"combs\" all day for $19.66. This means you pay $20 for a mediocre burger, fries and a drink. This place is Carl's Jr.'s marketing department's dream. Milkshake mugs and New York Cheesecake are among the knockoff items offered to make you think Stripside could be as good as Serendipity, but you'll be disappointed. Service is terrible. Host staff is slow and rude and the waitstaff is illusive at best. Breakfast items are served all day. My bacon, eggs, and breakfast potatoes arrived cold and flavorless. How do you mess that up? I will give credit where credit is due and their adult beverages are done correctly. I sampled a specialty margarita and a mojito and my friend elected to take advantage of the bottomless mimosa. When we were finally able to track down an employee willing to bring the bill, we were nauseated to discover that we were about to pay $80+ for what was easily the worst dining experience of our trip. Rest in peace Serendipatiousness of LV, you will be missed and fond memories of your greatness will live on in my heart."}
{"text":"Not on the high-end, but good view of the strip for people watching and solid food. Highly recommend the Prickly Pear Margarita. Laura, our server, is who really deserves the 5 star review. She was fun and engaging and helped up figure out where we should go on the town. Laura, you rocked it."}
{"text":"This restaurant was very disappointing! The food didn't look too appetizing on the plate when they arrived, but I wouldn't have minded that if they tasted good-- which they didn't. The potatoes were too dry and the Eggs Benedict were not anything special. I expected more for the price and the location. There was no \"wow\" factor in the food, atmosphere, decor, etc.. It was very basic and I would not go again, as there are so many other delicious options on The Strip. 

*Edited to add photo"}
{"text":"Oh how I miss Serendipity. I'm not the only one. This place was so empty, think the staff was shocked when someone came in. Never in the days of Serendipity were you able to walk in, place your order, and get your food in under 15 minutes. Over priced, you can tell it's a Caesars owned restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered 1 scoop of ice cream at grab and go window. It took 10 minutes with no one in line."}
{"text":"I would give this place 5 stars but where we were seated had bird poop beside it. Best place to go for breakfast. Staff were friendly and the surroundings where beautiful. Food was delicious."}
