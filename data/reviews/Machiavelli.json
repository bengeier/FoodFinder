{"text":"We were craving Italian and wanted to explore the Point St. Charles neighbourhood. What a gem! We sat outside on the terrace on a warm summer night, enclosed in a thicket of ivy, candlelight, and jazz blowing through the open door of the restaurant. Service was prompt and courteous. The food was carefully presented and retained a homemade flavour. The helpings were substantial and the ingredients harmoniously combined. The beurre blanc in the tilapia and scallop bouillabaisse was exquisite. The chocolate mousse was appropriately decadent and served in an adorable mason jar. We will definitely return!"}

Deuxième visite après 8 ans chez Machiavelli et que dire pour être honnête c'est difficile vraiment : Soirée à deux en amoureux, on arrive avec notre vin, accueil charmant et service impeccable.

On commence avec une entrée originale en présentation mais courte en saveur. les 3 Bernardins étaient migons mais les saveurs pas balancées du tout. Celui au poisson a un goût de fumé trop prononcé et trop salé, celui à l'oeuf est sans goût et le dernier au porc effiliché est le meuilleur sans être stellaire. 

On recoit ensuite une belle surprise, tapenade d'olive et 3 chips de maïs. Jolie  présentation vintage saveur un peu rance mais pas mauvais et gratuit... On nous sert ensuite du pain chaud frais et du vrai beurre; des notes positives.

Puis une autre + un gentil et délicieux trou normand offert par la maison, aux baies et à la Vodka. On aime.

Plats principaux:

1- Fettucini aux champignons et crème avec huile de truffe ($18) décevant, très decevant. Les champignons sechés ne sont pas bien rehydratés et donc imangeables, la sauce à la crème est sans goût et l'huile de truffe n'y a jamais touché. Pâtes lourdes et plat terne.

2- Côte de Boeuf et légumes du marché ($28). Le beuf est Excellent et la portion est bonne aussi. Très bel assaisonement complexe et bien équilibré. Les légumes du marché, courge musquée, patate et poireaux on nous à la dernière minute seront finalement sevis en purée ??? ... pas une bonne idée on vois déjà des restes défraîchit et en effet c'est pas bon du tout.

Donc le boeuf sauve la donne mais c'est pas assez pour justifier le reste.

Dessert, je me laisse tenter par la crème brûlée, mon talon d'achille. On nous offre soit bouton de rose ou fève tonka. Je prends le premier en demandant une croute de sucre caramélisé généreuse.

On nous sert un ramequin contenant au plus 1 cm de crème, même pas assez pour y introduire la cuiller. La consistance est motoneuse, çà ne goûte pas la rose et nous relevons la chose au serveur, très attentionné qui nous dit en parler à la cuisine; RIEN, on ne crédite pas le dessert ni le remplace. 

Donc,,. Ambiance chaleureuse et cozy, terrase rustique confortable, plats trop dispendieux pour le goût ou saveur en deça des prix et au final un service que nous avons apprécié mais n'avon laissé que 10% de tip car à $80 au total sans breuvages aucun pour un dessert perdu et des plats ternes c'est plus qu'assez."}
{"text":"What a great little restaurant. It's definitely one of Montreal's best kept secrets. The food is fantastic. High class yet homey at the same time (don't ask me how they accomplished this, they just do). The service was impeccable. And when they found out it was my birthday, they presented be with a beautiful creme brulee on the house. 

We had

Garlic-y escargot (very good, very tender, save some of that bread that you get when you sit down to soak up the cheesy garlic butter)

Apple Fennel Soup: OMG get this, just get this. Its savoury and rich and you'd never think to put those two together in a soup, but this works.

Duck: absolutely perfect (why does this chef not have a michelin star already?)

a vodka pasta dish: we perfect. Pasta wasn't as al dente as we normally prefer it, but the sauce more than made up for it

free creme brulee: good enough that I would've paid for it 10x over =)

We'll be back again, and again, and again."}
{"text":"So, about 10 of us showed up last night and I think we were ALL disappointed on so many levels; excruciatingly so. I'm amazed, considering how highly regarded this quaint restaurant is. I'm hoping it was just an 'off' night, although for not a single person at our table to be remotely satisfied speaks volumes in itself.

We were forced into a $40 Valentine's Day menu that did not satisfy anyone, let alone even make it to the table for some. Yes, that's right, two people from our group didn't even receive their (potentially mediocre) meals. 

To give you a better idea of this mediocrity: the appetizers were a joke; the seafood was painfully fishy and watery; the risotto was soupy and merely rice in a flavoured creamy-like substance; the vegan lasagna was an afterthought of random vegetables tossed in a tomato sauce; the meat looked like leather. Need I say more?

I'm really shocked, even service was lacking and we were the largest group there, forced to wait for prolonged periods of time to simply request anything.

All in all, I spent $50 on an unmemorable meal. At least the company and wine made up for its numerous shortcomings."}
{"text":"Restaurant Machiavelli has the best terasse in Montreal in my opinion. Even though it's right across from Charlevoix metro, the serene garden makes you feel like you are tucked away in the country far away from cars and buses. If it's too cold to eat outdoors, you'll find that the interior ambiance is wonderful as well. It's an old renovated house consisting of a main area and two smaller cozy rooms. It's a great place to meet an old friend and catch up because you can get a secluded table in the corner and don't have to talk too loud to carry on 
a conversation. 

The menu is constantly changing with the seasons. I've had great meals there and then meals that were not bad but not amazing either. I will say I've never had a bad experience though. The staff is always very friendly and pleasant. To start, I love getting the combination of three dazzling dips with pita bread. The seafood is usually pretty decent. 

It's bring your own wine which really helps bring down the overall cost."}
{"text":"Services exceptionnel,  nourriture très bonne et très abordable. Très bon resto qualité prix."}
{"text":"C'est le restaurant de quartier que je recommanderais pour les gens habitant la pointe St-Charles qui désirent un restaurant quand même chic pas trop loin. Il y a une petite terrasse à l'arrière qui est parfaite pour une petit souper plus intime. Nous avions pris des bruschettas qui étaient très bonnes. Sinon, je me suis rendu compte là bas que je n'aimais pas tant que ça le boeuf bourgignon, mais la présentation de celui-ci était très bien.

Un apporter votre vin en plus!"}
{"text":"Creative displays of excellently cooked and portioned food. Was pleasantly surprised when the bill came and enjoyed the lamb with salad, my girl enjoyed the pasta. I guess the only complaint would be that food took a longer than normal time to come out and they forgot to light the candle at my table. Went with my girlfriend but would take my whole family as well."}
{"text":"Great food for french cuisine and the portions are filling, nice and cozy atmosphere. Good service. It's perfect for a date! It's worth a try!"}
{"text":"Machiavelli is somewhere in between of the three and four stars. I'm not overly impressed with the food, it is rather home cooking, a little bit away from the haute French cuisine, the way the grandma from the village will prepare the food. The owners have done nice job utilizing the available space of the old apartment, two cozy rooms are decorated in rustic style. The service was extremely nice and our host explained in details the menu. 

The starters were good, particularly the snails. They were yummy with the warm baguette that is served at every table. I liked the salad with red beet and fresh greens, the chef forgot the walnuts and our host brought them somewhere in the middle of the meal in case we'd like to add them, which was sweet, they could have just kept it quiet. We were also served an amuse bouche, delicious paste with pita bread chips, unfortunately the chips was burned, I'm not sure why would you serve it at all, just make a new one, basic quality control. I had a craving for carbonara, so I ended up with a big portion of pasta. There is someone who makes wonderful carbonara for me at his home and I have to say the Machiavelli version is pretty good too. The other main I tasted was the lamb shank, which I found disappointing, particularly the overcooked vegetables, everything was a little bit tasteless and lacking flavours. Not exactly what one of my friends thought about her over-salted chicken dish. We were too full for dessert and for my surprise the dessert of the day is not included in the table d'hôte. 

We would have had a nice time if it was not for the six female guests who were obnoxiously noisy, but the owners are definitely not guilty about the behaviour of their clients. I would eventually give this restaurant a second chance as I like BYOB places and prices are overall reasonable."}
{"text":"Right by the Charlevoix metro stop and we pass this place all the time. Decided to give it a try on a snowy night, which may have been a bad idea. It was cold. We were back in a corner, ignored for large stretches, and cold in full sweaters, thermals, etc. Eventually we skipped desert just to go get our coats!

Most of the food was good to really good. Escargot was a hit, bread came to the table warm, they brought a couple of surprise little pieces that were each delightful. We were psyched for our main dishes and that's where it went a bit downhill. We both ordered pasta (half the small menu is pasta so figured that was a speciality) and were both disappointed. Great interesting sauces, perfect shrimp on the wife's dish etc, but the pasta itself on both was bland, doughy and stick in the teeth chewy, making it feel like a giant rock in the stomach. 

Maybe an off day? Will update if we drop in again."}
{"text":"Came here with a 'local' and another friend and made the reservation under the name '3 Sexy Bitches' (no, I am not even kidding) Showed up here with our bottle of red and were met by a laughing maître d' that whisked us away to a lovely corner table on the terrasse in the back garden.

The table d'hôte that Sunday evening was 24$ and was freaking incredible, I'm talking buttery/garlicky escargot, crazy/amazing stuffed pasta, fresh out of the oven pita bread complete with 3 yummy spreads and dessert: wow. One person in the group had the veal and it looked pretty tasty from where I was sitting.

The place is cute, centrally located and the menu is always changing. BYOW is always a great option and the staff here made the night. Trust me, you cannot go wrong at Machiavelli (invite me if you're going! Pleeeeease)"}
{"text":"I have been a client of Machiavelli for many years. Living one block away, I literally see it everyday. I had not written a review because I didn't want it to be an average review. 

Over the last year every time I go the food gets better, and better. The restaurant gets nicer and nicer. The presentation gets even more creative and the food as well. 

They hosted my birthday party for me on their magical Terasse and did an amazing all Vegetarian Family style meal for us that was perfect. They went above and behond with their service. 

If you have been to this restaurant in the past, try it again. They deserve our local support because they have stepped it up a notch.

Well done"}
