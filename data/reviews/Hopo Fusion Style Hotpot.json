{"text":"Food were OK but nothing special, its quite healthy as its 95% veggies, but you'd be disappointed if you're looking to meet your protein requirement. Smell is too strong, probably needs a better ventilation system. Overall I'd rather pay more and go to an AYCE place."}
{"text":"Visited when they had their BOGO special. Both me and my friend had their laksa pot and it comes with a bowl of noodles. I personally liked the soup base, quite tasty and lots of seafood in the pot. laksa pot is $14.99 each, it is quite pricey compared to other hot pot restaurants in the area as HOPO isn't all you can eat like most other hot pot places. But with the BOGO it was worth the try. we also ordered the lime & watermelon juice which was $5 each and it was not worth the price for sure. It was tasteless and very small. 

We arrived at 5:45 on a Monday and there was just a few tables but half an hour later people started coming and by the time we were done, line up was out the door. Im pretty sure everyone is just there cause of the BOGO special though. It will be better now that the special is over but I suggest calling in to make a reservation before going."}
{"text":"Came here during Asia Food Fest and ordered from the dinner combo for 2 (where you basically get two wintermelon iced tea for free). We ordered spicy fermented tofu soup, Taiwanese beef brisket soup and chicken cartilage. The flavour of the soups were pretty good and the fermented tofu taste wasn't strong at all. The wintermelon iced tea was the perfect drink to wash the food down!"}
{"text":"I went here to try out their lunch special. Each hotpot order comes with a wintermelon iced tea, (or you could upgrade to something on their drinks menu for $2) and an appetizer. Their appetizers were extremely greasy, which was expected, but it was drenched in oil once you bit into it. 

The hotpot itself was just alright...very salty soup base, which was fine with the rice/noodles served. The spicy beef hotpot was spicier than expected, even though we asked for it to be mild. The laksa was good, but spicy and salty too. 

In general, it was a good experience to have your own \"pre-made\" individual hotpot, but I probably wouldn't come back again. It wasn't anything too special, compared to regular hotpot restaurants where you have more options for meats, vegetables and etc."}
{"text":"Omg, this place is amazing!

I've been meaning to come here for awhile since I would keep walking past it on my way to Chatime. Finally decided to give it a try this past weekend.

I came here for lunch which is a better value since they include a glass of wintermelon tea and an appetizer for each hot pot that you order. This was my first time trying wintermelon tea and it was so good! I ordered the garlic butter corn as an appetizer which was just okay, i would probably try the other dishes next time.

The hot pot contains pre-arranged items and is a decent size for two people if you aren't too hungry. I ordered the beef hot pot (yes, you can ask for non-spicy!) and it was absolutely amazing. It came with beef, mushroom, tofu, corn, crab meat, quail eggs, mini hot dogs, beef ball, and a ton of veggies.The pot was definitely stuffed with to the brim. The one thing that I would change would be the portion of veggies. It was a bit overdone, so if they were going to load it that much, I would have preferred more variety than just cabbage. 

For dessert, I ordered the matcha green tea milk pudding ($4.95). It came with red bean ice creams, red beans, cornflakes, and wafer sticks. It was definitely the perfect way to finish off my meal.

Atmosphere: 4/5 | Service: 4/5 | Price: 5/5"}
{"text":"It's 3.5 Stars.

We ordered:

Tom Yum Seafood Soup ($13.99): Soup base is okay(more on the sour side).  It looks exactly what they've posted on their website.  Good mixture of seafood and came with rice. Rating: 3.5/5

Original Sukiyaki ($9.99): Soup base is okay.  Beef, mini sausage, enoki mushrooms, fish balls, tofu, big mushroom, cabbage, udon.  Rating: 3.5/5

Watermelon Lime Juice ($4.49): Can only taste the watermelon and very very small hint of lime.  Refreshing though.  Rating 2.5/5


Great alternative to All you can eat hotpot."}
{"text":"this place is not CLOSED! it's just currently closed! they'll opening soon! 

Good quality hot pot! I love their tom yum and laksa! The price is reasonable for the portion too, I usually split the pot with my friends and ordered an extra rice and side.

when you first stepped in, it will smell like a bit because of the stinky tofu, but just wait for 10 minutes, your nose will get used to it!"}
{"text":"The place is tucked away from other stores in the plaza. I decided to give it a try after my friend posted a picture.

Very nice spicy stinky tofu pot. The signature pots come with a default drink and one of three sides, but you can order another drink if you want. Service was great and the drinks (non-alcoholic) selection is very good as well. I would go there again on a cold day and enjoy and warmness it brings me."}
{"text":"It's deceiving cuz it's not really hot pot. Everything comes already cooked in a pot. They light up the flaming crystals underneath so that the pot simmers and bubbles a bit. After a while the crystals burn out and your food just cools down. It also comes with a bowl of rice. It's just like having Korean stews, without the banchan!  It's also a tad pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Ordered the bento box which was enough for a person and comes with rice, dish and veggies; cooked just enough to still be crunchy. All our orders were tasty, the bulgogi, pork chop and chicken popcorn. This bento comes with wintermelon tea which gives a nice twist to iced tea.

Ordered red bean ice cream for dessert. The serving is good for 2 people and the presentation was layered with frosted flakes, whipped cream, ice cream, some blue berries on the side and a couple of strawberry sticks. Very tasty dessert.

The place was clean and the decor pleasing. Overall, I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Came here when it was BOGO, so as expected it was busy and we ended up waiting just a bit over an hour. They don't take reservations, or at least they don't during BOGO. The place is extremely small. 

I ordered the Tom yum seafood and it was very very salty. My friends spicy beef was much better. All the pots come with a little bit of vermicelli and a bowl of rice. I found it pretty difficult to eat with the flame burning as the soup would overflow at times and it felt like I was eating with a flame under my chin so I asked for it to be turned off. 

I would return to have the spicy beef but I don't find the place to be anything special"}
{"text":"Wow this place was packed with so many people having hotpot in the summer.  Their buy-one-get-one-free promo is now over so the lineups won't be as long.  

I got the fermented tofu hotpot and luckily, it wasn't overwhelmingly stinky.  The portions were a good size despite not being all-you-can-eat.  They don't have many non-spicy hotpot options though.  The Korean Fried Chicken was good.

The service was decent, although a bit slow.  We had to ask for water more than once.  

Overall not bad.  It's a nice change from traditional hotpot."}
{"text":"Came in as a group of 14, they split us into two tables. This hotpot place is special in the fact that they are not all your can eat and you get your individual pot of your choice of beef, seafood, and veggie. Soup base basically is original, \"stinky\", spicy. Price ranged from $14-16.

I really like that it is individual pot for hygiene reasons and also the concept of add-on toppings after your base choice. This works well when there are small eaters in the group whom would be unfair to go to AYCE and pay $25+ just to eat little and to be the company for others. Adding beef is only $3 comes in ~8 small slices. They also have Sapporo on tap, $18 for a pitcher, fair pricing.

Food quality is average, im too used to the lower quality of all you can eat joints, HOPO might be considered a bit better and cleaner, but not material enough to say they are very good. So, you can expect you are eating those AYCE-like food but you pay half of the price and still get good amount of food.

Service could be better, I understand that big group of people is hard to be served but one waiter obviously was getting impatient with us when taking orders. Although we were a group of 14, no extra gratitude was charged and because of the service we received, I did not think they would deserve that either.

Overall - i would come back if i feel like a hotpot. I would highly recommend that spicy soup base if you can take spicy."}
{"text":"A twist on the traditional hot pot where the contents of the pot is set for you. Liked the soup base did not like the selection provided. Next time I should bring a pack of instant noodle and dump it in.

It's probably best to share a pot with someone as it is quite a large portion for one person especially since I always order the original or Japanese popcorn chicken as well. I didn't like the Korean one.

The waiter seemed super non-chalant about his job but was better as we started eating (gave us extra bowls and napkins).

I would come back just to avoid going to the traditional hot pot places (not a fan of those)."}
{"text":"I like the idea of individual pots. Came here many times since winter of 2015. 

Reasonable price for the amount of food serve. To me it is something fast and I don't need to prepare all the hot pot materials at home and doing the dishes at the end. 

The restaurant is filled with the smell of Taiwanese stinky tofu smell; if you're sensitive to that smell I suggest you may want to check it out first to see if you can handle it. Otherwise, it is really not that bad imo (maybe cause I like stinky tofu).

Clothes and hair don't smell like stinky tofu but it does smell like spicy hot pot. If you're planning to go out on a date, movie, sing k, clubbing or anything social... you may want to reconsider taking a shower before heading out again. (Maybe I'm just sensitive in that sense).

Food quality is good, pots are flavorful and amount of food per pot is definitely enough for a guy."}
{"text":"The sesame parfait was also very good and surpassed my expectations. It was 4.99 which is comparatively cheaper than ordering it at dessert cafes. It came with a scoop of black sesame ice cream, a scoop of vanilla ice cream (they shouldve gave 2 scoops of black sesame), whipped cream, frosted flakes, and blackberries. The first three tasted SO GOOD when eaten together in one spoon. The blackberries didn't fit so well since generally they're sour and the texture isnt smooth. It should've been the mango puree as shown in the menu!"}
{"text":"This is a set dish with individual pots. You get about 12 slices of beef per pot. As a girl, this pot is the perfect size to eat by myself. As a guy, I would maybe find that this was not enough meat? You can order extra meat for 3$, extra noodles for 1$, extra tofu for 2$ etc. I ordered spicy beef soup twice now, not bad. Next time I will try Beef soup to see how that is. Beef soup comes with two sauces, but spicy beef is already flavoured enough.

My friend ordered a fried fish fillet bento box. It came with a salad, three fish fillets, a soya egg, and rice. It was supposed to come with pickled radish but they ran out. Before 5pm, if you order a bento you get a free wintermelon iced tea, but we went after 5pm. The fish was very nicely done. For the price of 8.99 I thought it was a decent lunch item. If I worked near here at lunch I would want to try the minced pork on rice set which is $5.99. 

I found it odd that they do not serve tea here, only hot water. For those ordering a bento, it would be nice if they could have something warm to drink. I like how the water they provide here is infused with lemon. 

The place only smells like stinky tofu when someone orders the fermented tofu appetizer or the fermented tofu hot pot. Otherwise the smell is okay. Just dont wear super fancy clothes here as they will either smell or you might splash soup on your clothes. They have a one temperature fire option under the pot, so when it starts to become too bubbly you have to turn off the heat. I find this fine because otherwise it is too hot to eat my food.

I think the rice they make is undercooked, or kind of on the hard side. When you add soup to it, it becomes a bit better."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner at around 8ish to try something new and different. It was somewhat busy as there were a few tables left available but the place is kind of small. Ordered a Taiwanese Popcorn Chicken as appetizer, Tom Yum Seafood Hot Pot, Korean Style Hot Pot, Oreo Cheesecake and Matcha ice cream parfait.

Place is neat and sleek with a modern touch. Fairly simple presentation and not so big so dont bring a party here people.

Service was fairly good and waiters/waitresses were attentive and aware of the tables. They cleaned up finished hot pots within a few minutes so thats a plus. Food came at a reasonable time as well and food portions were sufficient. In fact, it was juuuust over enough. I was full but not stuffed luckily. There was a variety of toppings in bot hot pots ordered and both tasted great! Neither hot pots were too spicy so if you want the hint of spicyness then these are the way to go. The Tom Yum Seafood Hot Pot had vermicelli in it while the Korean Style Hot Pot had ramen. The Taiwanese Popcorn Chicken tasted well and the desserts were not bad.

This place is different and new and it honestly wasn't what I expected but I liked it! Would definitely come back to try the other fusion hot pot styles!"}
{"text":"Worst customer service I have ever received. It was a cold day and my group requested to sit at a table more inside rather than the table right across the door and the male waitor actually frowned and rolled his eyes. Seriously?! The restaurant was a third empty. No wonder it was empty on a Saturday."}
{"text":"I came here yesterday night for dinner with some friends to take advantage of the BOGO deal. This place is somewhat similar to the U.S. restaurant \"Boiling Point\" however pales in comparison. My friend and I ordered the Tom Yum Soup base and my other friends ordered the Spicy Beef. In my opinion, the tom yum soup did not taste authentic at all. It kind of just tasted like tomato soup with lime. A good tom yum soup has more depth and flavour than that. But maybe I'm just asking for too much as this place is a Chinese ran restaurant and obviously won't make a Tom yum soup as good as the ones I've tried in Thailand. 

That being said, each soup base bowl comes with different toppings and glass noodle vermicelli. EVERYONES bowl came with corn however they neglected to include corn in my bowl, which is disappointing but whatever. That means they're inconsistent though. 

Each bowl comes with a bowl of rice. I didn't eat much of it though because it was VERY mushy. I like stickier rice like many other Asians I know but boy was this rice MUSHY. 

As for my friends spicy beef soup base, it was much better than my Tom yum. It has more flavour but it tasted very generic and MSG-y. Still better than the Tom yum though. 

We also ordered the Korean popcorn chicken and the Japanese popcorn chicken. Both were quite good, but the Korean popcorn chicken tastes better than the Japanese one. However the amount of chicken they give you does not justify its price (from what I remember, around $8-9). 

I'd say this place is worth a try, especially during the BOGO. But the food is in no means extraordinary. In fact it was very average. I would go back, but only to try the spicy fermented tofu soup base and the Malaysian laksa soup base. 

Oh btw, I didn't experience bad service like the other reviewers did. But I did wait a while for a table, but that's understandable since there were a lot of people."}
{"text":"Parking
Do yourself a favour and park underground. The outdoor parking lot is a joke and everyone who park there are actually going to ChaTime for bubble tea lols.

Pricing
It's like $14-16 per person for each individual pot. A lot of hot pot places are All-You-Can-Eat (AYCE) in Toronto but they range from $23-30. I'd say that this place is fairly priced given that each portion can fill the average person (or me at least). I heard that prices are better at lunch time, though I haven't been.

Service
The people there are quite nice but not too bright. We waited for a table like 45 min to an hour and the last 10 minutes were due to lack of staffing. The tables were uncleaned and we just stood at the doorway waiting for someone to set it up for us. This place is extremely small but good thing it's not AYCE so people come and go pretty quickly. After we paid, the waitresses gathered around our table with puzzled looks. We just asked them like WTF do you want to know LOL. They were wondering why not everyone had receipts in their hand, in other words did they forget to write down our orders. No, just look at the damn table, not everyone ordered one pot for themselves. Luckily there is no policy on how everyone has to order and they quickly let out a sigh of relief. Half of us elected to pay by cash and never got change back. We were like.......so are we getting change because we aren't giving more than 20% tip LOL. Yes, they either forgot or wanted to not give change back. I think this is quite stupid, how do u miss that? Forgetting to give change back to half the table lols.

Food
As a graphic designer I want to give them a small pat on the back, those are some nice menus lols. Anyhow the food is mediocre at best but I totally recommend getting the vegetable soup base. I rarely taste a soup base that is so good when it doesn't have meat in it. Perhaps it's the corn, but I engulfed that thing like it was pure soup. The soup itself is more sweet than salty but you don't feel thirsty after drinking it. From what I know, hot pot soup base isn't the most healthy thing to drink lol. Laksa soup base is mildly spicy and a little salty. I didn't have the courage to try the spicy beef soup base but my friend was sweating the whole time lols. We also had the popcorn chicken which was average."}
{"text":"Love veggie soup! Tasted so good. Lychee soda was very refreshing. Recommend green tea dessert."}
{"text":"Saw the location while we were driving to T&T supermarkets, and decided to stop for dinner. The design is beautiful and the concept was new. We usually like an all you can eat hotpot, but as we weren't that hungry, this was a good alternative. We tried the Malaysian and spicy beef hotpot. Over all, the food was good, but the service was SLOW. 

Pros

Good food, can be very spicy. 
Different atmosphere. 
Convenient location
About half the price of an all you can eat. 
Friendly. 

Cons
SLOW service. Waited about 20-30 minutes for food.
Tightly packed location. The tables were so close that when one had to sit in the booth seat, their but hit the other table. Happened when a lady was getting out beside us."}
{"text":"This a pretty small hot pot place. Fair warning to all its not an all you can eat but he portions are decent sizes. The hot pot is individualized so no communal pot. 

The presentation of the pots are great. I had a beef broth hotpot which turned out pretty bland and had no side sauce to dip to change the flavour. My friends ordered the spicy beef begin was delicious and even with less spice it was pretty spicy. The Korean popcorn chicken was a highlight and was delicious, but some of the pieces was cartilage instead of meat which was too bad. 

If you check in via Yelp or any other social media it's 20% off, not sure how long that will be for."}
{"text":"Unlike your other typical hotpot places, Hopo offers premade pots for you. I ordered the spicy beef pot ($12.99) to share with a friend. The flavour was amazing. Although, it was not as spicy as they had suggested on their menu with their two chili pepper warning. The spicy beef pot came with beef, mushroom, tofu, corn, crab meat, quail eggs, mini hot dogs, beef ball, and an assortment of vegetables. Perfect for sharing with friends or having one to yourself. Would come back to try other items on their menu in the future."}
{"text":"came her e for dinner because I miss the boiling point style hotpot so much in the States! However, the taste was totally different. Overall, the taste is Okay, but the service can be improved. I spent a hour waiting for my entree after order. Don't know why it can take so long."}
{"text":"Came here with a large group for a birthday celebration. I got the spicy beef pot and asked for it to be made mild. It was not mild. I was fine, however my friend could barely stomach it. There are a large variety of ingredients in the pot which was nice. The presentation  was very nice (very instagram worthy). HOWEVER, there was way too much cabbage (it felt like a never ending pot of cabbage), and the slices of beef were extremely thin and almost sad. The shallow pots were also a problem because as the broth heated up, sometimes it would boil over and splatter out. 
Service was nothing special. 
I don't find that it was particularly worth the price. I probably won't be coming again."}
{"text":"A meal I looked forward to after seeing the mouth watering pictures on their Facebook page. Each individually sized Taiwanese hot pot was crafted like a piece of art.

Similar concept to a popular restaurant chain called Boiling Point in the States, we finally get a taste of it in Toronto. Simple menu with 6 main dishes, 7 appetizers (they call it snacks) and a bunch of drinks to choose from. 

I opted for the Tom Yum seafood, Malaysian Laksa hot pot, Korean Popcorn Chicken and Japanese Popcorn Chicken. The Tom Yum and the Korean Popcorn are defiantly winners.

Rice included free of charge with all the hot pots, something that wasn't mentioned on the menu.

They also had several Stinky Tofu (fermented tofu) items on the menu, but I wasn't feeling adventurous enough.

Prepare for a slight wait to get seats, as flocks of people are rushing to try them out."}
{"text":"The flavours in the hot pot here is not bad and the portion size is good. BUT their service is non-existent and the place is very, very dirty. Don't let anything touch the table and double check your bowls and cutlery before using them."}
{"text":"WAIT TIME: Came here for dinner on a weekday night. There wasn't a wait but the place was full. The restaurant is fairly small.. I would say roughly the same or maybe a little bigger than the chatime beside the restaurant. 

DISCOUNTS: right now they have a deal, if you check in via social media (FB or instagram) you get a discount depending on how many hot pots were at the table. I believe it is 3 hot pots at a table = 10% off, 4 hot pots at a table = 15% off. However they can only apply this discount on ONE bill, so if youre going I suggest to bring cash so you can split the bill easily 

APPS: ordered the korean popcorn chicken and the japanese popcorn chicken. Both were really good, I asked for extra sauce on the side for the japanese popcorn chicken. I actually enjoyed the popcorn chicken more than the hot pot. I slightly preferred the japanese popcorn chicken more, but honestly get both! 

HOT POTS: 4 hot pots for the table (spicy fermented tofu, malaysian laksa, 2 spicy beef) 

- sucks that you can't change the stuff inside the hot pot to a different soup base
- usually each hot pot will come with a side of rice or noodle
- when i came here (rmb dinner on a weekday night roughly around 730-8pm) they ran out of rice !!!!! like what??? my friend was forced to get noodles rather than rice and it's not even like they said if you wait for a bit we'll cook a new batch of rice.. like THEY RAN OUT. like how???? AND btw we went to chatime after and we saw one of the workers from HOPO bring a chatime worker rice (like whats that about????) 
- if you've never had smelly tofu before THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO TRY IT FOR THE FIRST TIME. this is an acquired taste!! my friend tried smelly tofu for the first time here and didn't end up eating any of the tofu and basically regretted his meal. 
- my friend who had the malaysian laksa really enjoyed hers and said it was authentic. I tasted hers and if I didn't get the spicy beef I probably would've had that
- the pots boil in front of you and honestly it's pretty tight in there so the pots basically boiling in your face. While the pot was on I felt very uncomfortable and stressed.. I was scared of the hot water splashing onto me because it was SO close. Once I felt like everything was cooked in my spicy beef hot pot I called for the waiter to turn it off right away because I could not eat while that thing was on. soooo dangeroussss
- theres only 1 beef ball in each hot pot!!!!! and honestly its the best part, so kinda sucked how theres only 1.
- TOO MUCH CABBAGE. there was so much that I had to remove some from the hot pot and put it on the plate... I was able to fill the whole plate with cabbage
- overall the hot pot was ok. My spicy beef hot pot really didn't strike me in taste or its content. Most likely not coming back - and if I were to it'd be for the popcorn chicken.  

MILD OR SPICY? - they ask you if you want mild spice or spicy, before going i read reviews on yelp and a couple ppl mentioned that spicy was actually really spicy (like in your face cant enjoy your food spicy) so i opted for mild and my friend got spicy. Mine wasn't spicy at all it actually lacked in spiciness .. my friend's was do-able, it wasn't in your face spicy at all he finished his entire pot. Spicy levels are subjective though so if you're scared you won't be able to finish your meal b/c of the spice level just get mild and ask for like chilli OTS. 

PRICE: spicy beef hot pot plus 2 orders of popcorn chicken split 4 ways totalled $21 for me (includes tax, tip and discount), for this amount of money would rather just go to an AYCE hot pot to get $s worth. (also for this price I'm not sure if I was actually full tbh .. I didn't finish my hot pot but I think that was bc I just got tired of eating)."}
{"text":"We got the tom yum and fermented tofu soup for the hotpots and the chicken gizzard, chicken wing, and cuttlefish for the appetizers. 

The hotpots were a bit bland for my taste, not savory enough. I wouldn't come here for the hotpot, as there are much better options and I enjoy the traditional hotpot style of putting your own items in more so than the modern take of prearranged hotpots.

However, I really enjoyed the appetizers. The chicken gizzard was very delicious, crispy, and flavorful. Definitely better than I expected. Would come again for the appetizers, but not the hotpot."}
{"text":"If you want to eat hotspot and you do not want to eat too much. You should come here to eat. The food is always fresh and the thing I like is they give you a lot of veggies!

They also have lunch special you order one hop pot and get a side dish with winter melon drink!"}
{"text":"I'm actually very impressed with Hopo. I've known about this place since they opened, but until today, I had never gone. I did my homework on Yelp and on their website. I also called them a couple times before I came. Based on the reviews, I wasn't expecting too much. However, I was hopeful. The pictures on their website looked good, and they matched up with the pictures that Yelpers had posted. That's a good sign.

I called twice before I came. I had a few questions. I wanted to know if they had some non-spicy options not listed on their website menu (Yes. They have regular beef hotpot, and miso seafood hotpot). I wanted to know whether their hotpots came with rice (Yes). I wanted to know whether they served non-hotpot meals (Not at dinner time). I asked if they would do separate bills (Yes). I made a tentative reservation for 10 people. About a week later, I had to change my reservation to 14 people. When I did that, they confirmed the date and time of my reservation, and asked if I still wanted to do separate billing. I'm very pleased with that. They kept a note of it. Good on them. Not many places I have been to do, and so I think Hopo should be commended for it.

I got here tonight at about 7:25pm. It was a full house. Four members of my party were already seated...at an 8 person table. There were no other tables open. I flagged down the staff, and inquired as to where our other table was. They told us that the couple sitting at the 8 person table behind us would be done soon and that afterwards, that table would be ours. We had to wait about 10 minutes. It was a tad chaotic for those 10 minutes because most of the rest of my party came, and they couldn't sit down, and the restaurant isn't big enough to handle that many people standing around waiting for tables (there was at least one other party waiting for tables). The waiters had a difficult time trying to maneuver around groups of waiting people. 

Once we got seated everything went fairly smoothly. The tables and seats were very clean. Actually, the entire restaurant was fairly clean. I like clean. Clean is good. I ordered a spicy beef hotpot ($12.99). The menu lists it as 2 spicy peppers, but I was given an option of mild, regular, and hot. I found the notion of spicy mild amusing, so I ordered that. Upon receiving it, it was clear that it was not going to be mild. My fried tofu pockets (dul pock) had bits of red peppers everywhere. Fun. With the boiling hot soup and the spicy peppers, the warmth of the restaurant and me wearing a thick sweater, it made for quite the warm night. The standard drink is water with lime already squeezed into it (for those wondering what those bits floating around in their cup are). No ice. Yeah. So my spicy mild soup was not mild. It was spicy. It was very good though. I didn't have my rice (gave it to a friend). Had most of my hotpot (hotpot beef, wieners, imitation crab, fried tofu pockets, tofu, cabbage, vermicelli, tomatoes, enoki mushrooms...there may be something else I'm forgetting). Did not have my corn (I don't eat corn on the cob) or my quail egg (my friend loved these, so I gave mine to her). Very good portion to price. I was quite full after. I would totally order this again.

Also had a few pieces of my friend's Japanese popcorn chicken. Popcorn chicken done the Taiwanese way. Slightly floury batter - as in you can feel the powder when you eat it. Japanese style means lots of kewpie mayo, roasted seaweed strips (I think?) and bonito flakes on top (those flakes that wiggle when they get put on hot food). Yeah. The bonito was still wiggling, so it was still hot. The popcorn chicken was not cheap, but the price was not so bad for the portion either. 

I quite wanted to try their desserts (because the website picture and the Yelp picture makes it look really good, and the prices are decent too), but I was full and my party wanted Chatime (which ended up being a disappointment). Oh well. Another time.

Tl;dr: Good food. Good price for amount of food and quality of food. My new favorite place for non-ayce hot pot."}
{"text":"Came here for my friends birthday.. 

Waiters are nice and service is decent. Food is just average. They give you very little meat and a lot of vegetables.. It's like $20 per person I don't think it's worth the value. Wouldn't visit again."}
{"text":"*If you are allergic to peanuts DO NOT COME here*.  Ordered a dish that didnt have the peanut symbol and i told them about my allergy when i was ordering and they seemed dismissive of it because after my 1st bite in  I had an allergic reaction. If the chefs don't care for cross contamination or for the waiters' service to clients by at least saying that they can't guarantee that there won't be peanuts in it, I could have made the decision of staying or leaving when ordering for the sake of my health."}
{"text":"HOPO serves different kinds of individual hot pots.  We were two, and ordered the laksa hot pot and stinky tofu hot pot.  

I really like the concept as each person can order their own hot pot flavour.   The only downside that I find it annoying, is that you must ask the waiter to light out the candle once it over boils.  But however, when your hot pot does cold, you must ask the waiter to light the candle again in order to reheat your hot pot.

The broth and ingredients were very flavourful and fresh.  I would recommend this place for hot pot lovers.  Each hot pot ranges from $12-$15."}
{"text":"Came here as a group of 4, and we all ordered different hot pots. I tasted all of them. Two of them were good (spicy hot pot and spicy surf and turf) while the other two lacked in flavor (miso and tom yum). Spicy hot pots are indeed very spicy (you can adjust the spice level except for the surf and turf one). Generous portions (all the hot pots come with a bowl of steamed rice) and fresh ingredients. 

They have a daily special hot pot everyday for only $9.99 and desserts and snacks are 50% off after 9pm (They used to have it after 8pm in the past I guess based on other reviews). I think it is a very good value for only $9.99 for any hot pot. 


Overall, because it is a hit-or-miss place, I am giving 3/5."}
{"text":"This place just recently opened and my friend and I decided to try it out. It's owned by Chatime and seems to be very popular. Although the restaurant is small (approximately seats the same amount of people in a regular sized Chatime cafe), it was packed when I went at 8pm. 

The staff was very friendly as they opened the door for us and greeted on the spot. We were seated immediately however the seating arrangements were very tight! Tables were only separated ~5-8 inches apart, but luckily we're both small. We ordered the spicy fermented tofu hotpot (~$14) and the Japanese crispy chicken (~$8). The pot comes prefilled with the soup base, veggies (corn, enoki mushroom, tomatoes, nappa), beef, quail eggs, and tofu. The waiter will turn on the portable stove for you and soon enough, you're ready to eat! I didn't find the Japanese crispy chicken to be that great (first time trying) but the hot pot was delicious! The size is fair for its price as my friend and I shared one pot, which most people did as well, and were stuffed at the end of the meal. There's additional addons like rice or noodles ($1) and meat ($3). 

I would come again for a quick hot pot meal for sure! Considering that I only paid ~$12 including tips, that's not too bad for a hot pot dinner!"}
{"text":"Love the service and condition of this place.  Small menu but very presentable. It is amazing and easily shareable between two people. The dessert is small, but it is worth a try."}
{"text":"After a few subsequent visits, HOPO keeps me coming back. The food has definitely gotten much tastier than my initial visit, although the not at the point that it's to die for. I love the stinky tofu hot pot ( both spicy and not spicy)! I've never had problems finding a table and the staff is friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"I'm not so sure about this place. The idea is alright I guess, and the food was okay too. But I didn't like how you had to choose a certain broth to get the fixings and vice versa. I chose the Spicy Beef Broth because I liked the fixings going into that one (most others had no meat, only seafood etc). The broth was terrible. Very greasy and floral tasting. It's similar to Malaysian style hot pot I think. 

I think I'm too set in my ways with traditional hot pot. There are no sauces to dip your food in. Additionally, whatever fixings come in the pot are very limited. Like one quail egg. 

I don't think I would come back here."}
{"text":"To be honest, I'm not sure why this place is called Fusion, unless they mean a fusion of asian cuisines as their is Hong Kong, Singaporean, Japanese, Korean, etc. individual hot pots which are quite tasty! 

They have daily specials, and 50% off desserts and appetizers if you arrive after 8pm. There is another dessert place called Sweet Esc if your'e interested too but we took advantage of the appetizers and ordered the spare ribs! 

Got the Sukiyaki Beef for 9.99 and it was quite tasty! They give you bowls so you can start moving the food and soup from the hot pot to your bowl. Pretty sweet, however watch out for the water overflowing. You may have to pile cooked food on top of the other food to prevent the spillage. 

I was also told the mild Laksa is quite spicy so beware!"}
{"text":"Became a regular right after I discovered this place. Since their grand opening, they've expanded their menu and have added more pots with varying flavours and ingredients.

My usual is the Malaysian Laksa. WARNING, it does contain peanuts in the broth, which gives it an amazing nutty tone that compliments the other meats and veggies inside. Another favourite would be the Tom Yum. It has the right amount of heat and spice that is balanced by a tangy taste as well. 

Their popcorn chicken comes in many variety, the Japanese is personally my favourite as it comes with a personalized mayo sauce."}
{"text":"Based on some of the other reviews, I wasn't expecting much but surprisingly Ho Po wasn't that bad. 

We were a group of 7 on a fri night at 7:30 and luckily we made a reservation because the place was pretty packed.

Spicy beef and Malaysian laksa are probably the best ones from my experience. If you really can't take spicy, don't get spicy beef because the spice level can build up. I thought that it was alright though.

I wasn't expecting to be full, but I was actually stuffed after my meal. If you're a guy and tend to eat a lot, then you might not be as full as you want (some of my guy friends weren't full - only mediocre)

The Japanese popcorn chicken is really good, so I'd advise you to order that.

Overall, my experience was quite good and I'd go back."}
{"text":"Loved the idea of individual hotpots and after reading the reviews I thought it was worth checking out. This restaurant is smaller than most hotpot places but the best thing is they accept reservations. 

I ordered the Spicy Fermented Tofu (12.99$) - the flavour of the broth was on point and had good level of spice. I liked the variety of the vegetables but wished there was more than cabbage. I enjoyed the concept of the food being cooked in front of you but got a bit messy when it started to overboil. I wish there was an option to control the temperature of the stove but you ask one of the servers to turn it off for you. 

My mom ordered the Malaysian Laksa Soup which came with noodles (14.99$). It was tasty and she enjoyed it very much, I personally thought there was a strong coconut flavour so if you're not a fan of coconut I don't recommend this one. 

We also ordered the Cuttlefish but regretted it after the first bite. It was not crispy and instead was drenched with sauce leaving the fried cuttlefish soggy and unappetizing. For 8.99$ it was not worth it at all unfortunately. I recommend you opt for a different appetizer such as the Popcorn Chicken that I've heard rave reviews about. 

Overall, service was good and the people were friendly as well. The food was good and I wouldn't mind coming back to try a different option. I quite enjoyed a change from the usual AYCE hotpot."}
{"text":"For all the hotpot enthusiasts like myself out there who don't feel like AYCE, this is the place! The individual portions are a good size and the presentation is nice in my opinion. I visited for my second time and was pleased to see there are three new soups - Korean, Japanese and Asian Surf and Turf! With a variety of soup bases, you will definitely want to be back to try new ones. My friends always have the Tom Yum when they go so that would be my recommendation! ... but I myself am still undecided. I also tried the Tofu cheesecake yesterday for dessert and it was very light! Only complaint was that it wasn't really worth the price. Overall, will definitely come back whenever I am not feeling like full-fledged do it yourself hotpot. Note: the place is also a bit small so may want to call ahead to see how busy it is (:"}
{"text":"I don't think it's worth the price it's 12.99 and the taste was just ordinary nothing special about it.i think I went cuz of the pictures that it looked really good"}
{"text":"I'm so surprised this place has such a low-average rating! I've loved this place since my first visit (I've been back a few times). For a few reasons: 

1. Individual hot pot portions - Makes it more manageable, quality of the food is a bit better and is cleaner than having it left out for everyone to play with... Also a plus for aesthetic reasons.
2. You get to choose from various different kind of flavours such as sukiyaki or korean style
3. Great service - Every time I've visited, the servers were very polite and patient, even held the door for us when we entered. 

The only thing that could improve is seating. I wish they had a larger space to sit more people so there's less of a wait time around busy hours."}
{"text":"*all the pots are individual and they aren't AYCE. 
*Each pot contains pre-arranged assortments of items and I believe you can't substitute them out, and you can also add most toppings for an extra $1-2 each.
*Service was ok. Food came out quickly but server paid 0 attention until she realized that I was a food blogger, then she was super attentive lol 
*Fairly pricing. It's around $14-16 per person for each individual pot. 
*If you are like my friend who eat a lot, the portion here will definitely not be enough for you. 

-Honey pomelo soda & jujube soda
The soda was not too sweet, really refreshing and much needed to tone down the spiciness from the soup.

-Malaysian Laksa Soup 
The Malaysian Laksa soup base was a bit more watered down than what I expected, but it was still quite aromatic from the coconut milk and various spices. The soup was slightly sour and had a nice kick of spiciness to it! All the ingredients in both pots are nicely soaked with the flavors from the soup. I was also quite confused as our hot pots was served with both rice and noodle, however from online reviews, some were served without rice - so definitely check with the server!

-Tom Yum Seafood Soup
It didn't have that depth of flavors from an authentic tom yum kung, it honestly tasted just like a tomato soup with lime. I also noticed that at some point, the pot tilted slightly to one side as there wasn't anything to balance it at the bottom, other than a candle to warm the soup."}
{"text":"Ordered a noodle and snack at hopo. They didn't have the noodle so within two minutes of ordering, they tell us after the first order so I asked to cancel the snack and get a hot pot instead. They said the chicken was already cooking so I can't cancel anymore and I should order another snack instead. Ended up having to pay for the snack and another hot pot. What is this. It hasn't even been two minutes.... hopo can keep the $7 they made from the snack cost but I'm never coming back for the service and bad first impression here."}
{"text":"Love the decorations and interior, modern and chic. There's a long line and it took 30 mins for us to be seated. Should have called to make a reservation... 

Apart from the 30 mins wait, the food and services are amazing!!! Each person has their own pot and I had the spicy beef, which is pretty good. It comes with a bowl of rice. The portion is a bit too much, I can only finish 70%. Their dessert looks delicious but I'm too full to give a try. Would definitely come back and try their other stuffs. Overall experience is enjoyable!"}
{"text":"Checked in at Thursday 7pm, no need to make reservations 
The spicy hotpot has a fair price: 12-15$ per pot with rice
The dessert is great: not as sweet as other places
However, the fried fermented tofu is overpriced 8$ for only 4 bites, they add kimchi in the middle"}
{"text":"My friends and I went there when there was only like a few tables taken inside. However, we still waited for like 10min until we were seated. 

When we got our pot, we all noticed the soup flavor was really off and tasted even a bit sour. The ingredients in the pot looked cheap and tasted bad...We didn't wanna eat the pot anymore so we decided to order something else to fill up our starving stomach. However, it took the staff forever to fill our order even though the place wasn't packed at all. 

Conclusion- my experience at this place was very frustrating. The staff there seemed like they had no management nor profession. Food was really awful. With the same price, you can definitely get a much better hotpot meal somewhere else. Wouldn't go there again."}
{"text":"Came here today where there were only 5 tables only. 2 tables eating.

 As i sat down and ordered laksa and spicy fermented tofu we were both eager to just eat! As we waited the place filled up very fast! We noticed that other people that came before us were getting appetizers and some even their meal! Im like this is weird since we ordered at least 10 mins before them. My laksa camr but the fermented soup hasnt... And we waited and waited... And as the table beside us got their whole meal before us being apps and both entree it just got seriously ridiculous!  I asked the server how long for the other soup, and she said 5more mins since we are busy.... In my head we ordered and got here first before most of the tables! The last dish came, we both really were just frustrated and just wanted to get this meal over with.... Both dish were good in flavor but theres no customer service and theres no management in this restaurant.

We also noticed that other tables at least 4 were having the same problem 1 entree for a couple ..

Make a reservation, biggest tip it gets full fast. Tables are seated really closed to each other too. 
The smell is awful if your not a fan of stinky tofu. 
To the management, you guys should have a system here, seems like the staff is running with no heads. And dropping food to wrong tables. 

Oh btw they gave me two bills, when i asked for my bill, 2 servers two different bill."}
{"text":"The service was great, the location lots of parking, not to mention the free wi-fi. But the food is a meh for me. It just wasn't my cup of tea. Serving was big! bf and I had the Spicy Beef soup base and we weren't really all impressed with it. It was too spicy for our taste. The spice on the soup was a bit too strong I could not taste the beef flavour. I recommend u try the place, if its your palate good for you. But its just not for everyone. especially not for us."}
{"text":"Ouu a new interesting hotpot fusion restaurant! 

Food: I had the Malaysian Laksa hotpot. Very yummy and filling with lots of ingredients. It's a prefilled hot pot bowl with a whole bunch of ingredients in it, unlike traditional Chinese hotpot, where you cook as you eat. There was 2 shrimps inside my soup which is great. The fried tofu fishcake (?) appetizer that came with the meal was really yummy too (I liked it better than the noodles)! Price wise, about $14, it's not bad. Wintermelon drink was not bad as well.

Service: Seated immediately and the waitresses were VERY attentive! When my clumsy friends kept dropping their chopsticks, they literally grab you a new pair without complaining right away! (Please dont purposely drop your utensils). Good service!

Decor: It's a long rectangular space which can't seat many parties (maybe like 10 groups max)? Small but modern and clean though. 

Came with a few friends and of course we have to grab chatime next door right after lunch! Perfect warm and filling meal for cold days!"}
{"text":"Noooooo. Hopo was going to be my go-to restaurant when the cold settles in. 
This dream has been destroyed by my last visit here.

I came in and waited 10 minutes for a seat which wasn't a big deal but there is limited standing space within the restaurant, so if the line is long; you're most likely standing outside in the cold. 

When seated I ordered the tom yum soup, the japanese chicken, and the spicy (mild) beef soup.

Both arrived soon and they are individually cooked at your table as the waiter lights the mini candle under your pot to bowl it.  
First, I disagree with the price: for $17 (which is literally all you can eat price for kbbq) why is my soup filled with 75% veggies and 20% seafood (with 5% looking inedible) and 5% of disintegrating noodles??? 
Secondly, I realized the taste of \"hot\" is just destroying your taste buds and doesn't give you the satisfaction of the hot tingling feeling you get from eating something spicy.
Thirdly, the seating arrangement sucks. I do understand it's a small restaurant but if my next table neighbour drops her mussel back into her pot, the resulting splash should not be able to hit me.

Overall, I still do think this is a really neat idea but I wish they'd adjust their prices and seats."}
{"text":"Food: 3 stars
It's not traditional Chinese hot pot where you get to cook your own food. There are preset options to choose from. They bring you a shallow pot with everything in it already and it is heated on top of a rack with a candle underneath. I got the Malaysian laksa soup and it came with noodles on the side. Soup was tasty and mildly spicy. Not a lot of meat in it but it was still filling enough that I didn't leave hungry. My boyfriend got the vegetable hot pot and there were no complaints out of him about it. We also ordered the Korean popcorn chicken and it was ok. I've had a better version of it at Galleria for less.
For dessert, I got to try tofu cheesecake and matcha green tea milk pudding. Between the 2, I thought tofu cheesecake was better with the black sesame ice cream. The milk pudding was very bland and the pudding was firmer than what I was expecting. 

Ambiance: 3 stars
Small place with casual and simple decor.

Service: 2 stars
One waiter in particular seemed to be having a bad day. He seemed annoyed when we asked him to put out our candles because our soup was boiling over. The worst was when he dropped the bill on our table (we didn't even ask for the bill) and we were about to ask for a desert menu. We told him that we wanted to order dessert and he just took the bill and walked away! No apology, didn't offer us a dessert menu, nothing! My friend had to turn around and grab the desert menu himself. 
Luckily he wasn't the only person waiting our table. There was a nice girl who took away our pots when we were finished. She was nice and at least smiled at us."}
{"text":"New style of hot pot in the land of Markham which is one of my favourite spot recently.... friendly services, accurate order and tasty food... not to mention, their many variety of selection of soup base, fusion style... this place is NOT all you can eat, but is more than enough to fill up your tummy"}
{"text":"Omg...that fermented tofu smell. So strong. I love it though. The individual hotpot meals come in six different pre-made combinations. While it is an individual portion, it's still quite a bit of food, although you wouldn't think so when you see how shallow the pot is. Each order comes with rice and you can add extras for an additional charge. I ordered the fermented tofu and boy was it smelly. The contents in this pot however was nothing special and didn't look as appetizing as the picture. My boyfriend however was a lot smarter and ordered the spicy beef contents in the Tom yum broth. It looked and tasted good but we were a bit disappointed at the end of our meal. While the individual portions are presented nicely, we preferred the traditional hotpot where we get to pick and choose what we want in our pots. While we knew this going into the restaurant, the preselected six options just didn't work for us."}
{"text":"Great service and food. After reading the reviews I decided to try the Malaysian Laksa hotpot. It really was as flavourful and tasty as the reviews say and I was pleasantly surprised. I recommend the tofu shrimp appetizer with the wintermelon drink, the cheesy corn is just as good too. Came here with a few friends and my boyfriend. His chopsticks dropped twice, but somehow the waitress was extremely fast in replacing them. We got our hotpot turned off immediately after we requested it. Overall, it was a pleasant experience and I got very full. Even so, we went to Chatime which was right next door to get some bubble tea to save for later.

P.S. If you must get the spicy beef hotpot please know that it is extremely spicy. My boyfriend wanted it but I urged him to request it mild(from reading the reviews) and it was still too spicy for him."}
{"text":"Small restaurant with maybe 50 seats located beside Chatime. Don't think this place is anything special, pretty average. It's a nice idea to have personal hot pot versus all the other hot pot restaurants around that are AYCE, which can be quite pricy. 

I tried the spicy beef, which was pretty good. It has the numbing spice which made it pretty spicy. My friend tried the Tom yom and I thought it was VERY SALTY. Each hot pot comes with a bowl of rice on the side. The hot pots are well portioned. I was full without eating the rice. Make sure to ask them to turn off the fire/gas while eating because the soup boils over quickly. And it was not enjoyable eating with heat under your chin and the smell of gas fumes.  

The service was pretty good. Very prompt, but I'm not sure if they were just quick on service that day during the BOGO deal because of the long wait to get us out as quickly as possible. They took my pot away the very second I put my chopsticks down, but still had a mouthful of food. They were probably running out of pots at the back. 

I'm glad I tried it during the BOGO deal. It made it seem more worth it. I'd probably go back, but won't be often."}
{"text":"The good: 
--individual pots for each diner. Especially since 2 in our group were sick! 
-- Malaysian broth was delicious. 
-- Non spicy beef broth was good too. 
-- great service. 
-- family friendly. Welcoming to kids. We went as group of 6 incl 2 kids. 
-- Taiwanese fried chicken & Korean fried chicken apps were delicious! 
-- kids enjoyed the strawberry mango smoothie. They separated it into 2 glasses for us. 

Not so good: 
-- I wish we could control the gas burner. Instead it's either full blast or completely off 
-- wish more veggies not just Napa cabbage. 
-- spicy beef broth had good amount of heat but not much flavour. Want to try the Korean style broth next time. 

The place was pretty good. I wish I could give it four stars because the service was so good but.. I just can't due to the shortcomings listed above."}
{"text":"I would not really say it is Hotpot but more like Japanese concept of nabemono ?? but with a twist.  When outside is cold and feels like summer never going to arrive, eating at Hopo Fusion Style Hotpot is just so comforting.

The option in having individual order as I can pick what I want without the need to share with my dinner mate is just so good. I love my Spicy.. extreme spicy. So this is the place I can order whatever I enjoy without worrying as my dinner mates can pick what they enjoy. 

Spicy Beef Soup ($12.99) and Sukiyaki Beef ($9.99) with a selection of ingredients. A lot of vegetables which my dinner mate really enjoyed. 

The portion is just perfect for me.

Check for daily weekday specials for $9.99. 

And I will be back for more."}
{"text":"Trust me. Never go to this store any more. I have ordered the ????? There's only one ?? in the whole pot. The flavor was very very bad and I will never come back again."}
{"text":"Service:
Majority of the staff only spoke Mandarin, so I had some problems communicating with them. They also seem like new hires, and didn't get enough training. 

Ambiance:
Not you typical Asian hotpot setting. The decor is more modern, but the seating is a bit tight. There's hardly any table space left after getting your hotpot dish. 

Food:
This is not your typical AYCE or a la carte hotpot joint. You get a preset individual hotpot of your choice from the menu. There are limited options, and the ingredients are your regular  hotpot items just precooked for you, which kills the fun of going to hotpot. What really bothered me was the fact that they used gel cans as fuel. You couldn't control the temperature, and as you eat the pot gets overheated and spills over. At that price point and limited options, I rather just go to an AYCE hotpot restaurant."}
{"text":"Unlike other hot pot places, the pots are premade for you here. I ordered the spicy beef pot, but asked for it to be less spicy than normal. I'm either just really bad with spicy food or they didn't heed my request, but that pot was spicy as heck. There was very little beef in comparison to all the cabbage they used to fill up the pot, so despite reasonable pricing, you're mostly eating vegetables. I couldn't finish the pot I was eating, so if you're coming here with a friend, as long as both of you have mild appetites, then I suggest sharing a pot. Service was decent, but since I was here with a group, they kicked us out once we were finished to make space for the next group. 

Overall, this is an okay place, but I wouldn't return on my own."}
{"text":"Well took my wife here for what seems to be a semi regular weekly date at some random place after church. 

This time around I found it a bit more bleh. The place is hipster looking that's for sure and so is the general crowd. That should've indicated as a warning for me. 

Going in it reeked of stinky tofu. Apparently it is one of their soup bases and they also provide it in deep fried form.

This place is not AYCE like most other hot pot places. 

My wife ordered the laksa soup which was supposedly mildly spicy. It is mildly spicy when I tested it. However the only thing you really taste is the spice. The only other thing that has a sense of flavour is the shrimp and that's about it. 

The pot is served on a box with a small burner below. The burner requires staff to turn on and off. It's not something patrons can do on their own.

The food they provide is not fully cooked yet when they give it to you so don't try to share the food too soon. In fact the first piece of tofu I tried from my wife's pot was still frozen inside.

Not that it mattered. As I said earlier it had no real taste. 

As for me looking through the menu the only thing I may want is the original vegetable soup. However, I still want my beef and that option based on what I can gather from the menu was an extra $3. So pass...

I opted for the Japanese popcorn chicken. It's basically the Taiwanese popcorn chicken which I have to admit is done well topped with bonito flakes and Cupee mayonnaise.

That dish alone made me think of giving this place a 3 star. However because of the seating layout on the wall side being cramped and likely a fire hazard. I dropped it down to two stars. 

Probably won't come here again. I get a more satisfying meal for half the price at Pho 88."}
{"text":"I've now been here twice, having tried almost all the broths due to the buy one get one free deal.  My friends and I have tried:

1) fermented non spicy soup - not really my preference, has that flavor of picked cabages, a bit of a sour taste to it, but like i said just my preference

2) Spicy beef soup - If you like spicy, it's not a bad soup, however the spicy begins to overwhelm the soup, so if you're looking for balance of both I wouldn't suggest it, but if you're just looking for spicy, then this would be what you want.

3) Tom Yum - typical Tom Yum soup flavor, nothing overwhelming, it tastes like it does at most places in Toronto.  

4) Laaksa - I got to say, this one was surprisingly flavourful, not too spicy but just enough to give it a little spice.  This soup comes with Noodles instead of a bowl of rice.

5) Vegetarian Soup - surprisingly, this soup base was very refreshing, it just tastes clean, no MSG type of feel.  Mind you, there's no meat in this hot pot, but it was still delicious.

What I like about this place is it's not all you can eat, and each bowl ranges for $13-15, and you can pay $2 or so to get extra stuff.  I would say I was full after eating one, its the right amount of food, as opposed to going to a all you can eat hotpot and feeling gross because you try to eat your money's worth.

The only bad thing I can really say is that it takes quite a while for a hotpot prepared and served.  My guess is they probably don't have enough pots in the back to be running it assembly line mode.  You're probably avg'ing about a 15-20min after ordering, and when you look at it, you question why it would even take 15-20mins.

The Japanese popcorn chicken was also pretty good, very tender eventhough it was battered."}
