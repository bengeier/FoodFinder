{"text":"Very nice atmosphere! I love their salted caramel latte, and if you're feeling under the weather try their citro-booster! It has lemon, ginger, cayenne, and more."}
{"text":"Another location added to the growing family that Balzac already has. 

This coffee shops located in what used to be a PowerHouse right beside the heritage Foundry Lofts on Landsdowne (just north of the main intersection Lansdowne and DuPont). 

Great ambience and unique decor make this location another gem where you can come, sit, relax either alone or with your friends. 

The quality of the coffee and the service is in line with the rest of the other location so if you are in the area, a visit is worthwhile."}
{"text":"I went in for the first time yesterday. I've been to the Liberty Village location and the one in Ryerson's campus, and the Powerhouse location is my favourite. It's so beautiful inside, with marble top tables, friendly service, and not too much clutter. I heard the weekends get crazy busy, but I went on a Monday afternoon and there were still 2-3 tables available."}
{"text":"Balzac's Powerhouse location is located around Dupont/Lansdowne. The cafe is somewhat hidden if you don't know where it is or live around the area. I've gone to this location several times and always find that the staff was very friendly and attentive, the drinks are good, and that there is plenty of seating if you are looking for a quiet place to work. Moreover, the decor is on point and I have definitely taken a few pictures of the pretty interior!"}
