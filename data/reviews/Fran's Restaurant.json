{"text":"*Came here on a Sunday morning. It was pretty packed, nearing to brunch time and all. 

*Ordered a big breakfast which came with 2 pancakes, 2 sausages, 2 eggs, 2 slices of bacon, homefries and bread. They were super generous with the amount if homefries too! Huge menu for other options too. 

*Food was not bad. Pancake batter was unique and sweet. Sausages however appeared a bit burnt. 

*Service was friendly but our server didn't check up on us enough. We were waiting to grab their attention for the longest while until another server noticed us."}
{"text":"This diner has a very extensive menu.  We came here before a show and had brunch.  I had the Eggs Benedict with the portobello mushroom instead of the bread and it was very good.  As a diner, the food was better than most restaurants in its class and we would definitely come back."}
{"text":"I have nothing negative to say about Fran's. I came here for a big breakfast and I got a big breakfast. The servings are generous and the food arrived promptly. You can't knock good comfort food at an inexpensive price. And of course me not being from Canada I appreciated the free wifi (not sure if it's theirs). I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"laTe night experience after shopping around Apple Store and the service is poor. Food is descent but it is a restaurant and we need waiters not self serve"}
{"text":"Food is great! no matter what time I go the food is fresh and always got considering it's 24 hours I think it's fantastic! The servers are always super super polite. One time I got a nice server but you could tell what they were saying was so scripted not a genuine niceness but other than that one so-so experience this location is great. I've been to the other one but it's not as cozy as this one."}
{"text":"My friends and I stopped here for something to eat after seeing concerts at Massey Hall two nights in a row. The service was good, the decaf was fresh, and their pancakes were awesome--crisp on the outside but nice and fluffy in the middle. My friends liked that they could have a drink, and we were all overwhelmed by the big menu, though we all had breakfast both nights. I'll definitely go back next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"Greeted by a rude hostess and got attitude when I asked to sit at a booth.  Waited over 10 minutes and wasn't even offered water.  Terrible service.  Got up and left."}
{"text":"Waited 20 minutes for menus do got up and left. Nobody even noticed."}
{"text":"I was flabbergasted at how rude our waiter, \"Chris C\" was. My girlfriend ordered eggs benedict and the egg was rock hard in the center. She complained about it and because \"Chris C\" had taken so long to come & ask how it was - I was already done.

She didn't want anything else because I was done eating. She had not even touched the food because of her displeasure. She asked to have it removed from our bill & \"Chris C' refused to do so. She said she did not want it, and he gladly forced us to pay for it regardless. He was rude, inconsiderate, and actually gave us faces and slammed her plate in the plate-tray.

I will never go back to Fran's because of \"Chris C.\" I can't believe he is still on staff there.

{"text":"I've had to wait a while for seats/to order/for food but it's no big deal. Cute retro diner decor, bright & shiny. Big selection, always busy, nice staff, full bar - good place to bring friends after a night of partying."}
{"text":"Fran's is amazing in every way.

They have food for any time, for whatever you're feeling like: breakfast, lunch, dinner, stumbling home from the bar looking for some food, been studying for 12 hours straight and need some food and nowhere else is open, or just grabbing a coffee. Everything is good here!

This time here was my first time having pancakes. AMAZING. I had chocolate chip banana, but I'm sure they're all good. The portions are also huge, for $7 you get 4 pancakes 20cm wide. The sandwiches are also amazing, the California wrap, BLT, chicken avocado club, western and grilled cheese are great. Another amazing thing about this restaurant: the fries! I don't think they're fresh made, but they're really nice and fluffy.

If you haven't been here yet already, stop by Fran's next time you're in the neighborhood. You won't regret it!"}
{"text":"These breakfast vibes feel good. Vibes, classic vibes, late night vibes. Come to Fran's. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"I am a huuuuge fan of \"greasy spoon\" old-timey diner restaurants. I love them. I love the classic eggs and sausage kind of breakfast, and I LOVE 24-hour diners, I love the shitty coffee and pour-out sugar dispensers.... but Fran's is the worst diner I've ever eaten at. The server wasn't nice, it didn't feel friendly (like you think a diner would), and the sausage was gross... and I'm one of those people who never complains about anything at a restaurant. 

I think Fran's is a completely overrated tourist attraction that is staying afloat by name alone. Maybe their other food items are better, but I don't think I'll ever go back to try. There are too many amazing diners in downtown Toronto that have never failed to give me acceptable breakfast."}
{"text":"This place is definitely not worthy of Fran's franchise. We have waited far too long to be served cold and not-so-good food. 
My Benedict came with a cold hollandaise sauce, almost hard boiled poached eggs and a sad looking orange slice as fruit. 
My friends have tried a western omelette and soup and sandwich which were both cold and tasteless. 
The only reason I am giving two stars instead of one is my previous good experience with other Fran's locations."}
{"text":"Quick service and HUGE portions.  Standard breakfast fare, nothing too fancy.  Server was friendly although at times she was a bit hard to track down."}
{"text":"Disgusting food. Frozen raviolli, powdered gravy nonsense, worst cheese meatball. Alright for a drink in the summer but stay away from the food. Bland and budget."}
{"text":"Nice quiet restaurant.  Friendly service.  Okay food but quality is not consistent.  Some items taste okay but some are pretty bad.  The big breakfast never fails though."}
{"text":"Food is ok, drinks were watery, soda was flat, ice missing, each time the waiter was asked to address it it was like we were putting him out."}
{"text":"I came to Fran's on a great night to be on a patio and was quickly sat by a pleasant host :) The patio was great and provided some nice atmosphere. The nachos we ordered were lacking in luster and peppers, additionally the cheese was also not completely melted. The prices were decent for what it was but this could only be based off the two glasses of wine and large shared nachos. The server was beyond monotonous which begged the question of, \"Do you want to be here?\". All in all, 3/5 to be fair."}
{"text":"Great diner to eat at - recommend if you are going to the Sony Centre."}
{"text":"Everyone deserves a second chance right? WRONG!! I did just that and was really disappointed in myself. I remember going to the Frans on College many moons ago and experiencing a surly waitress and flies in the washroom (it was winter). 

This location looks really nice but that is about it. As we were leaving my boyfriend said \"it's like putting a new hat on a piece of garbage\".  

The service wasn't good and I wonder if it was a shortage of staff and not lack of training. There I go giving the benefit of the doubt again.....I also wanted to check the kitchen to see if a child made my breakfast. 

** if you ever hear that little voice, listen to it **"}
{"text":"We decided to go here before a concert. The food was great and the server was very good. This is our last night in Toronto, but we can't wait to try out Fran's for breakfast in the morning.

Friday morning breakfast wasn't very good...should have went to Sunset Grill."}
{"text":"Found this place on yelp and decided to give it a try. Had Fran's Premium Breakfast and thought it was very good. The service was fast and friendly. 

As a frequent business traveler to Toronto, I really enjoy places like this. It isn't a chain, and the cost shows my boss I really do care about expenses. Win win.  I'll come here again  but I have to try other breakfast places nearby."}
{"text":"Reliably consistent diner food. Can't go wrong for breakfast. (anytime) or for lunch. Wouldn't be on my list for dinner though."}
{"text":"Nothing extraordinary, classic breakfast lunch dinner. Overall is a place you wont hate nor love! Everything is normal. Dont know what else do say, they have coat hook near every tables. 3.8/5 for food, service 5/5"}
{"text":"Tried to eat here.  Waited  30mins after ordering and food never came. Left.  Very disappointed with a place that says it is 24 hrs.  #neveragain"}
{"text":"Pros: It wasn't packed for a Sunday brunch at 11am, my companion and I got a table right away
Cons: There's a reason for that

The outdoor waitress was friendly & professional, but there weren't any seats.... so we went inside. It's a really nice looking restaurant.
Hostess: Super-quiet. Led us to a table, dropped the menus and left. No hello, here's your table, enjoy your meal, barely eye contact. I think she was shy?
Waitress... I think she was having a bad week. Nevertheless, please remember you're on the job. Give us a fake smile once in a while.
I was a hungry boy this morning, and the food was barely edible. 
The pancakes were hard and flat. 
I ordered scrambled eggs and got fried (the second server who brought them said, \"who's got the scrambled eggs\".... and they obviously WERE NOT). 
Sausages were sliced in half lengthwise and burnt, one of them to a carbonized husk of its former self. We asked the server, \"is it supposed to look like that?\" to hear her response. She said \"yes that's how they're done\". Geez. Lies all around.
Cold toast. Bacon, barely cooked. I'd rather have had normal-cooked sausages and crispy bacon!
I'd compliment the \"Arise\" orange-cranberry juice, but they got that wrong too. No cranberry. I later got some thick, super-sweet cranberry syrup in a glass on the side. Yuck.
Waited nearly 10 minutes at a cleared table to get the bill, I had to go get her.

Needless to say, there's so many decent breakfast/brunch spots in Toronto, we're not going there again."}
{"text":"Usually pretty good but this last time the turkey sausage with my breakfast take out the was disgusting.
Is this actually meat ?
Tastes like wall paper paste absolutely disgusting 

Never again 

From now on going sunset grill"}
{"text":"We went there at thanksgiving evening.
We ordered garlic bread for start, it seems that they forgot to use garlic on it and the bread was not toasted well and not fresh.
The main course my wife and I choose chicken food ( forgot the name). Both are terrible I think they  had not have enough customer during long week end and what they used weren't fresh at all.we paid 50$ but if we went to KFC for sure we got more delicious chicken with 15$.
It was my worse food experience ever."}
{"text":"I went to other branch sorry for my last preview about this location"}
{"text":"I enjoyed Fran's for the diner that it is, and I will surely be back after a night of boozing it up. I appreciate that I was finally able to find a place with a Tuna Melt going on, even if it was a little wacky with the baguette thing happening. 

It was very busy and they seemed under staffed, but everything came along at the right time, and I didn't feel neglected. Cute atmosphere and solid diner food. And a great location!"}
{"text":"Wow, what an ass-kicking this place is taking!  I didn't think it was so bad.  Coming from New York, it was about what I expect from an all-night diner: mediocre breakfast food, indifferent service, drunken patrons.  It was right door to my hotel, so convenience is admittedly the main reason I stopped in.  I wasn't expecting haute cuisine or five-star service and I didn't get it, but I'm pretty sure my late-night waffle saved me from death."}
{"text":"I went this morning and attempted to order the Big Breakfast. When I arrived my server greeted me and said I could sit anywhere. All the tables were full so I asked if there was actually a table available. I got attitude and told to seat myself. I was not pleased and chose to sit at the only available table in the restaurant by the patio doors.  I ordered the big breakfast, with my server seeming a little stressed out. There was still minor attitude but you could see something was annoying her and that showed through during this experience. After ordering, my server came back and told me I have to swap out the pancakes as they did not have pancake mix ready. While not directly saying it, her attitude was that of take it or leave it. She claimed I could have french toast instead. I appreciated the suggestion and ordered it given I was not in the mood to dick around. I wanted pancakes not f*****g french toast. If I wanted french toast I would have asked for it to begin with. 

At this point I was so annoyed that yet again, frans seemed to disappoint. I nearly said f**k it and walked out of the restaurant. I simply had enough. I got my food, ate only part of it and paid the bill. I did not care about the change, I just wanted out of there. I only stayed to be polite, not because I wanted to. 

I will never go back here, Frans consistently disappoints me. I have been going there for years but I will never go back again.  This is just stupid, I keep get second rate service and never treated like a respected customer. 

I will not be recommending Frans and I will gladly await the day the chain closes its doors for good!"}
{"text":"Service is excellent but the here food is hit or miss. I have received burnt pancakes, undercooked eggs, ect and other times had everything pretty much perfect. It's also very noisy because of its busyness, so don't stop in if you want a quiet conversation. The hashbrowns are probably my favourite thing."}
{"text":"Have been here for the second time! I love the pancakes and the waffles. I was not so hungry this morning so just ordered a waffle and coffee. I enjoyed the taste of coffee. It's not so strong and smelled so good! Oh and, waffles just the reason to drink maple syrup!!!"}
{"text":"My first trip to Toronto, had a show at Massey Hall at 8 pm, and everywhere else had a long line/wait for a table.  SO, my friend and I opted for Fran's, which you must admit is a fab location if you're going to Massey Hall (right across the street!).  The drinks were pretty good (and cheap), which is generally a good way to start.  We tried the poutine, but having nothing to compare it to (I DID say this was my first trip to Toronto?), we liked them.  The steak was likely not a great choice at a diner, and I know better for the next time. But the veggies were not overcooked and the mashed potatoes tasty.  

We returned after the show the next night (yes, Eddie Izzard fans rarely just do ONE show), as it was right there and open, and we were starving after waiting more than an hour for our guy at the stage door.  Service at that hour was a bit slow, but again, drinks were cheap and good, and the burger and fries were quite good.  

All in all, a decent option...."}
{"text":"Fran's done changed.
I used to go here a lot in high school. Partly because it was cheap and you could sit for hours and drink coffee and smoke, and partly because I was addicted to their home fries (which are more like tater tots than fries or potatoes).

I just went back again today and was pleasantly surprised to find that although the old diner charm is pretty much identical to my youth, the menu has been significantly upgraded.

It's still a greasy spoon with tater tots for home fries, but what other greasy spoon offers vegetarian breakfast sausage? In fact, there's a lot of vegetarian options added to the menu and formerly banned delicacies like fruit run rampant throughout the menu."}
{"text":"roast chicken is all right,egg omelet is too weak and greasy ,the price is little higher than the taste"}
{"text":"Servers were walking around our table but kept ignoring us despite making eye contact several times. The place was also empty."}
{"text":"I've been to this place twice now and both times have been great! The servers were friendly and the food was delicious. 

The first time my boyfriend and I went to Fran's we both had strawberry milkshakes, avocado chicken clubhouse sandwiches with homemade fries. I could put avocado on everything so I was delighted to see this on the menu.

The second time I went to Fran's was very late at night, after a night on the town with my girl friends. I don't think I have ever had a better late night feed. The havarti burger was juicy and delicious and I had homemade fries with gravy on the side which was awesome. 

I will definitely be going back soon and will be recommending it to all my friends."}
{"text":"Hard to find a place open after 10:30PM for some late night supper...We first went to 'Origin' and their kitchen close by 11PM, and we got there by 10:50PM, so we didn't want to bother the kitchen ppl who are cleaning up. We went to 'Marche' and they close at 11PM too... 0/2=(

Luckily we were walking along front street and saw 'Fran's'! Now I have been to Fran's to eat at the College Street location a few years ago with a sit-in diner style, but this location had a pretty big patio, so we went in and got a spot. They open until 2AM EVERYDAY!!! YEAAAA!!!

We were greeted by a young, cute waitress and started off with their fruit smoothies... I got the 'Fran's Fanta' which has banana, pineapple, manga, raspberry.
Verdict: A little too watered down and not too thick like I like it... But still healthy.

My gf got the 'Pina Colada' which has pineapple, honey, yogurt, coconut.
Verdict: YUM YUM!!! This was a great smoothie compared to mine.

On to the main event!!! I ordered the meatloaf...It comes serve steam veggies and mash potato. Now the meatloaf has beef gravy on it as well, so I mixed it with my potatoes. I noticed that my meatloaf was a bit burnt, thus, tasting very different and funny...
Verdict: Not a HIT!

My gf got the 'Fran's Premium Breakfast' which has 2 eggs, home fries, toast, home made potatoes, sausage. Now the sausage is split in half so it works out to be 2 sausages. 
Verdict: I can make a better breakfast than this!!!

Our server was not really visible, but I guess she's doing some work inside. After we finished our meal, she did recommend that the coconut cream pie is really good...So we got the pie.

My gf usually don't like coconut, but this PIE was OHHHH MYYYY!!!!
Light, fluffy, not heavy at all pie, and not overly sweet. I enjoyed it and so did my gf.
Verdict: This was a HIT!

2/5, but this joint I would come back to try other food and the pie and the smoothie, and mainly because its open until 2AM..."}
{"text":"If you are in need of decent diner food 24/7, Fran's is for you.  OR... if you are in need of decent diner food and have over 150 pages of Frankenstein left to read and need to finish the book in one night, it's perfect.

I had the pancakes, and they were a little fluffy for my taste.  However, after I drenched them in delicious syrup they were splendid.

The service isn't super quick and it can get pretty noisy, so if you like your midnight pancakes fast and in peace this may not be the best place for you."}
{"text":"Two nights ago at pride my girlfriend and I were chased 4 blocks across college through the intersection of yonge, towards the police station  ( so many onlookers, no one did anything to help, except this waitress) when this waitress from frans tells us to come inside to get away from this guy. So we go to the washroom and lock ourselves in. The guy knows we're inside and starts creating a fuss. The manager tells us that we need to leave. We insist that he let us exit through the back into the alley so we can get to police station without having to confront the guy again. He says he can't let us through the kitchen ( I work in hospitality so what this guy means is \" the kitchen is a disgusting mess\" ) makes me wonder what was back there.  So anyway, instead of calling the police ( whom are right next door) and telling us to wait downstairs where we were safe until the guy outside was dealt with he tells US WE'RE trespassing and need to leave before he calls the cops on us !!! I can't believe it! I'm so disappointed and enraged that I decided to leave this post. Customer service is just as important as food quality and I wouldn't say that the food here was that great last time I tried it. Decent place to get breakfast when you're out drinking late and that's it. The one waitress gets a gold star for being  a normal human and trying to help fellow females. The manager/ owner/ \"security\" guard is a pig. Throwing us back out to the wolves! Despicable!!!"}
{"text":"Morning Glory Waffle is phenomenal! My husband liked mine so much that he ordered one for himself after his huge omelet. The combination of the maple with the bacon and apple is genius! And the orange juice is so tasty! Thank you Frans for the great breakfast!"}
{"text":"It's expensive diner food, but the menu is pretty big, the location is good, and most of the staff are solid. I will say the Manager appears to be incompetent - he wouldn't let us sit at first despite the place being mostly empty, and later he actually touched the food on our plates.  His staff seem to be able to work around him, thankfully, but they would definitely do better with someone competent."}
{"text":"I love Fran's. 

My favorite is their Irish Coffee. They make it strong and for only $6. My last one was so strong that my waiter asked me if I was going to be driving after because he wanted to warn me that he had made it a little heavy handed, hah!

The food is a little more expensive than you would expect from a diner ($14 burgers, $10 salads) but the food is really tasty and the portions are so big I usually have to take mine home. Since it is a little pricey, I usually stick with the Irish Coffee and an starter. The starters come so large that you could eat it as a meal no problem. I've never had a meal from Fran's I didn't enjoy.

The decor is pretty cool, and it's in a great area AND it's 24 hour."}
{"text":"Today 10/04/09 after the CIBC 5km Run For The Cure my run mates and l decided to go to Fran's since it was the only place in the area with a shorter line-up for brunch. The line was moving fast until it came to us. For the number of people in our party we had to wait an additional 20mins on top of the 15mins that we had already waited.

We were seated in a booth and our waitress came right away to take our drink orders. We were all very impressed & I should point out that our waitress was very attentive & polite. 

We requested separate bills and this request was honored with \"no drama or raised eye brows\". We all ordered breakfast and it was so so, nothing to brag about.

Might go back, unfortunately it's not the Best or Preferred Choice in the neighbourhood. Will leave it to the Tourist's!!!"}
{"text":"Most delicious berry pancake ever! Got the berry pancakes and a milkshake, never been so full in my life! Excellent value for money, and no cream/icecream on pancakes made this a perfect brunch!! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Overall I was impressed. I'd go again. 

Food was flavourful, hot and fresh. Service was quick and nothing missed. Generally I was quite impressed for a 24 hr diner. Only concern was that the coffee wasn't so great. But for the price I can't really complain."}
{"text":"Went here on a saturday night (Blue jays vs Royals Game 2) and it was actually not as busy as I expected it to be. The servers were very nice and honest when I asked about the restaurant's specialty and their recommendations since it was my first time there. I had chicken baja and it was pretty good for a well-known breakfast restaurant, though the downside of it is that the wrap was too loose for me to hold on to it properly. 

The restaurant in general is very warm and cozy, family and friends friendly feel atmosphere. Overall, it's a great place to be with your friends after a long day out with pretty filling dishes and friendly staff."}
{"text":"This place is terrible.  I have only bad things to say so I'll keep it short.  I ordered the triple decker Reuben with fries.  I got literally a slice of corned beef in each deck.  What a joke, at druxy's for half the price I get 3 times the amount.  It's as if they used the third slice of bread to keep the weight of the sandwich up.  After complaining (which I never do) to our non-existent server, they gave a 10% discount, on the sandwich only.  I freaking dollar, but they were probably expecting me to go across to metro and buy some corned beef from their deli instead.  What a joke -- this place is a miserable fail in food and service and definitely a zero star rating.  I hope they bomb, they'd deserve it."}
{"text":"If I could I would give this place negative stars.  On my recent three day stay in Toronto this was the only bad experience I had.  Originally I was headed to what quickly became my favorite breakfast spot The Senator down the same street,but since it was Canada Day they were closed.  I decided to try Fran's since it was right down the street from it,what a waste of time.  The moment I got in I knew it was the wrong decision.  The hostess that greeted me was not very friendly this I didnt mind much but it went downhill from there.  The waitress that was serving us came around our booth asked for our drinks but she looked like we were bothering her.  When she finally did bring our drinks two coffees,a smoothie and my tea she left faster than Speedy Gonzalez I looked down at my cup and it had lipstick stain all over the cup YUCKKK.   Once my boyfriend finally got her attention, and I told her about the cup her response was \"OH\" and she left.  I don't know how much Fran's cares about customer service but any other place would have apologized and made the situation better,instead she made it worse.  My assumption is that she or the entire establishment are racist,but I was paying my money just like everyone else. They depend too much on the little decoration they have to attract people, had my phone had battery I would have never stopped here. We ended up not getting breakfast here Thank God and just left with the sour taste in our moths. Overall horrible service,water downed coffees and they had flies around other peoples food. 
STAY AWAY AT ALL COST HEAD DOWN TO THE SENATOR DOWN THE STREET."}
{"text":"Fran's may be my new go to restaurant for chicken and waffles. I have been to Fran's near college and Yonge before for breakfast and I was not impressed, so when I received a gift card to Fran's I was honestly considering giving it away. I searched the menu and decided to get the chicken and waffles after hearing great reviews. I honestly didn't think I would like it, but to my surprise it was amazing. The waffles were so fluffy and fresh. It had a great buttermilk flavour with a slight hint of vanilla. Just amazing. I tried both the chicken and the  waffles separately? before adding the syrup. The syrup was the Cherry on top. The chicken was very well executed. I love when my chicken is cooked right through. I don't enjoy having water leaking? from my chicken when I cut into it. Fran's chicken was well done, yet not dry. Both the chicken and the waffles were bursting with flavour. This was my first time trying chicken and waffles, so there may be better out there, yet I was impressed with Fran's version of the dish. I ordered my meal ahead of time for take out, and the service was fast and professional. I also ordered a slice of carrot cake and it was moist and delicious. I will definitely go to Fran's again for their chicken and waffles. If you plan to dine in, I would suggest you be prepared to wait a while to be seated. There was a long line of people waiting to be seated and the restaurant was full. I guess once they open the patio section for the summer, things will be better. The interior of the restaurant could use a makeover, hopefully the owners will give it some thought."}
{"text":"I just love their Big Breakfast!!!!!!! OMG!

Their very big on fried foods. I love how the waitress go to your table with their Credit Card swiper machines. They don't do that in the states. lol"}
{"text":"Wonderful outdoor seating on a perfect summer evening.  My meal was fine (not great) but be warned that other family members who got very different items -- stir fry and lasagne -- both reported that their items were SWEET, an obviously not in a good way."}
{"text":"Saturday night and only a half filled restaurant. Horray, we will enjoy this.

Not so. The greeting was friendly and we got a seat outside. The noise level was totally overbearing. I walked around among the half empty tables but the speakers were all  well placed to destroy any attempt at talking to your fellow guest. 

I asked if the sound could be turned down a notch. The waitress went to ask the manager and came back in a few sec: \"He said NO, the sound cannot be altered.\"

We should have left. 

We were then offered a seat at the very back, slightly less noisy.

But now we were out of sight and out of mind of all.

It became a long dinner even though the service was very friendly. The food? Totally average, absolutely nothing to come back for.

Several members of my family have been Fran's guest for over 50 years but but it's really time to look elsewhere now."}
{"text":"Good food and the place is nice, perhaps looks more like it's aimed for breakfast and lunch than dinner, but very comfortable and relaxed. Had All-canadian burger and it was tasty, big portion and very decently priced! The service was good as well, totally worth recommending and visiting again!"}
{"text":"This place is classic. Appeals to the nostalgia in most of us and gives us the feel of a diner back in the day. 

Pros:
price is reasonable
food is good

cons
selection is standard, nothing memorable.

Coffees and drinks are refillable."}
{"text":"Worse food I have ever had. Terrible service. Rude waiter. Long wait about an hour even though the place had empty tables the hostess thought it would be cleaver to make people wait. Greasy, oily, tasteless, bland and horrible food. Just cross the street and go to tim Horton or Starbucks."}
{"text":"Alright but would only go back for breakfast.  Ordered chicken and waffles and it came with one waffle and 3 wings? Ok, but for $13 I could get way better.  The chicken tasted and was cooked well, but the waffles were not the best.  I was expecting at least a quarter chicken.  Staff was fast and friendly."}
{"text":"O'Grady's at 518 Church Street in Toronto has a very nice, reasonable priced brunch menu on weekends.  The old bar location with varied seating is a pleasant place to linger over coffee.  The pea meal bacon is nicely grilled and a good Canadian touch."}
{"text":"Food and service at Fran's was quite good. Food arrived fairly quickly and service was fast. However the food tasted average and bland. 

Experience at Fran's can be improved with better tasting food."}
{"text":"This place is exactly what you would expect from a diner. Good service, reasonable prices and a no frills atmosphere. 

Food is good with large portions. And they have a beautiful large patio."}
{"text":"We had to put our order in twice because the kitchen lost the first order. After a long long while our food arrived and they actually got some of the order wrong. We got our bill and noticed they did not discount anything for our inconvenience so one of us asked the waiter (in private) if he could do something about this. He kindly did so and we thought that was that. We did not request to speak to the Manger (Mike) but he came to our table ...not to apologize or take responsibility but to question us. He was rude, condescending and unprofessional. I thought it was important for people to know that the behaviour of this inconsiderate individual made the 10 year old in our party cry. Thank you so much for ruining a little girl's day."}
{"text":"Starving after a night of dancing, I made my way to Fran's with a group of friends.
In all honesty, I wasn't thrilled about hitting up this greasy spoon joint but alas I was pleasantly surprised!
The menu is actually several pages long and includes a wide range of items from breakfast to wraps, burgers, appetizers, quesadillas,sandwiches, entrées, etc. 
We all found something we enjoyed and the prices are decent too.
Hmmmm...looks like Fran's has made it to my roster of places to go for late night eats."}
{"text":"When you are hungry at the middle of the night this is a great place with variety of good dishes. I love it!"}
{"text":"Feeling hungry after partying and want something fast? Come here for cheap eats! It's nothing spectacular but its good enough to come back over and over again when you want something quick and straightforward! They serve all day breakfast, sandwiches, French toast, pasta, ribs, and the list goes on! If anything try their pulled pork poutine. YUM! Their dishes are always in huge portions and you will never feel hungry leaving this place. Also try their milkshakes...oh my goodness...it's amazing."}
{"text":"The restaurant has a classic diner feel. We sat upstairs, the interior was nice, but they could use some umbrellas or sunroof of sorts, the sun was in our faces the whole time. We switched tables at some point, because it was really hot, but it didn't help much. They do, however, have these pipes above the tables which occasionally sort of sprinkle water on you, which is interesting and refreshing, but probably not an ideal solution to the problem. Behind the bar, they have an actual umbrella over the cash register, so I'm sure they're aware of issue.

The food was OK, but the service was extremely slow - we had to wait 45 min or so for eggs for 2 people.

Overall, not a bad place to go to for brunch, but there are better options in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Big breakfast is now $13.99?!  That's a bit steep, since breakfast ingredients are the cheapest. They use real eggs though and the pancakes are tasty. I like the freshness and service. If they had a breakfast special for the downtown working crowd they would do well. No one in my office goes anymore because of the prices."}
{"text":"I LOVE FRAN'S!

We went out to this location on Saturday looking for a nice patio that wasn't packed or over priced. I had a Monte Cristo sandwich that was great and my boyfriend had a cheese steak that was cooked perfectly. We tried this new Mill St. lemon tea beer which was pretty gross, but I digress. This location in particular always has great food and awesome staff whether you're there for lunch or stumble in at 3:00 am for \"breakfast\" (they're extremely tolerant of drunk club girls, bless them)"}
{"text":"Breakfast was decent, service was a touch slow considering the place was nearly empty.  I had the eggs Blackstone and my bf had the classic Benny.  Not awful but nothing special."}
{"text":"i've been to this exact location a total of four times now and it's still one of my favourite go-to places that i'll recommend to my friends. it's a quite popluar diner/ family restaurant but i never had trouble with getting a table. 

in addition, the service there is great as all the servers i had in the past were friendly and attentive. and of course, the food is always delicious and their menu has a wife variety of dishes that i still have yet to try.  

everything is so filling even the salads!"}
{"text":"I don't understand the bad reviews. The food was good, portions were large and the prices were reasonable. Change the music to match the vintage theme of the restaurant and blast the AC and it would be perfect. I'd go back and try the breakfast next time."}
{"text":"Great place for a yummy breakfast! They even do half orders for pancakes, French toast or waffles which was perfect for me. Portions are generous. Service is fast and friendly. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Right beside my office, so I tend to frequent a lot. Service is hit or miss, but you're here for the food, right? 

Greasy, delicious goodness. Home fries are bomb, and pancakes usually hit the spot. Don't bring your health concious friends, but do bring your vegetarian ones (they carry vegetarian sausages my work BFF craves all of the time)."}
{"text":"I've had breakfast here 3 times this week and excuse yet to find fault. Their omelettes are the best and the portions are huge. Friendly, helpful waiters too."}
{"text":"Definitely not going back again.

Went there multiple times. They're getting 2 stars (technically 1.5 stars is what I really want to give) because the first and second time I went, it was alright and they are open 24/7. Typical diner food, decent service, decent food and good portions. The breakfast items were okay (I mean, you can't really screw up eggs, pancakes, bacon). 

It's gone downhill now. Service is terrible. Its so slow and food is mediocre at best. It takes forever for the waitress to bring us drinks and the last time we went, she never checked on us and we tried to wait for her to bring us the bill so we can pay and leave. After looking for her for over 15 minutes we flagged down another waitress to ask for the bill. Other people sitting in our section wasn't happy either. Another man actually gave up, asked to cancel his food and asked for the bill for his drink. Another family waited for a while after being seated and just ended up getting up to leave. And this isn't the first time we've received terrible service and mediocre food. 

Really disappointed."}
{"text":"Always good, solid diner food, no matter when you go.  4 AM on a holiday weekend? Sure.  Saturday brunch?  You might wait, but the food is solid even at peak load.

Definitely better than the one on Shuter, nicer staff overall, better kitchen, etc.  A late night favourite."}
{"text":"Morning glory was amazing, careful with eating it right away, melted caramel is very hot and will burn your mouth awfully.
But is soo good.. same as everything on the menu, except for the fresh fruit bowl, that was nasty.. fo'real, avoid it... nothing fresh nor flavorsome. 
But thata just a detail where they can improve.. love the place"}
{"text":"Gotta say, maybe it's my Vancouverite easy-going attitude *ducks to avoid shoes thrown by Torontonians* but I enjoyed Fran's.  Was taken there for breakfast before we headed to the ROM and it was a decent breakfast.  Sure, not the best breakfast I've ever had, but it was cheap, not too greasy, fast, and they were good on the coffee refills.  We had no issues with service, and in fact, had about three different servers help us out."}
{"text":"I did a mass order from Fran's last summer when I was organizing breakfast for the office (life of an intern). Think ~100 pancakes, waffles, and french toasts. They were super cool with it. Confirmed my order with them the night before and gave them the time that I would swing by. When I got there in the morning, everything was already made, boxed, and bags were at the cashier ready for me. They even offered to help me load the bags into the cab. The whole process probably took less than 3 minutes, which was great because I took a cab there and told the driver to wait outside for me, letting him run the meter. 

The food was actually really good, especially considering the bulk order nature. There were a few pancake/waffle/french toast breakfast orders from various places that summer, and I'd say the order from Fran's was the best."}
{"text":"I'm handicap with great difficulty walking  and visited the restaurant on Sunday 06 Nov 2016 around 1pm.  We entered through the concourse level since we parked in the underground.  We stood at the back entrance and the waitresses said they had no table available on the upper level.  So I hand to hold onto my partner since we had to descend 3 steps.  I was handed my rollator/walker once on the lower level.  The waitresses directed us to an empty table near the front.  We proceeded to the table and sat down.  We asked the waitress for menus, but were ignored.  A female supervisor came over after 5 minutes and told us to get up and join the line at the front of the restaurant.  I told her that the waitresses at the rear directed to the empty table.  Another 5 minutes went by now the manager Joe Bagorro came over and told us to get up now since there were 5 parties waiting ahead of us in line.  He told us we had LIED about the waitresses in the rear directing us to this table. Why on earth would we lie?  Since we had been seated, over 5 parties had been seated, so we are to get up and now go to the end of the line with who knows how many had come after us.
We just left.  Totally inconsiderate management and made me feel ashamed to be at a disadvantage.  Poorly handled situation with total disrespect for my disability. 
As a result of this, we will NEVER again visit any Fran's locations.
I had been a patron of Fran's since the early days on St Clair Ave West.
We also had to pay $7 for the underground parking for almost being thrown out."}
{"text":"We went to Fran's today instead of our usual quick spot (the Senator) because we wanted a change. 

I ordered the chicken and waffles, which was actually very good at Pickle Barrel.  Instead of the \"spicy friend chicken on a whole waffle\" I got 5 tiny bland chicken wings on a soggy waffle.  This cost a ripoff price of $14.

Needless to say that's the last time I'll ever go to Frans.  I think it only stays in business because of the late-night crowd and the tourists who don't know better."}
{"text":"Excellent place at any time of day.  Classic comfort food (burgers, blts, all day breakfast, etc).  Gigantic portions, haven't tried a dish yet that I haven't enjoyed.  I've come here for Sunday-morning brunch, dinners with friends, and 4am ingesting of food to soak up booze.  The servers are always cheerful and patient (drunks!), and the coffee flows generously.  Oftentimes I find a lineup at this location, then head to the one by the Eaton Centre."}
{"text":"We were off to another restaurant, but due to the extreme cold weather, we jumped into Fran's.  This turned out to be a good move.  This place is a diner, a diner of the past!  We were promptly served and our server was friendly.  We had fish and chips and meatloaf.  We were told that the meatloaf was quite popular and yes it was delicious.  The fish was fried just right--crunchy outside and fluffy inside.  The cocktails were nice too.  The prices for food and drinks are very reasonable."}
{"text":"Just like Denny's here in the States. but a notch better in terms of quality and portion. However, expect to wait for table and food. This place is worth another visit if you have the patience."}
{"text":"Staff is always very friendly when I visit this location. Whether I arrive in a large group or in my own, they seem to maintain great service. 

I definitely recommend the steak salad, all day breakfast and the coconut cream pie! Another trearsure is the tasty Fran burger."}
{"text":"I had the Canadian Benedict which was brought to me by the Manager. It was smothered in paprika including the fruit. No one came to check on my meal and being it was brought by the manager, I decided not to say anything. 
It also looked like the pepper shakers haven't been washed on the inside for years. They were completely yellow but there was indeed black pepper inside.
For $16.00, I can't complain, just express concerns."}
{"text":"We dined here for brunch on a weekday. Our service was quick, no complaints there.  I am an eggs Benedict fiend and Fran's has a great selection.  I went with the eggs blackstone (smoked salmon eggs benny) and it was delicious! Generous amount of hollandaise sauce and large helping of home fries which were crispy on the outside.   
We also had the morning glory waffle.  Waffle topped with eggs, bacon, Apple and drowned in syrup.  Would have asked for the syrup on the side if we knew how much would be on there, so it was a little on the sweet side for our taste. It was still delicious and probably even better if we were hung over.  Definitely will be back for breakfast when we're in the area."}
{"text":"Good place. I liked the atmosphere. The food was pretty well priced.  I ordered waffles and really enjoyed it, the home fries were really delicious too. I wouldn't recommend the salad though."}
{"text":"Firstly I must admit that I live within spitting distance of this place, so the heavenly convenience of having a 24/7 365 dinner practically next door has got to count for some of those stars! 

I've always had great service here, eat in or take-out.
While you wait for your take-out you still get brought water & sit on comfy bar stools with news/sports on big screens. 

Service is quick & I've never had food I didn't enjoy. 

I'm a vegetarian & they have more choices than a lot of places, I recommend the veggie wrap with sweet potato fries or the veggie bowl. 

Servings are very generous, good choice of deserts & we had some great waffles & pancakes one day for brunch. 

The only reason this review is missing 1 star is because occasionally the food can be a bit greasy, I think it depends who's working the kitchen that night as it's not every time. 

Also - if you do go in the wee hours of the morning, midnight - 5am, be prepared for the typical College street revelers outside (not usually inside) - I have witnessed some stuff I'd rather forget outside Fran's on a Saturday night! (but that's just location, nothing to do with the diner, still mention it for a full review)

If you're looking for reasonably priced, speedy service food, large choice & huge portions then you'll find it here!"}
{"text":"Went this morning . Tried their chicken & waffles breakfast.  A little disappointed that the menu didn't specify if was strictly chicken wings, most places do a chicken breast.  However the wings were tasty and crispy.  Service was a little lackluster, disappointing when our city is trying to shine for Pan Am games.  Server never came to ask me about the meal quality. Then, when she brought bill over to pay with credit she didn't even bring a pen.  Seems like a basic thing to do.  In any case, my cokes were free, again likely 'cause she forgot to punch them in. I got that going for me."}
{"text":"Tried them out today for their 75th Anniversary deal.  Great value.  Only $0.30 for meatloaf with mashed potatoes and veggies.  Staff was friendly and upbeat even with all the volume of customers.  Would gladly return and pay full price!"}
{"text":"The great thing about this place is, its open 24/7. The guy serving was funny - especially since we saw a nut-job walk in at 4am behind us walking very oddly. We ordered our food which was a Ceasar Salad with Chicken and Qasadilla's. Both items were freshly made and tasted great. The place had a diner feeling. The music was fitting to the place. The location was easily accessible at least at 4am since we had no trouble finding parking at this hour. Good portions served."}
{"text":"We went here for brunch and were pleased.  The patio is great for the summer, and makes it my favourite of the three Fran's.   There definitely trying to dress this one up, and even the waitresses here are dolled up in little black outfits. The menu is the same as the other two locations and I was pleased to discover that the banana chocolate chip pancakes were as delicious as ever.

Generally, the food is your average diner fare, nothing really spectacular.   It's a good alternative if you are in the downtown core and tired of Marche, and not willing to wait in line for O&B."}
{"text":"The service is terrible. We waited for 28 minutes for our breakfast which was eggs and bacon. Another guest who walked in after us and sat down behind our table was half way through eating his meal when we finally asked if our food was going to make it to us. 

32 minutes later our food had arrived. We were so hungry that anything would have tasted good at that point. 

The food was decent but I much prefer Sunshine Spot."}
{"text":"Went here with my boyfriend after shopping at the world's biggest book store. Service was quick and friendly. I had the deep friend pickles - so yum, I'm a sucker for them though, and the open faced beef sandwich which was huge, the gravy was perfect and the fries hit the spot. My boyfriend had the broccoli soup which he said could use more chese on top but I think that's being a little picky as it is BROCCOLI soup but he said it was good. He also had the sheppards pie which was huge and he could only finish 3/4's of it. He said something lacked in the ground beef though, maybe some spice?? He got a vanilla milkshake which he lovvvveedddd and I tried and was super yummy. 
Overall the price was over $50 with tip which my boyfriend (And I agree) thought was a little too steep for diner food. However we did leave feeling overly bloated and full, so I guess it's objective."}
{"text":"I was there for breakfast with friends, and my favourite thing was definately the homefry hashbrowns (yum! soo tasty). The breakfast portions were well sized; my friend and i split \"Fran's Big Breakfast\" because it had 2 of everything and lots of homefries :)  The service was really fast & it wasn't that crowded because we were there at 9am.  I would definately go back, a)because our waitress said the chocolate milkshakes are to die for (i'll keep you posted), b)because the food tasted like home cooking and the diner was more spacious than trendy places on bloor and c) there were so many things on the menu i didn't get to try, like the  grilled chicken & avocado club and coconut cream pie. sounds tasty."}
{"text":"Food was amazing, but we waited so long for it that we enjoyed it much less as a result.
The service needs some work. In other words, fire the entire staff and hire new ones. It was so disrespectful the number of times servers, including our own, waltzed by while looking straight at us, then ignoring us as we tried to ask a question. All I was trying to do was get a glass of water and perhaps maybe order my meal. Am I crazy or is that not a reasonable thing to do at a restaurant?

Anyway, get rid of the disrespectful kids working here, hire decent staff that don't treat their customers like sh*t and maybe you'll get more business."}
{"text":"Chill, friendly service. Great, reasonably priced food. It was mid afternoon, so to avoid spoiling my appetite for dinner, I had the chicken poutine for $5, which was the perfect price for the yummy guilty pleasure. My group and I had a table on the top floor (partially-opened) patio,  that kind of resembled a greenhouse. 

My only complaint was the lack of air conditioning or fans cause we were all very warm (it was 26 degrees outside). They do however have this cool, intermittent misting that is released from pipes in the ceiling to offer a cooling (and mystical effect)."}
{"text":"First impression of this restaurant taps into my memories of old school movie diners. Definite 1 star for the trip down memory lane!

Now down to business came here on a Sunday morning around 9:30 no line moderately filled and very quick service. The service was great although due to the lack of rush made it a given. Staff gave a reasonable amount of time for the order and did not interrupt or make my morning feel rushed at all. 
The order between myself and my girlfriend were the vegetarian omelet with brown toast, and the Eggs Florentine. 

The vegetarian omelet was great with a generous splash of spinach, peppers, onions, and mushrooms. Toast came heavily buttered which I will in the future ask to leave dry as I prefer peanut butter. The home fries that accompanied the omelet were well seasoned and worked very well with the Tabasco sauce I added on. 
Total price for two massive portions of breakfast was $25 including tax and tip. Great way to start a morning! 

Fran's is a welcome addition to my list of breakfast joints and earns an additional 3 stars for the service, food and price point."}
{"text":"Been there couple times since it's the closest place that serve all day breakfast. The food is blah and the cooking isn't that great. Seems like the food either is over-cooked, undercooked, or lacks flavour. The service is mediocre."}
{"text":"By far one of the most unremarkable breakfasts I have ever had. Had the peameal and eggs with coffee. The bacon was sliced so razor thin so that it could only have come out over cooked and it did. Tough and chewy like beef jerky. The eggs were fine but how can you mess that up? My server disappeared mid-meal and my coffee sat empty for 25 minutes. Not good. Finally another server appeared and simply handed me my bill, no \"how was your meal\" and still no refill. In my opinion it wouldn't even pass as during a bad hangover. Poor value, I won't be back."}
{"text":"The menu definitely oversells the 'Chicken and Waffle' dish, describing it as spicy fried chicken on waffles with maple syrup...in reality you get four regular plain wings on a waffle."}
{"text":"I went to Fran's last night sort of late. 
I love eating breakfast at odd times of the day so I had the french toast and some homefries. It was really good. And wow, I got a lot of food for my money. I was happily  surprised when the bill came.
My waitress was also really great and friendly.
AND hockey was playing on the tv. So I was a very happy camper."}
{"text":"We arrived at around 12:30 for lunch. Waitress did not come until 5-10 mins later. We have already decided what to eat and ordered it right away. We waited for another 35 mins and food has not been arrived yet. During this time, the waitress never come back to us. We ordered Salad, soup, and a pasta. I don't see why the Salad or soup will take 35 mins. I suppose these type of food are ready at any time. So, we tried to find our waitress and ask her to rush the order. She asked us to wait while she is helping one table with paying the bill. Then, she never came back to us. She went to another table, and ANOTHER table. We finally have to reach to another girl at the restaurant. She apologized about the wait and said \"as you can see the restaurant is busy, the usual wait time is around 35 mins for the food\". Excuse me, I don't see the restaurant is full. First, if you think the restaurant is busy, you should notify us about the wait time when we order the food. I don't think 35 mins is a usual wait time that someone would expect during lunch time at a non- fine dining restaurant. Second, the waitress kept us waiting. We just want her to spare 30 secs to talk to us about the food or wait. She did not show any empathy at all. 
After that, the food came in within 5 mins. Then, I don't know what happened to the previous 35 mins. What did they do? Seriously, Salad and Soup takes 35 mins? The waitress never come back to ask us how is the food nor never look at us. I wanted to get another napkin but did not get a chance. OMG, this is the worst restaurant I ever go to. Oh wait... not until we ask for the bill. Then, she came back. I asked her to break down the bill so we can pay her tips (yes, I am still being very generous for that). She said \"yes I am doing that right now\". But she gave me 5 dollar bill without breaking down. I don't know why. So, we asked her to break down the bill again. 
Oh, by the way, we asked to speak with the manager and they have been saying the manager is coming out soon but that MANAGER never did. I only see around 4-5 waitress in the restaurant. Since they sound like the customers to expect they are busy, and the wait is gonna be long. Why don't they hire more people during lunch time? Or at least let the customer knows the wait time before they order the food or even before sitting down. Most of their customers work at downtown, not everyone has 2 hours lunch time to spend at their restaurant. In addition, they should show some sympathy if they are delaying the orders. This is not something everyone would expect at a regular restaurant."}
{"text":"Terrible place.  Their food sucks and their service is even worse.  After spending $50 for two, I go out feeling a lot worse coming out of McDonald's.  It's obvious that the chefs suck, their servers are dumb and the food is just BS.  Really, two slices of sandwich meat on a $15 sandwich?  What a joke.


-10 stars."}
{"text":"Went to Fran's just before attending an evening of xmas carols at the nearby United church..It was busy but after fifteen minutes, we were seated by friendly and seemingly efficient staff..we ordered calamari for starters..they arrived spread sparingly across a plate and in all had two 'rings'...the rest, and i counted, six, were the 'hairy' baby squids, which my wife refuses to eat...i looked at the gentleman who delivered the plate and he blurted out, 'i know, we get alot of complaints about them'...it turned out to be the manager...for 10.00 i thought that was a 'bad deal'...my friend had the roast beef on bread with gravy...the meat, prepackaged, barely covered the bread...my hamburger was good...we used to love frans for their good portions...but not on this occasion."}
{"text":"I love Fran's; I always get the Eggs Benedict and it is declicious. The past two times that I have been there the service hasn't been great but the great food makes up for it."}
{"text":"Fran's est une institution à Toronto. Style 'diner', c'est d'une qualité acceptable mais le restaurant bénéficie davantage d'un excellente emplacement et des horaires étendus que d'une réputation culinaire particulière."}
{"text":"Une institution que ce Fran's ! C'est le bon vieux restaurant style 'Diner New Yorkais' de Toronto. Pas de flafla, c'est frit, c'est rapide et c'est bon. La décoration est un peu rococo dans le style mais à 2 heures de matin, cela importe généralement peu."}
{"text":"Possibly my favorite after bar diner.

My go to food here are:
- Wings (they're REALLY good here, and the wing sizes are pretty decent)
- Chili 
- Energy Breakfast"}
{"text":"Meh. Can't even do mashed potatoes right.
One Tiny ice cream scoop of mashed potatoes. Microwaved to a Luke warm that gets cold in 2 minutes."}
{"text":"Came here for burgers - timely service and standard fare. Food was hot and fresh."}
{"text":"This place is the worst.

Used to love Fran's when I was a little guy. 

Came here with a friend after a long night of working. The outside menu said milkshakes $3.99, however once you're told the shakes are actually $5.99!!!???

I asked the absent minded waiter about this only for him to say \"oh that'a wrong\".
Thanks buddy. 

The service was absolutely below abysmal  quality. Our waiter wouldn't even look at us. Never even said hello or goodbye. No tip for you my friend. 

On top of that the food tastes like it's been used to mop the dirty washroom floor.

Don't give these punks your money."}
{"text":"Good service but the food could have been better. Had breakfast ... homefries were a big disappointment. Tasted like square french fries with an extra seasoning.  (Assuming they were deepfried rather than panfried)."}
{"text":"I was visiting Toronto last week and had heard great things about Fran's so I made my way down there from the train station. I was brought to a table in the back with a menu and waited. And waited. 

And waited.

Three waitresses walked by my table, not one even acknowledged my existence. I waited around a bit to see if I could even get a cup of coffee, but not even that. I closed my menu to see if that brought anyone to my table, nada. Perhaps there's a secret signal I wasn't aware of? 

Checked around the restaurant to see if it was busier than I realised, but it was after lunch hour and was barely half full. Grabbed my coat and bags and just walked out. What a waste of time that was."}
{"text":"Was visiting Toronto for 3 days and went here for breakfast 2/3 days! Would have went 3/3 if we had of discovered it sooner. Breakfast was so so reasonably priced and the pancakes with maple syrup were the best things I have ever had. I think our waiters name was Steven, he was so nice and even remembered us from the morning previous. Can't recommend this place enough"}
{"text":"Not impressed by the low quality food. I was so excited to eat poutine, but that was crap on a plate. Other than that the food came out quickly and the staff was very kind. Some people may like this place, but I won't be returning."}
{"text":"This is diner food galore. So many great options at very reasonable prices. The vibe inside was awesome with a very retro/vintage looking interior design. 

I had the turkey with toast covered in gravy and it was very good.

The service was quick and all of the servers were extremely friendly and courteous."}
{"text":"This place was pretty good. Food was affordable, atmosphere was pretty nice, nothing fancy but I left feeling satisfied. My only gripe is that the washrooms are locked and bolted and you need a server to open to door for you. Not quite sure what that's all about. Honestly could see myself coming back here in the future."}
{"text":"Fran's is like IHOP in America (is there IHOP in Canada??) - the most basic breakfast ever.  Prices were reasonable to me, at least, and the interior of the restaurant seemed clean.  Nothing special about the food, service, or anything here.  Pretty plain, simple, and average.  Thus, three stars from me.

I got two eggs, toast, and potatoes.  You can't really mess that up.  Eggs were cooked over easy as requested, toast came with butter and jam, and potatoes were fried and cubed.

I find it interesting that when you ask for hot sauce, you're presented with Tabasco and Sriracha.... weird!  Didn't know these kinds of places ever carried Sriracha!

Not sure why there would be a wait at a very basic restaurant that neither shines nor sucks."}
{"text":"So my friend and I were staying in Toronto to escape Hurricane Irma for 10 days, and on our very first day of exploring the city, we discovered this GEM.  We enjoyed our late-breakfast SO VERY much, that we came back 3 times during our trip!  We got breakfast each time, and still had more items on the menu that we wanted to try!  

Our favorites were the various egg benedict options, and our bloody mary's were some of the best that I have ever had.  I have to say that the omellete on the croissant meal was to die for.  I wish that I could order that every day.

Not only was it beautiful to sit outside, eat terrific breakfast food, have lovely drinks, but the service was spectacular as well.  We are American, so maybe it was due to our tendency to be used to sub-par restaurant service, but we thought the servers were great!  They were so kind, stopped and chatted with us about our travels, and recommended other things in the city for us to do and see.

We miss Frans every day and can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Cute spot. The food is so average, some below. Milkshakes are probably the best thing there. I recently ordered the Baja chicken wrap, it sounded amazing, came out and was probably the strangest thing I had EVER tasted, I recommend just taking it off the menu all together, don't order it people. Also when it comes to coffee/water, the servers could be a tad more attentive, I get it when it gets busy, but in this case it wasn't."}
{"text":"I used to come by Fran's often for breakfast when we didn't want to put up with the long waits at Eggspectations down the street.

Their is nothing special or fancy about their breakfasts but they definitely hit the spot if all you are looking for is a some what fast bacon and egg breakfast in the downtown core.

The servers have always been great to us and I might actually come by the next time I'm in the area.  I've never tried anything else from their menu other than breakfast."}
{"text":"The first time I went to this restaurant, it was for an early breakfast, before 9 am. I gave up and left after waiting for 25 minutes for a simple eggs and sausages dish. Never have I seem such slow service. The waitress at least was apologetic and waived my coffee charge.
In hindsight, not eating there was probably for the best as I went there another time, and ordered sausage and eggs. This time, the service was faster but alas...the food left much to be desired.  Sausages were extra hard and eggs were rubbery. I got sick and threw up within the hour. To be fair, my friend ordered the Eggs Benedict and didn't have any issues with her dish.  
Needless to say, this is a place I will never set a foot in ever again."}
{"text":"Work in the area....good cheeseburger and fries.....often order breakfast, the toast is always (and I mean always) stale. Service is above average."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a good big breakfast, and excellent service - this is your place. BUT not every serve gives excellent service I'll admit. There is one specific waiter, Steve, who is fantastic. My friends and I have been going there for about 4 years now once-twice a week for breakfast, and he knows us so well that we now have our food within 10 minutes! It's fabulous! He even gives us bigger cups for our coffee so we don't have to have as many refills! 

Overall though, great place. If nothing else, everyone is friendly and the breakfast is always good. Salads are pretty good too and the bruschetta. Haven't eaten much else so I can't make a comment on that. Prices are fair. 

Milkshakes are also amazing!"}
{"text":"Where to start!!!  We were very hungry and passed this place after leaving Eaton Mall.  It looked like a decent restaurant on the outside.  As soon as we walked in, it was obvious Fran's is a greasy spoon and a dirty one at that.  I have dined in plenty of greasy spoons over the years and they all have their individual charms with decent enough food.  Sorry I can't say the same for Fran's.  

The three of us ordered a chocolate milk shake & burger, 1/2 chicken with veggies & mashed potatoes and meat loaf with veggies and mashed potatoes respectively.

The 1/2 chicken appeared undercooked and when a small piece of breast was tasted, was deemed inedible.  The mixed veggies on both plates didn't fair much better as they appeared old, a bit over-cooked and flavorless.  The small scoop of mashed potatoes tasted like they were from a box--just add hot water.  The meatloaf (1 slice) didn't have much flavor and came with a congealed brown sauce on top.  Only a third of the meatloaf was consumed. 

We had to wait a long time to get waited on and for the food to arrive.

The burger was considered worse than the most awful fast food burger and the chocolate shake was watered down.

The server said she was new and wasn't able to answer questions without asking the cook.  Please take the time to train your staff better!  She was also slow on a slow night and was seen playing with her cell phone instead of bringing us necessities like silverware.

'Nuff said!  Don't bother with this place.  We ended up at Scaddabush as we were still hungry and the food there is real good!"}
{"text":"Great place to go for breakfast - any time of the day! We came on a very busy Sunday morning and didn't wait too long to be seated. Service was fast and friendly for our group of seven. Food was well cooked for a fast turnover restaurant."}
{"text":"Experience here was pretty bad.

It seems to be a popular spot and I understand they do tend to get rather busy.

Walked in and we were seated rather quickly. Although the hostess originally tried to seat us at a very small table wedged against a wall next to a party of 4. As in one of the people was using the space to put their personal belongings. We definitely wouldn't fit so we asked to sit outside.

Not really to blame them for but it was a windy day and copious amounts of dirt and debris flew into our drinks and food. Not pleasant at all.

Service was spotty. Took the server a while to even take our order, but I'm not that upset considering it was rather busy. 

Food wise, everything was okay. Nothing to write home about. My brother had gotten a breakfast platter where there was literally a fried fly on his bacon! Made us really question the other food. 

Only positives were the potatoes, pancakes and mixed berry scones."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and it was ok, nothing spectacular but I mean it is a diner. I got the veggie omelet with feta and avocado and it was pretty good. It's really just basic diner food. It has a large menu for kinds of dietary needs, so that was a plus."}
{"text":"Nice people and excellent food. Freshly squeezed orange juice and traditional egg was great. I would come back for sure"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for an early lunch before heading out of town for the zoo. What a great diner! We had exceptional service by the staff! If we weren't with the kids we would have gone upstairs to check out the more adult cocktail bar.

Ordered a traditional poutine which our son now sets as the benchmark for other places. I got the eggs benedict with spinach (fresh baby spinach -- not frozen), and the husband ordered the original with Canadian bacon. Both were cooked perfectly! Our daughter ordered the mac-n-cheese which was homemade and very cheesy -- really great!

If you're looking for typical diner food great service, full bar, local brews, nothing fancy and greasy favorites, you've got to check out this place!"}
{"text":"I had salmon entree. The fish is overcooked, so hard and flavourless. Beans on the side screams boring. 

My friend got chicken breast, for $14! But god, that was the smallest chicken breast ever, like a A cup size... not even organic, so not excusable. 

Services was so damn bad.... never go back!"}
{"text":"It's a decent brunch place if you want something close to the eaton center and decently priced. I ordered the steak and eggs and it's too much for me. Needed help with the home fries. It has a old diner feel if that's what you're into. All for the price of 20 something before tip. The server was nice but it's not always the best. Our sever today was very cheerful."}
{"text":"Everyone in Toronto has a great affection for Fran's, even though it's really nothing special. It's a diner, with diner food, and I was confused by the love it gets for something so blatantly dull. I was told Fran's is the oldest diner in Toronto, and then I understood it's nostalgia that keeps its patrons coming back. Our server was really sweet, and my onion rings were pretty good but I was unimpressed with my burger. I love that it's open late, because my friends & I didn't arrive until after midnight. May Fran's always serve the young, partying population of Toronto that wants diner food in the middle of the night."}
{"text":"Don't do it!

The patio is terrific.  That accounts for the 1 star.

The rest is a before picture that truly needs Robert Irvine to fix.
The staff were friendly but inept.  The menu contains well over 100 items.  In other words, it is too big to be done well.  We started with calamari, which could well have been frozen and microwaved.  It was a small portion that came with a lame salad.   The dipping sauce was from M&M meats.  

Then came a reheated shepherds pie with stir fried frozen vegetables on the side.   My wife had a stir fry that appeared bad and tasted worse.  There are frat houses turning out better chow at the tail end of keg parties.   

Stay away or enter at your own risk."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast.  We ate outside.  Fran's know what they are doing, the food is served hot and quickly despite how busy they are.  Staff was on it on my day."}
{"text":"I didn't really expect to enjoy my lunch here...it was sort of a default choice.  My sister, cousin and I all had sandwiches.

Me - Grilled cheese with real cheddar, thick-cut challah (egg bread) and sliced tomatoes (optional).  It was very good!  I also opted for the sweet potato fries which were 1.79 extra but a HEALTHY option, right?  ;-)  The side cole slaw (extra) was a disappointment.

Sis - Disappointed in the club sandwich as the chicken was a \"bit overdone\".

Cuz - He was happy with his grilled chicken and avocado sandwich.  His regular fries were good too.

We also had a helpful, attentive waiter, so I guess, based on some of the other reviews, we hit on a good day."}
{"text":"This is my first restaurant first meal of the year and it didn't go well!

After deciding what i was going to get, I looked around trying to find someone to take my order. I spoke to the waitress the next table who's collecting the bill that I was ready to order. \"i'm not your server, she is\" she replied and point the air on the other side. That's this place's service level.

As for my meal it came Bacon mushroom soup. VERY salty, no bacon at all in my soup. i took a few sip and gave up on this bowl of soup. Later came my steak, i saw a bunch of messy vegetables and striploin in the middle and mash potato on the right. First of all, the soup already worse enough, and then this bunch of vege destroyed my appetite. Baby carrots were under cooked, dry and it's frozen food! Secondly, the steak was median, but it's not even juicy and hard on the outside!. Third of all, mash potato was cold and hard. I thought mash potato suppose to be buttery and warm...NO! not at Fran's Restaurant! This restaurant gets 2.5 stars for reasons. i really should've checked the review before i went. It's my fault."}
{"text":"I'm sure I've been looking into this place from the outside for over ten years now whenever I pass College Street. The big furred hoods, and giant loop earring has always deterred my from Fran's. 
Finally, after being drained of my mojo from a visit to the Police HQ museum, I decided to step into this restaurant, and dine where countless other police HQ visitors had lunched before. 

So it looks like a diner from the early fifties, but as I discovered, Frans dates all the way back to the forties. But aside from the stretched leather seats, there wasn't much to suggest that it was a historical site.
I'm sure the people of Toronto know much already of this place, so there's no sense on telling you about it.

I debated between the shepherd's pie, and the chilli. The friendly waitress recommended both, but leaned towards the pie. I got a calamari to start. It was served in some kind of tubed 'Thai' sauce, which paired remarkably well with the squid. The pie however, was very average, dry, and didn't come with gravy. 
The place is fully licensed, but I can't for the life of me imagine why anyone would want to drink here. There's a mysterious lower establishment which looked..glossier. No name, perhaps a private dining area, but they've got separated tables? 

This day, I shared the restaurant with some beatnik looking people. Which wasn't unpleasant. Much better than Rocawear, and Babyphat..

My beef with this place is the price. My meal came out to be over thirty dollar Canadian. That is a very high price paid for such casual eating. I could have gone on King and had myself a better meal for that price, with drinks.

And shouldn't the service staff here be on roller blades or something?"}
{"text":"The food here is yummy and the portions are a bit on the larger side. The service was really slow, but the server was friendly and helpful. No one rushed us out even when the place got crowded."}
{"text":"A decent diner with fair prices in a nice central location. We went for a Saturday morning breakfast and got the steak and eggs 8oz special for $13 and Eggs Benedict. The steak was well seasoned and grilled to a perfect medium rare - pleasantly surprised. The portions of toast and potatoes are also quite big. Service is average but food and prices are definitely well-above for the area (sunrise grill, independents etc)."}
{"text":"Food was awesome. I had the grilled cheese with apple slices and broccoli soup on the side. Great portion for the price. Quick and happy service!"}
{"text":"I hadn't eaten here for many years and was a little disappointed that they had renovated.  I was looking forward to the old school decor.

As for the breakfast on a Tuesday at 9:30, it was so-so.  It's hard to ruin toast and eggs, but they managed to ruin the \"home fries\".  They use the frozen, spiced, cubed version that I now consider an inexcusable short-cut.  Having eaten at and reviewed over 40 breakfast places, the great majority manage to use real potatoes cooked on the grill.  Surely Fran's could do the same."}
{"text":"If I could give this no stars I would. It took us an hour to get our food and when it arrived, they brought the wrong items. The chicken and waffles were mediocre, the gravy in the poutine tasted like cardboard and we ordered eggs Benedict and got eggs florentine. They were hardly apologetic..terrible service and I won't ever step foot in this place again and neither should you."}
{"text":"This place is dirty. The ketchup bottles and salt and pepper are grimey. There were at least fifteen fruit flies crawling the wall on the booth beside us.  When we mentioned it we were told the door is open... OK.  The food is better at Denny's.  I wish we had left."}
{"text":"Excellent atmosphere, great prices, amazing late night deals. 
Wings are a-1 and whatever hot sauce is on the table is unreal"}
{"text":"The worst customer service experience of any Fran's location as it was clearly understaffed. Server finally came to our table after half an hour of seating us, took another 45 minutes to get our breakfast on a Sunday morning. My friend and I found pieces of plastic on our food, but waitress only waved that said friend's bill as apparently mine was from the egg- when it clearly was not. Perhaps the only redeeming qualities of the experience were the sub-par pancakes, watered-down coffee and dry sausage. Save your $20 and go to a Tim Hortons instead."}
{"text":"This may sound ridiculous.. but this Fran's location made me fall in love with melon. Never a fan.. the fruit was SO fresh that I buy melon and eat it on the regular now. haha.

Went to Fran's the morning after a wedding. The service was quick and awesome.. waiter very pleasant. My fiancé's wrap was UNREAL. I had a simple bowl of fruit which as I said above, was fresh and delish."}
{"text":"A friend and I got a hankering for rice pudding after the Raptors game - we figured it would cheer us up - so we popped in to this (rapidly fading) Toronto institution.

We ordered 2 coffees and 2 rice puddings. The (horrible) coffee came pretty quickly, but then the wait began. After about 10 minutes, we asked a passing waiter if he could send over our server. \"Sure, but she's pretty busy\". She didn't come over, but a few minutes later, my friend made eye contact with her, and she made a gesture like \"yes, your order will be coming soon\".

At this point, we figured the kitchen must be making the pudding from scratch, which included harvesting the rice paddies. Our server continued to tend to others, making no motion towards the kitchen, so we tossed down a couple of toonies, and casually left, unfulfilled."}
{"text":"By far the worst restaurant I have been too. I got the baked 5 cheese macaroni it had no taste it was oily, I got chicken added on to it tasted like it was boiled nothing about it was appetizing. My boyfriend got the chicken parmesan, the pasta was watery and the cheese on top just slid right off the chicken. The garlic bread that came as a side was mediocre and came out soggy/soft. The portion size was alright. We also ordered fries which we did not end up getting as they took to long to come we were too full off of the food by the time it came. We did finish the food, mainly because we didn't want to waste money, it was worth a try (experience). I just wouldn't recommend this place to anyone I know. 

PS - a star was only given because giving no stars isn't an option."}
{"text":"Went there for Friday dinner before the show at the Sony center. The food arrived allowing us plenty of time to enjoy it. We ordered the Philly steak sandwich, which was perfect.  The order looked as appetizing as it tasted. We also had the liver and onions, with double side of grilled vegetables. Delicious, and cooked to perfection. 
The server was attentive, and made sure that we would finish in a timely manner."}
{"text":"I am one of the biggest fans of Fran's in the world. This was my first time at the Yonge street location and unfortunately it was a horrible experience. I am an experienced server with over 10 years experience under my belt, as well as having managed two restaurants in the past.

This place is in DESPERATE need for new management. Upon arrival, my boyfriend and I waited at the door for over 15 minutes before we were seated. The hostess was not occupied either, she was in clear sight, on her phone, half hanging out of the kitchen to the right. Eventually I walked over to her and asked to be seated. 

After we were seated, we were ignored for over 35 minutes, during that time, we attempted to flag down a server over 6 times. We were either ignored or told to wait. Meanwhile, during this time, a waitress who's section was clearly on the other side of the restaurant came over, apologized that we were being ignored, and took our order. She was hands down the best part of the experience, because she already had her section and was now taking us on as well.

The infuriating part of it all was that over six other staff members could be seen in front of the pass, talking, joking, and being loud, with no food up to run, and plenty of work being ignored. 

Our food came fairly quickly, which was good considering we were some of the only customers in there.

One bite into our food we realized it was stone cold which was the final straw for me, and I called the manager to the table. I noticed she was a middle aged woman (with dark hair and a medium build) who I had seen for the last hour and a half chatting avidly with the staff at the kitchen pass, while the entire floor was being ignored. First, I tried to level with her, letting her know I was an experienced manager myself, and that I understood it could be hectic some times. She seemed relieved, however I let her know that the service was well below par, and that I would definitely need my bill changed. She came back and had docked %15 off of my bill. Keep in mind that we had ordered no drinks, and had each only had one bite of our food before we returned it. I told her that it should be refunded considered we didn't eat anything and the service was so bad, she said, and I quote \"Yeah but, you know, it gets hectic when its busy and some things slip through the cracks. There's really nothing else I can do, these things happen.\" 

To which I replied, \"So my service and my food deserves to be sub-par because you're busy? On top of that, I have been watching for an hour as you and your staff have stood over there laughing and joking around with no food up to run whatsoever.\" She then rolled her eyes and left, returning with a %45 discount on the receipt. I was in such shock at her cheap and childish behaviour that I just paid and left, not wanting to continue to argue with such a delusional and poor manager. I could not believe she was arguing price with a customer who hadn't even eaten the food, on top of her callous behaviour, I really have never been so irritated leaving a restaurant. Under what circumstances did she think it was a good idea to argue with a customer who had been ignored for over an hour, and then served cold food, that they still needed to pay because she was busy. Considering she was in eyesight not being busy the entire time, it's absolutely laughable.

Her attitude was pure high school. She was under no circumstances stable or mature enough to receive criticism, seeing that she childishly blamed it on being \"busy\" when she wasn't. She should take some serious management courses, I have no idea how she got that job to begin with.

Definitely, DEFINITELY go to Fran's on COLLEGE, not here. They're amazing, know what they're doing, and most importantly, don't have a manager that's dumber than a sack of bricks."}
{"text":"Our alternative choice for Monday brunch after realizing The Senator was closed thanks to Mister Freeze's latest prank on Toronto (where is Batman when you need him, hmm?) Had the premium breakfast for $6.99, a decent portion consisting of 2 eggs any style (mine were over hard), choice of meat ( I opted for the farmer's sausage), home fries (more like nuked frozen hash browns) and toast (marble rye in my case). My lunchmate (no not the package available at your supermarket but an actual person) skipped the forgettable potatoes and the bread and had a side of Greek Salad. We both had a cup of coffee (bottomless, which is good).
For $23.22 after tax without tip, it is decently priced. However, while we both found our food ok, we also found it very bland. Not to mention that I had been to Fran's a few times in the last few years eating different dishes and always left with the same feeling (whether at this location or the Victoria and Shuter one) of blandness and lack of zyng.
 Fran's offers a lot of different dishes, all well done but none memorable. To recommend only if other options are not available. Definitely not a destination but a reliable 24-hour pitstop if necessary."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times and it had always been pleasant. During the most recent visit, I got the banquet burger with added mushrooms. It was all good, though the bun was a lil bit on the dry side. My friend got chicken fettuccine which was great and came in a massive portion. Desserts were incredible. Our waitress was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"After my first awful experience about a year ago, I decided to give this place another shot. Unfortunately, my food came out rotten - I asked for medium poached eggs on my Canadian Benny but what I got was hard GREY ones instead. Adding insult to injury, I still got a full bill at the end of my experience here. 

The server was pleasant and took the plate back to be redone when asked. She was prompt about keeping my coffee full, however I just can't justify giving this place yet another shot after 2 terrible experiences with the food quality. There are too many great places to eat in the area for me to bother spending my money on food that comes out rotten. 

If I could give this place 0 stars for food, I would. These two stars are only because the server was kind in taking my food back and ensured my coffee was full."}
{"text":"Needed a quick meal before the show. We told the waitress we only had 45 minutes to eat, and she did her best and we were full and out the door within time slot. Service is quick and your typical diner style.

This location had an offer for 14.99 steak with fries.  No substitution, and it is strict. For under $20, this steak is pretty good and tender.  Freshly made fries is a plus, keeping it crispy and tender in the inside.  This is definitely a bang for your buck!

It was super cold and we order beef chili. Tastes so amazing, and the portion was huge! Made for a hungry man, or those whom doesn't mind sharing.  We poured the chili all over our fries in to make it 'luxurious'. Best idea ever."}
{"text":"Loved their big breakfast.. it came with a little bit of everything for an affordable price. The pancakes were so fluffy and the taste was so fresh. I also loved the freshly squeezed orange juice. This place is a must!"}
{"text":"Open late. Had great service. The meal was exactly what I expected. Been to other Frans and the serivce and quality is generally consistent. Not sure why they receive so many complaints. Don't come here with any expectations and you won't be disappointed or impressed."}
{"text":"Came here two days in a row. Last night had the steak and vegetables, service was pretty basic, but prompt and cordial. Food was good, steak cooked to liking and at $19.99 it is a bargain.

Revisited this place today for a late afternoon breakfast today.
Ordered the Waffles and found flakes of black plastic (from the griddle or wafflemaker I'm assuming). Told the server, who apologized and took it back. Came back with a new waffle pretty quickly, looked good, but as I flipped it, there I found another few specks of black plastic. Trust me, I'm not a picky eater and I would've eaten it if I knew it was charcoal. I picked off the bits and ate the waffle but let the server know when he cleared the plates. He told me he didn't think it was plastic but I broke one apart for him and he agreed it probably was and said he'd go talk to the manager. No update, he came with the bill and dropped it off. I think the Server was sincere and nice, but if he did go and talk to the manager, the manager obviously either didn't believe me or just doesn't give a crap about customer service. I'm staying in the hotel connected to them for 3 weeks and as convenient as this place is, I'm not going back again."}
{"text":"Frans is really great for students studying late late at night. 
Super greesy food and yummy milkshakes! 
It has the atmosphere and build of an authentic diner. 
I always come here with friends to treat ourselves after a long night of studying! The best is the milkshakes and desserts. The food is really good too and really filling. I would suggest the chocolate chip banana pancakes!"}
{"text":"So the two times I have been here have always been after 2am but luckily I am a sensible drunk so I can still review this sensibly.

Not a big fan of the breakfast, its just weird and not the dirty fry ups I prefer but their shakes are awesome, their pulled pork poutine and the gravy is delicious.

The staff have always been good, well done to them for putting up with so many late night revellers. Can not be easy working the hours they do.

Waiting times during busy periods for groups larger than 4 can be long, so if you arrive to loads of people standing there you might want to reconsider your options."}
{"text":"Incredibly rude staff. Last time I was there with a small group of friends on my birthday night. We sat down, ordered tea, and asked the waiter if it was okay to eat the birthday cake we brought there. He said no, and took our water glasses away without waiting for us to decide whether we were going to stay or not! Sadly this was not the only time I was treated poorly at Fran's (but is WAS the last). It's a shame, because it's close to campus and open 24 hours. Something you just don't find often in the city but oh well. I'm getting too old to stay out late anyway."}
{"text":"For Great breakfast stop here. We have been coming here for years. They serve all day breakfast."}
{"text":"Food 3/5 (60% of final grade)
I went with friends for lunch and ordered a liver with sauteed onion entree with side seasonal vegetables and home-fries. The home-fries were quite yummy, and the liver wasn't bad, but there wasn't really anything incredible about the culinary side of things. I also ordered a vanilla milkshake, which was, by the way, MASSIVE. Think trenta in terms of Starbucks size. The milkshake was yummy though, so that bumped up my experience a bite (pun intended). If you are getting a milkshake though, either share with a friend (omg was the intention of a massive milkshake supposed to be romantic like in those retro movies? I ernno), or get a side of fries and have everything as a snack. I consider myself a big eater, and I struggled to finish the milkshake-- but it was too good to stop. 

Ambiance 4/5 (10% of final grade)
I totally dig the retro vibes! Unlike other places, Fran's does not go half-way in terms of the retro vibe. Stepping in felt as if I was stepping into the world of Hairspray or Grease. Coming here on a nice summer day would be awesome!

Service 2.5/5 (10% of final grade)
Nothing particularly notable about the service. No meanies but not employee-of-the-months either.

Cost 3/5 (10% of final grade)
For downtown core, the price itself was appropriate. $5 for a milkshake was a tad expensive, but $12 for an entree was quite agreeable. 

Brownie Points 3/5 (10% of final grade)
For being open almost all the time.

Final Grade = 61/100 = Barely 3 Stars

TLDR:  Come here for the ambiance, but not for the food. The food itself isn't spectacular. I ernno, share the milkshake with a partner or something, if you're into that."}
{"text":"Dined at Frans during All Star weekend. Probably their most busiest weekend.  The Staff at Frans was NOT prepared. It was unbelievable how disorganized this place was ran. No host, 1 waiter, 1 waitress, 1 manager, 1 cook , 1 bus boy. 100s of guest. The manager was absolutely rude and actually expressed frustrations to the guest as if it was our fault for wanting to eat. It took 20 mins to be seated, 20 mins for our order to be placed, 30 for food to arrive. The waitress thankfully was not rude. I will never return. Never ---- worst experience ever and considering I'm from NYC that speaks volumes"}
{"text":"I've been to this restaurant a lot and it's consistently satisfying with quick service , Fran's will never really be impressive but you know what your getting, it's big servings and you always walk away content."}
{"text":"Overpriced, poor quality food. Cold fries, stale wrap...had to leave most of it
Was also very crowded"}
{"text":"Came here for late breakfast.  Got the banana chocolate pancakes.  They serve all day breakfast and apparently open 24hrs.  Place doesn't stand out as decor is plain and ugly.  But services was good and pricing on par."}
{"text":"I went to Frans for my friends birthday dinner. I must say it was a terrible experience.
Don't get me wrong, the food was satisfying but the service they provided was disgusting. 
It took 20 minutes for someone to finally serve us even though the place was not that busy. And when our waitress finally got to us, she was so rude and very disrespectful. My friend asked for four cups of water and the waitress interrupted her and said \"okay first of all, what are you going to eat\" She's probably a busy woman but is it so hard give us four cups of water? After ordering our food, it took them 30-40 minutes to give us our appetizer (which was cold) and another 30 minutes for our meal to arrive. I was beyond disgusted with the waitress' attitude. The next day i decided to come back and complain directly to the manager. He was just as bad, if not worse. He was incredibly rude and constantly interrupted me when I tried to talk. The look of the restaurant was nice and so was the food (not including the appetizer) but the service definitely outweighed it."}
{"text":"This is a very clean and friendly restaurant the staff are very polite and the service is very fast. Fantastic food and very good prices."}
{"text":"I ordered a steak and got frozen vegetables a disgusting clump of mash potatoes and a steak I ordered medium rare and got well done. The steak also had a weird green look to it. 

If your in the downtown area don't come to this restaurant"}
{"text":"Toronto downtown late night standard. Come here for some apple pie and poutine (pulled pork!) in the middle of the night to sober up after a long night out, or on a lazy Sunday morning for some eggs benedict and coffee. Either time, the food is always delicious, hot and fast. Friendly funny service (I came here once post-zombie walk in full bloody make-up and they didn't bat an eye) and reasonable prices make Fran's an easy choice if you want something quick and simple. Don't expect anything spectacular or in any way healthy though."}
{"text":"Nice little spot in a great location.  Service is not bad but not over the top either.  Food is surprisingly very delicious and at a reasonable price!  Definitely recommend if you're on a budget and want to still enjoy a good meal."}
{"text":"Bad experience today.  Milkshake was watery. Chicken panini was cold and avocado in it was brown/bad.  Steak salad had cold steak on it and the onions had gone soggy.  Restaurant was dirty.  Front door handle broken going out."}
{"text":"Fran's was a goldmine when my friends and I discovered it; it was open 24/7, had a pretty big menu and really friendly service.

But when our initial euphoria of finding a 24/7 place in Toronto wore off we actually started focusing on the food. First of all, the food's good but not all the time. The consistency of their home-fries continuously vary, their pastas aren't anything special, their steak always has muscles somewhere (even in the sandwiches, which make it terribly chewy), their chicken is bland and extremely soft and their poutine was a royal disaster. 

That being said, their breakfast is fantastic. It's one of the best in the city and occasionally when the other stuff in their menu is made well, it's really good. And that coupled with excellent service is probably why we still go back most of the time.

Lastly, I would most definitely recommend their floats. They are beyond spectacular! I haven't had a better one yet, they're quite essentially the pièce de résistance of the menu"}
{"text":"The Good: We decided to come here to wait out the rain on Nuit Blanche. We ordered their big breakfast and it was BIG. They had every breakfast staple on the plate. My personal fave was the pancakes. Light, fluffy, and a nice sweetness to it. 

It's bright and the seats were comfortable. Service was good even though they were very busy.

The Bad: The washroom was disgusting. Granted it was 4am, but the place is 24 hrs so that's no excuse. No toilet paper in either of the stalls. Used paper towels and napkins were on the floor and corners.

The Overall: There isn't anything spectacularly different about this place so the novelty wears thin after the first visit. It's a good place for some really late night eats, but I think Chinatown has more to offer and it'd be cheaper there too.

Revisit: Probably not just because diner food is more of a novelty especially with the way this place is designed."}
{"text":"Never really seem to have a problem here with food other than the service being terribly slow and not attentive enough -__- with that being said I would come back here again if nothing else can satisfy me as the portion sizes are quite large which would make good leftovers to take home and also - the food itself I'm pretty sure half the time is microwaved or kept in an oven but already pre-cooked and never fresh =) lol but still, at a good location and eh, at certain times when one doesn't care about quality and would just like to simply eat - why the hell not!"}
{"text":"The only thing this place has going for it is that it's open 24 hours. I don't know why I would ever come back here unless I really needed food at night - and even then, I'm sure I'd be happier with microwaveable food from Metro. 

I've been to Fran's twice for brunch/lunch and was left disappointed both times. The food is totally mediocre (don't order the french toast here, it's just thin slices of bread soaked in syrup!), although the serving size for the linguine alfredo was pretty decent. Even if the food were mediocre, I can live with that if the service is outstanding. However, don't expect good service here - everyone I've talked to always comments about the rude and unhelpful staff. Why forgo all the great brunch spots in this city (some of which are totally affordable) to come here? 

Basically, save yourself the time & money and don't come here unless you're drunk or starving and nothing else is open."}
{"text":"Breakfast menus are just okay. But their philly cheese steak sandwich is amazing!!! Upgrade regular fries to sweet potato fries. Totally worth it!"}
{"text":"One of the many restaurants we visited while in Toronto. I notice that Toronto loves their breakfast, because many places serve breakfast all day.
As a vegetarian who eats little to no dairy, breakfast is a tough meal to find decent options.
I ordered banana pancakes, veggie sausage and home fries. Everything I ordered was delicious except for the veggie sausage. It was really chewy and seemed a little overcooked. But the pancake and home fries were ON POINT! I could eat those two items everyday.
I recommend you visit this place if you are a fan of home fries and pancakes with fresh fruit cooked in them."}
{"text":"This review is mainly for the patio area as I didn't get to try any food there. We came here on a Sunday in afternoon and not realizing Biff's doesn't open till 5 PM on Sunday we ended up here. The Patio is huge and luckily they have a separate smoking section even in the patio which should quiet the folks who frown upon cigar smoking even in the out door area. I got some dirty looks from the some patrons (hey I am allowed to smoke outside) I ordered Jack on the rocks friends ordered beer and white wine. The Prices were OK and the service was good  they don't have a huge selection of hard spirits so beware of that. Nice Clean washrooms. 
Recommended for a drink in the patio."}
{"text":"I would come here often as a teen, line ups after the bar.  I haven't been here in at least 15  years and I thought it was time to check it out again. This was quite the \"after the bar place\" back in the day when Yonge Street was full of night life.  Of course the place is totally changed, from mainly red color diner style scheme to a horrible green-ish. The place has a dirty feel about it, not inviting at all (they should clean the bugs out of the lamps, I would add a star if they do). I ordered the chilli with toast for something different. It had potential but wasn't warm at all, cold actually. Had it been heated, they may have pulled it off. The service was excellent. Too bad things have to change, this was a hot spot back in the day."}
{"text":"2.5 stars

This Fran's location was packed on a Saturday morning so I figured it must be good. I never tried Fran's before so gave it a try.

They have a cool large patio in the front of the restaurant on Front street but it  was full so we sat inside.

Service was efficient and our server was upbeat and friendly. We didn't have any of the problems mentioned in other reviews - we got the food exactly as we ordered and quickly.

I ordered the french toast with mixed berries. Although the portion was huge, the french toast was so plain, no cinnamon or icing sugar and they used regular white sandwich bread. I only tasted the egg batter, it probably should have been cooked a little longer. The mixed berries were served in a tiny bowl with about 6-8 berries and they were almost frozen.    

I ordered a side of Peameal bacon which was unusually oily. They must have cooked it with the bacon on the grill. I ordered Peameal bacon because I didn't want the oil / fat.   

Unlikely to return in the future.

{"text":"The main meals (burgers, pasta, and other entrees) are fairly mediocre, but they get brownie points for being a 24-hour joint and with that 24-hour breakfast. The neon red sign just screams \"early morning comfort food\"."}
{"text":"3.5/5

Went in on Sunday for brunch around 12:45 and had a pretty pleasant experience. We got seated right away which was great because I was worried we would have to wait since it was \"prime time\". I order the rainbow Benedict with a side of banana French toast to share. 

Food came quickly but instead of bringing banana French toast, we got regular... Messed up our order but at least we didn't get charged for it . 

Rainbow Benedict was delicious with fresh veggies and hollandaise and a nice big serving of home fries on the side. 

We also got a piña colada and that was amazing! Sweet and coconutty and garnished with whipped cream and a cherry on top, would highly recommend. 

Tables were clean and the whole restaurant seemed to have a better vibe than the Fran's on College. My only issue is that the tables for two were a bit small and couldn't really fit the three plates of food we ordered, not a huge deal though. 

Overall decent experience, will probably return."}
{"text":"Use to be a great place to eat. I've been coming to this location for over 10 years. It's always been inviting and the staff friendly. The kind of place I would bring a date or family. Now I have noticed the staff aren't as friendly. The food is still great, however, the service has gone down the tubes. It's now become more of a hipster spot and not very inviting.

If you don't care about quality of service, and servers who don't go above and beyond personality wise for better tips, this this place is OK.  I use to be able to come to this place in a bad mood and come out feeling like a million bucks. Not so much now."}
{"text":"A really cool spot to hang out. 3 levels, but the top level was closed when I was there. The 2nd level feels like a balcony since they've removed the windows for the good weather. 

Service was good. The Skinny Dill Pickle Fries were great. They are french fries with dill on them, NOT actual pickles. I would get these instead of the regular fries that come with your meal. Loved them! The Chicken & Waffles were ok. The waffle was fluffy and perfect, but the chicken was dry and overcooked. I could barely get any chicken off. 

Really good drink selection. Everything from beer to cocktails to milkshakes."}
{"text":"Bad experience here with their FISH & CHIPS!  I was very upset and disappointed with the food I ordered.  I couldn't eat my fish at all.  After the first bite I could tell that the fish WASN\"T FRESH, was OVERCOOKED and covered with THICK BATTER.  I even thought that they did deep fried it twice that was why it looked burnt and hard to chew.  I don't think i'm too old to chew the battered fish fillet.  

However, I was too silly to not send it back and asked for another one as my husband told me to.  I thought they wouldn't treat me with a nice dish anymore if I say something.  So I packed it back home and threw it away.  (- -\") now I regret it and I am still upset!

It would be better if I talked to our server in the first place... and it might be my bad to order something that shouldn't be ordered in breakfast restaurant!  If I ordered classic breakfast, I would be satisfied, I guess.  Anyway, I would rather go to Lakeview or somewhere else next time."}
{"text":"Fran's is a classic diner style breaky venue. You really can't go wrong since you always get
A big portions
B good pricing 
C bottomless coffee

It can be pretty hectic but it's the the best bang for your buck breaky wise in this area."}
{"text":"Usually good for brunch, but this time, the waitress forgot to put in our order and we were left sitting for 40minutes. She only realized her mistake when we checked on the order. At least the juice was free."}
{"text":"I try to like Fran's. I've been to the location near Yong and Dundas as well as the one here on college. Last Wednesday I came here for a bite with a friend after work. We first tried Rogue Mahone across the way but they never came to take our order. So across the street to Fran's , we went. 

Service was slllllow. Getting our order taken was glacial. Getting the food was supremely long.  The food itself was perfectly passable. The place has a giant menu and really hasn't changed that much. Can't go wrong with all day breakfast or a burger. Just has to be faster. Then you will get another star Franny kids!"}
{"text":"This place was so great! My husband and I walked by it going somewhere else and instantly knew that is where we wanted to go before we left Toronto in the morning.
We got there at about 10:30 AM which was perfect because a huge brunch crowd came in after us so we got lucky. We were seated right away which was great. 
We were given just the right amount of time to think about drinks and we got our drinks promptly. I ordered a berry smoothie - I was super excited because most smoothies have banana's and I hate banana's but this one didn't - so I had to order it. It was just the right texture and very berry. It was so good and worth the price (~$5.00)
The menu had a bunch of really great options so my husband and I knew we weren't going to be disappointed. I had an omelet made for me with bacon and cheddar with hash browns and toast on the side. My husband got one of their bigger meals with sausage, bacon, toast, potatoes, eggs and pancakes... We both ate it all. The food came out very quickly and you could tell it was very fresh. We were amazed at the amount of food we got because the prices are very average or on the cheap side for a meal. We both ate everything on our plates and honestly wanted more but we were so full from the huge amounts we already ate. If we lived in the area, we would spend a large amount of money at this restaurant.
We strongly suggest anyone try this place if you love breakfast because you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"So foodie-snobs hate Fran's.  Let me tell you why I like it:

- booths.
- the service is always pretty damn good. Sometimes, you have to remind them you want water.  But overall, it's fast, and the servers are friendly.
- they show CP24
- if you order CORRECTLY the food is really good.  I think the coffee is great, surprisingly.  Stick to breakfasts and sandwiches; don't order pasta or salads.  The big breakfast is great.  Ask for your bacon extra crispy.  The onion rings are good."}
{"text":"The waffles and fried chicken!!!  combination of sweet Ana savoury so good!!! I normally don't Oder waffles for breakfast because I prefer savoury but this was a good balance!!"}
{"text":"I was a hungry looking for a good ol' breakfast while visiting Toronto and stumbled upon Fran's which was a few blocks from my hotel.   I noticed a few other \"chain\" like places around this area, but the neon and the full booths of Fran's told me it was the place to go.

The place has all the traditional breakfast fare, served piping hot, quickly, and with great service.  Good prices and hella good waffle if you go for the \"Morning Glory\"."}
{"text":"I was here a few days ago with some friends for lunch and it was made amazing by two things. 1 The chocolate banana pancakes and our server Sara. I really enjoyed the atmosphere and left with a full stomach. Amazing."}
{"text":"I love the Fran's on College Street, so I was hoping that I'd like this Fran's as well.  It has a really great, big beautiful patio. That's why I gave it 2 stars and not just one.

Let's see...service was awful.  Slow, uninterested.  I always get a vanilla milkshake, and this was was only filled halfway, the rest clearly had spilled all over the cup and the cup looked dirty.  I never send things back, but I pointed these things out to the waitress and when she brought me back a new milkshake, she did so with major attitude.  Which isn't necessary, at all.

The food was gross.  I got the steak and eggs.  First, why ask me how I want my steak cooked, when you're just going to make it grey anyway and it's only 1 mm thick so how could they possible cook it any other way?  At least half was gristle and inedible.  Nothing had taste. I didn't get it.

Overall, watching all the waitresses and hostesses stand around and chitchat, twirl their hair and get themselves drinks (and they were even sometimes eating) while everyone on the patio sat without service (our food took about 40 minutes to come out) is just insane.  I guess if you're a tourist, you might stop by here, but they clearly don't want anyone who could stop by more than once."}
{"text":"This was the first time i've been to this particulr Fran's location across from Massey Hall, although i've been to the Fran's on College numerous times. 
I was surprised when i walked in and the layout seemed much bigger on the inside than the other Fran's! 
We just popped in here for a quick bite before a concert at Massey Hall the other day. The service was good, quick and attentive. I just got a poutine to fill my tummy up. It looked good when it arrived, but i did have to ask for extra gravy. I don't like them dry fries... They brought it out right away.
No authentic cheese curds this time, but i didn't really expect it from diner poutine. All in all... yummy!! 
p.s. the bathroom is extra fancy! You go through to an ajoining resto next door to use the bathrooms."}
{"text":"Enjoy coming here for breakfast! Usually order the big breakfast with a smoothie. Excellent meal that fills you up for the day. Plus the service & ambiance is excellent. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place has terrible food and terrible service.

However they have the best pancakes in the city by far and that itself is worthy of 3 stars.

Order pancakes because they are slap your mother good, however expect to have awful service. If you order anything but pancakes expect to have a one star meal."}
{"text":"Knowing you can get breakfast foods at any time of the day (and more specifically, night) is the best feeling. 

Fran's is open 24-7, so it is the perfect for a visit after a late night out. With a large variety on the menu, they can cover pretty much anything you've got a craving for at that moment. 

Their breakfast options are definitely the best, but they've got things like spaghetti and steak as well! Their milkshakes are a highlight as well!

Make sure to drop by and check this place out if you're ever out late and in the area!"}
{"text":"A great go-to place when you're craving all day breakfast or late night eats. The menu is extensive, I've barely made a dent in it, but some notable dishes are the Mac and cheese, grilled cheese, spaghetti, eggs Benedict, and any of their pies. The rooftop patio has a nice atmosphere but the menu up there is much more limited....only worth it if you're going for drinks and the view."}
{"text":"so I ask can I get a quick breakfast she said of course got my meal in 20 mins for an omelette and homefries and side of bacon funny thing was guy next to me ordered his bacon well done and waitress brought mine well done too I have never sent back bacon before it was black like burnt and she had the balls to tell me that how it usually comes out I can try have him cook it less but no gurantees like whatttttttttt lol it came with 2 pieces of smallest rye bread ever seen so I asked for extra toast she said its extra I said no problem I got the butt end of the loaf like the first slice u normally throw out its so small lol I couldn't ask for new toast she think I'm crazy what was really disappointing that they advertise breakfast specials in window each day a different one for 5.99 and no where it states only till 11am I walk in at quarter after 11 and she says I got pay regular price of 11,99 so that's why I ordered the omelette instead but come on for 11.99 it should come with a protein sausage bacon or ham I had to pay 3.50 extra my breakfast with coffee cost 18.47 that's ridiculous what ever happened to those places 3 eggs bacon ham or sausage homefries toast and coffee 4.99 those days gone???????"}
{"text":"Nothing to complain about but nothing to rave about either. The food was good maybe a little heavy on seasoning though. The service was good meeting the standards at which most people should expect to be served when dinning out but not exceeding those standards. The joint was clean and had obvious flare. I would go back to Fran's."}
{"text":"Great place to go with friends late at night, I had a burger which was okay except it was very overcooked and the edges were burnt. The home fries were amazing though!"}
{"text":"Walked in on a sunday afternoon. It was busy waited 10 minutes for a table for 4. The waitress was nice. I was super hungry and was craving for a burger and since i loved mushrooms i ordered (i think its called) portobello mushroom burger. (I cant find that item on their online menu. ) Had some water downed coffee. When my order arrived couldn't wait to get my hands and try it out. Fries were nasty. The first bite out of this burger was meh. I thought it tasted funny but i ignored it because i thought thats how its supposed to taste like.  
Fast forward three hours later I'm hovering over the toliet with my hair tied up in a high tight bun and....well yeah you know what happens. ill spare you the details 
Yeah never again."}
{"text":"I wanted a hearty breakfast before going to the Auto Show.

It looks like a generic 50's themed restaurant, but apparently this chain is pretty old, so maybe a real vintage place.

The service is a bit slow, but they were busy.
Coffee is not included in the breakfast specials, which I found odd.

The 2 eggs were OK, but the potatoes and sausage tasted really off.

This is a great location off 2 busy streets, and despite the hundreds of restaurants nearby, most are not sit-down diner food.

Might bump it up if i'm in the city and try other stuff that's better"}
{"text":"You know, maybe I'm a dumb American, but it wasn't so bad!  My price perspective is also pretty off, but it seemed reasonably priced to me.  2 beers, and some corned beef hash and cajun popcorn shrimp really hit the spot.

A ten minute wait was followed by very brisk service; had to see a show at Massey!  So, we ordered in 1 minute, and I asked for the check in the same breath.

Inside decor is very 50-60's diner.  Reds, whites and chrome.  

The food was fair... but nothing mindblowing...  I did eat all my hash though!

And... made it with time to spare!"}
{"text":"Ate at Fran's during TIFF, it's really close to the Winter Garden/Visa Screening Room.  
I stopped there for an in between film meal and ordered the beet & goat cheese salad with chicken.  The food was fairly standard if a bit pricey (about $20 with tip) but the service was pretty quick and friendly.  It also shares the bathrooms with the pricey Pantages Hotel next door, too, so that's a bit different.  

I would try it again the next time I'm in Toronto."}
{"text":"The Hubster and I came here for some late night eats after a night out, as you do.

He loved loved loved his BLT and I was pretty happy with my corned beef hash. Service was good, and there wasn't a wait to be seated, as it was still before 2am.

I'd go back if I were in the area and didn't want to make the trek to Chinatown. yes, I would only go back for late late eats. And probably not sober.

The atmosphere is quite clean and nice, a big difference from the grungy Fran's I grew up with."}
{"text":"Last stop at the Canadian National Exhibition was at Fran's Restaurant.

I had to finish up a night of ridiculous food with an even more ridiculous dessert. Hence the Blueberry Pie Milkshake. Considering how much sugar is heaped into this shake, you're probably going to have to hit the gym after reading this review. This fun house of a blueberry milkshake comes served with whipped cream, sprinkles, Smarties, cotton candy, a chocolate wafer stick, and a slice of blueberry pie nestled on top for that extra \"F you\" to your doctor. After taking a sip I'm pretty sure that I felt my childhood travel through time to give me a high five. It should go without saying, but in case you lack imagination, this thing was a delicious mess of calories. And God bless the folk at Fran's for actually making the blueberry milkshake the best part of the dessert, rather than relying on the array of fun toppings.

This was stupid good. For my health, I'm never going to eat this again, nor would I suggest that anyone treat themselves to this without having heavily exercised prior. But hey, you're an adult. Do you boo."}
{"text":"This place is the bomb.  My kids loved it and so did I.  Giant waffles covered in strawberry whipped cream goodness, chocolate chip waffles, eggs, bacon and breakfast potatoes. . . a perfect morning.  

Do it!  The service was excellent, even after my daughter spilled a chocolate milk all over the table, and the coffee is delicious."}
{"text":"I've been to Frans twice. The first time was awful the food was soaked in grease (yes I realize its a diner but come on - I shouldn't be able to scoop spoonfuls of grease off my food). After complaining we received no discount and no response from management. 

On the second trip I had to be dragged kicking and screaming with friends. I must admit the food was *better* the second time but nothing I'd write home about. The service was mediocre so I've given them 3/5 stars. 

The food was also somewhat expensive."}
{"text":"Busy spot! Looked like it was going to be a long wait but managed to get seated in less than 10mins . Great menu selection/ right downtown : 50m from Yonge / friendly staff of course / very fresh food due to heavy traffic . We were very satisfied! Wife had \"whole wheat breakfast wrap\" : delish and fresh but could use a little zip like chipotle or Sriracha etc .. and I had the \"Along the Seine\":  interesting flavours with the balsamic reduction and feta mmm with the yoke too. Eggs were cooked perfectly ."}
{"text":"Location: 200 Victoria Street, Toronto, ON M5B 2R3
Price: $
Service: Decent

This is an okay breakfast place. It wasn't as special as I hoped it would be but it wasn't terrible. The price was cheap and the service was decent. The food is very generic so there's not much to review. 

Verdict: try another breakfast place"}
{"text":"I had heard decent reviews place about this place so decided to visit on the weekend for breakfast. The hostess was courteous and there was no wait.

They menu had roasted vegetable panini, we asked the server if they could do a sandwich with roasted vegetables instead since there were no vegetarian sandwiches. She seemed quite confused and asked us to order something from the menu and they could remove the meat instead. She didn't really care about trying to understand what we need.

Eventually we ordered Roasted Vegetables  Panini and Waffles with Banana. The panini had too many eggplants, tasted just about OK. You cannot go wrong with Waffles. The Cappuchino was fine.

I will not visit again, there are plenty of options."}
{"text":"Many years ago, I use to love the Fran's on St Clair Avenue when I worked nearby.  Lately I've only heard and read negative words about the remaining Fran's.  However I happened to be close to the College Street one today and on a whim decided to try it out.  Not gourmet food by any means...more like comfort food, but overall the food was more than decent at a very reasonable pricing (lunch specials).  I loved the old style booths and the service was very friendly.  While not a destination place, I would have no issues giving Fran's a return visit."}
{"text":"First time trying out Fran's after eyeing it all these years and we were impressed!  Cute diner set-up and enjoyed some nice old tunes while we had lunch.  We both ordered eggs Benedict specials and no joke, we were served in 5 minutes!  And it was a full house for lunch!  Tasty and very good portion size.  We always go to Cora's for lunch meet-ups when we crave breakfast food but I think we just found our new go-to.  Better pricing too...not to mention that Fran's also has an extensive menu beyond breakfast specials.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"Decided at the last minute to come here for breakfast one day and unfortunately it was a terrible experience. The food took forever to come out. Normally I don't mind waiting but it just took an excessively long time, and the place was practically empty. 

They also got my order wrong, had to be reminded to bring things that we ordered, brought stuff we never ordered (and tried to charge us for it) and straight up forgot the names of the breakfast specials on their own menu. The servers were clumsy, often spilling and dropping things on the table or floor (thankfully, I saw them take back, and presumably throw out the stuff that landed on the floor.)

After actually getting my food, the portion was small and it was extremely underwhelming, bland, and left me craving more food afterwards even though I had somehow already spent about 30$ after tax/tip.

Before we got the bills, one of the servers said she would look into getting us some sort of compensation for our experience. The bill came, no discount, no explanation. Why even offer it then?

All in all, a hot mess from start to finish. Would not go back. But hey, it's pretty, so there's that."}
{"text":"It was the snow storm day and I was at the College Park courts for a client and bumped into my friend who works there. So we went for breakfast at lunch time at Fran's. The staff were friendly, fun and funny! The food was good but I think they are starting to get a little over priced."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick bite, was pretty hungry and the huge portions did the trick. Ordered eggs Benedict which is what I usually like to order for breakfast food. It said it came with fruit and it did... One piece of an orange slice. Rather disappointing. It was cool that sriracha sauce was available - it was yummy to have it with my home fries along with ketchup. Our server was friendly and checked up on us. I'm kind of thirsty still.. Definitely should have had two glasses of water instead of the one. If you're looking for a no frills meal, this is it! Fun to have breakfast for dinner from time to time."}
{"text":"The worst eggs Benedict I've ever had - it was more like hard boiled with cold hollendaise.  Also had the nachos which were cold with congealed cheese."}
{"text":"Mediocre to poor, not even good quality
You could do worse, its better than a Denny's,
But you could do better with a random restaurant,
give this one a miss, this is don't go here if you can avoid it"}
{"text":"Fran's Restaurant.  Oy vey.

It gets one requisite star for availability (24 hours).  

They were open when we got in late to Toronto.  I had a regrettably greasy omelette and potatoes that I probably would have walked away from were it not for our 5 hour travel delay and the incessant stomach grumbling that accompanied it.  We were lured back for a breakfast with the promise that they had the best pancakes in Toronto.  We were lied to.  The pancakes were too much of a mediocre thing.  I don't need to eat a whole backyard's worth of food.  Just give me a decent portion that's done well. 

Maybe Fran's should reconsider the 24 hour thing.  Go home.  Get some rest.  And at least get breakfast right."}
{"text":"Had breakfast two days in a row. Good food. I loved the eggs Benedict. Pancakes were good."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast spot.

Been here many times and to be honest, I've only gotten the big breakfast everytime.

2 eggs (poached), some rye toast, 2 sausage, 2 bacon, home fries and 2 pancakes. 

It's quite heavy though so make sure you have no immediate plans after.

The staff is lovely, great service, food came out quickly and open 24 hours!

One day I will attempt to order something else on their menu, but at least I'll know i will always have the big breakfast to fall back on. 


I wish I remembered to take a picture of the big breakfast but I was hungry."}
{"text":"I went to friends at around midnight on a Monday night when they were in the middle of shift change for the staff, maybe our waiter just had a rough night or was out of it but he seemed really stressed and unable to do much. If we would ask him for something, he'd tell us how he was going to do it in a rushed manner. So that wasn't very pleasant. 

I ordered the drunk burger which a side of chips and salsa, the burger was good and the pineapple and egg were great additions. 

I'm glad I ordered the burger because a couple of my friends ordered the chicken and waffles and it was the saddest chicken and waffles I had ever seen. We hadn't realized that it'd be served with 4 little pieces of chicken wings and apparently the waffles were not great either. If that is how the dish is all the time, I would def recommend you to not get it and have your chicken and waffle fix elsewhere. Also my friend found a piece of metal of some sort in his waffle. 

Other than that, I heard the eggs benedict was good, and also the big breakfast looked really amazing and worth the money. Otherwise I would think this is an overpriced dinner."}
{"text":"I always walk by Fran's and yesterday I decided to try it for the first time and I was really pleased.  I know they are well known for their breakfast items especially because they serve it all day.  They also have daily breakfast specials and every day it is something different.  We walked in and was really busy on a Saturday afternoon but we were greeted and seated right away.  The ambience was really homey and had a feel of a retro diner, like the ones you see in the movies. We were introduced to a young gentlemen who served us and he was really knowledgeable about the menu. We ordered the Big Breakfast and decided to share that as well as their Comfort Meat Chili, which the waiter recommended.  The Big Breakfast comes with two eggs cooked any style you'd like, two breakfast sausages, home fries, two pancakes and a choice of white, brown or rye toast.  The food was delicious and I was definitely stuffed after eating all that.  We even had to doggy bag our Chili to take with us for later.  The waiter we had was very observant and attentive to our needs.  Anytime were low on water, he'd refill our glasses and he came by numerous times to ask us how we were doing and if we needed anything else. He even had the bill ready to go before we asked him, which I thought was exceptional customer service.  I failed to get the waiters' name which is unfortunate but none the less, I will definitely come by to Fran's again next time I crave for breakfast food."}
{"text":"I found it really hard to review this place but here we go. First of all, the staff here is awesome. Our server was extremely friendly and made sure our water was filled and came back several times to check up on us. 

The downside is that this location gets really busy so be prepared for a line up. The seating is also a bit tight. The other issue I have is for some reason the portions here and the quality of some of the menu items are different compared to the Fran's near st. michael's hospital. The oatmeal with mixed berries for instance, was quite watered down and the mixed berries came in the same size pot as the brown sugar which was incredibly small for the extra $2.00. At the other Fran's location, the berries came in a bowl that was at least 4 to 5 times bigger for the exact same price. The toast is also smaller, and the western omelette was smaller and came with far less home fries."}
{"text":"Came here last night and I got the three cheese penne pasta. It came with a long garlic bread and the pasta had cheese spinach and grilled chicken. My friend got the spinach and artichoke quesadillas and it came with 2 kinds of dips. We shared the two and loved them both! Our servers were really friendly and the restaurant was really clean. It was my first time coming here and I'm definitely coming back. This restaurant definitely deserved 5 star rating. Can't wait to be here again! :)"}
{"text":"Very disappointed. Ordered the morning glory waffles for $11.99. When the plate came the portion was  small. My friends who ordered cheaper food had more food and bigger portions. Definitely not worth the price. Other food are not bad."}
{"text":"Frans is amazingingly good especially at 3am after the long hours of clubbing. The portions here are massive and I usually always get the breakfast with eggs, pancakes, potatoes, bacon, and bread and never ever finish it.  You do not come here at 3am for the service.  Come here for the food. Eat until you are full and then go to bed satisfied.

The breakfast is so tasty here and there is just something about it that makes it so friggin good. I have had breakfast at other places and Frans always has that little bit of extra love in their food.  

Prices are comparable to your typical breakfast joints averging $10 or more for a good combo.  Parking...well it is downtown so you need to find a creative place to park.

Come to Frans and you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate lunch here on 5/21.  The outdoor seating area was very nice.  They were playing some awesome 80's music (not an oxymoron).  Food was slightly above average.  

The MAJOR reason we won't be returning is the service.  As other reviews have mentioned, the service is atrocious.  We ordered nachos which took over 30 minutes to get.  Nachos are not that hard to throw together!  Of course, halfway through the nachos, our sandwiches showed up.  

I try to give plenty of leeway when it comes to service; at times the kitchen is overwhelmed or there aren't enough servers to deal with a crowd.  However, we saw people who were seated 10+ minutes after us receiving their food before we got ours.  So it didn't appear to be a kitchen issue.  Our server was one of 3 or so working the outdoor seating area, so adequate coverage.  

There are countless other choices in the area.  I'd suggest checking out one of those before dining at Fran's."}
{"text":"There is something really nice about being able to find consistent diner food in the heart of downtown, and Fran's iconic location on College street was just what I needed on a raining friday AM in Toronto. 

Coffee was black, hot and constantly topped up by the staff. My omelette was tasty, and although I opted for no toast, making the potatoes look lonely without the toast accompaniment, everything was just as I expected it to be in a diner. Tasty but not innovative. Filling, not overfilling and just the right amount of grease. Endless supply of ketchup.  

Service was a bit slow, but as I was in no rush, I didn't mind that there seemed to be plenty of staff moving at their own leisurely pace. Personally, I like finding more unique diners to eat at, but for a dependable diner breakfast, it's nice to know you can depend on Fran's."}
{"text":"I like the Fran's on College, so I figured I would like this one too.

We came here to watch FIFA on a warm summer day. We were lucky enough to get a patio spot with a big TV. That part was good.

The bad part is that the food was terrible and we came there hungry. When you're hungry, sometimes you'll eat anything and regardless of how it tastes, you'll think it was good. That wasn't the case here. I was hungry and I still thought the food sucked. Service was spotty."}
{"text":"I have tried all their burgers, we usually go late at night like 11 pm from lab when we stay late, breakfasts are also nice to have at night but I don't recommend them. Drink menu is good enough for a 24 hour diner, not awesome drinks different domestic and imported beers as well as cocktails.

Pastas are not awesome, sandwiches are more recommended, steak sandwich is decent and filling."}
{"text":"Great little diner in downtown Toronto. You can pretty much find any delicious home cooking meal here. Stop in for some fab comfort food. 
We stopped in for breakfast and each person at our table was pleasantly full. You get plenty of food for the price!"}
{"text":"I really liked my Grilled Havarti Cheese & Apple Slices 'Franwich'! The thinly cut Ontario apple slices were fresh and crispy and a good mix to the melted savory cheese. Mmm, I should really order grilled cheese sandwiches more often!

The tortilla chips and salsa were nothing spectacular; just your regular tortilla chips and store-bought salsa. I wish there were more salsa actually as I had more chips than salsa.."}
{"text":"Great location and Food, Service needs some work.

Fran's is Great, the food is delicious and such value, we had ordered pancakes, meat loaf, a breakfast meal and salad.

It was all under $40, for  table full of food.

Except my meatloaf being super dry the rest of the food was spectacular. I recommend the pancakes!! Such a treat, delicious pancake batter. 

The service is what really needs to be worked on, our server was really nice but I wish she knew more about the menu, when we're given the bill she mischarged us when bringing it up to her she just told us NEXT TIME tell her first before ringing it in. As if a server wasn't supposed to know the menu itself. She also forgot our waters, and the place wasn't busy.

I would still come back to fran's but maybe to one of the other locations."}
{"text":"I love Frans, and especially as of late. I've been coming here since first year of university (about to go into my third) with my student fellowship a couple times a semester, and again a few times on my own with friends and classmates. They changed their menu/main ingredients recently, so now their food portions and flavour and quality is so much better than before! Every waiter that I've ever encountered at Frans is always super friendly and helpful. So glad this is near my school and 24H for anytime breakfast! Their sandwiches and benedicts are awesome."}
{"text":"They were completely slammed the Sunday I arrived for breakfast.  Waited 5 minutes at the door before anyone acknowledged me. Then wanted 10 minutes once I got a table for the waitress to acknowledge me.  Felt like the invisible man, but once she arrived she was attentive despite what seemed like a looney bin of staff and managers running around the place.  I wouldn't go back, the food was simply average."}
{"text":"I'm a little biased towards this location because 80% of my visits have been during late nights (when McDonalds after drinking didn't seem like an appetizing option) drawn mainly by their \"adult milkshakes\" and my experience then has been 2-3 stars but my breakfast trips here have definitely been at least 3 star experiences.

I must say that their location is amazing, so amazing in fact that sometimes the line up at night is annoyingly long, so if you're very hungry on a peak time, expect to wait longer or go somewhere else. 

They have a full breakfast menu that will be sure to fill you up to the brim for a greasy start to your day (although you can change things around to eat healthier) and I must give it credit for totally giving off the diner vibe. 

Staff experiences for me have been up and down, most of my night visits were impaired by below par service while during breakfast time it has on average been better. 

For a breakfast place this is a good bet, and depending on what you want late at night they could fill that need too, don't expect very high quality or consistently great service."}
{"text":"Came here with a friend after a night out. Ordered the western omelet breakfast. Egg was cooked very fresh. It had a fluffy texture which you could easily tell that it was not overcooked. Their breakfast portions are definitely worth your buck. I was only able to finish half of it and had to take the rest to go. We had a pretty energetic waiter who I swear has one of those smiles that would warm up your day. Would love to try their famous milkshake next time!"}
{"text":"Lots of options and can accommodate for vegetarians. Staff is nice and service is usually pretty good. They generally accommodate most requests. This is low end diner food and does the trick!"}
{"text":"Food was fine, but nothing to write home about. I had the lasagna (flavor seemed off) and my partner had the pesto pasta (said it tasted like canned sauce). Our waitress was great and quite friendly, but overall OU was a 'meh'

We ate outside on the small and were bothered many times by people asking for money. Perhaps indoors would be better?"}
{"text":"When I attended university my circle always raved about Fran's.  However, since I was in the suburbs, I never got a chance to dine here until recently.  I went here with my bf, who actually used to come here a lot when he was younger with his older cousin after a few WoW raids.  In all fairness, I was blown away.   I always had a penchant for liking breakfast foods, but Fran's outdid many of its competitors in my book (eg. Markham Station, Cora's, Sunset Grill, Eggsmart, Panagois, Golden Griddle, etc.).  It maintains a 50's diner aesthetic with regard to the furniture, uniforms, and lighting.  I personally enjoyed the aesthetic, as it was a nice break from the \"hipster\", trendy landscape found at many restaurants now.  

My bf and I ordered individual breakfast platters with all the works (eggs, toast, home fries, sausages, peameal, coffee, bacon, and pancakes).  Each platter costed about 12 dollars, which was a fair price because the portions are good enough for two with a smaller appetite or one with a large appetite (like me!).  I will not say this was the healthiest breakfast, but the sauce, oil, and carb-centric items titillated my taste buds throughout the meal.  It wasn't one of those experiences during which everything tastes exceptional at the beginning only to have grease and saltiness get to you midway. I loved the maple sausages and pancakes the most. The sausages were thicker than normal and hosted a party in your mouth with every bite.  The pancakes were actually fluffy, a quality that I don't often find at all-day breakfast joints.   This is also my bf's holy grail for breakfast foods, and I will definitely be returning!  

I completely understand the hype over Fran's and I encourage anyone who has any adoration for breakfast foods to come here!

...If only this was in Scarborough!"}
{"text":"One of bigger location, I find it a bit slower in service then other two location I have been to but that just might be the size

I went with big breakfast, (3 eggs. Bacon, ham , sausage and pancakes) it was good , quality doesn't change thou I will probably stick to one of the other locations."}
{"text":"This is the place you go to when you're too hungover or lazy to make breakfast. Food is boring, lacks inspiration, and average at best. We ordered the veggie omelet and walnut pancakes. The omelet was tasteless and needed a lot of Tabasco and ketchup to accompany it. Pancakes were okay. I had no expectations and would have given 3 stars. However, waited 15min+ for the cheque. Our waitress was very MIA."}
{"text":"It baffles me why, with all the other great places to eat in this neighbourhood that Fran's is still in business. 

Came here with 2 of my female co-workers as it was one of their birthdays (hey, she chose the restaurant I didn't).  The hostess has a dual function as a bus girl as she has to wipe down the tables and be available at the front to seat guests.

One order arrives, and its the wrong thing.  How do you confused steak for chicken?  However, they do remedy the problem right away.

I should've known better than to have wanted to be adventurous at a place like Fran's.  I ordered an overcooked Grilled Liver & Onions that came with a naked mash (where's my gravy?)

However, at 1PM when we strolled in this place was packed.  We even had to wait for a table.  

The burgers are huge but the anorexic buns are not thick enough to hold all the condiments in the bun and its a sloppy mess to eat. 

All in all my Grilled Liver & Onions was $10.  It filled me, but that was about it.  The sauteed vegetables could rival that of any hole-in-the-wall Chinese restaurant.  

Definitely won't be back again."}
{"text":"I went here for breakfast with my dad and the service was okay. Our waiter brought us our drinks and took our orders. The place looked runned down and wasn't appealing to the eye. My dads \"waffles with fresh berries\", came with fresh frozen berries but the waffle was still good. I ordered the chicken and waffles and my chicken was as dry as cali on a good day. I will probably never go back!"}
{"text":"I used to love going here, really. I was always into the decor, always loved the all day breakfast idea and the odd time when I would order from their regular menu I was not disappointed.

But I have to agree on the service, it really has gone downhill for a place that was not so service friendly to begin with."}
{"text":"Good comfort food. Good breakfast. Reasonable prices. Non-pork breakfast meats."}
{"text":"I have to drop my rating, the pancakes were lacking, not much taste or wasn't that fluffy. The sausage was a bit burnt and over cooked, lack favour but it was passable, the rest of meal was alright, eggs and bacon. Home fries are decent"}
{"text":"Great Food and affordable. Clean. Always open. Helps with the midnight cravings. A treat for a Canadian visiting from overseas."}
{"text":"Great place for a meal anytime of the day. Great all day breakfast menu. Awesome lunch and dinner menu. Spectacular service. Everyone is nice and serves you with and smile on their face"}
{"text":"Frans is a good place to get breakfast, location was small and service was slower compared other locations but it was fine"}
{"text":"So my boyfriend and I arrived in Toronto by way of Greyhound at the ungodly hour of 1:00am.  After to checking into our hotel we were famished and needed an all hours diner to satisfy our rumbling tummy. Traveling by bus can really work up ones appetite. 

We located Fran's on Yelp.com and quickly as we could walked from the hotel to Frans. 

As we walked up the sidewalk Fran's beckoned to us the outside has this charming flashing marquee, think old theater, such as the Benedum Center has in Downtown Pittsburgh. 

Flashy happy sign, a great way to make a first impression! 

We dined here at 3am in the morning. Going into the experience my expectations were low but boy were they exceeded. I had low expectations for Frans due to negative experiences with all night diners. 

Well let me just tell you. The restaurant was clean and well cared for. Our food came out hot and made to order and the waiter was very friendly and efficient.

I ordered the steak and eggs with a 5oz steak and two sunny side up eggs, my meal came with hash browns and toast.  Home fries are normally something I completely ignore when they are served to me. Something to be discarded and only eaten when every thing else has been consumed on the plate. With home fries browns I normally get the feeling that the entire restaurants hash browns were carted in frozen and sprayed down in some chemical solution that tingles in my mouth after each bite.

But NOT at Frans I can tell the difference between a frozen potato and a fresh potato and Fran's was FRESH and seasoned perfectly. I am pretty sure we all can. 

The steak was served medium well, the eggs were slightly under seasoned but the steak was hot delicious and glistened with juices.  My steak needed nothing but to be sliced and eaten, I am slowly learning that when meat is prepared well there is hardly a need to coat it in steak sauce, ketchup or the like.  I ate my steak sans sauce! 

My companion ordered a waffle with scrambled eggs bacon slices and caramelized apples.  His breakfast was equally as delicious and equally has nicely prepared.

Frans really delivered when we needed nourishment after a 10 hour bus ride from the Burgh and for that I give them 4 stars."}
{"text":"I work right around Fran's Restaurant and have always walked by without eating there because I was not terribly impressed with the prices. 

Well, now I've eaten there and I'm not terribly impressed with anything else there either.

The wait staff seems totally disinterested in their customers and in getting tip basically, it took FOREVER to get our orders taken and the restaurant was only speckled with people with wait staff wandering around mindlessly. While our server seemed nice enough, after we ordered we never saw him again, never got refills of water or any attention regarding our food (which was luke-warm and meh) The best person there was the bus boy, so I left a decent tip hoping it would trickle down to him.

I had the Eggs Benedict but with feta cheese and tomato, which arrived with barely enough feta cheese to actually be listed on the menu. The home fries were nice enough but for 13$? No thanks. 

The famous float  for 2.99$ was pretty good. Standard pepsi and ice cream but I added strawberry ice cream for nummy chunks o' strawberry in my soda.

If you're strapped for time or want a location open late, why not, but if you have ANY other option, avoid this place."}
{"text":"As a former frequent visitor of the Victoria street location, I wasn't surprised the service today wasn't adequate, I guess that's consistent with the management.  This was a 2 star review turned 3 star due to the nice way that they split the bill and made payment super easy. 

However, it was a busy Sunday morning and we came for brunch at 11:30am. Their 'policy' was not seat anyone until their entire party was ready.  This wasn't known to us until we got there, so be warned.

They were waiting on me and AT, but they were already 5/7 people, and they still were not able to be seated because of some ridiculous rule (even though the table makeup would not change if we were to not show up for some reason). 
When they were waiting, they witnessed some couple being sat down at a table of 8 without their whole party being there, and the hostess got an earful from the manager. This was also the reason they weren't seated. 

At some point, the tables were actually going to be given away, and we were right there crossing the street. They had to fight with the hostess to give it to us when we did get there (about 1 min away!). 
(btw, we're sorry we were late!!)

Anyway, after settling down after that fiasco, we ordered. The food wasn't amazing, but it was still good.  It's at a decent price point, but I've had better. 

I got the Vegetarian Benedict, which was veggies on an english muffin, poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. It was okay. Homefries were crunchy and yummy. At least that stayed the same between locations. 

AT got the Scrambled eggs on a croissant with avacado, tomato and goat cheese on a croissant. I'm glad I didn't opt for that, I had expected a crisp half cut croissant with most scrambbled eggs on it. Instead, it was a whole croissant, smooshed flat (not seeing the point), with flat eggs omelette style. i felt like I could have made this at home. At the same time, maybe I expected too much. AT really enjoyed it though. 

Another friend got the vegetarian chilli, and I tried some: I have to say, it's extremely hearty and delicious for a vegetarian dish, and if ever I were here for lunch or dinner, I'll probably get that. 

Coffee refills were good, sometimes magically appeared, kudos for that. 

I'd recommend coming here on a quieter morning for breakfast or lunch and I think you'd have a better time. 
There is parking in the parkade on Scott Street south of wellington for $3 on the weekend."}
{"text":"Went for a breakfast, the four of us on the Family Day Monday morning. Things were busy, but was assigned a table within a coupe of minutes. Our first visit to this iconic restaurant. 

Was impressed with the menu as it had a fair amount of dishes suitable for vegetarians.  We ordered a Vegetarian Rainbow Benedict, a Vegetarian Omelette, Mixed Berries Pancakes and a Fran's Energy Breakfast minus the ham. The Benedict were slightly over done. The plate looked interesting and quite colourful. The mixed berries pancakes were huge and fluffy and were the best we have had in a long time. Four pancakes are quite big and may be a bit too much for a person with a smaller appetite. The energy breakfast was tasty on a croissant and had a lot more home fries than we anticipated. The omelette was just plain but had a variety of vegetables and asparagus was a welcome change. The vegetables were done perfectly. 

Would definitely go again and try some more things. 

The surprising thing was that there was a digital juke box. An Indian Hindi song played just as we were leaving from the movie K3G!!"}
{"text":"Hmmm I have mixed feelings about Frans. It's fine, the place is clean, staff are always lovely, patio is nice, food has always been fine, free refills on soda (nice), good value for money but I have been a little unwell after eating here twice and it is probably  just coincidence.

Things I have tried in my many visits -

Steak benedict...eggs perfect (I hate over cooked poached eggs), steak cooked to how I asked for it and in general everything tasted fresh and lovely.

Pancakes, waffles etc - delicious, fresh, fluffy and just how they should be!

Maple leafs breakfast thing - tasty, and Frans baked beans were superb

Meatloaf - I was disappointed with this, it was ok but just!

Steak - its hard to go wrong unless its a bad cut or not cooked as requested...it was fine and cooked to how I like it!"}
{"text":"My sister, friend, and I went to Fran's on Victoria for breakfast. This was not our first time at this location and I had a great experience at the one on College. My sister and I ordered the whole wheat breakfast wrap to share. When we first ordered we asked the waiter if the home fries would be enough for the two of us and he blankly answered \"I'm not sure\". Due to that, we decided to order a side of home fries as well. When the food came we realized there was more then enough to share and we were left with a huge plate of home fries neither of us could eat.

When ordering the breakfast wrap we specifically asked for no bacon as my sister is a vegetarian and I do not eat pork. Once we got it and began eating it we realized there was bacon inside it, leaving us extremely upset. When we told the waiter, he apologized, paused, and asked if we want a new one. A good waiter would not ask if we would like a new meal, as the meal we received was inedible for our dietary restrictions. Instead, they would immediately offer to bring a new one. 

When we were finished eating, he asked if we would like our bills. We were shocked that he did not compensate the meal for this big mistake. Also, instead of offering us a to-go container, he took our side of untouched home fries and was about to throw them away. We had to stop him and ask for the to-go container.

Overall, this terrible service made it a really unenjoyable experience and I do not think I would ever go to this location again."}
{"text":"Service was really slow for it not being busy.  French fries were terrible! Not sure how a restaurant can screw up French fries but they were hard and cold like they had been refried a bunch of times they sat out for hours. My husbands burger was burnt and the bun was burnt too. Again not sure how a restaurant can screw up a burger and fries.  Just stick to the dessert and you should be fine."}
{"text":"Full bar! Open 24 hours. Most of the staff is amazing, except for a few turds. Went here before a show at Massey Hall, very busy and food was ready fast. Menu aimed at peoples tastes pre1970, but the breakfast is always awesome.  Go straight to the bar, fuck the booths."}
{"text":"My grandfather gave me advice one time, it was \"Always look for the longest line, that's where the good stuff is\" Now I don't know how true of a statement that can always be, but the 3 times I have visited this location the line has always been out the door.  Knowing that and people still decide to wait for it, has got to say something.  I highly enjoy watching the orange juicer work, it never gets old seeing the fruit get halved, juiced, and ejected quite rhythmically.  2 out of the 3 times we have been seated in the lower level which I actually prefer over the main floor, it's quieter, has a nice large flat screen, and the servers seem to be not as frazzled.  Each meal has been good and we felt full after leaving.  The service was relatively quick given the absolute hilarity running amok in the building.  We'll come here again."}
{"text":"Milkshake: uh-mazing. These are the kinds of milkshakes they rave about in old school movies. So smooth, so rich, so GOOD. As I was drinking my strawberry milkshake, I literally felt like a teenager from the 50s hanging out at the local diner before heading over to the drive-in cinema.

Rest of the food: very average. Very standard diner food. Not particularly memorable. I've definitely had better.

I would definitely come back for the milkshakes!"}
{"text":"First of all, this place had some massive portions. It had that diner feel spot on, from the colour choices to the extra friendly waitress that calls you honey and asks about your day. The food itself wasn't exceptionally great. I had the chicken and bacon panini, but it seemed more like a regular sandwich. The bread was very chewy and the chicken tastes processed. The home fries that came with my sandwich was very good though. My friend ordered a Shepard's pie that tasted quite nice. Overall, I'd come again because of the great atmosphere and I'll try something else on the menu. I'm still hopeful"}
{"text":"I don't like to kill time, I need to squeeze every second with enjoyment. 

Having 1 hour to please myself around this area gave me lot's to think about, how could I spend wisely those  60 precious minutes?

For several reasons I was sucked into the magnetism of this old fashion dinner. Do they have outdoor seating? They have a 2nd something floor with sun (and chilly winds so far)...

Breakfast menu topped with beer (always at 11... yeah, we got it Smart Serve).

Apparently they have two Universities around; don't get upset if they ask you for ID (never leave home without ID), plus feel flattered, maybe they just want to check out where are you from and what your caliber is (blink).

I was missing my mom (Marsh), so I ordered the grilled liver. Plus I want to grow my bump, so I need lots of proteins... Said that, I want to go back and try one of their attractive Breakfast.

Loved the vibe and the waiter was super friendly and effective."}
{"text":"This place has never disappointed me. It gets quite busy here, so making a reservation for a larger group is a must. The diner itself is quite small and cramped. I recently had the corned beef hash with home fries, toast, and eggs over-easy, and it was pretty decent."}
{"text":"I was a bit weary coming here with the dimly lit Yelp stars, but had a great lunch experience!  It's a great place for a large group as they can put together enough tables to accommodate 10+ people.  There were tons of choices on the menu, including some Asian dishes which I wouldn't recommend.  I find that Asian food is never good at a diner, and this place is no exception.  My coworker had the orange chicken and didn't like it very much.  The waitress was fast and friendly.

Fran's Lunch Special $8 \"Your choice of tuna salad wrap, bruschetta with cheese, or Fran's Western Sandwich with any lunch-sized daily soup or salad.\" - I went with the Western Sandwich and cream of tomato soup and it was good for diner food.  The Western Sandwich is a chopped ham, onions and peppers, and 3 large eggs omelette sandwich.  The soup was good, but it could have been hotter instead of luke warm.  The egg was a bit bland in the sandwich."}
{"text":"I came here with my friend for brunch on a Sunday and it was pretty busy. Luckily we were a party of two so we only waited about 10 minutes. I've always wanted to come here ever since they debuted their thanksgiving waffle at CNE. 

I ordered eggs Florentine with extra hollandaise sauce and my friend ordered fish tacos. The wait for the food wasn't too bad, about 15mins. My friend enjoyed her fish tacos and I thought my dish was pretty standard. It was good but nothing special. The server we had was really pleasant though so i would definitely come back for the service."}
{"text":"I believe this is the original Frans location in Toronto. My mom and dad (who were married in 1952) used to frequent this place shortly after they met.  
I remember them having their condiments on a lazy susan type device (which I loved as a kid).  
Their hamburgers are absolutely delish.  The fries are great, and if you go there for brunch their coffee will blow you away.
This place holds a special place in my heart because of my mom and dad, but that aside, it's an awesome restaurant with an old school feel and great food."}
{"text":"First time here and we order the big breakfast. The pancake was average. The over easy eggs was pretty good. The fries was crunch and turkey sausage was dried. Overall the food is very average. When we got inside the restaurant there was a lady waiting. We waited for 3 min the lady left because no one seated her. We waited another minute before we got a table. There was 4 to 5 table open and no one come and seat you for 5 min. This is not good. Not a big fan of this place but I could come again but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"Every time I come to Fran's I'm pleasantly surprised by the quality and quantity of their food. They cover all three meals (breakfast,  lunch and dinner) with countless options to choose from, offer a selection of apps/snacks, and desserts as well. Nothing is overpriced here, especially considering how much food they give you; the plates are massive! I generally split one dish with whoever I'm with since there's simply no way that I'd be able to finish an order on my own. 

During my most recent visit, I got the big breakfast (at 11ish pm aha) to share. It includes: 2 eggs, bacon, 2 breakfast sausages, homefries, 2 pancakes,  and toast. All that for about $16 after tax and tip! It tasted great!  They did butter the toast without asking me,  so if you want your toast un-buttered, its probably best to specify that. The waitress was also super nice too!

In the past I've ordered their mozzarella sticks,  poutine, chicken fingers,  and quesedilla....all were great,  and I would definitely order them again.

Frans offers practically any food you could think of, at any time of the day! I'll definitely be back again :)"}
{"text":"Fran's feels comfortable.  It's nothing flashy but it's clean and decently maintained such that it doesn't feel trashy.  After visiting Fran's for years, I've picked this location as probably the best of the 3 that are within walking distance of each other.

It has the best combination of service, cleanliness and speed.  I'd rate the Fran's locations the following:

1. Victoria St 
2. Front St.
3. College St.

Victoria and College St. locations are 24 hours.

The best part of Fran's is consistency.  Until they changed their Corn Beef Hash, I always knew what to expect when coming to Fran's.  The crisp home fries, the slightly stale piece of fruit and Sriracha sauce are always there when you want them.   I usually default to the eggs benedict (traditional with ham, or sometimes with Chicken).  I've also tried the breakfast steak and vegetarian omelette.  None of the dishes are mind-blowing but they're tasty and just what you would expect.  If you've tasted a Benny or omelette before, this won't really be much different.  The steak was hit or miss.  At the Victoria st. location, it was always cooked medium well, but at the Front st. location it kept on arriving rare (so I just eventually ate it rare).

Service is good and coffee is always refilled promptly and without even asking.  Sometimes the food might be a tad slow but it has never been a terribly long wait.

The only weird thing at this location is that you have to go into what seems like another venue to use the washrooms.  You're going to feel like you shouldn't be there but just keep on going and avoid eye contact with anyone on the other side of the doors."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with lab.
Good service. Ordered the orange chicken. Good serving size, sufficient for lunch.
Chicken and vegetable were cooked well.. Orange pieces seemed to have been removed from can and simply put as garnish.. fine for flavor, but their temperature was off-putting. 
A lot of options in the menu. 
Not many options for beer, especially on tap.. Supervisor wasn't happy."}
{"text":"I would give this establishment one star, yet three of the five people in my party enjoyed their meals. I, however, was very excited to try their \"vegetarian rainbow Benedict.\" After reading the ingredients, it sounded appealing, and I figured that this city is probably a good place to get this type of dish (Benedicts seem to be on every breakfast menu, and I ordered the eggs florentine at Sunset Grill which was very good), yet I knew something was odd when I saw the plate. The eggs looked odd-certainly not like a typical poached egg. They were probably cooked in some sort of mold. Upon breaking into the first egg, I noticed it was mostly solid on the inside. I didn't even need to try it to know it was overcooked. The other was even more overcooked. To make matters worse, the vegetables that accompanied it were all undercooked, and did not blend well together at all. The spinach was raw (a pet peeve of mine in a dish like this). However, I must commend them on the side potatoes, which were perfectly cooked and seasoned. I hope I don't sound snobbish, yet when a restaurant has several Benedict dishes on their menu (I believe there were four or five here), one would expect that the chefs can prepare the dish properly. I can cook a poached egg and I don't have any formal training. I was just disappointed really. On the bright side, two of the dishes in my party were apparently good-goat's cheese omelette and something with lox (I can't remember what). All in all, the quality of the food was certainly not worth the steep price."}
{"text":"It's an institution, so I'm told. The menu is massive and the food is better than one would expect from a 24/7 establishment and not overly priced. They make two kinds of chili here, meat & vegetarian, and both are quite good. The standard sandwiches, burgers and meat loaf are also satisfying. Service can be hit-and-miss, depending on who your server is. Okay, it's a diner...I get it."}
{"text":"We had gone to Fran's for brunch before heading to the Caribana parade during that weekend. My go to brunch meal is usually chicken and waffles which is exactly just what I got from Fran's. What I really liked about their chicken and waffles was that the portion was a size decent enough for me to finish. It came with three chicken wings as opposed to a big slab of fried chicken which I preferred but I think one more wing would have been perfect. The waffles was great because I don't like my waffles to crunchy and it was the perfect texture. Our waitress (who sadly I can't remember her name but she was Irish and just a doll) was super helpful in helping us get information on going to the parade since we were from out of town. It was nice to also know that Fran's is 24 hours though we didn't end up going late night.

Also I ended up eating all my friend's home fries because they were little potato heaven of goodness."}
{"text":"I first recognized Fran's when I was staying at a Day's Inn on College and Fran's was a block away and was open 24 hours. This new one, on Front, isn't open 24/7 but it is a new addition to the downtown dining scene that isn't yet another Irish pub.

I tried a late-night breakfast platter of eggs and peameal bacon. They let me switch the home fries to french fries and I was happy with that. However, the fries reeked of frozen and definitely didn't have much taste going for them. Actually most of the platter didn't. It was all so-so and I might have done better at Golden Griddle.

The saving grace of the restaurant is the beer selection. Surprisingly alongside the usual Molson crap, was a tap of Hop City Barking Squirrel which was kind of like a Newcastle and one of my personal favs, Mill St. Belgian Wit. That really surprised me since most bars in town, if they offer Mill St. at all, offer the Tankhouse Ale and while that is good, the Belgian Wit is exceptional. That's what brought me in. The food was secondary.

Service is hit or miss and the WiFi actually bleeds in from Biff's next door. Thankfully, there's no password since I was working on website projects while dining and drinking there.

Overall, not a great place to dine. Better to drink. And maybe that's the point. The food is so weak that you need strong beer to balance it all out!"}
{"text":"I've experienced that same Fish & Chips before and unfortunately it was during a BAD experience with Pickle Barrel.  

I thought it would be nice to get a FRAN'S Fish & Chips which is a part of Fran's Favourite category.  If that was one of Fran's Favourite than I think I have to question Fran's taste.

Have you ever tasted DRY Pollock before?  Simply look at McD's Fish O' Fillet and cut inside then you'll understand how dry it was.  I was home around an hour after and realized that a piece of the Fish was stuck to my TEETH like floss.

GOOD side of the dish was that there was definitely enough to feed a FULL grown Adult because there's a warehouse load of Fries.  I liked the Cole Slaw side which was the most flavourful part of the meal much needed to offset the BLAND Fish & Chips.

The Rice & Raisin Pudding was a better CHOICE that took the flavour of Fish & Chips meal away.  I do realize this is an Eggs & Bacon place where people chat over a hot cup of JOE rather than a dinner place, but I wished that Fran's Favourite could have been one of mine as well."}
{"text":"I have been to the other Fran's locations several times, and I've almost always had an enjoyable meal. Last night, after a late movie at the Carlton theatre, I finally decided to try the Fran's on College Street. 

I should begin my review by stating that I fully understand that Fran's is a chain of diners and neither the food nor the service should be expected to \"wow\" its patrons. That said, the meal that I ordered last night was terrible. I had to send it back, and I had no interest in giving them a chance to make it better. Worse still, although the server took the entree off of my bill, she still charged me for my iced tea. Not exactly stellar service...

I think that the nicest Fran's is the one of Front Street. I'll stick to that location from now on..."}
{"text":"The Ambiance of school that fifties Diner sort of feel and the staff do some singing which is fun but I gave it three stars cuz the food isn't really up to pair being downtown and next to Dundas Square you think the fair would be high quality but it's just diner food"}
{"text":"Fran's premium breakfast.

SO yummy. 

Service was great. Had a very helpful gentleman and he was just so polite. Cheap!"}
{"text":"Yum!! If you want breakfast portion sizes for your money then visit Fran's. Fran's has a diner atmosphere, which I wasn't' expecting, but it was still neat. Breakfast was good, service is very fast and customer service was good. I'd go back!"}
{"text":"Most time is good. The odd time get a bad server. Got a plate with weird scratches and it looked like dirt. But 9 time out of 10 the food is good"}
{"text":"I have been to Fran's for brunch but never for dinner so last Thursday, a girlfriend and I decided to go for a quick dinner here as this location was close to Eaton Centre. I have to say in terms of location, I prefer this location over the Yonge and College location. 
The food here is good and if you are craving for some comfort food, this is a place to consider. However, why I say it is a two star versus a three star (which is typically my rating for places I consider average and good go to places) is really due to the service my girlfriend and I received. This place is a busy place so I don't have a high expectation for service. So when we entered the restaurant, the hostess was friendly and we got seated. Where the disconnect was really our server. I understand it is busy, but I do expect some level of professional service. Why I say this? Don't get me wrong, our server was not rude in anyway - but her body language and the way she talked to us gave me a very rush feeling as if she was saying \"come on, hurry it up and make your order, eat and get out of here...\" For example, we were finished with our entrees and she asked us whether we wanted desert and we said no. When we didn't order any desert, she took the menu away and gave us the bill. NOTE, when we haven't even asked for the bill or even mentioned the bill. 
Maybe I will come back, maybe not, I am not sure whether I would consider this as one of my go to places for comfort food anymore."}
{"text":"Visited Frans on a Sunday and ordered an eggs benedict and recieved an egg that was not poached. The egg came fried and when the waitress was asked about it, she advised that it was how it is supposed be. Worst part of the dish however was the fruit that came with the dish. I received one strawberry, one melon and one orange slice. To make the dish even more terrible than it was, the fruit was NOT fresh. I am not a person to argue, so I left the dish as is and left after advising the waitress who didn't seem to care.
Busy place and has the old diner look, but the food is outdated as the ambience."}
{"text":"I love that this place is open 24 hours a day, great to go to after a long night out or for breakfast! There are so many different items on the menu that I never end up getting the same thing twice. Last time I went I had the chicken parmigiana sandwich with a side salad, really filling and tasty! The sauce and baguette were both a nice consistency and it was just the right amount of cheesy goodness. Chicken was a bit dry but the rest of the dish was yummy."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now, both times the service was excellent. They're very efficient and fast with their service, even if it's close to midnight!
Their sliders were amazing and they have a pretty big menu so even if you're picky, you'll probably find something! Their opening hours are so convenient, good for lunch, dinner or drunkness hunger.

I also love the look of the place, traditional diner style, very cute!"}
{"text":"I like the style and menu of all Fran's. However, this location has a serious lack in service. I've been twice now and both times the server seemed like they'd rather go home than be anywhere near the place. Which is unfortunate. Food was still good, just don't get a side of bacon, you get 3 slices for a ridiculous price."}
{"text":"I've dined at Fran's many times and can't believe I've never written a review for it

As usual for weekend breakfast at Fran's, it was quite busy and looked packed. Thank goodness we were seated within 10 minutes because we were starving. 

Anyways, I've been to this location a couple of times and service has always been fast and food always tastes good. I built my own vegetarian omelette with onions, red peppers, olives, and cheddar cheese. It tasted good but not anything like my mama's omelette. It also came with a side of homefries which were delicious--just the perfect amount of crunchiness on the outside and tenderness on the inside. As for the toast, we'll, you can't screw up on that. My boyfriend got the breakfast with scrambled eggs, bacon, homefries, and toast which he also enjoyed. For drinks, I got the piña colada smoothie which was everythinggggg--it was so delicious that I'd go back just for one of them. My boyfriend got the strawberry banana smoothie which was so mediocre compared to the piña colada one (even his picky self agreed). The only thing I thought was so stupid was that for every ingredient you pick out of the omelette, you get charged $3! I was initially going to get the vegetarian omelette listed on the menu but asked for no mushrooms and was told that it would be a $3 charge because all the veggies were already mixed together (hence why I built my own omelette). If I wasn't starving, that's something that would've been a deal breaker for me. 

As for the waitress, she was very friendly, energetic, and outgoing. I didn't get her name but she had purple hair. 

Overall, I always enjoy my time at Fran's and hope to go back more often in the future."}
{"text":"This is a cute little place. I really love this patio, it's atmosphere, and the fact that it's in the heart of downtown (close to many hotels). It's a perfect spot for a hot day because every couple of minutes a nice light water mist sprays everywhere which is soooo refreshing considering Toronto's humidity this summer. 

Another thing I really loved about this location was the customer service. Every server that attended to us was absolutely charming and extremely attentive. 

As for the food, I'd say it was mediocre. If I was rating this place solely on its food, I'd give it a 3. However, the atmosphere and customer service really helped amped its rating for me. I had a vegetarian omelette with homefries and toast, and to drink I had a mimosa. The homefries were grated potatoes (think of grated cheese) that didn't taste the best and the omelette was just ok. Let's just say that my favourite part of the meal was the mimosa. My boyfriend got scrambled eggs, bacon, homefries, and toast which he also agreed was just an average tasting meal, nothing special about it. 

Overall, I'd love to come back here to try different things from the menu."}
{"text":"Service was excellent. Their Vegetarian Rainbow Benedict was the best eggs Benedict I've ever had."}
{"text":"Standard food. Nothing overly special, but the diner does have that 50's feel to it. Great place to catch up with friends; food is nicely prepared and a good portion for what you're paying."}
{"text":"Standard diner in Toronto. Always dependable. Food portions are large. Service is fair. I've been here a few times and it's nothing fancy but consistent. Good standard brunch fare. Large seating area. Prices are not that high which makes it attractive"}
{"text":"Fran's is the place to go for all-day breakfast! I've been here a few times now and food is always consistent and service is pleasant. This location is very close to the ACC, so I suggest coming here either before or after you watch a game. I believe you can access this location from the Path so you never have to go outside. Portions are quite generous and fair for the prices.

My favourite thing to order is the chicken parmigiana sandwich with homefries! The menu is quite extensive so I'm hoping to try different things next time i go back."}
{"text":"Service was slow! After finally being served I decided to go with the \"Spicy\" chicken and waffles! After about 45 minutes of waiting for our food, I received over cooked chicken wings topped with green onions!!! The chicken was far from spicy furthermore had any seasoning on it and the waffles were ok! Not my best experience at Fran's!"}
{"text":"Our family really enjoyed Fran's on our recent trip to Toronto from the US.  We would not consider it a funky or eclectic diner, but a really good basic diner.  For breakfast, it was fantastic...super yummy pancakes and the other egg dishes looked great.  They have a pretty large lunch/dinner menu too.  Service was pretty quick even when it was packed."}
{"text":"Finally decided to visit and see what this place was all about since it's been in the area longer than I can remember.  

Ordered fish and chips..  Substituted regular fries for sweet potato fries.  

The beer battered cod fish was pretty good, but the fries I payed extra for were a little small and shriveled for what it was.  

My boyfriend enjoyed the steak and fries he had but I don't think we will be returning in no hurry.   The bill with 2 coffees(refillable)came up to around $50.  A little much but I guess it's downtown and they gotta pay the rent somehow to stay afloat.  

Was it worth it?  Meh, I beg to differ."}
{"text":"The best restaurant in Canada bible. Best aesthetic. Best food. It's like the cheesecake factory but better. Extremely consistent, fairly priced, with a huge menu! I will never stop going to Frans"}
{"text":"Actually, I would like to give Fran's on College Street 3.5 stars, mainly because I have been there many times in the past and have almost always had a decent meal for a decent price.

So this past Sunday, I was out late and decided to go back, probably the first time for this year. It wasn't as busy as it sometimes is, so it was less loud inside than usual. The service was okay but I have had better; my server seemed to be in a hurry all the time. The décor is definitely retro, a real old-fashioned diner feel, with floats and milkshakes and big pieces of pie for dessert.

I decided on a sandwich and chose the Triple Decker Reuben; corned beef / Swiss cheese / sauerkraut on three slices of marble rye bread with fries (which also could have been home fries or tortilla chips). Pretty good, the rye was very nice, and the sauerkraut gave it a nice tangy flavour. Total bill was $14, so also not bad.

Overall, a decent meal once again, certainly good enough for late-night fare when not too many places are open. I have had many late-night breakfasts there, and they are generally better than the dinner fare. The Maple Leaf breakfast with eggs / maple sausages / baked beans and the corned beef hash are both very good choices."}
{"text":"My friend and I recently went to eat at the Fran's on Front Street; this was my first time eating-in, although I have had take-out from this location a few times. Much like the other two locations, it is an old-fashioned diner, although this one seems maybe a little more upscale and is open late but not 24hrs. It is located on the ground floor of a tall glass and steel residential building, with an outdoor covered patio. The section that we sat in has mostly booths, with some tables and chairs along the wall, and a full bar with seating near the front door. There was a tv near our table (which required me to explain the finer points of Indy car racing) and two more at the bar, and there was music playing not too loudly in the background. It was not very busy at the time, so the service was pretty quick.

The menu is the same as for the other Fran's locations: all-day breakfast, sandwiches, salads, burgers, desserts. I ordered the Morning Glory, which is one large waffle with eggs and bacon and caramelized apples, and a strawberry float. My friend had the Eggs Blackstone, which is Eggs Benedict with salmon instead of peameal bacon, and a cup of herbal tea. All the food was fine, but nothing special, although I particularly enjoyed the float. Our total bill was $39 for two. Overall, another decent meal in pleasant surroundings."}
{"text":"Fran's is an establishment founded in 1940 and is considered a landmark for most Torontonians. Open 24 hours, it caters to the morning crowd or those looking to mix up their meal options in the downtown core.

I'm ashamed to admit this but I've worked 9 years in the down town core and I've only now visited fran's.  SORRY FRAN.

I order the western omelet (peppers, onions,cheese and ham) with a side of home fries and toast.

The omelet was not very warm or flavourful and a bit sad looking (presentation wise). The home fries were hot, crispy and piled high. A surprising redemption for a not so marvelous meal.

Unfortunately, delicious home fries are not enough to draw me back. If I ever have a late night carb attack I will consider venturing down this path again."}
{"text":"This rating is just for their benedict because thats the only thing I have there. They easily have the best hollandaise recipe in the whole city. Hands down."}
{"text":"The rooftop patio is nice. The first floor has a nice armosphere too. It's a nice place to get a brunch. The menu options are good and i really recommend the milkshake."}
{"text":"This is one of my favourites -- I always come back when I'm at a loss for where else to eat! I love coming here with groups or with a friend or two. There are always lots of options for food, whether it's a snack or a meal. The snacks are great for sharing, especially since they can be a bit on the pricey side. I also really love the grilled cheese here.

The waiting staff here have all been really polite and friendly -- they're great about splitting the bill if you're in a big group. Also -- if you go to the bathroom, take a peek at the bar/lounge behind the main store. It's quite the secret escape!

All in all, Fran's is a great diner. It's basically what you expect a sleek, downtown diner to be! Well worth a stop if you're not sure what else to grab for dinner."}
{"text":"I've now been to this location twice now and I'm not sure if I will be returning again. I came here for breakfast and the food was relatively bland and there something that I was missing. 

Food: 2/5, food was what was most disappointing about this place. First time I got the Montecristo and the second time I got the egg croissant sandwich with hollandaise sauce. The Monte Christo was way too salty and The egg croissant and the sauce was extremely bland.

Service: 3/5, nothing special

Ambience: 3/5, fun decor with the 70s theme

Price: 3/5, average I guess, $15-$20 per person."}
{"text":"love Fran's for breakfast! or...  have breakfast any meal of the day.

The original decor is pretty awesome. this one has a killer location, two floors, and fun waiting staff. It's 24 hours so wether it's 4 in the morning or.. 2 in the afternoon i can always depend on Fran's to make me eggs and home fries. mmm"}
{"text":"I've never given a 1-star on Yelp because that's just sad, but Fran's (basically all locations in TO) comes pretty close in terms of food. I've been to this location multiple times in the past 6 months, most of the time for eat-in, but once for takeout. Fran's has an impressively long menu with comprehensive options accommodating everyone. Yes, it has all-day breakfast, which is a beautiful thing, but also has heart, savory lunch/dinner options, i.e. steak. My issues with the food, which truly deserves 1/5 stars imo, are that the fresh ingredients (vegetables, fruits) rarely taste or look fresh, the awkward presentation and portion distribution of certain dishes (e.g. nachoes) make the food appear unappetizing, and any natural flavors are masked by salt, sugar, and grease, which I guess what more can I expect from a chain brunch restaurant. 

They do have some vegetarian and vegan options as larger brunch places do. But definitely not healthy here, don't kid yourself. Even their salads (which I do NOT recommend since they are so measly and show very minimal effort from the kitchen) and especially their omelettes are not worthy of health stars due to grease and dressings (do a Google search of the nutritional content here). The fruit cups here are tiny and lack variety - literally a few grapes and tasteless cubes of melon. 

Comparing Fran's to Cora's, Fran's has smaller portion sizes, less wholesome and fresh ingredients (remember the huge amounts of fruit you get at Cora's?), but is much more convenient since has long hours (24 hours at some locations, but not this one. vs Cora's only opened until the afternoon).

Pros- great service here. All the waiters and waitresses I've encountered here so far have been so upbeat (even at 10PM) and attentive. Food also comes out relatively fast (within 10 mins). This Fran's also has a large venue with a bar area, booths, and giant TV screens playing mainly sports, as well as a large outdoor patio (gorgeous on summer days)."}
{"text":"Haven't been to Fran's in almost 35 years.   It hasn't changed a bit.  It was a terrible greasy spoon then and it still is.   I had the misfortune to have their celebrated Thanksgiving turkey dinner.   Swansons frozen would have been superior.  How this place has survived is beyond me.  I guess they must survive on tourist trade alone - people who would probably never return.  I certainly won't."}
{"text":"A good place to enjoy Sunday brunch if you come early enough to avoid the wait. I find the ambiance of the restaurant relaxing and friendly for the most part, although once in a while you may get a waitress that is a bit aloof. I've only had breakfast there, but based on that, I'd say that their food is generally okay -- while not the best brunch in the city, it does the trick. One menu item that I would strongly recommend avoiding though is the vegetarian sausages -- they are rubbery, dry and greatly overpriced."}
{"text":"Servers were rude and quoted us the wrong wait time and the food was terrible. Everything was over cooked - we ordered chicken and waffles and the chicken was nearly burnt. We also ordered the classic big breakfast: bread was soggy and sausages were burnt as well. Would not recommend this restaurant to anyone."}
{"text":"Been here a few times, little disappointed. Food was okay but I ordered the chicken and waffles and got basically 2 chicken wings cut in half. Pretty measly for $13.99."}
{"text":"No, No and No!

I normally like Frans, but this location is horribly understaffed and under-cared for. 
My 3 friends and I were here on a Saturday night, so I understand it's going to be a little busy. 

However, we waited 15 minutes to be seated at 11:40pm. We finally sat down and asked for a pitcher of water that never came.  Our waitress hardly spoke english and had a hard time understanding us.  She was extremely stressed out so we did our best to work with her. 
We put in our food order, which took 35 minutes to get to us! Our food was okay, so I won't complain about that. One of the guys at my table ordered 5 sliders and only received 3 of them. (The waitress never checked up on us to see how our food was, just came once to refill the draught of water at our table)

When she came back to bring us our bills, my friend was charged for all 5 sliders! I asked her if we could speak to the manager about the waiting times and incorrect charges, and she said no, because there was nothing the manager could do for me... What?! Oh my. All she did was not charge us for the 2 sliders.

We paid, and on our way out, the blonde manager was sitting at the bar doing what looking like nothing.  Our poor waitress was running around like a chicken with her head cut off and there's the manager sitting down doing nothing to help the stressed out servers.  As much as I disliked the service, I felt bad that all of the servers were being overworked. 

I won't go back here. First and last time!"}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of dinners and 50s style restaurants! So I really like Fran's.

The food is very typical of any dinner, don't expect anything special. It's a great place to go after a night out at the clubs downtown. The atmosphere is very much a dinner feel to it, I enjoyed my burger, strawberry milk shake and cheese cake."}
{"text":"This is our go to when we stay in Toronto for breakfast. It's fast, it's tasty and if you have a wicked hangover, they will treat you right."}
{"text":"I don't even know where to start. Our waitress, Liz, was extremely rude and downright unprofessional.
1) I asked politely if I could get a substitute for bacon and sausage in my breakfast item, as I do not eat meat, and received almost no accommodation. No extra pancake, not even fruit, after negotiation I finally managed to get a couple slices of tomato. She also offered an extra egg but that was no help since she stated it was mutually exclusive with the tomato.
2) I asked for my eggs loose (in fact I had to repeat myself), and they came in overcooked.
3) The food came but our silverware was nowhere in sight, leaving us staring at our food like puppies. 
4) We talked to the manager and got little acknowledgement. Very unapologetic, he claimed that they had a large volume of customers, and that \"every child in town was here\". If too many customers is an issue, don't worry, the quality of your service should resolve that problem. 
5) When the waitress brought my food. I asked if I would also get tomatoes, to which she replied that they had added an egg and I would have to switch. Without leaving time to reply, she tried to tug the plate OUT of my hands - to switch my already made 3 scrambled eggs to 2! Cheapest move I've ever witnessed in a restaurant.
6) And finally the cherry on cake. As she was removing our plates, the waitress dropped a knife on one of my friends, and did not even acknowledge what happened or apologize in any way! That was unquestionably mean and inappropriate.

Well there it is, if you plan to brunch there, I wish you best of luck."}

1. Lackluster, disinterested, poor service, by first server, when I chose not to buy booze.

2. More bad service by second server, who I was passed on to.

3. \"Would you like a minute to order\" ..as I was being handed the menu.

4. Getting a partial order....not everything that comes with the so-called meat loaf.

5. Getting a STEAK knife with the meatloaf, what an ill portend!

6. The cook used too many tablespoons of garlic in the meat loaf.

7. I got the potatoes but no vegetables.

8. Did not know if the gravy on the meatloaf was gravy or re-cycled motor oil.

9. When asked how everything was and I responded 'crappy', the server just left. 

10. I had ZERO energy before the theatre to address the manager.

11. I will never come back. BEWARE."}

{"text":"Ordered a Benedict. Eggs were hard. Asked for new ones. Took 45 minutes. Never again."}
{"text":"open 24/7/365-- can't argue with that! this is my and my husband's go-to place because there's never a wait and you don't have to worry about it being closed. the food is average-- sometimes better or worse depending on the day. i think overall this location is better than the one on victoria. try the home fries, they're 100x better than the regular fries (which happen to be very very bland). the breakfast foods also happen to be very good."}
{"text":"24 hour diners are generally good places due to their convenience, and Fran's is not an exception.  They have a good sized menu, with all the foods you would hope to get at a diner.  This includes things like all day breakfast (decent), grilled cheese (meh),  sandwiches (good), burgers (good) and milkshakes (excellent, even better if you add a banana!)  They also have some Asian food on the menu, but this stuff is very minimal.

The staff here is pretty good, but it's obvious that they deal with a lot of annoying drunk college kids, and as such, certain waitstaff is prone to rolling the eyes and not taking you seriously.

The feel inside the restaurant is an old fashion diner feel, with lots of booths and bright overhead lights."}
{"text":"I liked Fran's, was a good breakfast especially after a night of drinking. You are better off ordering the basic breakfast than some of the fancier ones as you end up paying a lot of a few pancakes or croissant. I liked the way they cook their hash browns and was also happy with my eggs and bacon. The restaurant is larger than it looks and was able to accommodate our large party of 8. I look forward to returning to Fran's in the future."}
{"text":"Frans is your typical diner.  The nachos were mediocre and the French onion soup was just about average.   The Lakeview Diner in Toronto is way better.

The booths were also very small and tight.

Cool setup but not good enough for Diners Drivind and Dives."}
{"text":"I'm in Toronto a few times a year and I always make a point to stop in for breakfast. If you have a big appetite it can be satisfied without seriously draining your wallet. This location is open 24 hrs, so it is a great place to stop in for some poutine after a night of partying. My top picks from the menu are any breakfast that includes pancakes, and poutine. You may want to choose one or the other. I'm not sure I'd want poutine with pancakes."}
{"text":"Seriously fresh and amazing food. I ate breakfast here everyday when I was in Toronto. The prices are good and you get a large portion every time. All the servers I had were super friendly and welcoming. I wish they extended their chains to South Florida."}
{"text":"I'm a breakfast guy and this is an old fashioned breakfast place   One of the few I have found that will serve corned beef hash. That's in mind it was not 100 percent satisfactory.  One the hash was not what I have come to expect it to be over the years of having it in other places.   It was a mass of onions with slabs of CB in it.  Any other place have it in a potato mix and cut finer ... Safe to say I was not a fan of it and another issue I had was the lack of butter on the toast .... Not just mine but on the wife's to.  It was as if the chef just ran a butter knife across the toast that had only glanced at the butter dish but had never ventured in.  I'm not saying load the butter on or soak the toast in it.  But some butter would be nice to take away the dryness of the toast and add some flavor.  Over all the breakfast was decent and service was good my eggs were not prepared the way I asked And still abit under cooked. At this moment I'm jot a big fan of Fran's but willing to give it another try"}
{"text":"Its good for breakfast, the prices are reasonable i like how they are always open for those that crave breakfast late at night."}

Fran's Big Breakfast is a must if you can do it. Sausages, bacon, 2 eggs, home fries, toast, 2 pancakes....i'm sure there is more but that's all i could eat lol"}
{"text":"Such a cute restaurant! The food is good for the price you're paying and the staff is very friendly. I love the option of all day breakfast as well."}
{"text":"One of my favourite local downtown diners, friendly staff and fast service.  All day breakfast can't go wrong... I would suggest steak and eggs the home fries are delicious"}
{"text":"I like the milkshake. It's not too sweet and comes in large size. Fran's offers all-day breakfast. When I left the movie theatre nearby at night, it will still be open"}
{"text":"I was in the mood for french toast. So I ordered the strawberry/blackberry/raspberry french toast. My order came out: six triangles of white bread, dipped in eggs and fried, topped with the berries compote. No powdered sugar. Maybe they don't do powdered sugar with french toast in Canada? Ok. I was disappointed, but I could live without it. But the compote was really tart and a bit on the stingy side. I would've wanted twice or three times more compote than what they gave."}
{"text":"Nestled along many fine dining restaurants, including Biff's Bistro, O&B, and Houston Steakhouse, Fran's makes its mark by offering a quick and cheaper alternative in the district. 

From several visits, I have mixed feelings on coming back here again.
The staff are friendly. Though service can be quite slow, whether if the restaurant is busy or not. It took several attempts just to wave my waitress down to refill our water. It was not until the bill came did she bring a pitcher of water.

Fran's is best known for their breakfast and diner type food items, though there is nothing spectacular. 

Fran's Fish & Chips - Poorly executed. It was thin and tough to eat. It seemed over deep-fried as the fish appeared dark brown, more than what it should look like - golden brown. Coleslaw wasn't any better.

Fran's Philly Beef Sandwich - Cooked medium rare. This was a decent sandwich, but I had better.

Fran's Onion Soup - Melted cheese, large  garlic croutons, beefy broth and sweet onion. It was a nice starter on a cold night. Not bad, not great.

Note: Don't be fooled with food items that start with the word Fran's -. It doesn't necessarily mean it's any better than the ones you've had."}
{"text":"My rating of Fran's on College Street is based on overall convenience and offered services. It is a great place to eat breakfast in the middle of the night. Occasionally service may be slower between the hours of last call and about 4am as it can be a popular place for people to eat after bars close, this can also create a little more noise and contribute to a short line of people waiting to be seated. 

It is a retro diner, I like the scenery, and it is reliable time and time again. It is also better than Denny's or the Golden Griddle.

Coffee costs a little more than the average restaurant but has free refills on request. The downside to this are the limited sugar packets and lil coffee creamers. If they had refillable sugar pouring jars on each table and a small personal sized stainless spout full of 10% half and half cream with their coffee then I would rank Fran's on College the full 5 stars, but instead I have rated 4 based on the limited creamers and sugar packets. I usually ask for more cream and sugar with each cup. When I am eating breakfast in the middle of the night, I want to drink 3 coffees during the visit and would like to do so with a ton of sugar in my coffee and enough cream to give my cup a light complexion. Instead I ration the sugar and do what I can with the little cream that they give. 

Depending on the time of night, for example after the bars close and nothing else is open... the place might be filled with people, so a group of 4 or more may sometimes be challenging to get seated. I smoke therefore never gave a shit when this happened to me and I just hung around outside until a table became available. 

This isn't the Vatican, it's Fran's. It's a diner. You eat breakfast, or maybe burgers and fries. I rate this restaurant above average in terms of product/accessibility/reliability. I have sympathy for the people from NY who had a kitchen crew quit on their visit. That has happened to me before at another place so I can relate and can understand the hate. 

Overall this place is like an on and off again girlfriend who comes in handy every other weekend between the hours of 1:30am and 4:00am. You can't do it everyday but once in a while it does the trick and you both know you'll be back for more in a couple of weeks. Fran's is a friend with bennies and is reliable time and time again. It may never be marriage material but it will also never disappoint or let you down and will never attempt to be something it is not."}
{"text":"I have never had worse poached eggs. I was here a month ago and they came out so puck-like I felt it was looking at the eggs from a McDonald's breakfast sandwich. But McDonald's taste better. The ones at Fran's had a chemical taste. I thought maybe I was just being too ambitious ordering poached eggs so I tried my friends scrambled eggs (if you mess that up, there's no excuse) and they too had the same chemical taste. 

I had been here before and didn't remember it being so gross. I recently went to Denny's with much lower hopes - it's Denny's after all - and while their sausages have become the tiniest little things, their poached eggs tasted much better and didn't look like pucks. If you can't even beat Denny's, why even bother putting them on your menu?"}
{"text":"We found Fran's on a trip to Toronto and well surprisingly blown away! Food was just fabulous with a 50's diner-type feel. Excellent variety of food, which was well prepared to our specifications. All over great service and experience!

It's been over a year since our last trip to Toronto; however we continually long for the most fabulous Monte Cristo! YUM!"}
{"text":"This is the go-to place after partying in the entertainment district!!
Food is always decent, however nothing to brag about.

As a party of four we shared their infamous Pulled pork poutine;melt in your mouth curd cheese drizzled all over the mixed french fries and sweet tender pulled pork. 4/5 in my books for taste

Then their Frans cheddar cheese burger was delightful, big portion, thick juice meat, served with crisp fries.  3.5/5

The waiter was helpful, but a bit slow, however due to Halloween parties coming to an end in the AM, the place was packed!"}
{"text":"Before seeing the hilarious Craig Ferguson, we decided to grab a quick drink and bite on this 'classic' diner's patio before the show.

It was 45 minutes before the food arrived; we had advised we were seeing a show before we ordered.  We were almost late for the show.  We actually ordered the special and pre-paid the bill to save time.

The steak was luke warm, flavourless and well done, though we ordered it medium rare.  The vegetables and potatoes were tasty but cold.  We didn't complain... didn't have time to send the steak back!

And it was likely because service was slow... won't be back... unless I'm offered a free and properly cooked steak."}
{"text":"Simple, local diner. Our party of 3 came here on a Friday night and they were about three quarters full. Coffee and water refills and general checkups were frequent which was nice.

Everyone at our table got something different, a sandwich, a breakfast meal and steak. All the food was on par, and nothing too special. The only issue I had with the whole meal was that their food didn't really seem that warm. It was definitely cooked thoroughly, but it never felt fully hot, which wasn't to my liking.

I'd probably come back out of convenience, but not particularly for their food or service, as neither were that exceptional."}
{"text":"After bar hopping on a Saturday night, this is the place to be, whether you're drunk or not! 
I've been to the other locations; college st, as well as Victoria, this place is a lot cleaner, and less grungier. This time I decided to have the Pull pork poutine! mmmm totally worth it! Lots of gravy topped and loaded with plenty of fries, cheese, and pulled pork.  The smokey flavors of the pork really helped diversify this dish...defintely pure comfort food!
my buddy decided to have their chicken sandwich which was not bad, nor was it OVER the top."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with my friend yesterday. It's a cute, diner-like place, which reminded me of being in an old movie (in a good way). They have a pretty large breakfast menu, along with the traditional soups, sandwiches, wraps and salads you would expect to find at a diner. Their home fries are probably one of my favourites."}
{"text":"I have been to Fran's a few times and have enjoyed the food. However, this evening I dined upstairs and have been disappointed in the service. It is not busy with plenty of open tables, and we have been waiting over 45 minutes for our order. If this is the best club sandwich I eat in my life, I'll update this review."}
{"text":"Fran's feels like a diner and yet it's not. It's open super late. I've been here at least 3 times now whenever I go to Toronto. I love the food here. I've tried their omelettes, steak benedict, baked 5-cheese macaroni, and nachos please.  Good service."}
{"text":"I ate here at around 9 PM on Friday, June 3. The last time I ate at this Fran's location was probably five years ago but I remembered it fondly. The first thing I noticed when I walked in was that there has been no upkeep or maintenance. Every surface is grimy and the seat covers are torn and dirty. I had a burger and my friend had a chicken and avocado sandwich. Service was fine at first - we were seated quickly, but the place wasn't busy so no kudos deserved for that. Our orders were brought out less than five minutes after we ordered. The food was obviously not fresh. The burger was cold and had an off flavor and taste. The bread on my friend's sandwich was starting to dry at the corners. The fries were stale.
I was so hungry that it only occurred to me how bad the food was after I was already halfway through. It seems that the staff are well aware of the garbage being served; we sat there for a half hour after we were done and were roundly ignored. On the 10th try, we finally managed to flag down our server to ask for the bill. He didn't ask how our meal was; like I said, I'm sure they know they're serving stale garbage."}
{"text":"Breakfast items (especially the banana pancakes) = to die for. Amazing... u wont be disappointed. Big breakfast was great 


Lunch/dinner items = generic and underwhelming . Nothinng amazing, not terrible. They are bland... ex. the chicken parmigiana... cheese wasn't even melted, and the chicken was thin, tasteless, and barely even breaded, it was cold... breading not even sticking to the chicken , falling apart. 

Stick to what they do best - breakfast."}
{"text":"I have been going to Fran's ever since I moved downtown. This 24 hour diner serves your classic fare with all day breakfast and hearty staples (ie. burgers, nachos, and fries)

My go-to order is a bowl of chilli and the nachos. The nachos are topped with enough cheese, papersolives and the salsa/sour cream is served on the side. The chilli is always meant to compliment the nachos, as the nachos are often dipped to ensure the tomatoey awesomeness in a bite.

My second go-to-order is the shepherd's pie. Served in a round pan with a side of green beans, it is comfort food in every bite.

The chocolate milkshake is easily the best milkshake I've had in Toronto. If you are in deserving of such a chocolatey treat, order one at Frans - they are made fresh and it is easily the creamiest thickest chocolatey dessert :)

Frans has two floors - the main floor with little cart seats and the downstairs basement with additional seating."}
{"text":"Fran's is a typical diner that's right by Yonge & College and close to College station. I went once for a buddy's birthday. 

They have a bar which is nice with Mill St. PBR and I think Heineken on tap. Unexpected for a diner. 

They have an all day breakfast and I had breakfast for lunch, I ordered the pancakes which were nice and tasted pretty good but the price was pretty steep. I paid $10 including tip for pancakes, seemed a bit expensive. 

I'm not a diner person and typically avoid them but for what it is Fran's isn't bad."}
{"text":"Was so excited to go to Fran's because of their breakfast selection. So we decided to head there for brunch. It was a mistake. Other than the company, it was not enjoyable. The service (other than our waiter) was very unfriendly. A yelper had mentioned that but I brushed it off thinking it was a bad day at work for the employees there. Apparently that's not the case. Every face was frowning. Everyone seemed like they didn't want to be there. Our waiter was ok. He did his job. But that's about it. 

The food. No thank you. Everything tasted bland. Nothing had any flavor to it. The food came cold. Even the kids did not enjoy simple foods like grilled cheese and pancakes. Grilled cheese looked toasted rather than grilled. It was dry, barely any cheese and tasted stale. The pancakes were flat and chewy. Eggs Benny (which I usually LOVE) had no flavor. English muffin was stale. Hollandaise might as well been mayonnaise. My husbands sandwich was your average sandwich. Nothing special about it. The poutine came cold. Gravy was pure salt. The food LOOKED way more appetizing than the taste. 

It's too bad though. The location was nice, restaurant was clean and big. But what's important is the service and food and neither of them were acceptable."}
{"text":"Not bad. This is a cute little diner with lots of seating. We came here immediately after a concert tonight at Massey Hall, as it is right across the street. We were seated immediately and our server came over a few minutes later. 

My mom ordered the portobello panini with sweet potato fries and I got the burger version. I had a pretty intense migraine so I only glazed over the menu, so we were shocked to see that our portobello mushrooms were deep fried! Welp, forget our attempt to be healthy. But I have to admit, I kind of liked it, although I wish they would have drained the oil off a bit better. My burger was topped with apple slices ( I enjoyed the crunch) and typical burger fixings. 

The fries were your typical frozen shoe-string style, and they were very generous with the portion size. This place became packed pretty quickly because of the concert across the street but the staff appeared to be getting food out ridiculously quick. 

Overall, this was a pretty decent dining  experience."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.

Experienced Upper Deck by Fran's on a Friday noon. Service was quick as the place was pretty empty. Got a burger (forgot the name) with a side of Caesar salad and I was pretty satisfied - it was packed so fully that it was difficult to eat without spilling.

Will likely be coming back as it's super close to work."}
{"text":"----- 3.5 Stars! -----

I've walked by Fran's at least hundreds of times and yet I had never gone in. I just thought it was a really grungy old diner that never really appealed to me. Well finally I was forced inside to meet a couple friends before starting on a quest for a good a night out and I was pleasantly surprised about this place.

First off they are open ALL THE TIME (literally) and they have a HUGE menu (that looks classier than the actual place) that serves something for everyone. Prices are okay but I didn't find any of the food that we got to be much better than late night grub.

Fran's is a great hangout place but definitely not a restaurant you should looking at planning to come to."}
{"text":"Mediocrity sums this place up nicely. I agree with Terry P. about the value lacking. I didn't taste anything other than cheddar and maybe a little jack in the mac & cheese. I thought the bowl was small for the price, maybe the burgers are the way to go? The Pina Colada was really good, but on the smaller side for $4. The waiter was good, tended to me, made sure I was happy. I tipped well for that. However, I will say I was glad there was a Tims across the street for a dessert."}
{"text":"We came here on a Saturday afternoon and it was super busy.

Everyone at our table got something different and we were all satisfied with our orders. Coffee and water refills were consistent, and our food came pretty quickly. I got the Western omelette and it was pretty good but a tiny bit bland. The home fries made it worth it.

Our waiter was extremely friendly and checked up on us often to make sure we were doing okay. Standard diner breakfast food, big portions, super friendly service. Would come again if I were in the area."}
{"text":"Wow, probably the worst sandwich I've ever had. The bread was chewy, the steak was cold, fries were cold. Terrible, never going back here."}
{"text":"I found the server to be polite and the food was good. I wouldn't say anything is spectacular, price is a little high but I suppose your paying for location so. Overall it was good but not 4 or 5 star quality."}
{"text":"Got the cajun chicken fajitas which came out steaming hot. Pretty tasty,but wish i had one more shell haha. Hot apple pie was ordered for dessert and it was very disappointing."}
{"text":"Fran's always comes through!!!  
great atmosphere,  great food,  great place!! Friendly staff,  as always,  andnthe menu is quite diverse so coming back numerous times is a must!"}
{"text":"Came here late night. Old stale meat in my sandwich.  Even the bread was tough. The breakfast items which my friends had are still ok. Avoid this place unless you like stale dry food. A street side pizza shops have better products."}
{"text":"It is a great place to eat, any time of the day. I have had their breakfast, lunch, and dinner -- numerous times. Love that they are open 24/7 and that their food is just delicious."}
{"text":"Restaurant de type \"le passé avec le jukebox\".

Il n'y avait plus de place au rez-de-chaussée alors l'hôtesse nous a dirigées vers le sous-sol en nous disant de ne pas s'en faire, que c'est bien éclairé. 

En effet, bien éclairé par des ampoules électriques, on se sentait un peu comme dans une caverne. En plus, la table se trouvait pratiquement dans le chemin de la clientèle et des gens qui faisaient le service. J'aurais préféré attendre un peu plus longtemps en sachant que tout le monde serait plus confortable. C'est okay d'avoir 3 tables en moins pour que les gens puissent circuler et respirer mieux!

Pas très cher et efficace - sauf le (mauvais) café, d'ailleurs, pourquoi les cafés ne sont pas inclus dans le prix des assiettes déjeuners ? Oh well. 

J'ai commandé le \"Energy Breakfast\": croissant, jambon, 3 ufs brouillés et beaucoup de fromage par dessus, tout ca avec des p'tites patates qui goûtent la tendresse. Pas de flafla, pas de
décorations en fruits ni de confettis. C'était bon, sans grimper au plafond.

Le service: excellent. Les serveurs.ses avaient vraiment notre bien-être à cur (ou iels font vraiment bien semblant). Super expérience.

Salutations à la serveuse qui a lancé un regard dégoûté à un client qui souhaitait changer de place avec sa famille à cause des démonstrations d'affection de ma blonde et moi. La famille a pu changer de table, grand bien leur fasse, mais le patriarche n'avait probablement pas compris qu'on était dans le village gay de Toronto et aussi en 2018. OUPE ! 

Seul hic, on a été servies après des gens qui avaient commandé un bon moment après nous alors que nos assiettes étaient similaires. On avait vraiment faim alors peut-être que ça nous a paru plus long qu'en réalité. Un peu décevant quand même.

Une expérience correcte dans l'ensemble, mais je n'y retournerai pas en courant lors de ma prochaine visite à Toronto."}
{"text":"You can't fault the diner for being clean and well, diner-like in its decor. I think I like the concept of a diner more than the idea of eating in one! At any rate, I found myself looking for a quick dinner. I ordered the chili which apparently has not changed since 1948. Same ingredients. I did ask what that meant: do they cook it in lard? Using the same methodology as 1948? What are these ingredients? The server had no clue and had to go back and check. In the end, I ordered it. It was ok.

I don't think I will come back. They definitely do need to better educate their servers on what the dishes are and what's in them. I'm sure most are no brainers but when you advertise on the menu the recipe has not changed since 1948, it will not hurt to be prepared to answer related questions."}
{"text":"I find this diner unappealing, unappetizing and bland. Unfortunately, I always come with others. Others who refuse to eat better.

The dishes are large and eating them bloats you up. I refuse to eat any of their large meals. Even people who allege are hungry take one look and barely finish the meal.

I dislike the way they cook their scrambled eggs.

And their coffee....I am deeply disappointed they don't serve milk! They bring out a little bowl with creamers and milk portion control cups. Ugh. So disappointing."}
{"text":"I came here recently for breakfast. I ordered the 2 eggs dish (small dish, I hate large breakfast dishes). I ordered the eggs scrambled and they were dry. Finding a place that can cook scramble eggs is difficult!  The home fries were ok. Toast was meh.

The service left a lot to be desired. The hostess sourly showed me to the table, which was next to the door. Being sick, I didn't want to deal with a draft the entire time, so I asked for another table. She took me to the booths. 

Now, I am not fat but I felt I didn't fit in the table!  The space between booth and table is very constrictive! I felt the space was closing in. With 3 more people coming, I couldn't bear the thought of staying there. I asked if there was anything else available and I was told no. Fine.

Eventually, another table opened up and after it was cleaned, I moved there. But absolutely no acknowledgement from the hostess who knew I wanted to move.

The service was slow and inattentive. The server walked slowly to her tables. I got served water, so I cannot complain. Each time one of the party arrived, she would eventually make her way to us and take our drink order.

By the time all 4 of us were present, she ignored us. She kept slowly waiting her other tables. Someone in my party had to flag her to get our orders because she had no inclination to serve us.

I know I was difficult. I had a massive congestion and felt lousy but I still retained polite demeanour. But their service is inexcusable."}
{"text":"I came here with some friends a couple weeks ago as a party of 8. This place is SUPER busy on a weekend. The food was OK (3/5) in taste. Service was really slow, which was expected, given the condition of the restaurant. The portion size was only good if you ordered the big breakfast or  the 8 oz. steak and eggs. Others within my group ordered the chicken and waffles (ridiculously tiny portion). Prices were decent - expect to spend $8-15 per person.

We had someone check on us to ask us how we found the food RIGHT after it was served (not really much opportunity to taste it). Besides that, they didn't check on us. One of us in the group asked for an additional iced tea before we got the bill...they forgot to bring it. We had asked for all the bills to be separate - when they arrived,  they got the bills all wrong. From looking at the receipts, it was just kind of randomized: some bills had multiple meals and no drinks, some bills had all drinks and no meals (but every person ordered a drink and a meal). Ultimately, we sent the bill back and I paid it all as one bill. It took about 15-20 minutes just to get the debit machine after the single bill was issued."}
{"text":"I generally really like Fran's. I love the atmosphere and the food at the original on College St. From now on if I go to Fran's, I will only be going to that one.
I went for late lunch recently. The restaurant was practically empty and it took far too long for someone to see us. Once we were seated (right in front of the waitress station), it must have taken 20 minutes for anyone to come over and take our drink orders. We watched the waitresses sit there and chat right in front of us ignoring our table completely. I was shocked. I wasn't any better that they were complaining about tables and customer where we could clearly hear them.
The food was very good, but I would rather have had a good waitress to make the experience better. From now on I will go to the original Fran's."}
{"text":"Pros:
Choices
Convenience
Cheesy but fun decor 
Price $--
Customer service 
Family friendly
Budget friendly 
24/7 menu

Cons: 
Some foods hit or miss
Not good for anyone looking for high class lol
*note if you eat here without reading the reviews, it's your own fault 

Summary:
A great place to stop off with the family or a bunch of friends as there is a price point for everyone. Almost like a fast food restaurant but glorified on plates and with lots of choices to choose from. One of my favourite restaurants for a quick and effortless meal. Lots of seating, so it's perfect for a last minute fun time.

Food quality is subjective but for me, sometimes I just want comfort food. You get what you pay for and if you're aware that the quality matches the price, then you'll have a great time! I just love how fast paced and easy it is to get a last minute sit down meal! :)"}
{"text":"I believe this is the third location in Toronto - the others being on College and on Victoria.

I like Fran's. So do a lot of other people. It's not surprising to see a line up, so if you are planning to eat before an event - go early as you may have to wait for a table. The service here is generally good. You won't be waiting too long before someone comes around to serve you. You also won't be waiting long before you get your food, which is great when you are going there for breakfast. When it gets really busy, it isn't surprising to have someone else bring you your food.

The food itself is good and the portions are generous. Every time I have been to Fran's the food has been well prepared. I've never had a situation where I've had to send the food back. However, \"good\" is relative. Remember, it is a (chain) diner, so don't expect it to be a five-star Michelin-rated eatery.

When I go to Toronto, I do make an effort to eat at Fran's for breakfast as I know that the food will be decent, inexpensive, and the service will be solid."}
{"text":"My experience with Fran's was one of pure mediocrity.  

They have a few items that are decently priced and the food isn't terrible by any means, but overall it's simply just not that great and you can find similar food of much higher quality elsewhere.  There burger is half decent and their breakfast is acceptable but neither had any wow factor at all, and the fries in particular were horrendous.

I give the place two stars simply because the service was above average, the place is open 24 hours, and the interior has a somewhat unique 1950s look.  

Only worth going to if its 5am and everything else is closed."}
{"text":"Stumbled into it... Breakfast.  Great breakfast diner experience.

We were quickly seated, coffee arrived immediately, server was friendly, polite and efficient.

Food was cooked perfectly, and hot when delivered.  

Again, great diner."}
{"text":"We stopped at a different Fran's the morning before and loved.  We tried this Fran's in hoping we could get a repeat performance. 

Wow, we were wrong!

The place was a mess, it looked clean on the surface, but underneath was filthy.  The booths were broken, and when we asked to be moved to a non-broken seat.... We found out that we are apparently picky.

We pressed on.  Ordered breakfast, asked for a croissant instead of toast and was told that that was not possible.  Not on the side, not for extra money.  No way....  But my wife got one with her breakfast, and the previous Fran's had no issue in handling that request.  Stupid customer requests.

Food was fine, coffee was bitter.  Service was terrible.

Find a different Fran's."}
{"text":"was pretty good a bit too pricy although waitress wasn't very friendly I found. Nice interior would be better with a jukebox though"}
{"text":"Either I was super hungry one morning or their food is just that good...!!
I really liked their little patio!

Would definitely go back.
 A nice casual atmosphere.... and they're always open ;D"}
{"text":"Loved the Canadian eggs Benedict. We love breakfast here. Eveyrone ordered something a little different. Our University student daughter often orders her eggs over hard as \"eggs Sunny side over\". Thy didn't blink. They also put up with us enjoying the late summer scene on the downtown street and drinking the surprisingly good bottomless cups of coffee. They were busy when we came, but we were seated almost right away and loved the patio. My hard-to-please folks liked the straightforward-with-a-twist approach that Fran's has. It's a good diner at a great location with superior service and a good patio."}
{"text":"I came to Fran's on a recommendation from a friend.  They had indicated that it was a Toronto Institution.  I did a quick read of the website/menu before heading out and realized this place is a glorified diner.  When arriving there, it is definitely a diner.  And as such my expectations were set.  If you are looking for gourmet, this is not your place.  If you are looking for comfort food, then this is definitely your place.

Diner style seating on benches.  The distance between me and the table when seated was alarmingly small.  I'm not a big guy and I would be hard pressed to drop a french fry into my lap.  

The Server was quick and friendly and was very good.  After she took my order, she indicated she would be bringing water but was there anything else I wanted.  Kudos for identifying that.  No real upsell on anything either, which is always good.

I had ordered the ALL-CANADIAN BANQUET BURGER with fries.  The burger was served up quickly and everything was hot.  Other reviewers indicated the burger was bland... it had some flavour, but wasn't anything explosive.  It was a good juicy burger, but nothing overly fantastic.  The bun was a bit wimpy and didn't hold together very well.  Fries were what you'd expect from a diner, fresh and hot (just the way they should be). 

Overall, the service was very good, the food was better than average for a diner, and the place was clean and bright.  Next time I'm in the mood for comfort food, I'm coming back to Fran's."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here on a Sunday noon for brunch. We were greeted almost immediately considering how busy they were. We sat down - menu came - ordered coffee - left to decide for food - ordered our food - waited for about 15 mins for the food. 


We both ordered Benedicts - he got the Eggs Blackstone (Atlantic smoked salmon) and I got the Portobello Mushroom Benedict. 

His Benedict were not consistently poached. One was almost soft boiled and another one is almost hard boiled. 

My Benedict were inconsistent too but better than his: one was runny and the other one was soft boiled. The flavour of the mushroom was a bit bland (my camping grilled mushroom tasted better than this). 

Coffee wasn't very good either. And we had to ask the server for a refill, other places would offer refills. So overall, it was an okay dining experience. It's definitely a 2.5 stars. Independent businesses for the win!"}
{"text":"Just okay. I had the eggs benny. Not bad, but I've had better food and better service. I was there around midnight and it wasn't overly busy, but the waitress seemed impatient that we were there."}
{"text":"I normally get breakfast here, but decided to venture off.
We ordered: Philly cheesesteak and Chicken/waffles. Delish.
Great service, I always feel comfortable at Frans."}
{"text":"I've been to the Fran's on College a few times and always thought it was decent enough, but this location? Not so much. I don't think these places have ever really been known for their quality food but I ate at this location a few weeks ago and it was borderline cafeteria.

The atmosphere has that diner vibe that I love, and they had a lot of HD television screens around the place -- possibly because they are located in the sports district. Our waitress was incredibly nice and efficient, but one thing sort of threw me off: the food came to our table very quickly. Too quickly for my liking. Did they just pop something in the microwave?

I got something along the lines of a veggie wrap, which was decent, but didn't really differ much from the wraps you might get at a truck stop, packaged in plastic wrap and borderline stale. The food seemed fresh but I still have my doubts they were able to prepare me and my two sister's meals in less than 10 minutes. Something has to give."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorit brunch spots in the city. Fast, patient and friendly staff. Very good food and a lot of variety. 
Make your own omelette or pick one of the menu. Fresh pressed orange juice, good unlimited coffee.
 Clean and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"They have a large menu, so there's something for everyone here for every meal.  Prices aren't too bad and portions are perfect.  So far I have enjoyed everything that I've ordered at this location."}
{"text":"Fran's! This place is awesome, I love the retro styling, its like a blast from the past back to the 1950s. The food here is great, no real complaints. MY favourite menu item here so far has been the portabella mushroom burger, this is a vegetarians wet dream so to speak. The only little tiff I had about this place is this one waitress...She wasn't very polite, and seemed very frustrated and angry, which in turn gave off a horrible vibe that made all of us sitting around the table to feel really crappy. Just watch out for this lady, dont know if shes still working there, but if so you now have a heads up. Anywho, its still a great restaurant and needs to be checked out if you haven't yet!"}
{"text":"A nice place that was very close to the hotel friends and I were staying at. We were recommended to come here as the original diner we wanted to go to was closed for the day.
Upon entering we were seated rather quickly so kudos! We were given a booth near the door and a nice view of Massey Hall. The first time we came here, the waitress was sweet and pretty attentive of what we were going to order. Food came pretty quickly and the portions were pretty big! We ordered the Big Breakfast ( I think that is what it was called). However, one friend asked for a coffee and that never came until he asked again, so that was a bit odd.
Second time we were here we were again seated quickly in an adjacent booth to our last visit. The waitress we had was a different waitress and although nice, a lot less attentive. By a lot less I mean we had to ask another waitress for the bill because she simply left us.
The food was great and the portion was pretty awesome, but service is a hit or miss..."}
{"text":"All day breakfast? Old fashioned diner? Conveniently located 2 minutes from my work? Sounds like my kinda place! I came here randomly with a friend a few months and I'm so glad I did. I love the cute diner-feel of the place, reminds me of Mel's Diner in Waterloo. The breakfast steak is amazing here, so fatty and delicious. Their home fries are also delicious (I ask for them crispy cause who doesn't like crispy home fries). I like how their portions are quite big and their prices are decent. Their service has been friendly and fast the handful of times I've been here so can't complain about that. I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Happened to stop by this place while waiting to see Trudeau during the Pride Parade last weekend in Toronto. Why this restaurant? I truly regret it now. 
This place seems like a lovely brunch place and we spent a good 15minutes trying to decide what we wanted from the menu because we were starved and everything sounded amazing. 
We got the Eggs Benedict, two breakfast sandwiches, and kaluha cappuccino. The drink was amazing, it was almost like a milkshake with lots of alcohol (totally worth the price) but we were so disappointed with the food. 
The eggs on the eggs Benedict was over cooked, when we told the staff this- he gave us the most condescending look before he went back and got other eggs which were again over cooked (no surprise there). After which he tried to tell me that 'this is how eggs Benedict's are' 

The house fries aren't good, the sandwiches weren't special at all and the whole experience felt like the 20minute line up to get into the restaurant was an utter waste. 

I don't recommend this place to anyone, as the staff and the cook clearly have no clue what something as basic as eggs Benedict is supposed to be like."}
{"text":"This diner was awesome! Food was spectacular! Way better than expected! Handmade burgers were great. We don't eat much meat so ordering one is a big deal for us. Our waitress Jennifer was absolutely an awesome waitresses. Very polite, thorough and soft spoken in a way which actually made our dining experience very pleasant. We just stopped in for a quick bite and left Fran's very satisfied! We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Fran's is one of those super common/kind of chain diners in Toronto that I have been avoiding for years (for absolutely no reason). Sunday morning while in the search for an early breakfast I figured why not finally give one of these Fran's locations a chance, what's the worst that could happen, eh? I came here with my girlfriend around 8AM and the place had plenty of open seating. The menu was pretty diverse and offered pretty much everything you could ask for in a breakfast menu and even a few extras. I settled on (I forgot what they called it) a giant waffle with both scrambled eggs and bacon on top while being drenched in maple syrup. I have to give it to them, it was absolutely delicious and kind of made me regret not coming here in the past. On top of the great food, the staff was friendly and the place itself was a pretty cool spot. Overall, I definitely recommend checking Fran's out for some solid diner style food!"}
{"text":"Amazing every time!!  Quick service, great all-day breakfast, jumping' atmosphere.  Fran's is great!!"}
{"text":"The service here was good but the restaurant was kind of dirty. There was food on the floor and fruit flies everywhere. I ordered off Fran's favourites and got the meatloaf which was cold. The food was mediocre but my portion was big. My husband ordered the fried chicken and waffles. But it was more like three fried chicken wings...not fried chicken. Not worth it ppl... So many better diners in Toronto."}
{"text":"It's quite possible that the college location of this chain has raised my expectation of this place and quite possibly skewed my review. Meh.

Meeting my friend in the middle of the night for relationship crisis is not usually how I like spending my Thursdays but you know , since it was at Fran's with their yummy goodness, I braved the rainstorm to lend a ear.

The good.
This is the second Fran's I've seen with Modern decor- I love it. The mosaic art piece of Marilyn Monroe is stunning. Love the colour scheme in the washroom. Love the lighting - really well put together place I'd say. My tummy starts to grumble in happy expectations and my mind is loving the decor- it's going to be a fab eating experience.

The bad.
I had a salad - Greek salad - which seemed more like a house salad. The lack of  onions, olives and Greek dressing really left me disappointed. I was really in the mood for a good, oniony greek salad. 
What made this worse, was that ever so often I felt like I was chewing.. .sand??! it wasn't food but it was definitely too small and I knew it wasn't going to kill me ( I really couldn't interrupt my friend's vent session either) so I chewed on.
The I had banana split - never really was tempted to have it so it was a new thing (yes I'm deprived) and I was in for another disappointment. My friend was kind enough to tell me after I ate it that I should order something like that at Dairy Queen - really not helpful - but I digress.
There was only 2 scoops - chocolate and strawberry - and I'm not a fan of strawberry ice cream. Definitely not enough syrup but it certainly looked alright and I loved the real whipped cream.

overall? not really. I'm going to the college location - at least there, when my tummy is satisfied, so are my taste buds."}
{"text":"I have to admit I have only ever come here for breakfast food and it has always been good! Breakfast for breakfast/lunch or dinner is always great here! And endless coffee is a huge bonus! I don't know what they put in their hollandaise sauce but it is AMAZING!"}
{"text":"OK, this place has taught me one thing.  When you eat at a restaurant, stick with their specialty.

Started with the onion rings.  They looked half way in between hand made and machine made.  Served with ranch dressing that tasted like half ranch and half tartar sauce.  Sauce was tasty, but I ate half of my rings with ketchup.  (have i used the word half enough times yet?). We both ordered the 10 oz striploin steak special.  Why?  Because it was on special, duh!!  

Steak was fairly thin, and had a lot of fat in the cut. It was ok, but not what a good steak should taste like.  So back to the lesson, i should have stuck with the diner food that they specialize in.  My friend noted, that the steak wasn't that good, but it tasted exactly how he expected it to.

Dessert.  Friend said \"Sky High Lemon Meringue\" was good. I had the Hot Fudge Brownie Binge. WOW. Warm moist brownie topped with both ice cream and whipped cream and hot chocolate fudge. Amazing.  Too bad I had ordered so much food that i could not finish it.  Leaving leftover dessert should be a sin!!


Closing thoughts: If I based this on the steak it would be 2 stars.  If it was based on the dessert it would be 5.  If i come back here i will order something small off the \"diner portion\" of the menu, and re-order the brownie binge for desert ... even if i came for breakfast."}
{"text":"3.7***

I have been going to this Fran's location on College for years! If you want a hearty meal for an affordable price, Fran's will never fail you. They are often busy yet always manage to have attentive service (I have never waited long for my food). The premium breakfast is a steal for less than six buckaroos you can enjoy two eggs, some big delicious and slightly greasy sausages, two slices of toast, and a generous helping of their crispy seasoned home fries. I can always count on Fran's for a dependable brunch option and even late at night. They have a pretty extensive menu and I enjoy their wraps as well. If your not into the carb scene you can sub in a side salad and they have a whole page of the greens too. Try their rice pudding :)"}
{"text":"Went with some friends for a late breakfast and I really liked salmon Blackstone, Big Breakfast looked big, veg sausage seemed smaller? I'll come back again.."}
{"text":"Would have given it zero but I don't know if that's an option.

Came here after a night of drinking (staff party) and was hungry for a good burger and a nice cold soda. What me and friend who came along for the ride got can be summarized in one word: horrible.

Took over an hour to be seated. There weren't too many other options for sit down dining at the time we were there and she wanted Fran's. When we were finally seated we were ignored for another 20 minutes. The waitress finally came around and took drink orders very quickly, then disappeared for another 30 minutes. By the time she took our food order we were digesting our own stomachs. The food finally arrived 40 some minutes later and the server was nowhere to be found after that. To be fair, she was swamped and wasn't unfriendly, but an explanation would have gone a long way.

Whole experience took 3 hours. Ridiculous. Won't ever come back. Zero tip. Like I said, if she'd said something maybe I'd have given lenience, but if you're making people wait that long you should tell them ahead of time."}
{"text":"On the pricey side, but basically the perfect diner. I love the retro, bustling atmosphere, and the food is total comfort food - perfectly hits the spot when you're in the mood for old favourites or an all-day breakfast. Nothing fancy, nothing complex in terms of flavour, but just simple ingredients and simple food done very well. The mac and cheese has a delicious blend of cheeses and keeps me coming back for more. Blueberry pancakes taste milky and are really light and fluffy. Basically, for any typical diner dish you can imagine, Fran's does a version that will always meet your expectations and satisfy your craving. Nothing innovative, but no disappointments either."}
{"text":"While in Canada for a few days with my girls, we decided to grab a bite to eat on the first full morning after arrival.  I can not remember the name of the place we initially went to, but they were closing soon and not very inviting since it was near time for them to close.  Understanding, we decided to ask someone walking where we could go and she quickly said \"Fran's\" and pointed us in the right direction.

This was the best breakfast meal we had while there!  OMG, the prices were unbelievable for the amount and quality of food.  I was impressed with the OJ prices being that they were mostly fresh squeezed.  I say mostly fresh squeezed because when I saw the prep, they did in fact pour a little orange 'juice' from a gallon container.  I asked the waitress what that was and she described in detail their process.  She said basically depending on the oranges they receive, some may not be sweet enough, so they add a little 'help'.  Seriously, it wasn't that much added, and it was so good.  I mean let's be honest, there are a lot of restaurants that serve a fancy glass of Minute Maid OJ.  So at least 90% of Fran's OJ was actually OJ.  :-)

Most of us ordered the Big Breakfast, which was really big and filling for only $12.99.  What a steal.  I went back three days in a row and ordered the exact same thing.  When I tell you once I find something great, I am hooked...believe me.  I shall not lie to you.  I was HOOKED.  

I, the coffee drinker of the group, had coffee and I wanted more.  It was so good with their table cream.  

Lastly, I would like to mention their syrup.  So, you're in Canada and you want real maple syrup right?  Well you wont get it here...BUT it's still better than the norm in the US.  They will actually sell you a bottle of their syrup for you to take with you and we all purchased at least one.  It was great and I have been using it since.  Now once it's gone...I don't know what I will do.  I guess I will need to make another trip and rack up!

The service was great all three days and I had to leave a bigger tip because there is no way I would have received all that food for that price in the US.  I felt like I was cheating them.  hahaha

Overall, great food and since I was with my girls, it was a nice place to just chat and eat.  Fran's reminded me of an old diner where you could go, grab a cup of Joe and they would actually remember your name and order."}
{"text":"I came here the other week and was really missing the atmosphere of the college location. Apparently one server is really sweet and attentive (but of course she was off that day).

Servers took forever to come and take our order and bring drinks. Which in this case was fine as the group I was with was happy socializing but it wasn't busy enough to justify the slow service.

Food (once it arrived) was adequate, nothing that would justify the slow service aka not over the world great. But made with fresh ingredients so I'm not complaining!

I believe I had a ceaser salad which was well done. Had tons of real bacon and crispy croutons. Also the salad was not drenched with dressing. I must have been so focused on the salad because I completely forget what everyone else had. Regardless, they had no complaints.

Atmosphere: comfortable, family restaurant with quite a few tables. Lightning is pretty cool, I must admit!

This place is worth it for the food but I agree with the others about the service. Come here if you aren't in a rush."}
{"text":"This place is located right near hospital ave. and open 24 hours so I have lots of not so pleasant memories of this place while my ailing mom was visiting the ER and/or hospitalized.

However, we visited tonight with a couple of family friends and they really appear to have improved in their quality of product. On one memorable visit in August 2013, my cousin felt sorry for the fish that sacrificed its life to be cooked in such a senseless manner. He also wanted details on the cooking technique because he wasn't aware that a fish could be cooked so dry and tasteless.

Today's experience was very different. It's still a decent home-cooked meal and what they've always done well over the years they continue to do well. Service was prompt and timely. Servers were honest when answering questions and if they didn't have an answer went to the kitchen for more information.

Two of us had pasta. I had their 'baked 5 cheese macaroni' and savoured every bite. The lasagna looked to die for as well. The others covered their salad, sandwich and Favourite section of the menu and no complaints were heard.

The member of our party whose goal in life is to find the best Western sandwich, commented that their Western sandwich was very 'fluffy'.

Our taste of the dessert menu was more than adequate. Their sundaes have 3 scoops of ice cream (vanilla/chocolate/strawberry) but their pies and rice pudding are still what they are known for.

Because of the memories, I can't say I'll be running back but if I'm in the area I wouldn't hesitate with going back."}
{"text":"I ordered  the  chicken and waffles and it was alright.  waffles were soft but they only gave 4 chicken  wings which wasnt enough. Nachos were average."}
{"text":"I used to eat at this location on a semi regular basis until a few years ago.  I'd been standing, waiting for a table for about 10 minutes.  No one came to seat me.  Then these 2 girls dressed in skimpy outfits came in and were seated immediately.  When the guy that seated them came back, I approached him and told him that I'd been waiting 10 minutes for a table.  He responded, rather apathetically \"do you want a table?\"  I said no and that I wanted to speak to a manager.  He refused.  I don't know if this person still works there, but that's irrelevant as I won't return to this restaurant, which is a shame because I used to love going there to eat.  The only reason this place gets a star is because I can't post a review without one."}
{"text":"This diner is centrally located directly across the main shopping area. I'm sure this place has many stories to tell since it's been here so long and open 24/7. 

The California wrap with a side of Caesar Salad was probably my \"healthiest\" meal during my stay in Toronto. The order came out super fast, the wrap was excellent and a perfect shareable meal. The salad was good although it had way too much dressing on it. 

Although it's 2017, Fran's still doesn't have WiFi. What a bummer! But to get around it, you can walk in to Pantanges next door and ask for their wifi password."}
{"text":"We've eaten at the original Fran's every time in town so we were eagerly anticipating another trip. It has always been outstanding, this time it was slightly above average which was disappointing given our expectations. Like previous reviews have indicated, things seemed to have declined a bit. Maybe the focus is more on he ritzier locations downtown than this one. We love the Mom & Pop diner experience with what seems like added attention to detail and a home style experience, but next time even a trip to a Panera's is in order as they never disappoint."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times now and just getting around to the review.  Some pretty serious issues on my last visit:
~~The pages of my menu were completely glued together with sticky maple syrup and clearly had been for a while.  Absolutely disgusting.  So disgusting I almost left.
~~The kitchen did some major burning of something while we were there.  The smell of burned food did eventually motivate us to get our check and leave.

It's a typical diner with typical diner fare.  They do an ok job on breakfast, getting the appropriately greasy items at least reasonably well-cooked.  Not so sure about other items.  You can tell that this restaurant specializes in transferring items from the deep freeze to the deep fryer.  Their perfectly cubical and bland \"hash browns\" are an example.  

Coffee is more expensive than Starbucks and flavourless...if you drink black coffee, be sure to ask for cream and sugar here.

Service has always been nice and friendly.  Never any issue there.

After my last experience here, I'm pretty grossed out.  I don't think I'll be back for a while.  Even when everything runs smoothly, the food is pretty \"meh\", even for the price."}
{"text":"Fran's really delivered in terms of taste!! Good old hearty burger - SO GOOD! The spaghetti with meat sauce was really really nice too! I was so hesitant to order from them because I've never had Fran's before and I'm the type of person if I don't enjoy the first 2 bites that's it - SUPER REGRETS! So glad I ordered from Fran's all in all real good hearty food and would recommend to others. THE FRIES WERE DELICIOUS and portion size is very generous."}
{"text":"The good: the large pink neon sign out front.  Nothing says classic diner to me more than pink neon.  Not as epic but in the same vein as the Save-On-Meat pig in Vancouver - pink neon will cure what ails you.  Also, this place is apparently legitimately quite old as my girlfriend's parents used to come here when they were dating.

The 'ehh': Standard 'open late' chain diner fare serving a huge menu of stuff they can't possibly all do well.  Seems like most of the positive reviews here are from post-bar/club patrons, so that'll give you an idea of the food.  You don't 'go to Fran's' -- you 'end up in Fran's'.

The bad: Pretty expensive for the white bread diner food you're getting."}
{"text":"Great diner style all day breakfast restaurant! Delicious food and friendly staff! Unfortunately there was about a 15 minute wait for me and my friend to get a two person table but it was during their lunch rush and we forgot to make a reservation so it was understandable.

My only complaint is that the bathroom was next door. Our table was right next to the door that led to the bathroom. The door was kept locked and only a red key that was very difficult to use (I never used it but I watched many other people struggle with it). My friend and I were constantly being disturbed to help people find or work the key. 

I hope this small issue will be resolved before my next visit or I will request a table elsewhere. 

Other than that the staff was wonderful and the food was very good. I had the BLT and enjoyed it very much!

Can't wait to go back!!!!"}
{"text":"Fran's reminds me of the \"Coney Island\" style restaurants in the Detroit area where I'm from. Fran's just has a little bit of everything on their menu. They don't quite specialize in anything particular, so they aren't good at any one thing, but are decent at everything. My first night here I had the Monte Crisco, which was pretty good when I added raspberry jam to the sandwich. Solid sandwich. I also came here for breakfast and bad the chicken & waffles. Solid. Not the greatest, not bad though. Fran's is also right off the main street, so it's so easy/convenient to get to."}
{"text":"Rolled into this Fran's at 4AM with a group of 4. Got seated after the waitstaff walked by us about 4-5 times.

We sat, took 4-5 minutes to decide... and waited for another 15 minutes.

25 minutes after entering we hadn't even got our order in, and this was after trying to flag down waiters. We ditched them, went to the other Fran's, where the food was mediocre to bad.

Chicken wrap doesn't even have proper pieces of chicken in it, they used deli slices.... Way overpriced. If you're looking for something half decent, stick with their breakfast options.

Even if it's a ridiculous hour, I'll be avoiding Fran's.  I'm heading to 7 west next time."}
{"text":"Fran's is a Toronto institution at this point, and this location has always been the one I visit because of the slightly retro diner feel and friendly service. Also, the space is huge so you are always guaranteed a seat no matter what time (even if it's 3am because they are open 24/7).

Was here recently for Sunday lunch and had the Morning Glory on the breakfast menu. A large waffle topped with 2 eggs (poached pls), 2 strips of bacon, caramelized apples, and drizzled with hot syrup. The waitress asked if I wanted the hot syrup on the side and I took her up on the offer to prevent any waffle sogginess from happening. I appreciated the extra attention to detail and that she took the time to clarify. Everything came promptly and as requested, so I had none of the dreaded service/kitchen issues others have reviewed upon. Will be back in the future!"}
{"text":"good place for a late nite post drinking night out on the town meal..

basically your denny's alternative thats open super late or 24/7.. can't remember

food was decent.. basically everything tastes good at that point but nothing was amazing

also service was incredibly slow as to be expected at that time of the nite though i guess.."}
{"text":"Fran's!? What's wrong with you!?  

I went to Fran's one evening with my friend for \"dinner.\"  Being the lover of breakfast, I had myself the salmon eggs benedict.  I was soooo disappointed because the poached egg that they made was not runny at all -- it was like an hard boiled egg.  The smoked salmon wasn't that good either.

Disappointed, I was. :("}
{"text":"Came here with my friends on a Friday evening after watching a Raptors game.  I was thinking, \"Hey - breakfast at night?  You can't do no wrong.\"  So I ordered myself \"Fran's scrambled on a croissant.\" (3 large fresh eggs, green /red peppers, onion, mushroom, asparagus, tomato, sliced avocado, goat cheese and rich Hollandaise sauce).  I was expecting something similar to that of an eggs benny ... Instead, it was scrambled eggs on top fo a croissant, and the croissant wasn't good either.  Disappointed?  Very much so."}
{"text":"Come for the omelettes, stay for the waffles.

This review will pretty much just be about how this place has the best waffles that my taste buds interacted with. I don't know what delicious Canadian voodoo they used to create this combination of batter and syrup, but it worked. The waffle was infused with maple syrup and this magical glaze that ignited all of my senses. Yes even hearing. 

The funny thing is I didn't even order the waffle combo. I had an omelette with home fries and toast. I just ate half of a leftover waffle. Now I can't stop thinking that waffle coated with an elixir handed down from Canadian deities. This review is making me hungry for a Fran's waffle."}
{"text":"My daughter and I really enjoyed our meal here.  It is a laid back, family-friendly place that serves good food for a reasonable price.  The server was lovely and efficient, the food was delicious and arrived quickly, and the staff was very accommodating of our needs, as I had a toddler with me.  If we lived here, we would come to Fran's all the time."}
{"text":"Had my breakfast at dinner time last night, a plate of portobello egg Benedict and it was super super super delicious. Their homefries is so light and not too oily. Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"Fran's is the best place to go for a late night meal; they don't mind if you clap, drum on the tables and dance in the aisle, you'll fit right in with the crowd :) On our last visit our server was quick and friendly; she didn't want to ring up 25 separate bills but was willing to divide the bill by tables, I can't really blame her.  It definitely isn't a fancy place but the portions are generous (the poutine was crazy, it took up a whole plate) and they serve breakfast 24 hours a day! They have a pretty good selection, including healthy options, and the food is decent and the prices are reasonable. There is no parking lot but a pretty good number of spots on the streets around the area."}
{"text":"Fran's is a big diner, and I have been to diners with better food and services.  Its key strengths, and not to be understating them as they are big ones, are location and pricing.  Unless you dine at a grab and go joint or food court, nothing in this neighborhood, I mean NONE, allows you to eat a dinner sitting down in this price range.  You can get a sit down dinner for under $20 here.  Closer to $10 if you order all day breakfast.  Most places within walking distance from Eaton Centre charge $25-ish and up.  The food quality is pretty low.  Standard fares such as burger, salad and all day breakfast are the safest bets.  I ordered something more complicated than these, and it was overcooked and tasted pretty bad.  My dining companion ordered a pasta.  It looked pathetic, but he said it tasted all right.

Come here for the prices, not the food.  And I probably will return due to the location and pricing, too.  I would order breakfast next time."}
{"text":"I like to go here strictly for dessert. I don't know why, I just love that it's open late and I can go and have a tea with apple pie when I like. I'm just not that interested in the day time crowd.

Mostly, it's after a Massey Hall concert, which is right across the street. But even if you're not part of the concert, you can watch from the big windows at Frans when the smokers make a dash out the door of Massey Hall to light up."}
{"text":"Not a huge fan of Fran's from the get go. The interior was a major let down compared to the bedazzled street view of the restaurant. The service was very poor & the food was bland and slightly unappealing. 

I didn't go over the entire menu with any concentration because I knew I was there for the All Day Breakfast hands down, but I could see there was a lot to choose from. That being said, I ordered a standard two egg/home fries/toast & sausage situation and I barely finished my plate. 

Home fries were seasoned beyond belief, the toast tasted like it had been frozen beforehand (you may or may not know that particular taste I'm referring too), the eggs were inedible.. The only thing I enjoyed was the sausage links. A disappointment to say the least. 

The bathrooms were pretty nauseating. 
I don't be back."}
{"text":"Thank you for great service and breakfast. I will certainly frequent your establishment again in the near future. The waiter was patient and extremely professional."}
{"text":"Fran's is like an old pair of pants...it may be dated, have some holes in it, but you just gotta try them on every few years to see if they still fit. Ditto for Fran's. 
I've been coming in for breakfast for years and there are really no surprises. The food is good, staff are friendly, location is perfect...what's not to like?
So why not a higher score? It's just that in Toronto there are much better places to tempt your taste buds with....and this is strictly comfort food."}
{"text":"We visited Fran's for lunch & dinner. Both were equally tasty. The menu offers breakfast all day & lots of options. Service was quick & attentive. Try anything with eggs! You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Terrible service, a \"who cares\" attitude. I am local and will not go there again. Do not waste your money or time - tourist trap."}
{"text":"Must try: poutine with pulled pork and chili. Yummy eggs benny. Great milkshakes, and you actually get to drink it out of the metal cup! Skip the dessert because the slice size is pitifully small for such a high price. A little pricy for a diner, but it IS downtown."}
{"text":"Pretty standard diner-style fare. Decent breakfast options, but don't expect to be WOW'd by anything.

I came here for a weekday lunch. The restaurant got a little bit busy but I didn't see too much of the corporate crowd make its way over here. There were definitely many tables available. I ended up ordering a breakfast meal. It was pretty basic with eggs, home fries, toast, and sausage. There really was nothing special about it. The home fries were pretty good, and they didn't mess up my eggs over easy. All in all, I enjoyed the meal, but there's really nothing to write home about.

Our server was quite pleasant and helpful. And glancing through the rest of the menu, kudos to these guys for being reasonably vegetarian-friendly."}
{"text":"Food is average and workable for the price, but the service is awful. I think they mean well, but there's no one really steering the ship and you just have to hope for the best. Our server told us for 40 minutes that the kitchen was backed up and food was close. This seems like a place that was good a long time ago and has just deteriorated."}
{"text":"On a Sunday at 1 o'clock in the morning, the options for food in T.O. become limited unless you want Chinese or McDonald's. 

With this in mind we went to Fran's. I had been there years ago and don't remember It being anything special, but it was edible.

This time we got the three cheese chicken penne which was in a Parmesan, cream cheese and mozzarella sauce with spinach and fresh tomato. There was no cheese to be found, the pasta was very plain and undercooked. The tomato and spinach were both OK. The chicken was inedible - big square pieces that had an almost plastic taste and smell.

Also ordered the Greek salad (regular -$5.99) which was a good size and had fresh ingredients (lettuce, tomatoes, olives, cucumbers, feta), with a strange sour dressing that distracted from the rest of the dish, although my friend thought otherwise and really enjoyed it.

We ordered takeout so I can't comment on the service."}
{"text":"the absolute worst. every. single. time I go
in I am welcomed with awful waitresses that clearly shouldn't be in customer service. the girl at the bar that unfortunately always helps me is also clueless. she has constantly messed up a simple order of a slice of cake... for instance this evening. seems like she should be working at mc Donald's than at a diner because diners usually have friendly awesome service. you won't find it here! funnily enough all my friends seem to agree with how terrible the service this frans is.  this place used to be so good now it's awful yuck! want
my money back!!!"}
{"text":"I don't believe I am writing this! I LOVE Fran's normally but after last night I am not impressed!! I ordered my usual, Western sandwich, on whole wheat, home fries, and a chocolate shake, I was Almost done, and Bam! the sandwich tasted like soap! Yup Soap!!I was crushed!! So, I took another bite, this time separating the egg from the veg, just in case, and nope, it tasted like soap! :(  
The Upside however was Emma my waitress she was loverly! Smiling and friendly, one of those customer service gals who seems to like what she does opposed to those who just smile and nod! If it wasn't for her this review would have been 1 star!!"}
{"text":"After spending the most lovely evening at Massey Hall with Coeur De Pirate and a few of my nearest and dearest, my friends and I decided to tromp over to Fran's for some late night snacks. After spending quite some time trying to decide between Poutines and Deep Fried Pickles we all reached a decision and placed our orders. To start we had the deep friend pickles which as delicious as they were, ended up burning all of our mouths as we had no sort of warning as to their temperature. 

Our mains arrived shortly after and we all delved in. As I began to eat my burger I noticed my friend starting to give me a strange stare from across the table. I stopped as the look of horror reached her face. As I put it down on my plate and spat out the remaining food in my mouth I asked what was wrong and she just pointed at the side of my bun which was covered in blue speckles of mold. 

Feeling like I was about to throw up I grabbed some water and began to chug it. Immediately I lost my appetite. As our server walked by I motioned him to the table and showed him the fine looking fuzzy blue friend my hamburger bun had made. He looked genuinely mortified and began to apologize profusely. He offered to give me another burger in replace of it which I wasn't really in the mood for but reluctantly agreed. Once it arrived I was too distressed to eat it. I peeled off the bun and had one chomp of the burger then called it a night. 

When the bill arrived my burger was comp but the rest of the bill including my drink was all still on there. I have had a few experiences similar before and was a little disappointed on the lack of customer service. 

After paying we left with no intention to return. I highly recommend that you take a look at your food before you bite into it. Won't be back here again."}
{"text":"The pancakes are perfect! There really is no better place the eat breakfast in Toronto!"}
{"text":"The service was less then quality in this restaurant. I asked three times for a cup of black coffee and the waitress didn't bring it. I had to ask the person bringing our food out. Additionally, the server did not check in with us throughout our time there. We actually needed to find her to get the check. The food was very good. Overall, not a great experience."}
{"text":"Went with a group of 8 people 
Food was good and service was great.
We had breakfast.
It is open 24/7"}
{"text":"Currently on the road to try out new breakfast diners around Toronto and Fran's was our first stop. 

Quick note, Fran's is a chain diner so don't get your hopes up if you're looking for quality breakfast food.

We opted for the Eggs Benedict and Steak & Eggs. I was seriously craving some really good hollandaise sauce. The eggs benedict is served with fresh fruit and homefries. Upon arrival, it was a very disappointing dish to say the least. Fresh fruit consisted of one strawberry and a slice of cantaloupe along with two spoonfuls of homefries. The plate was rather empty. Kicking off with the eggs benedict, the English muffin was cold  and stale. Not to mention, the hollandaise sauce was definitely not freshly made. 

The steak & eggs tasted mediocre at best. Definitely nothing special and worth ordering again. 

Overall:

 - Service was okay, fast came out quickly
 - Atmosphere had a nice diner feel to it
 - Food was a disappointment"}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far and had bad experiences both times. The most recent visit was this past weekend during World Pride. Yes, they were very busy, and I do try to cut restaurants some slack when they're that full. However, there were just too many issues with the quality and service to ignore. 

We didn't even see out waiter for at least 10 minutes, then waited forever to order and sat for at least half an hour after that before our food started coming out. Our table of 4 was served slowly and individually, with the server finally having to ask the fourth person what she had even ordered. He came back fairly quickly with her room-temperature eggs and potatoes that had apparently been sitting forgotten somewhere. The meat on the burger I ordered only just barely resembled the flavor of beef, and my friend who ordered macaroni and cheese said it was awful.

This place is a huge let-down and I will definitely not be giving them another chance."}
{"text":"There's something about breakfast food that is akin to angels singing or wiping your wet hands on your dog, it's ultimately very satisfying. Fran's does breakfast food right by giving generous portions with great variety. 

I have come here a total of 3 times and my go to meal is the \"big breakfast\". Most people think that a little Asian kid like me cant finish the big breakfast, they're liars and I'm hungry. The big breakfast comes with two eggs done how you want them, 2 slices of bread cut lengthwise,2 sausages cut into 4 pieces, 3 rashers of bacon, 2 pancakes and enough home fries to smother a small annoying toddler.

There's not much to say but breakfast always comes out piping hot and my eggs are always done perfectly, sunny side up, scrambled etc. The bread is also cut nice and decently thick and the pancakes are nice and fluffy but also cakey, they really hit the spot. The home fries are also good and really comprise the \"bulk\" of the meal as the carbs and the bacon and sausage are nice, crispy and salty. 

The service is always fast and friendly and the decor is diner-esque, true to it's american style of breakfast. How many times can I say nice in one review? I don't know but Fran get's a nice fat five stars!"}
{"text":"food was fine, i didn't have an issue with that. good serving sizes for sure.

the service however, was questionable. we ordered, then i asked my waitress about whether or not they had a promotion for key to the city, as i had seen Fran's on there before. she said she'll ask the manager, then stepped away. i did not see her again until she brought out our food...common courtesy is to ask and return with the answer, whatever it may be. i even had to prompt her for a response when she did finally make a reappearance.
additionally, they had little flies of some sort in the restaurant. the restaurant staff didn't seem to be doing anything, even though there was a noticeable amount of them flying around and resting against the white walls. surprisingly, this happened to me once before at aroma on King St E. the manager immediately called for maintenance, and in the meantime he went up to everyone in the restaurant individually and apologized for the inconvenience, and offered a free drink. that's what i call good service. at Fran's, we didn't even get an acknowledgement that there was a problem from the server!

came here out of convenience (my friend lives about a block away). however, i don't think i'd come back again."}
{"text":"Ate here around a week ago.  Service was terrible.  Food was all cardboard.  How can a diner muck up a burger?!"}
{"text":"The food quality is a 2* at best but the service was fast and the decor was very nice so, overall, 3*.

I went for brunch with my husband on a Sunday and it was quite busy, but we received our service and food quickly. I ordered the breakfast wrap with home fries and my husband ordered omelette with home fries. Both mains were EXTREMELY BLAND SUPER BLAND, emphasizing on the extremely part. I honestly don't think they used any salt or seasoning at all. The home fries were okay, but nothing special that I would consider it a signature or anything. 

Convenient and quick as its in a great location but if I were to describe the food in one way it would be....grey."}
{"text":"Always come here from brunch. Food and service are great. Standard diner fare."}
{"text":"I enjoyed the food here; nothing spectacular but the home fries were good.  Service as pretty good as well and it didn't break the bank as far as breakfasts go."}
{"text":"We had the impression from other Yelp reviews that it would be a dive. Instead it was a nice place with inside booths and a cool patio. Great classic rock n roll music in the background. Service was excellent. We were visiting from the US and looking for an all-day breakfast place. The first day we ate at Fran's and really enjoyed the food. So we went back again. I had the choose your own ingredients omelette and the salsa was inside the omelette which was surprisingly good. My daughter had the pancakes and waffles which she reports were delicious. Classic diner food but fresh and quality ingredients. We only had breakfast but the lunch menu looked good as well. Good vegetarian options although they deep fry the veggie sausage."}
{"text":"Only come here for breakfast.


Typical breakfast fare, though you can order lunch/dinner options as well. The hashbrowns are AMAZING, and keeps me coming back. They have specials from 6am-11, which are TOTALLY WORTH IT."}
{"text":"Horrible food and service, stay away from this place. Came here on a Saturday night around 7pm or so as a group of 20 (we reserved). A few of us went in early (like 6 of us) as some of us had just bought bubble tea nearby. The guy told us no outside food/drinks allowed so that we had to finish it. He then proceeded to say that we had to go outside because we were blocking the entrance. When it came to ordering the food, he was very rude. He took one order and then when I told him I wasn't sure yet and to get back to me after the others he straight up left. I don't see why he couldn't take the other's orders first?? Honestly he just gave off a very fake and rude vibe that I didn't like and u could tell by his actions and the tone of his voice. My friends were also like I don't know why he's so angry. I was honestly speechless. 

When it came to the food, I got the chicken and avocado club sandwich with a side of sweet potato fries. This was the worst meal I've had this year and it was $22. The entire sandwich probably had a dime-sized amount of mayo/dressing and that might even be an overstatement. The sandwich was beyond dry, the avocado and tomatoes were also raw. I didn't want to waste my money so I ended up eating most of the filling and left the bread. It was like eating a gross salad. Thank goodness the sweet potato fries were fine. My friends had the burger BTW, and got a gross and cold slice of processed cheese. Yes it didn't melt at all, I think the burger was probably cold too. It's like they don't put any effort whatsoever in making the food. Either way stay away from this place."}
{"text":"I only go to Fran's when the wife & I are heading to a show at Massey Hall, but I find it's a good place.  They'll make sure they get you on your way when you've got someplace to go, and the food is decent.

The staff can be okay, although on occasion they make mistakes and it's your responsibilty to deal with it, but convenience and dependability of food still get it three stars.  I might deduct one, personally, but I'm gonna just be cool with it."}
{"text":"I thought diners were supposed to be good value?

Went here with a friend.  We shared a mediocre calamari appetizer.  I had a cheesesteak sandwich and my friend had \"sliders\".  I put the word sliders in quotation marks because it was actually just a long sandwich cut in to three pieces.  Bizarre.  

Total bill $45 including tax and tip.  I'm sorry - I have no problem paying for good quality, but this was not - this should have been a $30 meal."}
{"text":"got me once, shame on you, got me a 4th time... alright im an idiot...
just cause you like a restaurant doesn't mean that brand is going to be good everytime... this place exemplifies that statement... for over 2 decades ive been going to Frans... first, the one on St Claire waaaay back when... then on college, then on shuter now down near the sony centre... usually I get the big breakfast and its solid but the last 3 out of the 4 times its been a comedy of errors... first time waited 20min for a menu and a glass of water... after flagging down the waitress twice... then a completely botched omelet... insert one decent meal... then todays half assed attempt at scrambled eggs and ham... and a soggy omelet... im done... the towel is in the middle of the ring... im heading to the showers... then maybe a mcdcs for an egg mcmuffin..."}
{"text":"Solid breakfast food. Went there after nuit Blanche and everyone in n my group was happy with their food."}
{"text":"The food is classic and it's super nice inside. The wait stuff are fantastic but the manager is always yelling at them and it's very uncomfortable. I've only had positive experiences with the servers and it's unfortunate that the manager seems to create an air of stress."}
{"text":"My daughter has discovered all day breakfast! We were pleased with generous portions, yummy food and good service. I would appreciate this place after a long night of drinking or in our case a place with our family. Great for conversation or simply people watching. 
My daughter enjoyed her five chocolate chip pancakes. Standard but good. Orange juice was freshly squeezed.

I really enjoyed my Montreal meat Benny's. I am very full. The fruit was underwhelming."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoy myself every time I go to Fran's and I have never been disappointed. I have had great experiences at all the locations in Toronto but in particular this one is my favorite. 

The service I find is extremely good here; fast, friendly and efficient. The location seems small but there is extra seating in the back so I have rarely had to wait for a table. The main thing that surprised me most was the food, I generally avoid steaks and I would never in a million yrs think to order one anywhere but a steakhouse but for some reason I tried the Special which was a 8oz striploin I believe and I was blown away! It was cooked a little rarer then I ordered but after taking a bite it was delicious! Literally ate the whole thing and I am a bird eater that rarely eats red meat at all so this really was a big deal for me ... and at a great price, $12 I was thrilled.!

Offering breakfast all day and open 24hrs this is a convenient diner inspired restaurant that always offers the comfort of good food"}
{"text":"A well established restaurant in the heart of Downtown T.O.  

My breakfast was just decent. Portion size was there but the baked beans were tomato asked & I like molasses. The home fries were bagged ones not home fries. The sausage was over cooked for my taste. 

My server was very attentive & solid so no complaints there. This was decent but I would t go out of my way to go again."}
{"text":"Breakfast/brunch on my first full day in Toronto, and I was angling for something good. Featuring pancakes in particular (I'm a bit of a pancake snob?). 

Of course got up late (hey, the entire day before was spent traveling from NYC to Toronto, arriving in the middle of Canada Day, and joining the celebration) and when we arrived at the intended destination, the wait time was over an hour. 

A very nice person informed us of Fran's a short walk away, said they were a Toronto institution, and no wait! I was sold - tips from locals usually work out great.

This tip was so-so.

Fran's is definitely an instituion in Toronto - been around in one iteration or another since the 1940's. It's diner style food served in a diner style environment. The menu is stuffed with a bit of everyting (even lasagna), and of course - all day breakfast is featured. The location we went to was right across the street from Massey Hall, and we sat outside which gave us nice breeze, views, and heightened the experience.

Excitedly we got the corn beef hash platter with a side of pancakes and turkey sausage.

Now for the so-so.

The corn beef has is some of the best hash I ever tasted. Now I'm not a corn beef hash connoiseur, but the flavor and texture of the hash was incedible. The beef was so tender, and there were big slices of it. It was more like corn beef mixed with julienned potatoes than it was corn beef hash. I shoveled as much as my better half would let me into my mouth.

The pancakes? Well there's the so-so. They were doughy. Firm, but doughy. Not ridculously doughy where you had to drown them in syrup to get them to go down, but doughy enough to notice and need more syrup than you'd normally like to use. They actually tasted like a mix - or at least that what the flavor felt like in my mouth. I was disappointed.

Three stars for your basic diner food at a decent price. It's an option if you're there, and if you get there in the morning during the summer, an outside seat is pretty nice. But I'll continue my search for the slap yo' mamma pancake/breakfast/brunch location in Toronto."}
{"text":"I like to come to Fran's for breakfast when I visit Toronto. This time, I visited twice. First visit -- a busy weekday morning -- the service was friendly and a bit offhand. The second time -- on a Sunday morning -- the waiter was unusually solicitous, refilling my coffee quite frequently. (It's not as if my breakfast took a long time to come out.)  I always enjoy the egg dishes here. Their hash is \"real\": actual sliced, shredded corned beef mixed with onions, instead of the homogenized stuff that's usually served as hash in the States."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of pancakes....and these guys have the best I have had in Toronto so far besides Detroit Diner.  The breakfast at this Fran's is much better than the lunch or dinner selctions, but they are still pretty good.  Average pricing and A-ok service and cleanliness are a big plus for this location compared to the old Fran's on College Street.  The only thing that I would change about this location are the hostesses who always seem to be a little too prissy for their job and restaurant."}
{"text":"This is a decent option in downtown.  We came here for dinner one night while in town.  We got the Meatloaf and the Spaghetti with Shrimp.  I found the meatloaf to be good.  Nothing special about it, and not the best.  But, perfectly acceptable.  I'm told the pasta was great.  This is largely based on their meat sauce, which was not skimping on the meat, and had a great flavor to it.  I almost ordered a pasta dish myself, and was disappointed I didn't after seeing how good the sauce looked.  

The place was busy, and they didn't seem to have a great system in determining who was next in line.  It was a hot day, and the temperature inside was a bit warmer than comfortable.  But, decent food.  I would come back here."}
{"text":"Yes! I finally found another brunch place that serves veggie sausages. The bonus is that you can get them any time of day, even at 3 in the morning."}
{"text":"I thought this place was good. I ordered the Maple Leaf and I liked the home fries a lot and they were crispy on the outside and soft inside. The eggs came out perfectly sunny side up and the sausage was very tasty. The baked beans had quite a bit of bacon that tasted better than Senator's. For Americans that are used to IHOP, this place is way better."}
{"text":"There is a lot of choice on the menu and most of it sound pretty good. 

The day I went in, I happened to have been waiting for a show to start across the street and ran in for some desert. These days it is hard for me to choose between Baked Apple Pie with Vanilla Ice Cream and Carrot Cake. My taste buds love both, and they love my butt; but I digress. The menu contains both desserts, and for some unknow combination of the forces of the universe and so on, that day, I chose Carrot Cake. The cake itself was quite yummy, the cream cheese frosting was not so much. When it comes to Carrot Cake, the quality of the frosting is super important. It makes or breaks the cake. At Fran's, the Carrot Cake is broken. Not very much frosting, and half of it was not cream cheese frosting; it was that fake gross frosting that you often find on cheap cakes. I did not cry, but I wanted to. 

Aside from the cake drama, the rest of my group seemed to be ok with their food. The onion rings were very oniony, and the burger was average. The service was not too fast, not too slow, friendly-ish, and the place was mostly clean.

I will be back, but only because sometimes I need breakfast in the middle of the night."}
{"text":"First time walking into this place to order breakfast, to go.  While looking at the menu I was greeted by the hostess.  At that time I was not ready to order  so I let her know I was still looking.  She then proceeded to seat the next customer and the next and next even helping out the people for pick up while I waited for her to help.  After about 8 minutes I asked her if someone could take my order and she then adviced me to go to the counter area and order from the waitress who was not there.  I asked the hostess if she could call for the waitress becauae I was at work after that I did not see anyone for atleast 5min and left without being able to order.  The second star is because the place looked clean!"}
{"text":"Average breakfast fare.

My friends and I went here after a long night at a wedding down the road. The breakfast menu had a good variety and offered a nice flavour. I opted for the maple lover's meal. It was served with beans which presented a different breakfast spin and was super tasty. My friends LOVED their vitamin C smoothies. The price was alright but I have to admit, I was shocked I paid $2.65 for a bag of orange pekoe tea. 

I was very interested in a morning mimosa but was discouraged when I found out it was $6 only because the restaurant beside it (O&B) has a weekend special of $3 mimosas and ceasers all summer long. I figured Frans would at least have some type of promotion considering their reputable neighbour did. 

I left full and satisfied as you should leaving any breakfast joint. I guess I just wanted a cheap morning buzz to celebrate the nice weather and good company."}
{"text":"Calling all Drunkies! 
This is the place to go for those post-clubbing nights.  If you're plastered and looking for a greasy spoon - this is your place to go.

I got here at 4am on Sunday morning and I had to wait for a table - you would've thought it was broad daylight outside with the amount of people in this place.
After a night of drinking I personally like to have a full on Brekkie. 
I got the 2 eggs, sausage, home fries, toast for $6.99.
Can't go wrong especially when you're paying $4 for street meat in the downtown core. 

Service is fast and food comes quickly when you have your cravings and then start thinking about wanting your bed. 

On a sober note - I do like this place just believe it's your classic diner with your classic comfort food. 
They don't have many diners anymore in Toronto which is unfortunate.

However Frans is great and glad it's still around. 
My dad remembers coming here when he was 18 which was AGES ago.

An original is bringing in the crowds... give it a try :D"}
{"text":"Food is alway good - service seems to always take an hour to get something - go to over easy across the street, they seem to get staffing right."}
{"text":"Good banana/chocolate pancakes. Sloooooow service"}
{"text":"We were walking by and we were hungry so we decided to give Fran's a try. Our waiter was very friendly and answered some questions my wife had. My wife had the sirloin steak special and I had the shepherd's pie. I found it did take a little bit longer than usual to get our good. However, when it did arrive we both found our dishes delicious. For desert we decided to share a carrot cake. It was good but could have been a bit bigger considering the price. Overall we enjoyed our time there and will return (I do want to try their breakfasts)."}
{"text":"Disappointing.  
This was one of the first places I ate a sit down meal in Toronto.  I met up with my friend and his little toddler.  Just to put things in perspective, it was the weekend of the G20 summit.  The day before had seen windows broken, ATMs trashed, police cars set alight.... There were police on every street corner as we wandered around looking for somewhere to have brunch.  The police were polite and even smiled.  A couple of them chatted with the little child and tried to get a smile out of him.  Their friendliness was even more striking when compared to the attitude of the staff in Fran's.
The place was half empty, but they didn't really seem happy to see us.  We were given menus and a piece of paper and some crayons for the toddler.  My friend chose the full breakfast and I went for waffles with side order of strawberries (extra charge).  His breakfast looked good in a sausages/pancakes/home fries way.  It would definitely keep you going for the day and was pretty good value!  My waffle was nice but the strawberries were terrible.  I got around 4 of them, from a tin, in some kind of nasty juice.  And it was extra.  Coffee was weak but better than nothing I suppose.  
Service was....just about adequate.  They gave us food and we didn't have to wait too long for it.  They were far from friendly though and when the poor little toddler decided he didn't feel like sitting down and wanted to explore he was treated to scowls.  Maybe they should recruit the staff to be part of the riot police next time?

I might go back if I'm craving a big greasy breakfast when everywhere else is closed.  Otherwise?  I'm positive there are much better places where I don't feel like my existence is an annoyance!"}
{"text":"It was a close call between 3 or 4 stars, Frans  is an uber-diner, the menu is extensive, the burgers are good, the service is good, amazingly, even their fries are quite good which in Canada is little short of miraculous.  I want to go back and eat their eggs benedict which looked really good as it was being served to the person on the table next to me, actually I want to go back and eat their everything.  Everyone seemed to be eating something that looked fabulous in a diner-y sort of way. 

So why the 3 stars then?  Because a Ceasar Salad should be made with freshly grated or shaved pamesan not dry powdered stuff, the bacon bits regardless of provenance have no place here and there should be a lot more dressing.  

I will not be deterred from coming here again though, nice people, a great diner, good prices."}
{"text":"Waitress was slow, tomatoes in bruschetta and spaghetti was not fresh, Greek salad was average, strawberry banana milkshake was weird with orange flavor...  Disappointed. maybe I should have ate something from the breakfast menu."}
{"text":"Fran's is simply a staple of Toronto living. If you live or work downtown, chances are this 24 hour, 365 day a year diner has become a second home for you. Fran's has been there for me from my college days of stumbling in inebriated at 2 am with a pancake craving, to early more pre-work breakfasts, to late night exam studying. 

The menu is extensive - comparable to Denny's in the states, but better quality. Where else can you order surf and turf with a side order of pancakes, a smoothie and a big ol' slice of carrot cake? No matter what you're craving, Fran's will have it, 24 hours a day.

The best deal by far is the big breakfast - for $12 you get a breakfast fit for a king, or rather Noah: 2 of everything. 2 breakfast sausages, 2 eggs, 2 orders of bacon (4 slices), 2 pancakes, 2 pieces of toast, and a big portion of their horribly addictive homefries. It's the perfect portion to split between 2 people, and the beauty is with their bottomless coffees, the bill comes to just under $20.    

As often as I come here, I should probably have stocks in this place."}
{"text":"I had supper here tonight with two friends.  It was such a nice night and we sat on the patio (it's huge).

Liz had the Legendary Banquet Burger (Classic Franburger topped with melted cheddar cheese & bacon) with sweet potato fries. She said it was good.

Deb had the Baked Macaroni & Cheese (Not your ordinary mac & cheese! Tender pasta with 5 different cheeses [cheddar, parmesan, Swiss, Jack & blue], fresh cream & baked with a herb crust). She said it was very good.

I had Fran's Chicken Sizzler (Grilled chicken breast glazed with Fran's Jack Daniels BBQ sauce, bacon & mozzarella cheese). I substituted the fries, homefries or tortilla chips & salsa for healthier white rice. Other than the chicken being cool (it was supposed to be hot), it was delicious and I would get this sandwich again.

Our server was Julia and she took good care of us. She gave us the right amount of attention but left us alone so we could yak. It's been a few months since I've Deb and Liz and it was good to catch up.

Liz left a bit early to catch a drive home with a friend. Deb and I sat around and yakked a bit more. When we were leaving, Julia gave us a hug good-bye.

With good food and service, I betcha we'll be back!"}
{"text":"I was hesitant to come here due to the reviews.  However, every time I passed by, the food looked good and the place had a steady stream of customers.  I decided to give this place a try for breakfast food - eggs, home fries and toast.  Really, not bad!  The service was decent and the food was good for a diner.  I would come back.  Not the fanciest place so you just have to set your expectations."}
{"text":"A Toronto icon.. was downtown and got the hunger so went into Frans.. and had the burger.. Can't say a bad thing.. not gourmet but not bad.. it was just what I needed at 10 30 pm lol.. plus the entertainment is free.. the night crawlers that pop in and out.. staff is great."}
{"text":"The only good thing about this restaurant is it's location, very convenient downtown.

We arrived at 10:30 am just after the morning rush and the place was empty.  The two waitresses weren't too quick to seat us, they kept us waiting about 5 minutes while they talked to each other.

The menu selection is great, something for everyone and all day breakfast is definitely awesome.

Again it was quite a long wait to place our orders which was odd, since the four of us were the only guests in the restaurant and again a longer wait for the food.

The food was average, they messed up my order, I was annoyed, but didn't bother to bring it to their attention since they didn't come back to our table until we had to go searching for them in the kitchen for our bill.

The prices were quite higher than we expected for the quality of the food and the service was definitely below acceptable.

Maybe the other Fran's locations have better service, but I'd definitely skip this one."}
{"text":"I came here during my lunch time on a friday around noon and the place was packed. We waited about five minutes and got our seats. There was a wide variety of dishes on the menu n they did offer a few lunch specials. I ordered a chicken quesadilla n my coworker ordered fish n chips. Our original plan was to dine in but we sat there waiting for 30 mins... decided to get it to go. We got our food 15 minutes after then it took another 15 minutes for them to come n let us pay for the bill. I understand that it was really busy, however it shouldnt have taken this long. The quesadilla tasted like it was sunk in a whole stick of butter. I def would never get it again. My coworkers fish n chips were delish tho. I used to come here all the time for breakfast but never for lunch. Lesson learned... i will only come here on early mornings."}
{"text":"A staple for late night or super early eats. This place has been here forever and relies on the greatest spices in the world: hunger and desperation. 

It's 4am and you need a big breakfast? Frans. 
You just left the club and you need some steak and eggs? Frans. 
You don't want to hit up the fast food and you want to feel a little more grown up, but you don't want to break the bank? 24 hr frans. 

I have never been impressed with the food here. I promise I'll never try the steak and eggs ever again in my life. But if I'm drunk and my standards are low, I'll... probably get the steak and eggs. 

I feel like, in a weird way, if you're a part of downtown Toronto, you've been here.

The one thing I do love about this place tho, is the service. Cheers to you patient people."}
{"text":"We went Fran's restaurant on Victoria St for dinner. Fran's restaurants is an old chain of restaurants that have around for a long time. This location was plainly decorated. The service was friendly, but they made mistakes with our orders..

I ordered the pork chops with French fries. My pork chop came with mashed potatoes instead. It was dry and overcooked. My friend ordered the macroni and cheese. She said that it was the worst macroni and cheese she have ever eaten. She also ordered the chocolate cake. It was a very sweet piece of cake that cost around 6 dollars.

Would we go back? I doubt it. The food was terrible. Fran's is an old medicore restaurant chain that somehow managed to survive."}
{"text":"This 5-star review isn't necessarily because the food is the best ever, but rather because it's the best at what it is: greasy spoon diner food. Anytime I want a reasonably priced breakfast at any time of day, Fran's is my go to. The food is consistent and I love getting the Big Breakfast with ALL the things.

As a bonus, their milkshakes and smoothies are fantastic and their homemade pie is fabulous."}
{"text":"I love the fact that these guys are open all year around.  Good food, but the prices could be a bit lower."}
{"text":"We had a nice experience eating outside on the upper deck .  We we're there for breakfast / brunch. It was not too busy so we got great service ."}
{"text":"Food was okay. It came out pretty quickly after we ordered and our server was very friendly. Good place to go if you're looking for something that won't break your wallet."}
{"text":"Nice selection of vegetarian options beyond the (normal) ones you'd expect from a diner like Fran's. Love the nostalgia, service is very good, and we enjoyed the food very much. Chances are you will have to wait a few minutes for a table but it's pretty much worth it to get a good meal and sense of what Toronto was like in the past. Don't forget to keep an eye out for the jukebox (digital) by front door, while we were there the staff played Michael Jackson and Madonna, which fit well with our meal ;)"}
{"text":"It's a chain diner... What are you expecting? Great homefries, and the sandwich was worth the 8.99.

It's not haute cuisine, it's a diner..."}
{"text":"Fran's was one of the only restaurants open on Christmas day.  And it was busy.

Fran's is a diner and, as expected, the menu is your standard diner fare.  I had trouble finding something that wasn't greasy but eventually setlled on the caesar salad wrap.  This had tomatoes, cucumbers and onions in addition to what a caesar salad typically comes with.  The chicken pieces were battered and fried, grilled was not an option.

The service was unattentive.  I'm ready to go.... please please please look at me so I can ask you to come over and bring my bill.  Please?  No?  Ok... I'll just play with my phone until you look at me."}
{"text":"Funky old downtown diner. Friendly service and decent a breakfast at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place in the middle of downtown.  This is your old school diner similar those those I remember growing up in the northeast.  Omelets, pancakes and lots of good stuff!  A little pricey but it is downtown. Service was good."}
{"text":"You know when you go out on a date with someone but you didn't know it was a date until after? And then it gets awkward?

About a year ago that happened to me here. He really liked Fran's and we good waffles. I hadn't been back since I moved into the city early Sept. and now Fran's is right around the corner from me! And I go there! Hoping not to bump into him! Naw scratch that he's a nice guy.

Oh right this is a review about Fran's! Yeah it's pretty alright! You get what you go for! Okay diner food! The waffles are decent as is the hot chocolate (you get such a big cup!) but I don't recommend the chicken qeusidellas (there's just too much going on in them, I also have no idea how to spell quesadia...)!

Recently I spent something like 5 hours here because I had to read Frankenstein - good book. I ended up getting a free tea. So yeah that was nice.

Go here if you are close by it and just looking for diner food that's nothing fancy. Also gimme I shout and I'll come visit you seeing as I'm so close by.

ps. The play the strangest mix of music. Techno remix of \"Puttin' On The Ritz\" back to back with Alanis Morsette."}
{"text":"Fran's has pretty traditional breakfast food. It's good for late night and random needs for this type of food, but doesn't really stand out from similar places. Only slightly better than chains like Denny's."}
{"text":"There is nothing fancy about this place. The bar is small, but the bartender was friendly, and there were TVs nearby where I watched the Super Bowl. The steak wasn't fancy, but it was tender and tasted good. The sides were just mixed vegetables and fries, but they were well-prepared and I was able to upgrade to sweet potato fries.

And the price was right."}
{"text":"I frequent this particular Fran's location rather often as it can accommodate large groups of my staff going out for lunch and its within good proximity to work. It always works well when meeting up with friends that work on Queen or King and I've always gotten prompt service as if they know we only have so long for lunch.

This is probably the very first Fran's I ever went to - when I lived at college, I went to that location more often, but this one is my go-to. I've never been when its so busy we've had to wait for a table, they almost always have something open and available, even if we have a big party.

The last time I went, we had a party of 8 people and they were able to accommodate us right away on a Friday at lunchtime. I decided to deviate from my usual choices and get the Grilled Chicken and Bacon panini with avocado. Oh good god... it was delish! I couldn't have asked for anything more. When they put the plate down I was a tad surprised at the portion size, as most things here tend to be massively over-portioned, but it was just the right size for lunch with some sweet potato fries on the side. And those sweet potato fries... it's the garlic aioli they serve with it that makes them so fantastically amazing.

I noted this on my review of the Frans at college - Fran's isn't called a greasy spoon for nothing. I don't recommend coming here for special dinners, its not the place to get top notch, blow your mind food. This is the kind of place you come to when you want a comforting meal or you can't decide what you want, because the menu is so massive. In my opinion, don't come to a diner and order steak, or something that a diner typically isn't known for. If you stick to the \"diner\" selections (the standard eggs-bacon-sausage-pancakes breakfast, the sandwiches, the mains) you're probably good. I can't speak to any of the things like the fanicer breakfast items, asian  bowls or the salads, but I'm sure they're fine. Oh and the desserts are super yum :) All those pies and cakes are amazing - every one I've tried has been a hit.

I come to this location when I'm craving something indulgent and I've never been let down. I've tried many dishes from here and no one that I've ever brought here has complained, and over the years, I've brought at least 15 people through their doors.

Overall, you'll be happy with Frans if you go in with appropriate expectations. There are plenty of places to get great food in the area, but when you're feeling like homefries, eggs, bacon and pancakes (all on one plate, mind you), or a massive chicken parmesean sandwich, this is THE place to go."}
{"text":"I have been going to Frans (multiple locations, but more recently this one) for YEARS and have rarely been disappointed. I work at Ryerson and live right near the College location so my staff and I frequent the location across from Massey Hall and my hubs and I frequent the location at College location.

Let's get one thing straight here - Frans isn't called a \"greasy spoon\" for nothing. And if you want super cheap food ($5 for a full dinner plate), there are plenty of places to find it in this area. But you pay for what you get and Frans has always been consistent for me through frequent visits over the past six years.

The menu is HUGE and I've tried a little bit of everything off of it and have found lots of gems on their menu. You can't go wrong with breakfast, the portions are large and are always fresh and taste good. The all-day breakfast is a huge plate (and I feel like a pig being a girl and ordering it) but it's always a pleaser and I never regret ordering it.

The fettuccine pasta dish is fantastic; I've yet to order it for myself because I'm partial to sandwiches but the last time I had it (a friend shared), it was amazing. The chicken parm sandwich is great too, huge portion size and always tastes great. You can't go wrong with the grilled cheese sandwich (somehow the ones I make at home never come close to measuring up to Fran's grilled cheese) and I know that the unlimited coffee is a popular choice for my sleep-deprived student coworkers. 

However, all that being said, this is not the kind of place I would EVER order a steak at - if you want a good steak, go to one of the many steakhouses or pubs that line the downtown core. And anyone expecting to get an appetizer and a good-sized main for under $20 is insane (this goes for just about any sit-down restaurant I've been to). Fran's is about comfort food and an almost familiar atmosphere inside. The staff is always friendly at this location and we usually wait less than 15 minutes for our food.

If you're looking for a place where you'll be blown away by flavor and arrangement on plates and all that fancy junk, this isn't the place for you. But if you're not an elitist food snob and you like good home-style food for decent prices, you'll be happy with what you get at Frans. I also think it's pretty important not to judge a restaurant based on one food dish - the menu here is so large that it definitely deserves a few return trips to get a good sense of what food is good and what food is great."}
{"text":"This Fran's is located on Front Street east of Yonge on the North side of the street. I've been to both the College location and the Massey Hall location of Frans and both were quite good, with the Massey Hall location being my favourite. I expected more of the same from this location when I brought my boyfriend here before a game at the ACC.

The menu at every Frans is the same but the execution definitely is not. I ordered the grilled cheese and I recall on other menus it was a triple decker grilled cheese and was always nice and crispy, cheesy and came with shoestring fries. They've changed up the fries at this location, not the best. It was an okay dinner but it really didn't live up to the Frans I'm used to. Service was fast enough but we were sat at a table DIRECTLY beside the kitchen, which is a horrible location to sit. 

If I had my choice, I'd go back to the Frans at College or the one across from Massey Hall. Better food, better service and better experience. In a pinch, this one will do."}
{"text":"The food isn't good.  But at 3am in the morning when everything else is closed WHAT DO YOU EXPECT!  It's better than Mcdonalds! 

A little expensive for the lack of quality but again 3 am in the morning!  The service is not bad, they are pretty attentive and quick.  

To be honest the food isn't HORRIBLE but it's not amazing, its basically grease between two buns or on a fork, however you prefer, but after a night of dancing and drinking....its all you could ask for. 

Cost: 1 people, 2 mains, $40.
Food quality: 2.5/5
Food quantity: 4/5
Service: 4/5
Perfect for: Late night binges

Would I Go Again: Yes, because I still plan on going out getting drunk and being hungry."}
{"text":"Despite being discouraged by some of the previous reviews, I went to Fran's last week because it was one of the only places open at 5:30am near St. Mike's where my dad was having an MRI (not to worry - he's just fine). 

I had the breakfast burrito and an orange juice. The burrito was not very burrito-y... but what did I expect at a diner? It was more tortilla than filling and at one point grease dripped down my arm. Ew. The hashbrowns were pretty tasty though and the orange juice was surprisingly good and freshly (or at least recently) squeezed.

I likely won't be back unless I happen to be in the area at an ungodly hour once again, but it wasn't terrible. My surroundings were clean and staff was attentive and friendly."}
{"text":"Don't go between 3 pm and 4 pm unless you want soggy and warm food."}
{"text":"Worst take-out meal I have ever had. Can't remember the last time I had to throw out an entire meal. I ordered the chicken parmagiana and it was supposed to come with mashed potatoes and \"vegetables.\" What I got was an artificial/fake piece of greasy \"chicken,\" green peppers and red onions for vegetables, and powder-like mashed potatoes (had no seasoning or butter). It was nasty. I was warned and told to stick to their breakfast, but I figured, \"how bad can it be?\" Answer: beyond bad."}
{"text":"You cannot be a college or university student in the city of Toronto without having been to Frans for their all day breakfast.  That being said i used to go there all of the time for that meal alone.  If you go on a weekend be prepared to line up.  I was just at Fran's on Sunday and i opted for their Triple Decker BLT with fries for under $10.  Honestly you get what u pay for, you cannot pay ten dollars and expect Haute Cuisine.  My sandwich was good but not great, it didnt blow my mind.  It was a triple decker, but personally i think two pieces would have made the sandwich more manageable. The saving grace were the fries, they were delicious.  Overall if you are looking for a good breakfast with a great youthful vibe, than Frans is it."}
{"text":"Literally shaking my head as I write this review. This place used to be so good! Went there recently and I was so disappointed..looks can be deceiving. Our food looked decent, but tasted awful. The chicken and waffles was truly by far the worst. First off, why did they use a chicken thigh instead of chicken breast? I was so displeased I didn't even bother continuing after the first bite. Then the pancakes were dry as hell, stale and just unenjoyable. The omelet also lacked flavour .. might as well be dust swept onto a plate. Won't even bother going back."}
{"text":"This location in particular is our staple (we don't go to the yonge/college location... bad experiences). Usually grabbing dinner, an odd hour breakfast or cake, it's our 24 hour go to spot. Recommended!
2014 October Update: I've had bad service here a couple times out of my past few visits so I can no longer recommend this location. If you want a consistently good experience, head over to the Front St location."}
{"text":"My new favorite Frans and also the newest. The college location was the first one I ever visited and had bad service both time so it was off my list. For years the Victoria street location was my go to but I've had some bad service in a couple of the past few visits so I will no longer be going to that location either. This leaves with this location, bright and new with a fantastic patio. As with all Fran's we love the dessert menu and the standard diner fare. If you are in for a greasy spoon, go here!"}
{"text":"After my jog for an hour i was starving like hell. Wanted to eat healthy n quick so shortlisted \"frans\" i would definitely eat at CoRa's but i hav been there many times n also wanted to check who is better then the other n no doubts its CORA's that rock!!
When i got in my expectations rose as it was fully packed n food looked delicious on the big plates they use to serve. 
I did notice that they serve freshly squeezed orange juice. They refills ur black coffee for u n number of times so  . They have clean bathrooms . Plenty of servers so not too long wait n they are always cheerful( at least in the early morning hrs) 
Talking about my food. I wasn't that happy. I ordered french toasts with walnut which I expected to be mixed in the batter rather they were served like a garnish on top of french toast. My sunny side eggs were not done properly. 
As i was alone so i observed around that theu had screwd couple other orders too but luckily for them , no customer created a scene . Maybe coz they understood that its busy morning n it can happen . Whatever they need to improve on food quality n preparation ."}
{"text":"Aren't diners fun? This location is definitely my go-to spot before concerts at Massey Hall or shopping trips at the Eaton Centre. 
It's large and bustling, and fun to people-watch if you sit along the window. :)

This place is usually pretty busy, but the service doesn't suffer for it - at least when I've dined here. I will typically order one of their all day breakfast offerings, and they are among the cheaper options that you can find both at this restaurant but also in the neighbourhood. You can't go wrong with classic bacon and eggs! I've heard their Eggs Benedict is also pretty good. If you order homefries, get them cooked well done.. I find they are a nice crispy treat, and much better than how they normally come out! 
While I can't speak for the other food on the menu, I definitely have a soft spot for this place and good memories over the years of greasy spoon diner breakfasts. Looking forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"I had the French poutine and that delicious stake salad. My friend had a burger. We were pleased! I would eat at Fran's again!"}
{"text":"LOVEEEE FRAN'S!!!
Early morning of me flying out on vacation this past December, me and 2 friends decided to eat since we pulled an all nighters.
Amazing server, food, and of course milkshakes!"}
{"text":"The. Worst. Service. Ever. 

There aren't a lot of options at 3:30 AM, we saw that Fran's was more highly rated than Golden Skittle so we skipped the Skillet and headed to Fran's

Bad move.

I'd rate the food at Fran's but it NEVER ARRIVED. Never. After waiting over an hour fir our order, the waiter finally came by to inform us the he \"had no idea what was going on In the kitchen...no idea when our food would be ready and we should probably just leave\"

I had ordered 2 scrambled eggs an a well toasted English muffin. I could have gone to Sobee's, taken an Uber home and made eggs in less time.

I have been a waitress at various times in my life, and I know how things can be beyond a good server's control, but you always keep the customer informed, and you offer something complimentary if you can. A beverage perhaps? Some bread? Neither happened.

What's worse is that when I finally tracked down  the manger ( who seemed be either napping or taking a TV break in the back) he just gave  to give me a condescending half smile mixed with a look as if I had interrupted his Netflix binge watching. 

\"True, my food was late. True, there was no ETA on my eggs.\" His only explanation was that someone had quit. My response was\"and??? Maybe you should inform your customers?!?\" That's it. No semblance of an apology or offer of ANYTHING. Amazing.

We grabbed our coats - commiserated with the other patrons seated next to us who were also waiting forever for food and then made sure to inform the people reading menus that there was no point. Pack it up and go home. Like us."}
{"text":"This place was super busy the night I went to see a performance at Massey Hall. The lobby is extremely small so no where to stand in line. Because of the limited space the lineup was disorganized. It wasn't clear who was waiting to talk to the hostess to request a table & who already had. Also washrooms are in the hotel and there were only 3 stalls which ran out of toilet paper. That's ridiculous. Food was decent and our waitress was fine. I would just rather go to a less crowded space."}
{"text":"Went there because we were looking for a burger place nearby. Place was just off of Yonge Street next to the hospital in case you have a heart attack from the grease. Ordered the burger naturally.

The atmosphere is the classic diner with a hint of friendly waitresses. The food itself is pretty good but something seemed to be missing. 

I'll probably go again and try the BLT or all day breakfast and if it is good, I'll bring this rating up a notch."}
{"text":"Ordered the banquet berger and it was very good. Like mom used to make. They gave me a very large amount of fries which filled me up pretty good. Only with the table they put me in was a little bigger, felt a bit scrunched up in the seat being a big guy. Staff was very friendly."}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for old-fashioned diners. Loved the booths and relaxed ambiance. Had a hard time choosing from the menu but I finally decided on cheese omelette, rye toast, and fruit cup. It may be ordinary fare but it came across to me as comfort food, and my coffee just kept pouring in! All-day breakfast in a no-frills resto with warm and friendly service-- I'll definitely be back for more!"}
{"text":"The burger is not that good, they ran out of short ribs although it was 2pm and the fish and chips was too dry :(
But to be fair the stake was perfect"}
{"text":"Was running around downtown on Wednesday, when the pangs of hunger overcame me.... Just around the corner from Massey Hall, I went into Frans.... Checking the menu, I saw Reuben sandwich and ordered fries well done.... Sandwich was oozing melted cheese, 1/4 pickle, thousand island dressing on the side, bottle of dijon and french's yellow mustard on the table, fries were very average... The sandwich rocked.... Meat was tasty and tender... Pleasant experience, good service, and an excellent sandwich for only $11.99... Surpassed my expectations..."}
{"text":"Not usually a fan of the greasy sodium fests that diners often are but funny enough 21 days into my cycle the body shuns all discretion and judgement and just wants to effing pig out irresponsibly on food that bears no resemblance to anything veritbly nourishing. Enter Fran's my (bucolic)PMS cravings destination.

The decor is here reminiscent of the Peach Pit from 90210 , but thankfully no sightings of a surly and aproned Brandon Walsh to be seen.

My recommendation is to stick with the good ole' diner classics here no sense in ordering steak or pasta, best save that for a real night out.  Everything pretty much tastes like the food your babysitter would have made you, like home fries reminiscent of tater tots slathered with canned gravy and roast beef served up on a pasty slab of Wonderbread. Mmmm the taste of nostalgia....

Funny enough me & my girly friend always end up here for shits & giggles when we've fallen off our healthy lifestyle diet bandwagons. One time she lied to her SO that we were at Baton Rouge instead as we didn't want to get busted here but when he found us, we hung our heads in shame on being outed for the Fran's junkies we were.

Truthfully though Fran's is great for nursing those late night hangover munchies and admittedly have had some fun late times here after various Yonge st related ribaldry.  Now if only their rice pudding could tame my moodswings..."}
{"text":"I actually like it. 

Have you tried their  tuna melt? You will forget your mother's (or girlfriend's) name. It's got the right level of saltiness, a bit of onion and greasy bread... it's heaven. I bet with one order, you consume half of your recommended calorie intake.

Don't worry - Goodlife and Extreme Fitness are just around the corner. 

I like this location better than the one on College... it's classier. You get to enjoy the view of St. Michael's hospital depending on where you're seated. Or better yet, of the lovely Eaton Centre. 

Fran's is a good \"I'm going to eat and what a day huh\" place. You come here to eat and relax. NOT go on a date (tacky). The bathroom, because they share it with the Pantages hotel, is very clean. 

The food menu is pedestrian and cooked decently, but order that Tuna Melt!"}
{"text":"Good place for a really late brunch. Average food. Friendly and helpful staff. The home fries are amazing. Easy location to get to"}
{"text":"Oh Frans, how you never disappoint my very late night munchies after a long night out partying... 

Food: This place does breakfast and it does it pretty darn good. I always order eggs here and have yet to try their sandwiches. This time, I ordered the Vegetarian Rainbow Eggs Benedict. The menu said there would be asparagus but I couldn't find it this time around. A little bit more on the pricey side around $11 but the plate was huge! Almost half the plate was filled with their fries. Although not beautifully plated as Cora's, this place gets the job done and leaves you full enough to get home into bed satisfied. 

Service: 4am and my party of 4 were quickly seated at the back and not surprising that it was moderately busy with people. Its another fast diner so dont expect top class service with servers asking you how your meal went. Occasionally someone would refill on our water. 

Decor: Still has the 60s cheap diner vibe going on. How many times have I passed by the flashing lights outside in the middle of the night? Again cheap diner so a little dirty inside so yeah. Decor is vintage looking and cute. 

If you want a late night bite more filling than the 24h McDs on Yonge, head to Frans!"}
{"text":"Garbage service, entire staff stood around watching a tennis match instead of serving customers"}
{"text":"I enjoyed the steak and eggs special with home fries and my friends had repeat orders of rice pudding, a Fran's specialty, on the sidewalk patio. The waitress didn't neglect us and we stayed getting refills for hours."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a Sunday afternoon to watch the second half of a soccer match and was pretty underwhelmed. We were seated on the patio which was a bonus; the downside was the tv screens were above the bar. Whilst trying to take in the plays on the screens, I was constantly distracted by the servers milling about below. I know, boo hoo, right? The real distraction, however, was some rather unsanitary beverage handling. I know I might be a stickler for details here, but I don't want my caesar butted right up to and touching some else's dirty dishes and cutlery. I thought I was maybe being too much of a primadonna, but my sister-in-law noticed the same thing and had her own stories of things she saw in addition to mine. 

Oh and our server was apathetic and disheveled. In short, I am glad we only had one pint."}
{"text":"Popped into Fran's for breakfast and was not disappointed. I had the maple leaf breakfast and my wife had French toast with a side of home fries. Home fries here are really good. Service was good and food was delivered quickly. Good little spot breakfast. Would definetly come back."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch with a friend and it never fails.

Although we waited for the hostess to seat us, we could see everyone was busy (lots of people!) so it wasn't unreasonable. We were sat and given menus, with enough time to think about what we wanted. Water came quickly as we asked for it.

My friend got the energy breakfast and I had the two-eggs breakfast - I never come here for anything but breakfast, though I should try other things, I know. The great thing is that there are so many options with my choice - breads (white, brown, rye), meat (sausage, ham, bacon), and egg style (scrambled, over easy, etc.etc.etc.) are all up to you! My friend's energy breakfast was more like a \"hangover breakfast\" with the croissant sandwich...the scrambled eggs were pretty massive and it even came with more carbs - home fries. MY FAVOURITE. YUM.

The desserts looked amazing, but we were full at that point. Totally would recommend this place and bring my friends here! (and I did just that today~)"}
{"text":"I was going to say Fran's isn't a place I'd take a date, but then I remembered my wife and I visited at least two locations while we were courting (side hugs galore). We got married, and we still are, so she must love me for reasons other than my choice of classy restaurants.

Fran's is hardly classy. An old school greasy spoon diner in a state of permanent shabbiness, frequented by students and office workers and transients lucky enough to scrape coffee money together. The front door's busted, and a display case by the entrance features proprietary bottles with ketchup turned black from age. Want a Fran's basebal cap? A faded pique knit shirt? A yellowed plastic travel mug?They're here under glass. I don't know if they've got your size in the back.

Staff are a pleasant surprise. I walk into most diners expecting gruff service, unless I'm a regular (by which point I either expect to be greeted like family, or tossed out and sworn at...like family). Wait staff here are a youngish bunch; freshly shaven or dyed or tattooed. They're unfailingly polite, and happy to be of service. 

Which is good, since they have to cover for some pretty mediocre diner food. 

Over they years, I've learned to stick mostly to breakfast. It's generally well-executed. Over-easy eggs are suitably runny and always arrive intact (scrambled tend towards overdone). Marbled rye toast is hot and bathed in butter. Plumb sausages arrive split and grilled crisp. A few homefries dot the plate. I'd rather have hashbrowns, but I'd have to move to Vancouver for that. Belgian waffles are light and crispy, and pancakes huge; as vehicles for real maple syrup, they're admirable. 

Other items are less successful. a hot turkey sandwich coats sawdust-textured fowl with gloopy brown gravy, and sad uni-vegetables sog anemic frozen fries. Soup of the day is vegetable...so what? A bacon cheeseburger is just OK; a similar one can be had at your local fast foodery for less than the $12 Frans charges, and fish and chips features more pallid potatoes and a slightly gummy portion of haddock. 

Frans may just be the archetypal Toronto diner, and for that I love it despite it's faults. Besides, breakfast is the best meal of the day."}
{"text":"Wow what a disappointment. Let me try to make this short and descriptive.

Food: 
Mediocre, items are hit and miss. Generic things like chicken fingers, poutine are okay. I came here last night and ordered corn beef hash it wasn't that great but it wasn't horrible. I've had better. Everyone felt as if there food wasn't hot and was more like room temperature. 

Service:
Atrocious! The diner had two servers for the night which honestly in my opinion isn't that bad as it was 4 in the morning. I've covered an entire patio and I'm an amateur. It took them ten minutes to take our order. Our food took 30 minutes to come there was no apology. We didn't have enough utensils and we had to ask the other waiter that wasn't. our to bring us some. My friend was served waffles with no syrup and our waiter never checked on us so we had to go to the front to get some. My friend ordered scrambled eggs well done and they came runny. When our waiter finally came back about 15-20 minutes into our meal. I asked if her eggs could be replaced and explained that we had to go all the way to the front to find someone for syrup and he rolled his eyes and walked away. He didn't come back to our table for the rest of the night. Another waiter brought her new eggs they were very well done and not scrambles they were actually sliced eggs (yes weird). We asked the other waiter if we could have our bill and our waiter came put the bill on the table and walked away didn't ask if we need the machine or anything. We waited 5 min to se if he would come back but he didn't. So we all got up to look for him so we could close our tab. None of us tipped him and we gave our extra money to the homeless man at the front door. 

P.s our server had an English accent for future reference. And tip: when you are understaffed or overwhelmed just apologize in advance and let your table know your name and to just call if they need anything. Also, make the effort to do checks so we don't have to get up out our seat and look for u."}
{"text":"Extremely bad service. Not even a full house. So many tables empty. Many waiters. Not seated till 30 minutes later. They would look at the long line up and walk right by it. Waste"}
{"text":"Not sure why the reviews are so low here - I was visiting Toronto and needed something quick to eat on a sunday before catching the train and wound up near this place. They're open 24/7, that seemed convenient enough!

Decor wise, this place looks like a modern diner/bistro. Clean, classy, athough a little bland. I would have breakfast and lunches here, not sure about dinner as it's lacking ambiance.

The menu is extensive and really has a bit of everything, from basic breakfast foods, to sandwiches, pasta and ribs, I don't see what's not to like.
I ended up getting the grilled salmon salad and my partner got the orange chicken with rice. Both dishes were served in a timely manner, presentation wise, I was impressed at how pretty the plates were. Very colorful and fresh looking ingredients, generous portions.
I gobbled down my meal and kept thinking of how delicious the other selections must be. If there was a Fran's in Montreal - I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"I love Fran's, but maybe not for the greatest reasons. I love Fran's for hangover food, for its large portions and its reasonable prices. That's pretty much the only thing to love here. 

I went yesterday with a friend for breakfast. I'm on this awful diet and I'm unable to eat any dairy or gluten for 30 days (Whole30 - look it up). Our server was very accommodating with my questions about what contains what, and informed me that their home fries are coated with flour...what a bummer (but before this, I didn't know - so celiacs beware!). My other options were a fruit cup, a $3.95 upgrade, or a salad, a $1.95 upgrade. I get it, choosing a different side than the standard is a little annoying, but this is Fran's. You're gonna charge an extra $2 for a small cup of leaves? Considering I skipped the toast as well, I thought they coulda just given me the salad...but oh well. 

I don't know if it's a thing at Fran's, but it seems your server only comes to the table if you flag them down. If you ask for a few more minutes, you'll wait 10; when your meal is finished, your plates will sit there until you do something about it. The server was kind and friendly, but it seemed we disappeared until we made a gesture towards her. 

For brunch, I just think two eggs, two little turkey sausages, a small cup of salad and a coffee isn't worth $15 when the two egg combo is typically $8.99. Though I will give them praise for accommodating my annoying diet...sort of."}
{"text":"Do you like diners? Don't like spending a ton for a good portion of food? Like your diner with a full bar? 
Fran's is the place for you then.
I've had breakfast here MANY times. My favourite times to go are late night. Its nice and quiet.
The booths are enclosed in their own little sections. It makes it feel really cozy.
I've had the same waitresses again and again. They are all really great. Make you feel like a valued customer.
The menu has some interesting things on it. Like orange chicken. Not what you usually expect in a diner. That's what's so great though. You can bring anyone here and they'll find something they really enjoy."}
{"text":"A basic, standard, long-standing dinner type, where lots of people go to before the shows at Massey Hall, Elgin or Cannon theaters. Meaning, this is subpar, but a basic, generic, consistent food place, and they are used to get customers served in time for the shows. Burgers, etc are OK. Nothing to crave or die but real table food (as opposed to the street's hot dog or burger fast food options around). 

If you are short in time, and wish only for such basic standard no-surprise food, that is OK.

Cleanliness of the restaurant could be improved. If you seat in a booth you can almost be sure to find stuffed, dirty paper towels or other litter items tucked between cushions or cushion and wall."}
{"text":"I like the Fran's restaurants, the Franschise, if you will (cheeeeeeessssee). This one, I think, is one of the original if not the very first Fran's in the city.  I have eaten here many times and recently enjoyed a 9 pm breakfast with a pitcher of cold beer on their patio and was reminded of how pleasant this place really is.  The ability to have breakfast at 9 pm with a cold beer out on the patio should be a requirement of every restaurant ever."}
{"text":"Cool that it's opened 24/7, the food is below mediocre though. Service didn't make the experience any better. Grateful for breakfast options at 3am I guess..."}
{"text":"There's not much you should expect from a 24 hour diner. They have a huge variety of selections, from breakfast food to burgers to pasta to...miso soup. No I didn't order the miso soup; i suspect if i did, i would take off a star..haha.

We had the rueben sandwich, poutine, and chicken finger with fries. When I asked if i could substitute fries with anything, the waitress just said, what do you want? I was like, erm...salad? and she said it would cost you. Not very helpful.

I like how easy it was to split the cheques though. One person asked for a separate bill and she gave us one bill with everything divided neatly. Very cool.

Food is average. If you're hungry at 3am, you really don't care what you're eating unless it's absolutely disgusting. amirite?"}
{"text":"Love me some Fran's, yes I do!  I am a non-fancy breakfast person for sure...just give me a good cup of coffee, 2 eggs over medium, white toast with butter, some crisp bacon and some kind of potato and I'm happy.   That is why Fran's makes me so happy.  My one and only complaint would be about the massive portions of fried potatoes.  There is just no way to finish them and I hate leaving a big pile of leftovers on my plate when I'm staying in a hotel and can't take them with me.  

We've always had excellent service, even at 3 a.m., and I love the cozy little booth compartments on the main level.  

Just watch that step down out to College Street from the exit door..woah!"}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and was pleasantly surprised with Fran's. I had the corn beef hash, my husband had a more traditional breakfast with eggs and ham. Both meals were delicious and good size portions. The service was friendly and quick, and we were not made to feel rushed as I've experienced at other breakfast places."}
{"text":"A downtown Toronto diner with a great patio? Sign me up! Discovered this gem a few weeks ago when I was passing through the area. 

I ordered the quarter pounder (or something like that) but was brought a banquet burger by mistake. Best mistake ever.  The banquet burger was one of the finest I've had in this city. Make sure to get the home fries as well. This meal was as filling as it was delicious. 

The price of a banquet burger and tall beer came out to ~$30 so I definitely won't be going back every week. But the good food and customer service definitely made it worthwhile.

Note: They covered the difference between the banquet burger and my original order. That's class."}
{"text":"Had a lovely breakfast on the patio here. I was skeptical about this place because their menu had so much going on. Think dinner style. You can have everything from burgers to breakfast. I selected breakfast and it was a damn good choice.
I had the waffles that came marinated in syrup with eggs and Bacon sliding across the syrup slick surface. The waffle was so rich I could hardly finish it. Lucky my meal ticket had no problem finishing the dripping waffle and picking up the low 20 dollar bill.

Come hungry and on a budget--leave painfully stuffed."}
{"text":"Half of my visits to Fran's have been after a night of heavy drinking while the other half has been in the morning after a night of heavy drinking. The shaman aka cook has the best cure for a hangover. It comes in the shape of Fran's Big Breakfast. You get a pair of toast, eggs, pancakes, bacon, sausages and a pile of home fries for under $10. I like that the servers are perfectly accustomed to handling a certain level of drunkard tomfoolery. I have always received the respect and kindness I don't deserve. In fact, they come by often to flash you a smile and top your coffee up for free.  

I would stir clear of their \"famous\" coke float. That is where I draw the line. Also, I have tried their eggs benny in the past and their hollandaise sauce did not taste right to me."}
{"text":"Hey guys. My boyfriend and I visited Frans for the first time a couple days ago. I had only heard great things, but was extremely dissapointed. 
We came in just before 11:30pm. we noticed a sign at the hostess stand asking for us to \"please wait to be seated\". we waited for almost 10 minutes before deciding to seat ourselves. (we both work in the service industry, and we realize how annoying that can be. but it was a well staffed restaurant and was not very busy). The server (an older bald gentleman with glasses, arm tattoos, and ear piercings) glared at us for a while before dropping two menus on our table and asking us who told us we could sit there, We explained that we waited for so long with out even being acknowledged. He told us it didnt matter, and that we should have waited. I asked how long he expected us to wait, and he said \"as long as it takes\"...... and then he just walked away from our table. we decided that we no longer wanted to stay at frans. on the way out we tried to explain to the server that we were leaving. he didnt even look at us, and just said okay and again walked away from us. 
After looking forward to dining at your restaurant we left, and have no intentions of ever coming back. 
Hopefully you will take this feedback seriously. That server SHOULD NOT BE WORKING FOR YOU!"}
{"text":"I, too, have a thing for greasy food at all hours, as well as jukeboxes. The food here is good, but never quite spectacular. But that's not what it's about, right? It's about the comfort food, and the comfort of food.  Items like lasagna, macaroni and cheese and burgers have, at some time, provided me with both. Although I must say that in the immediate aftermath of having the best lasagna in my life (in NYC's Little Italy), choosing here to satisfy the residual craving only bred disappointment. 

Whatevs, it's a Toronto institution, y'all. You've got to go sooner or later. The two locations are quite different from each other, the College St. one being appropriate for late-night philosophizing, and the Shuter St. one being particularly awesome after a concert at Massey Hall. 

This brings me to my most recent and quite memorable visit, post- Smashing Pumpkins as well as immediately post-Obama victory! I of no cable got to enjoy a side of historical television with my burger (which is far better than the relatively small salad you can subsititute for fries, for relatively too much money). Now that is what I call change we can believe in (I don't really know what that means)."}
{"text":"I had only been to one other Fran's in my life, (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/frans-barrie) and based on that visit I was willing to overlook all the glaring 1 and 2 star reviews.

To start, my service wasn't bad; granted my waitress was far from giving me the \"warm and fuzzies\" but she was adequately attentive.

As previously mentioned I had eaten at a Fran's before. As far as I could tell the menu was identical to the other one, so I ordered the calamari, knowing that it would be great. My order arrived and I already knew I had made a mistake by ordering this appetizer. The sauce was not thick and spicy... instead it was thin and oily like a vinaigrette. It tasted on but was more reminiscent of a calamari salad.

I sampled a few deep fried pickles and they were awesome. My entree, the deluxe BLT was pretty good.

Bottom line is that it was overall a good visit but I probably wouldn't go back unless I am craving a late night snack. These guys are open 24/7."}
{"text":"Sometimes I love my friends and sometimes they plan get together at Frans which makes me question not only their mental state but use of common sense! 

Let me set the tone for my tale of disaster....
-Co-worker's going away gathering
-She doesn't drink
-We get off work at midnight
-We are a group of 25
-We'll be hungry!

So Fran turns out to be one of the hand full of places in the city that will accommodate such a list of requirements (notice good food is not on the list or else we'd be screwed!)

We made a reservation for 25 at midnight a week in advance and showed up as planned. When we arrived the manager had his head down on the counter and his staff was flipping chairs onto the tables.... 

Turns out they've had one couple in the last two hours and decided to close the kitchen early (they close at 2am)... WITHOUT CHECKING TO SEE IF THEY HAD A RESERVATION! So as our group starts trickling in via car, bike and TTC the manager begins to panic and offers to have a table set at the Victoria street location. We had originally tried to get a table there in the first pace via phone but we were told they could not accommodate such a large group on a concert night.

The manager gave us $13 in taxi fair which was nice but only allowed 4 of us to make it to the new location without forking over more $$$. He also requested for us to have a table for 25 setup at the other location.

Though I think the manager dealt with the problem in the most adequate way possible... I feel this could have been avoided if they had just read their reservation book or called us in advance. If it was just me and a few friends I might have given this one 2 stars but for inconveniencing a group of 25.... 1 star seems fair!"}
{"text":"How can I forget to review Fran's!? Every Toronto human should know and have been to Fran's at least Once! I've been with my friends, on drunken club night out.. I usually get the simple eggs, sausage and toast and the Milkshake!! It's the only thing I can safely say about Fran's.. The Milkshakes are Delicious and they are open freaking Late!"}
{"text":"Found this place while looking for a patio near Massey hall. Going to see classic albums live Rush 2112 show with by buds. Great food beer and service. Several types of craft beer. Great evening menu. Good view. Hostess was nice to fit us in at end of patio on last table. Waiter was awesome. I will be back. Prices very good. Thanks."}
{"text":"Pretty good, I prefer other diners to be honest. The prices are ok but not fantastic and the food isn't anything to write home about. That being said the service was great and quick!"}
{"text":"Been here three times so far and each time has been good to above average. Most recently ordered the Morning Glory Waffle which was good, but a smidge displeased that it came drowned in syrup (personal preference to take care of that myself). Last,  minor gripe is the relatively small amount of fruits."}
{"text":"I retract my nice review of Fran's! I think I was nice because I hadn't actually been there in about a year, and had not witnessed the downward spiral of this place.

Let me paint a picture for you: Brunch. Friday around noon. Restaurant is NOT full, yet there is a lineup out the door because the hostess is ignoring all the people at the door.

Finally, we are seated. And we sit. And sit. And sit. Seriously? There were three waitresses in our section and not one of them even said, \"Hey, we're a little swamped right now, give me a minute and I'll take your drink order.\" If someone had said that, I would have been fine. Instead, I saw a couple who were seated AFTER us get their coffees before someone had even said hello.

Needless to say, we walked out. I don't go to a restaurant to be ignored, I go there to eat. Bye-bye Frans. Your food is not worth waiting around for, anyway."}
{"text":"Fran's has a cozy spot in Toronto's history, and I'm not here to take that away from them. This is the \"historic\" Fran's where a couple aunts and uncles of mine went on their first dates, where I first learned the glory of late night food, and where I later learned that late night food is all too often accompanied by obnoxious people.

This location in particular, is usually filled with obnoxious 19-year-old GTA-ers, out to celebrate someone's birthday, looking for food at 3 am when the clubs close. And that's fine, it's just not my cup of tea.

The food at Fran's is decent diner food. They have the typical all-day-breakfast, tons of different sandwiches and other assortments, and none of it is bad, but none of it stands out as phenomenal, except the milkshakes. You MUST get a milkshake from Fran's to fully understand the meaning of milkshakes.

Breakfast-wise, they do a good job, but I'm not a huge fan of the home fries -- I find them low on the flavour scale but high on the grease scale. Tip the scales and I'd like them a lot more.

If you're coming to Toronto, you have to come to Fran's at least once (especially for a milkshake). If you like dingy diners, the College St location is for you, but I tend to lean towards the newer, cleaner one on Shuter, although they don't have the Banana Chocolate Chip pancakes there for some strange reason."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my meal here. The food is well made and hearty. Fun diner decor helps to wind down after a party. 

I would say it's good for when I don't want to deal with oily denny's food or the overpriced 7 west cafe in the area. 

I had the chili with garlic bread, very good combination of freshly baked bread and a deep flavour chili.

My S.O. had the montreal smoked beef sandwich with eggs potatoes and fruit. I enjoyed trying it but was happier with the harder hitting flavour of the chili."}
{"text":"There are things I love about this diner and things that make me shrug and go 'meh'.
Let's start with the good:  Open late night, fast service, lots of seating, and all-day breakfast.
The average:  Food and decor.

My friends and I venture here when there's nothing else open that serves up a meal. Depending on when you swing by, there might be a bit of a wait. However, it isn't always long because they've got a lot of seating. The service is pretty good considering how busy it can get. My favourites are the sweet potato fries, breakfast, and cakes. All the other menu items are quite average. 

I wish the food was more delicious, but Fran's is Fran's. It's a place you should go to at least once during those crazy nights or even a pretty wild day."}
{"text":"Trustworthy..It's the diner vibe you crave..The sounds, the smells, the crazy fast and quick wait staff.  The food is just the cherry on top.  All day breakfast options, classic diner fair.  It delivers time after time .  No frills, just satisfying eats."}
{"text":"I haven't come here for anything other than breakfast but that's okay! The portions are massive for breakfast at least, and everything is what you'd expect. I wouldn't say the quality is above average or anything, but portion size is important! The design of the place is nice and retro. It seems like it's built for tourists. The service was fine. This place would  be a 3/5 but the huge portions bumps it up for me."}
{"text":"I'm an American and I know diners. This was a fantastic diner AND was open on thanksgiving (which, as a silly American, I had no idea about when I went searching for food). The host was fun and silly with me as I was silly with him. My order came out super quickly and I DEVOURED it all. 

My favorite part is the all day breakfast. I have a weakness for benedicts and holy moly they had AN ENTIRE PAGE of them. I had the eggs Benedict with steak and asparagus and it was heavenly. 

Got good food for a very reasonable price on a holiday- I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Coming from New Jersey I equate this to a diner experience. Service was good and going there for breakfast I had something simple -- an omelette. Though enjoyable the whole presentation looked too perfect for me. (as in McDonald's or Denny's) I was hoping for something a little more homemade like and this is not the case."}
{"text":"Definitely one of my go-to breakfast places in Toronto! The food is amazing, the service is great, and the people are super kind and outgoing! It's typical diner food, but it's definitely higher quality and won't leave your stomach in shambles."}
{"text":"One of the only places in Toronto that serves vegetarian sausages, so I already knew I loved this place. Unfortunately this location is definitely my least favourite Fran's location out of the three that I've visited - it's really crammed and the atmosphere makes you feel a bit rushed. Still a great place to grab breakfast food, but I'd recommend trying one of the other locations if you're nearby"}
{"text":"This location is good, but definitely seems like the most inexperienced location out of the three I've been too. Location is great (so close to Union + Sony Center!) and there's a very nice patio as well, but some of the servers are more inexperienced here compared to the other locations. Food is still as great as the other locations, from what I've had, and I'd definitely come back again."}
{"text":"I live frans. Been coming here for years and probably tried all of their breakfast items on the menu.

Their home fries are the bomb..... seriously and love the 50 styles diner look plus it's 24 hours which means breakfast at any time of the day.

Must check this place out for sure.  A toronto favorite."}
{"text":"First off, let me say I really enjoy going to the Fran's on College Street.

So, it wasn't a huge leap in logic to assume that this Fran's would also be fun & delicious.  Unfortunately - I was quite incorrect.

Our server was grumpy (she mumbled, scowled, & slammed down out various glasses & plates).  We never received the waters we requested.

I'm lactose-intolerant.  This is an important part of the story, because I only use my 'lactose points' for things I know will be totally worth it (ie: old-school milkshakes, cheesecake, etc.)  I ordered up a chocolate milkshake with confidence.  It arrived lacklustre entirely in the silver 'extras' cup with a straw.  I shrug it aside & take a sip.  Ick!  Water-y chocolate milk.  There was nothing shake-y about it.  I refused to drink the rest of it, but didn't send it back as I was wary of our server's attitude.

This was the first time in my life I haven't tipped.  Don't go here; put in the extra leg work to get to the other Fran's."}
{"text":"You may or may not have read my negative review of what I shall refer to as the \"Icky Fran's\" from this point onward.

I revisited the College Street location to seek out my mojo - the diner milkshake.  I was hesitant to order one after my last experience, but went for it (chocolate, if you must know) & waited for the moment of truth.

It arrived.  It was a true blue milkshake.  & it was delicious.  I was so relieved that I explained my giddyness to our server about my Icky Fran's experience.

Fran's @ College has redeemed it.  From now on, I'll know where to head for my 24-hour-diner needs.  While it isn't the classiest food or the most upscale joint - Fran's fills their niche perfectly."}
{"text":"It was OK.  Nothing extraordinary.  The usual comfort food everyone is used to.  Maybe it was me, but I haven't been there in ages and it looked a bit updated.  I had sweet fries and Reuben, I think, and I found the sweet fries dry."}
{"text":"Bad service at the upper deck. We waited for 10 minutes and they completely ignore us. Really bad experience that I do not recommend."}
{"text":"Came here after watching a late night movie with my cousins and it was a nice place.  Food was good (but not memorable) service decent,  and it was warm (considering it was a cold night) .  They brought the food to us quickly and didn't say anything to us when we were laughing really loudly at YouTube videos.  

Overall good experience"}
{"text":"Always a great breakfast. Service fast and efficient. The place to have a great home cooked breakfast."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had an enjoyable time at Fran's. We biked from my condo, so we were good and hungry upon our arrival. When we walked up to the hostess, she warned us there would be a half hour food wait, which we decided was still ok. We ordered mimosas to start, which took a few minutes to come out to us. After a toast to our fun weekend, we enjoyed the mimosas while waiting for our food. I don't think we even had to wait half an hour, and before we knew it, we had our meals in front of us. (Delivered by a different waitress, however, which bothers me).

We both ordered the Big Breakfast which included 2 eggs, bacon, home fries, sausages, toast and pancakes. Normally I'm not a big eater, but I ate everything other than one pancake. I thought it tasted great! The rye bread was toasted to perfection, my over-easy eggs were the perfect runny-ness and the bacon was the perfect crispness. The sausages were slightly too chewy, but that's difficult to achieve on any given day. 

The reason I give it a 3/5 was the waitress seemed distracted and uninterested in us, and the blazing sun was beating down on my back while eating, and there were no extra free umbrellas. When I went inside and asked a waitress for our bill, she said she would get it, but didn't! Then I asked another waitress, with the same result! Finally our waitress came out and asked if we wanted the bill. We politely said yes, but rolled our eyes internally. My boyfriend proceeded to tip her 5 percent."}
{"text":"I came here one morning wanting breakfast and seeing as Fran's was close to my building, I thought it'd be a perfect new breakfast place. We walked in and were immediately seated towards the back of the restaurant. After looking at the menu for a few minutes, no one had stopped by our table of two to ask if we wanted drinks or anything to start. 

Before I continue my review, keep in mind I'm not the type of person to expect over the top or even great service. I don't get frustrated having to ask for drink or water refills and if I only see you at the beginning and and at the end of our meal, that's all I need. 

After seeing servers go to the tables around us and not even attempting to look in our direction even though we were trying to signal for them, I was starting to get frustrated. The diner wasn't exceptionally busy either; we went early after opening so there were only a handful of people. 

After 10 minutes of waiting, someone finally put down some water for us and before I could even open my mouth to ask to order, she was gone and out of earshot. We were clearly seated in an area where no one could see us signal for them so finally, I had to get up and walk over to someone to ask to have our orders written down. 

That was the extent of service we got. If I had known I had to approach someone to get my order in, I would have gladly done so from the get go. But the fact that I waited 15-20 minutes before someone even acknowledged us was a waste of my time and that's my biggest pet peeve. 

I have a two star because of the food and the ambiance. The food was your typical diner breakfast which is always satisfying to me and the ambiance made you feel like you walked into a small town diner joint. Prices are reasonable as well. 

I tried really hard not to sound arrogant or contemptuous in my review because my intentions are never to purposely give a restaurant a bad review, but I was really disappointed with my experience here. Overall, I probably wouldn't come back because I value my time, especially in the mornings. Maybe we were missed and a server wasn't appointed to our table or there was miscommunication up front about us being seated there. Nevertheless, I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"This place has really gone tits up, hasn't it?

The service is abhorrent.

When my friend Joe L. used to work here it was decent, but after he quit I noticed that I actually dreaded being served (or more appropriately NOT served) because the servers are so inattentive and generally scatterbrained. 

Also, the number of typos and mistakes on the menu is frankly unacceptable.

The only reason people eat here is because they crave breakfast late at night. There ARE other 24 hour options in the city, people. Lakeview Diner, Reggie's, 7 West, King Palace, Sneaky Dee's (pretty much 24 hours), for starters. 

Whoever owns this Fran's location needs to be more discerning when it comes to hiring competent wait staff."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick breakfast after a long overnight shift. The service is friendly and my order of bacon egg sandwich was delicious. It came with free homemade fries and portion size is pretty big.  Overall, decent breakfast place and I would.come back if stop by College."}
{"text":"One word. Wow. The food is fantastic, the venue is fantastic, and the service is the best I've ever had. I ate the chicken parmigiana sandwich at my first visit, and it was presented nicely, at a good price, and tasted amazing. 10/10 would recommend. No, I insist. GO HERE NOW!!!"}
{"text":"Love the fact that they had a non-bread version of eggs Benedict with portobello mushroom. The egg was a bit too well-done and the holladaise sauce was not as creamy or flavourful. It was topped with raw purple onions that was too pungent & bitter. The staff were able to substitute the homefries side to slices of tomatoes for free. 

Otherwise, the diner itself is super vintage and cute."}
{"text":"There's a new Fran's around Yonge and Front in Toronto. And if you're unfamiliar with Fran's they're a known staple for breakfast and diner type foods. Their most popular location being on College and has expanded across the city.This location has been here for a couple of months and is located in a very cliché area. It is surrounded by steakhouses and close to the busy business downtown core. So is it out of place or perfect placement, debatable.  Either way we were in the location so we got a table for a weekday dinner.

The interior is an upgrade to their typical decor. It's been catered to fit in with the surrounding restaurants and clientele. We order quickly as we were starving. I got the fran's legendary banquet burger with all the typical toppings (ketchup, mayo, lettuce, tomato, pickles and onions) with home fries.  Angela got Monte Cristo which is french toast with ham, turkey and swiss that's grilled with home fries. My sis got the chicken parm sandwich with fries. We also got a basket of onions rings to start off with which sits well with the sis. =P. The wait wasn't bad at about 10 mins before the onion rings came and another 5-10 for the rest of the entrees. Our waitress was all really nice and there's a number of lcds to catch the local game.

The onion rings were the big pub style version with large onion rings. My sis is more of the \"Harvey's\" type where the batter and onion rings are infused well together striking a good balance. She doesn't like it when the onions are strongly present. And I have to say they're okay but I too prefer \"harvey's\" type of onion rings.  My burger was surprisingly good. I mean I wasn't expecting much so maybe that helped. But it was a solid burger and they cooked it well too. Wasn't dry and it did in fact remain as a moist patty.  And home fries as side, yess pleasee. One of the benefits of going to fran's?  Home fries as a side option and they weren't bad at all.

For the ladies, angela enjoyed her monte cristo.  Was it a fatty choice, ohh you betcha. Not only was it fatty in nature but she also chose to pour a fair amount of maple syrup on top. Another unexpected surprise was just how well the ham, turkey and swiss went with the also moist french toast.  I myself would have wanted more meat, but Angela seemed happy with the amount. And tho 100% fatty and non heart-attack friendly, the maple syrup did definitely help to bring all the taste to a full circle. I too am guilty of enjoying more with the maple syrup. My sis's chicken parm was definitely wayyy too big for her. She's a tiny eater unlike myself and Angela.  She ended up having to pack about half her dinner. The chicken parm wasn't bad and was definitely saucy.  But it wasn't anything special and tho saucy and filled with cheese (thumbs up), I somehow just expected more. As well her fries weren't very good. I know she ended wishing she had gotten a salad or home fries instead.

Overall, fran's was not bad at all. The price is manageable and it's in an expensive area of downtown. Having fran's as an option is definitely nice for peeps working dt and want to have something before heading home. Yess it's a diner so definitely not the healthiest and yes it's greasy, but I liked it.  The only dish which was a little let down was the chicken parm, but still it wasn't horrible. Just average at best. So I welcome fran's to a location that needs food that isn't starting at $20-30 a dish. It's in a very cliché and business oriented area, so Fran's against all odds, I hope you make it."}
{"text":"We were seated right away, and our server was very attentive and were not short of any refills at any time. I got the chicken and waffles, while my dad got the shrimp florentine benedict, and my mom got the scrambled croissant. We split everything amongst the 3 of us and it was all so delicious. I was stuffed all morning. The prices were very reasonable. My dad wanted to come back here again the next day, but he knows I like to try new places."}
{"text":"Not a heck of a lot to say about this place. Fast Service, huge portions, open 24hrs, right in downtown Toronto. Has the ambiance of a bus terminal, but don't hold that against good 'ol Frans. Prices are all very reasonable.

Don't expect to loose any weight by eating here, but do expect to leave full and not too broke. In terms of 24h, all-day-breakfast, Diners, Frans is the benchmark."}
{"text":"Food is decent but service can be hit-or-miss, depending on who you get and what night you go you might get great service food coming out within 10-15 minutes or you might get terrible service with no coffee top-ups and everyone waiting around to settle up the bill at the end of the night. They're open 24/7 but don't expect service byond Golden Griddle levels, despite the 1950s kitsch..."}
{"text":"Great place to have a quick breakfast/brunch. Typical diner with typical diner food. Service is quick and good. You can't really expect too much from a franchised diner so I give it 5 stars!"}
{"text":"I guess this place is famous in Toronto or something.  They get points for being open 24 hours, but I don't know, I just wasn't feeling the place.  Don't get me wrong, my waffles with 2 eggs sunny side up with bacon and caramelized apples was really good, but I get I expected a lot, since I had heard a lot about this place.  My fruit smoothie was good, but not great.  The service was really mediocre.  The bathrooms were confusing as HELL to get to.  You have to grab a card, and open the door a certain way and slide the card again, ARGH, why is going to the bathroom this difficult?!? I'm glad the bathroom was clean when I got there.

I realized while eating that I probably shouldn't have gotten the extra side of toast, since the waffle was sufficient to sop up the eggy remains.  I can't really pinpoint what I didn't like about it, maybe it was too sweet? Maybe the eggs were too runny? There was just something about Fran's that didn't do it for me.  Maybe it was the price? It was about $36.00 for the two of us, which isn't exactly cheap, especially for what we were getting in terms of ambiance and food.

I probably wouldn't rush to come back here.  Yes, if you are a drunk college student, I see the appeal of some good waffles and eggs after a night of partying.  But I'd probably head somewhere else before I decide to come back to Fran's.  Or maybe I'll have better luck at the original location on College Ave?"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Fran's for years and the brunch is always good.

Just whatever you do, do not order off the dinner menu. It's soggy, bland, and clearly made with microwaved frozen food."}
{"text":"What's not to love about Fran's?

A \"go-to\" for late night eats and brunches alike, they serve a little bit of everything; and the menu is HUGE. As you can imagine, with so many items on offer it may be a bit \"hit or miss\" although I have enjoyed everything I've tried on the menu.

Generally, prices are reasonable and on-par with other options in the area.

Personally, I am a BIG fan of their Mac & Cheese, whih comes with a small piece of garlic toast. It's very rich, but worth every step on the treadmill!

Service is generally very good, although at peak times (Sunday morning) there can be a bti of a wait.

Four stars as at times cleanliness does leave a bit to be desired (clearing tables, wiping down surfaces) but overall the ambiance here is retro and quite clean."}
{"text":"Visited here for breakfast. Waited 15 minutes in line. Looked like a busy spot! I had high hopes!

I ordered two sunny side up eggs , hash browns , sausage and orange juice. 

I had to send my eggs back as they were raw  - I mean the whites weren't cooked! They were still opaque. Really? If your cook is sending out 50% raw eggs- they should go back to school. 

The orange juice was great. Everything else was ok."}
{"text":"Members of my office have attended this restaurant several times mainly due to its proximity to us.  It has been a running joke for sometime how they always manage to screw up at least one order.  This is a place that has been resting on its laurels for too long.  The food isn't even that special and the prices are inflated.  The last straw was today, Dec 16th, 2016.  Two days ago we called ahead to make reservations for our group(yes we confirmed it was this location).  When we arrived, they had no record of the reservation and their unapologetic explanation was that whomever took the call forgot to write it down.  \"Sorry, half an hour wait if you wish to be seated.\"  So, we walked up the street to \"The Coach house\" (Yonge and Wellesley on the west side) where they immediately seated us.  The food was spectacular and reasonably priced.  This will be our go-to place from now on and we will not be returning to Fran's."}
{"text":"A Toronto classic.  Our visit to Frans was a classic diner experience. They had the same classic menu with all of the classic dishes.  We enjoyed the French onion soup and smoked meat sandwiches.

We will go back if in the mood for comfort food."}
{"text":"Great place the best part food came out so fast and great costumer services!!!
Food was good the only down is no wifi
Once the owner care or appreciate the costumers by adding wifi I will do 5 stars."}
{"text":"Stopped in after a late night out. Ordered, then waited an hour until 4am, only then to learn the kitchen staff had quit earlier in the middle of the shift. No announcement from the waiter or apologies from the manager who we finally managed to lure out of hiding in the back - he just sort of shrugged his shoulders indignantly, offering no further explanation. At that point, we just left. Pretty awful from a  customer service stand point.

As for the food, I guess I'll never know. #BetterPlacestoEat"}
{"text":"A cute 50s chain restaurant that my parents love taking me to.   I enjoy the vibe, and the decor quite a lot, as well as the service.

I had eggs benedict, and there was no option to ask for a soft poached egg.   My eggs were more of a medium poach, and with way too much hollandaise sauce (presumably to mask the stale english muffins)  

Overall, it was just a meh experience, nothing unique or amazing about this place."}
{"text":"Average to nice vibe, same with the food, but service was great and I'm giving them 4 instead of 3 stars because they were open so early New Year's Day!! Thank god! Had to leave town early and was starving. Pro Frans, very Pro. I wouldn't not come back if I wanted an egg breakfast and was near by."}
{"text":"Positively dreadful. The service was poor, coffee was worse and the food was greasy and overpriced. I would avoid."}
{"text":"My friends and I stopped by here on a chilly night at around 8pm. Initial impressions of the place were positive as the decor was nice and was warm and inviting. The place was busy but not packed so I expected to be seated right away but we had to wait a few minutes to be seated as there was no one out to greet us and show us to our booth. As a small line was forming, we were finally shown to our booth which was nice and comfy but that's not too important as we came famished and ready to devour some food. The only problem was that our waiter either forgot about us or just taking his sweet time to give us the menu when he said he'd be back with them. After 5 mins we asked for the menu from a different waiter and a new, prettier waitress was placed in our section. She was very attentive and courteous  to us throughout the whole dining and redeemed the service portion of this review. 

I ordered the French onion soup and the Shephard's pie while my friends had the meatloaf and the chicken parmigiana. Food comes really fast.

The soup was good (maybe I was just starving) but could have been a lot hotter coming out. The slice of baguette was kinda small for the serving dish and was too far submerged that it couldn't get the cheese on top nicely broiled. I liked the kick in flavour that the fresh herbs added (I think it was either thyme or rosemary) but it's overpowered by excessive use of what I can only imagine as Worcestershire sauce as there was a very prominent vinegary aftertaste. 

The  Shepherd's pie with veggies on the side was tasty but has an aftertaste surprisingly similar to the soup which leads me to believe there is an excessive use of Worcestershire sauce in an attempt to maximize flavour and broaden the depth of  flavour. The mash could have used a little more butter in it and more time under a broiler to get a nicer colour and crispness. overall, it's tasty  for what it is but feels kind of one dimensional.

My friends seemed to have thoroughly enjoyed their food and rated it a 7 out of 10.

overall, I enjoyed the experience here save the service blunder at the beginning. It's OK food at and OK price and is great when you're really hungry and just need some comfort food. I'd give it an 2.5 but round up to 3 stars because I liked the decor and feel of the space. I'd come back to see what other stuff on the menu tastes like because the all day breakfast menu looks really good."}
{"text":"I love me some good diner food and Fran's definitely fills the void. Whether it be breakfast, lunch, dinner or a late meal Fran is open 24/7 and has not let me down yet. There's something soo comforting about cozying up one in one of there plush cream leather booths at a large blue diner table while noshing on some homestyle greasy diner grub.

Menu items I've ordered include

Chicken Parmigiana Sandwich
Lightly breaded chicken breast topped with tomato sauce &
mozzarella cheese. Served on a baguette.

Grilled Chicken and Bacon Panini
Seasoned chicken, avocado, tomato, bacon, and Jack cheese.

Gourmet Deli Smoked Meat Sandwich
Served on marble rye, garlic pickles, coleslaw. 

Corned Beef Hash
Lean corned beef sautéed with potatoes, onions & spices
served with 2 eggs any style, homefries & toast.

Coconut Cream Pie
The best cream pie in town! Made with real cream.

Food comes out hot, large portion size, simple and delicious. Service has always been great here, it's a diner with diner food...what more could you expect? The coconut cream pie is phenomenal here....definitely the best!

FYI Washrooms are shared with Pantages Martini Bar."}
{"text":"Pretty good place overall as offer spaghetti for breakfast!

Food was decent for flavor and quality as well as portion size.

Service was fast and efficient.

Prices were fine for downtown Toronto."}
