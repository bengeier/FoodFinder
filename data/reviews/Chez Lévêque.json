{"text":"Delicious, warm and fulfilling experience. Our waiter, Doris, was amazing. I think she participated a lot in the overall satisfaction of our evening. My guests and I stayed there for 3hrs, great time! I had the foie de volaille entrée (3,5/5), the AAA steak (4/5) and a 2009 Bordeaux (4,8/5), Service 5/5. I recommend !"}
{"text":"Food's good but the waiters are way too laid back and even impolite at times.  One waiter is looking insistently at my girlfriend. Not that I am jealous or that I lack confidence but they shall know when to behave like they are in a bar and when to behave like they are at work. I went twice there and the same waiter was intensively checking out female customers every time.  The other waiter wouldn't take my order properly as he was standing very far from me when taking notes (like I was apparently supposed to shout at him to say what I wanted). He did dare arguing with me that I shall have said something as soon as I noticed that he wasn't proposing me the proper sauces accompanying my meal...  It's the french school of waiting, where being impolite is accepted. The difference is that, in France, tipping 15% of the bill is not the norm. I'm waiting for much more coming from a supposedly chic establishment (at last when one looks at the prices).  Montreal does not lack of good restaurants with servers providing great service. I'm definitely not going back to Lemeac before a long time."}
{"text":"I had the 8oz rib steak. It was served up with a béarnaise sauce, steak fries and market vegetables. It was perfectly pink and tender, well rested and exactly how I ordered it. Only complaint was that they missed the rubbery connective tissue in the butchering, I remained calm as I pulled what seemed like dental floss out of my steak."}
{"text":"My friend who lives in Montreal recommended this secret little gem while we were visiting in the summer. We were looking for French food but less expensive than what your generic google search would spit out. I really gotta give them 5 stars as my experience was impeccable.  The food was excellent at every point along the way. Several different kinds of locally baked breads and a wide wine selection, along with our waiter who recommended a great wine choice, which made way for several different appetizers for each person's taste. I got the escargots which were far better than ones I had tried previously, made with a simple garlic and butter sauce. Their basic salad with other prix fixe meals was also lovely, and the cheese plate was great as well.  Choosing my actual entree was not as simple. Had I asked more questions, perhaps I would have chosen differently, but one of the specials was locally-sourced crab legs. That I got to crack myself. And wear a bib. In public.  Anyway, goes without saying that it was flawless. The crab was in a classic butter sauce and it matched the other veggies on the dish perfectly. Highly recommended from myself, although they may not have it when not in season.  Lastly, as a visitor and English-speaker, being in Montreal is always a little tricky. I speak some French, however I was with my brother and his girlfriend who were not as versed in the menu and style of dining. As rude as some people were in some parts of Quebec, the waitstaff and bartenders at Chez Leveque were very accomodating and really wanted to give us the best experience possible and bridge the language gap.  I really can't say enough great things! I loved it there and it was a very pretty interior. The upstairs is a little more laid back for group events and the bathrooms are modeled after a church. It just works, don't ask me how."}
{"text":"One of the best meals we (connoisseurs, to use the 'French ' word) have ever had! Try the goat cheeZ salad, salmon, lobster rol (if in season) and wine, of course. Awesome service, great ambience, all in all a \"parfait\" nite~~~ PS let US eat cake"}
{"text":"We live in the neighborhood and been there quite often. It used to be ok, a reliable place, not too fancy but efficient and pleasant. But now you just have to avoid it. Service is surreal. Invasive waiters trying to please beyond rationality, mingling into private conversations and filling your glasses every two seconds (clearly the objective is to boost the tap and hence their tip). Yet unable to write a correct order down, leaving the table unattended while ordering. Huge wait between dishes, with kids waiting 1.30 hour before getting any food (the waiter realizing that they offer kids menus after 30 minutes, bringing them an slowing down, once again, all the process). Food ok, standard brasserie fare, but then ugly dessert straight from the fridge. And if it is Saturday, a stupid techno music as if it was a club. You ask for volume to be turned down, just to be able to have a conversation, and after 2 minutes is up again. It's a brasserie not a disco! Kitchen clearly overwhelmed by patrons. And they even tell you, \"sorry but tonight it is a mess\". No manager in sight capable of taking any responsibility, offering an apology or a partial reimbursement as a courtesy.  DON'T GO THERE! Unless it comes back to what it used to be."}
{"text":"Very nice restaurant. The food was delicious! Unfortunately, that night our waiter didn't know the new wines offered so we missed an opportunity to match a special wine with the food. Other than that, it was really really nice!"}
{"text":"Classic \"brasserie\". A bit overpriced... but good. The $21 Menu Lunchtime and 9 P.M. is a good deal..."}
{"text":"This is a wonderful place!  My boyfriend and I had dinner here after opting out of reservations across the street at Lameac, which had been recommended to us by our hotel's concierge, but which was far too loud and and busy for our tastes (I expect summer is better with the patio access -- in winter, the main room is oppressively loud.)  Everything about Chez Leveque was just perfect: our waiter was fantastic, the food was delicious, and the overall atmosphere was warm and inviting, especially after a long, cold walk from the metro.   As for the meal? Divine. My boyfriend had the French onion soup as a starter, and of course I had to try it. Amazing. For a main, he had filet mignon, which was perfect. I had the bouillabaisse, which was absolutely incredible, and full of salmon, red snapper, clams, and mussels (and one slightly over-cooked shrimp.) The soup came with a side of toasted bread, cheese, and a sauce, which you were supposed to submerge in the soup, but I thought that was over-kill for what was a superb soup.)  Neither of us had dessert, but the selection looked delicious.  Two tips:  1. If you go, and if you're on a budget, note that they do a $21 fixed price menu after 9:00. Before 9:00, the place is full of considerably older folks (as noted by another reviewer), but after 9:00, younger couples came in to dine.   2. This place has one of the more amusingly themed washrooms I've seen. The restaurant has a slightly religious motif going on (not sure why), and the washrooms are worth checking out."}
{"text":"Très bon restaurant français. Un bon lunch sur semaine ! Les frites sont incroyables. Coup de cur pour les chants grégoriens qui jouent dans les salles de bain !   C'est un endroit classique avec une clientèle assez âgée (50+).  Tout de même dans les bons resto francais à Montréal!"}
{"text":"Ahhh ! Enfin un bon restaurant.  Le service est parfait. La bouffe est très bonne et en quantité suffisante.  Très cher restaurant mais qui vaut le coup."}
{"text":"I went with a friend during Taste Mtl so we both got the set menu. The staff was very friendly and very helpful!  First, the appetizers. We both got the tuna albacore tartare and it tasted so good! The tartare was wonderful and it went well with the cucumber salad and the other ingredients! Very light, but had a distinct taste which I absolutely loved.  For the main dishes, I got the duck and it was just so good! The cut of the duck, the sauce, everything was just right. I was just speechless because it was that good. My friend got the maple glazed scallops and it was really good too. The right seasoning, not too salty, just perfect. I'm very satisfied with the food.  And finally, for the desserts, we got the maple macaron with passion fruit sorbet which was very sweet and delicious, I'm a big fan of macarons so I was happy that it was fresh and not stale. I was a bit disappointed with the brownie but it was still very good and simple because I wanted more.  I will definitely go back again to try the other dishes and the desserts, that's for sure!"}
{"text":"The menu is French , I tried the dorade fish which is good but the salade de cresson not tasty and not fresh but as a whole everything not so bad , my friends had the tartare de saumon which is not as good either , the bisque d'homard was very salty ..the ambience is good the service was excellent ."}
{"text":"Franchement je suis déçu, entrée de pattes de crabe avec beurre à l'ail ( svp si votre ail n'est pas fraîche de grâce dégermer la ) ."}
{"text":"I've been going to Chez Lévêque for a while now for special occasion brunches such as father's or mother's day. We went today with my parents for my birthday brunch. I've never been disappointed with the food. It is delicious and well plated.  I have had the brioche which is delicious and today I had the egg benedict with smoked salmon which was superb.  The only downfall was the service. The waitress was attentive until we had finished our main meal at which point she completely forgot about us. I finally had to flag down another waiter who standing at the other side of the room. He seemed surprised that I was calling him over. I asked him to bring us desert menus.   She never apologized for our long wait, and was not very willing to help us which seemed strange since we were very polite with her!  The rest of the staff was a bit short as well."}
{"text":"I have been here several  times and I have a love-hate relationship with this restaurant.  Love: - Best French onion soup in the city - They bring you a sample of the tartare to make sure it is seasoned enough for you before serving it.  - The irony of the in-your-face Catholic inspired decoration, including the chanting playing in the toilets.  - Decent wine-list - Solid selection of oysters including a peep show of the shucking.  - Great option for after 21h late dinner. $21 after 21h  Hate: - I always feel judged when I'm there as my boyfriend and I do not fit the profile of the \"average clientele\" (Read: we are young, casual and non-caucasian lovers of French food) - There is an air of presumptuousness that can be suffocating - Inconsistency of the food. For example: today's eggs Benedict were solidly over-cooked and the hollandaise sauce was tasteless.   Overall, I can handle the snobbery when the food wows my taste buds. Today was not one of those occasions.   Must have: Onion Soup. After a city-wide tasting of all the onion soups there is to offer, Chez Lévêque makes the best."}
{"text":"I've walked by Chez Leveque (The Bishop's in English) several times over the years but never had dinner. So when we saw a recent deal we decided it was time to try it. And are we glad that we did! The maitre d' greated us warmly. Excellent bistro menu, the lobster bisque was superb. The service was excellent and attentive and the waiters really worked as a team. All the food was properly spiced. I'm usually not a fan of bistro, but this was excellent. Even the terrasse in front was so nice (with no smokers). The bread fresh, the water glass filled and the male waiter was so professional. Definitely recommended.  Oh.... and slip upstairs to the bathroom, the door glass is made to resemble a church window and there is ecclesiastical music playing. A very nice touch."}
{"text":"Love this place. A great back-up brunch resto (no lines ), excellent service, amazing oyster bar... it tends to skew a bit old but that's part of the charm..."}
{"text":"Fréquente ce restaurant français classique depuis plus de 40ans(la lucarne)nom,dessins et surtout les toilettes blasphématoires ,mais c'est aussi je crois le nom du proprio.clentele et service agréables ,carte de vins et prix corrects.les abats sont toujours au menu et réussis.merci"}
{"text":"chez leveque came highly recommended, but after reading a few reviews online i was a bit apprehensive. but after we checked the place out, i have to say i was pretty impressed!  first off, the bread was great and the busboy/waiter came by often asking if we wanted more. they had two options, regular baguette and a rye bread with nuts, both of which were great.   my friends and i went for the $21 after 9PM, which is a really reasonable price for an appetizer and a main dish (since usually, their entrees are in the 20-25 range). i had the french onion soup, which was great- tons of cheese, lots of flavor. maybe a bit too salty, though. i had the fish of the day, which was halibut. also really tasty and the sauce was perfect, but i'm afraid they overcooked the fish. it still tasted good, but the consistency wasn't exceptional because it was on the grill one or two minutes too long.   i also read a lot of bad things about the service, but i have to say all the waiters and waitresses we interacted with were cordial and efficient, so i definitely can't complain on that front.   overall a good experience, so i'd recommend it!"}
{"text":"Nous avons testé le \"menu après 21h\" un jeudi soir moi et ma gang de 6 personnes!  Le restaurant est très agréable, décoré façon brasserie parisienne chic!  Je le recommande à tous les français expatriés qui souhaiteraient renouer un peu avec les grands classiques de la cuisine, comme le boudin, le foie de veau, la terrine ou les magrets de canard.... Rien que d'écrire ces denrées me donnent l'eau à la bouche.... Je le conseille plus largement à toutes les personnes qui aiment la gastronomie....les mets sont préparés avec délicatesse et avec des produits  de grande qualité ultra frais!  Le service est très bon et chaque serveur est au petit soin avec chaque client!  Enfin j'ai un petit coup de cur pour mon dessert ...... la tentation au chocolat et son parfait à l'estragon.....et heureusement vu qu'une telle douceur coûte la bagatelle de 12$....et oui!!!!"}
{"text":"Service is a bit like a coach experience on a good airline. Food is like a business-class level experience on a subpar airline. Music is more reminiscent of a late-night crash in some horrendous club in Laval.  All in all, the After-9pm 21$ special is a fair deal. But come in earlier and pay more, you'll feel like a douche flying to Vegas for Christmas."}
{"text":"I've dined out here on several occasions, after nine o'clock of course, and here is what I have to say:   The food was, once again, spectacular. They never disappoint. When I go to chez leveque I always pick their more exotic plates. From the plating to the flavours, It's just perfect.  The decor has a controversial catholic religious theme which precisely matches the menus, washroom, and second floor. It perfectly flows throughout the restaurant.  The service is on point. As soon my girlfriend and I walked in, we were instantly greeted by two different waiters whom assured us that we will be seated within the next five minutes.  Moreover, of you mentioned them on Facebook or Twitter, you get a free drink! This restaurant has become my 2015 favourite restaurant."}
{"text":"Sommes toutes une expérience assez satisfaisante. Amateur de tartare, je n'ai pu résister à l'appel. D'ailleurs, le tartare de Chez Lévêque est semble-t-il légendaire.  Fait intéressant, c'est l'un des rares endroits ou l'on nous fait goûter le tartare avant de le servir question de l'assaisonner au goût de chacun.  Sans être extraordinaire, il est effectivement très bon. Mais nous sommes gâtés à Montréal au niveau tartare alors disons qu'il est dans l'honnête moyenne.  Les autres plats de la tablée était aussi bien mais pas extraordinaire.  Le service était super sympathique et le choix des vins intéressants.  Somme toute une belle soirée mais avec la qualité des restaurants montréalais, j'essaierais d'autres tables avant d'y retourné."}
{"text":"Était un 4 étoiles auparavant mais la qualité a quelque peu baissée. Clientèle agée d'outremont, beacoup de têres grises. Bon service et plats typiques de la cuisine française. Bon mais manque de finesse dans la présentation. Bons vins."}
{"text":"Delicious food. Terrible service.   Its one of my favorite places with constant great service and impeccable food, however it is the 2nd time I am being served by a waitress who has not tact and class expected from a high-end restaurant.   She tries to insert herself into your conversation and make inappropriate jokes while at the same time not being able to explain the menu properly.  At some point she was advising where to put the plate and telling we should have more wine in order to go dancing (and yes in fact she was making the dance moves to imitate that wine would make us super happy).   She forgot to refill the water however she was fast there to grab the check out of our hands and see what was the tip left to her.   Someone like this damages a reputation of such a great place and leaves a bad taste in your mouth despite great food.   So if you are lucky you will get one of the guys or a younger waitress who is good if you are unlucky like  we were then ...  be patient and try to ignore it (though it gets hard at a certain point)."}
{"text":"French food is my absolute favourite and this restaurant doesn't disappoint. This place has been around with the same ownership for 40 years and from appetizers to dessert, your stomach will thank you. Friendlier service than what one often gets at a true French resto/bistro. Best lobster bisque I've had in Canada, it's really something to be savoured and remembered."}
{"text":"Nous y avons été pour le menu du soir à partir de 21h, à 25$. Nous étions 6, nous avons tous pris des entrées et des plats différents, et avons tous été ravis. Tout était très bon, frais, recherché. Excellent service. Vin très bon à prix abordable pour ce genre de resto. Seul hic: desserts un peu cher (surtout les 3 boules de glaces à 10$, qu'on ne vous offre même pas en cas de fête...)"}
{"text":"Cela faisait près de 3 ans que je n'y avais plus mangé... mais l'ambiance est la même et la nourriture toute aussi bonne. Cette fois nous y étions avec notre 3 1/2!   Décor: 4/5  Thème central sur la liturgie décalée et ambiance de style brasserie parisienne. Sans être exceptionnel, le décor est chaleureux et recherché.   Service : 3/5 Notre serveur a été super attentionné à nos besoins notamment au niveau de la cuisson de la viande et de nos goûts en matière de vin. Seul bémol, il s'est trompé de garniture pour le plat de notre fille et nous avait dit ramener la bonne chose mais a complètement oublié.   Bouffe : 4/5 En substance, mousse de foie de volaille, coq au vin, entrecôte... tout était succulent et parfait. La carte des vins est très intéressante mais le choix pour les demi-bouteilles demeure limité et relativement cher.   Rapport qualité : 3/5 Les prix valent largement la nourriture mais la facture demeure élevée pour 2 repas complets. Notre demi bouteille suggérée par notre serveur était délicieuse mais équivalent au prix de certaines bouteilles présentes sur la même carte.  Avis final: 14/20 La note reflète ce que représente Chez Lévêque, une valeur sure. Toujours un bon choix mais pas bon marché."}
{"text":"My boyfriend isn't too big of a fan when it comes to French food simply because of the portion sizes for the price you pay, so it was a great thing that they had a special 9pm menu.. Nicely located in Laurier, it has a very romantic ambiance. Or maybe because we were seated by the windows and it was a rainy night.  Good : The food is excellent, from appetizers to main course. The service was very good too.  The veal tongue slivers will not disappoint!   Bad : I cannot recall anything bad about this place.   Bottom Line : Oh, I will definitely return. If you enjoy French cuisine, this is definitely the spot. Great for dates!"}
{"text":"Four of us had dinner on Valentines weekend.  The place is bustling and was packed.  The secret to getting a nice table downstairs is to book an early table at 6:30PM.  It's very reasonably priced for quality French bistro food, especially if you eat off their Table D'Hote menu.  We were all served with a giant macaroon for dessert. What a treat!"}
{"text":"First, if you are staying in Old Montreal, this is NOT close and there are many good/better restaurants closer.  That said, if you are staying in the area, it's not a bad choice.  Onion Soup had enough onion (hard to find), but was missing key spices.  Salads looked good.  One odd thing: the English menu wasn't current. In short, OK, but there are better."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. Moderate sized portions of tasting high quality food. Bread served with olive spread and butter, get a second portion, nice! We had shrimp app, dinners: lobster and scallops/shrimp. Glass of wine and sparkling water. Dessert included with scallop dinner, an apple pie, very tasty. With Capp coffee.  Waiter was very attentive.  Tre Bien."}
{"text":"This is a great place for a casual upscale meal. I highly recommend coming after 9pm for their late-night menu (21 dollars for two courses and 6 dollar drinks). Even if you come outside of this time, it's still wonderfully priced for the quality of food you're getting. The deserts are wonderfully tasty, rich, but not overly so, and the steak is to die for!"}
{"text":"J'ai découvert ce resto dans le cadre du passeport La Tablée (forfait sur Tuango).  Entrées: feuilleté d'escargot. Un peu salé. Portion parfaite. Croquette de parmesan. Ordinaire.   Plats: Rognon. Excellent! Sauce bien crémeuse.  Tartare de boeuf. Nous fait goûter pour rectifier l'assaisonnement avant de servir!   Desserts: tarte aux sucres et île flottante. OK, mais très bon!   Si je cote seulement la nourriture, je dirais 3 1/2, mais le service est tellement excellent que je pourrais donner un 4*. Le service est sympathique, courtois et amical...on se sent bien dans ce resto!"}
{"text":"L'endroit est sympa. Un peu cher pour un bistro (non pas un restaurant). Service minable (sans exagération). Je ne recommande pas, je n'y retournerais pas."}
{"text":"Chez Leveque is pretty special and an oddly spiritual experience.  We ventured in here for a late, prix fixe nosh. Two of three courses for I don't remember what price. Coming here was a fantastic idea. The service is great; the host is engaging, the server is attentive and on the ball with great recommendations. Clearly, the management knows how to train and/or hire.   They have a cool, tilted mirror on the ceiling over the oyster bar where you can watch the oyster boy shuck away.   Their drinks are inventive and themed after the seven deadly sins. I had the Luxuraire and L'envie, the latter of which was better.   For my appetizer, I selected the croquette salmon and veggies. It was pretty crunchy and the veggies were crisp and delicious. Crab cakes and frites for my main were decent, though I think the appetizer overshadowed it to a certain point. The presentation was great.   The restaurant itself is pretty interesting. The washroom has an antique prie dieu in the middle, the mirrors are cathedral-cut and you get the background score of some haunting monk chants while you go about your business.   As an aside, the worst-date-ever was in full motion at a nearby table for some poor woman. Some yelling ensued and staff handled the situation very professionally."}
{"text":"Nous avons ete bruncher un week-end et j'avoue que j'avais beaucoup d'attentes!   Service: 5 etoiles, rien a dire car notre serveur etait juste trop gentil.  Ambiance: beau resto, tendance bistro, lumineux.  Nourriture: c'etait bon, mais pas extra. Rapport qualite/gout/prix je donne un 2 etoiles. Serieux un brunch a presque 40$ par personne et offrir un pain doré sur le menu avec rien d'autre en accompagnement? Je peux pas dire que c'etait mauvais, mais pour le prix on s'attend a plus!   J'y retourne pas!"}
{"text":"Very full French menu.   Had tartare. V good. Boudin maison: excellent Service is warm and friendly. Better to reserve. Wine list is disappointing but nonetheless has choice."}
{"text":"Une institution de 40 ans qui jouit de son titre.  J'en ai fait la découverte lors de Montréal à Table.   Les bons points: les serveurs sont très sympas, malgré le chaos qui régnait ce soir là. Le menu offert était immense, ils ont allongé la liste pour l'événement pour offrir plus que 3 choix par section. Le décor est original.  Les aliments du menu sont de haute qualité : du homard, des escargots, etc...   Pourquoi j'ai été deçu? Parce que tous les aliments étaient soit noyés dans de la crème, soit dans l'huile ou les deux! Les desserts n'ont pas été montés lors de la commande, on a eu droit à du congelé... Je peux comprendre qu'on ne cuit pas un gâteau en 5 minutes mais la confiture, la crème, le sirop, l'alcool ou autres parties du dessert, devraient être frais et ajoutés avant la sortie du plat. Surtout pour le prix, je m'attendais à plus.   Ma sangria au vin mousseux était un désastre de jus trop acide avec des morceaux d'agrumes brunis... Nous étions pas les seuls déçus, j'ai entendu des commentaires de la table à côté de moi: \"Votre description du menu est plus délicieuse que le résultat.\"    Le but d'un événement comme celui-ci est de découvrir et de charmer une nouvelle clientèle. Bref, ils n'ont pas réussi."}
{"text":"This place is great.  They have the address wrong though; it's Laurier West (or Ouest).  One weird thing is that this place is always full of people in their 70's -- I guess mature people appreciate classy food.  I've eaten here about five times and it always impresses.  I would write more, but I'd rather that you experience it for yourself.  Do yourself a favor and get out of \"centreville\"."}
{"text":"Beau et bon restaurant français ! Déjà 40 ans ! Un des classiques à Montréal !"}
{"text":"Overall, I was disappointed in my experience at Chez Leveque. I was visiting Montreal to celebrate New Year's, and came here for lunch on January 1, with the desire to enjoy a classic French meal. While the service was nice and attentive, the food was overpriced and mediocre in my opinion.   As part of the New Year's special, we were unable to order a la carte -- there was a $55 per person 3 course menu (with selections) that we had to order from. We opted to do 2 of the prix fixe and then just order one of the plats at regular price (which we were allowed to do).   For our entrees, we had the blood sausage (quite good) and 6 baked oysters (which were not very warm). Plats -- magret de canard (which was overcooked), quenelles (oversalted unfortunately) and tartare de cerf (pretty good, interestingly sweet). Dessert -- chocolate lava cake with ice cream (quite good) and almond merengue.   The bill came out to ~$200 which I felt like wasn't quite worth it. The food was fine, and the service was very good, but we felt that we could have gotten better value for what we paid."}
{"text":"Old crowd so don't bring a date there in your 30's food is ok i saw a tv show about a chef working there not too experimented would give a second chance though"}
{"text":"Le Brunch \"totalement divin\" est bon. Toutefois, tous les produits ne sont pas frais du jour et le prix demandé est peut-être un peu trop élevé. Ça reste une belle place pour le Brunch du dimanche, mais il est préférable d'y aller avant 11h."}
