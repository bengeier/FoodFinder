{"text":"Beautiful, welcoming space. A really nice neighborhood shop with lots of seating. A live edge wooden counter at the window and another communal counter mid-shop, adds to the seating provided by many tables and comfy \"wicker\" chairs. There are benches & 2 umbrellas out front.   Beans from Brothers in Oakville, and yummy standard pastries. A few prepared sandwiches & salads are offered.   My cappuccino was a little hotter than ideal, but well made otherwise.   This would be a good place for live acoustic music! (Hint to owners.)"}
{"text":"I met a friend here for coffee.  She was raving about this being her absolute favorite place, even better than SB, and that I had to try their lattes.  There was plenty of street parking in the area.  The place was very quaint, but I was unfortunately underwhelmed by my latte.  It was quite strong, and not as hot as I would have expected.  I personally didn't find anything special about it :("}
{"text":"This is my kind of cafe. Beautifully designed and decorated.   I enjoying having a coffee here with my girlfriend as we both admire the space.   The brewed coffee is smooth and not acidic. Doesn't leave the film feeling on your tongue.   The latte is good too. The foam is almost marshmallow like. My favourite latte yet."}
{"text":"Great spot! The lemon and poppy seed tea biscuits are delicious. Very nice interior as well! Great addition to this neighbourhood!"}
{"text":"Agree with several of the reviewers here. The space  is lovely and they have some nice treats but they have no idea how make drinks. I really wanted to like this place since its in the neighbourhood but no dice. We drive all the way to Roosters or Sumach Espresso for our daily coffee fix."}
{"text":"I've tried to like this place since they opened, and I have been reluctant to write my review but today's the day.  Almost every visit I'm greeted with pained faces who seem more pre-occupied with their chatter than making drinks.  Now I'm not asking for fake-happy or insincere chirpy, but at least a warm greeting from a place that serves coffee is usually an industry norm.    Every cappuccino I have ever ordered from there was a latte.  Today I even asked for one on the drier side, and it was still a latte.  Yes, there is a big difference, and yes, expect that your patrons will be able to taste the difference.  Espresso shots are pulled too long and taste bitter.  It's not the coffee, because trust me, I take home Brothers' Roasters (GREAT COFFEE AND LOVE THOSE GUYS), and brew my own at home on an Aeropress.  Birchcliff is the only place around where I can get Brothers Roasters without having to drive all the way to Oakville.  Lastly - and this isn't the fault of the merchant - but on one day last year when my husband and I decided to have a seat, read magazines, and enjoy some coffee; an old man, who I assume is a regular (the baristas greeted him by name), decided to sit down with us and tell me straight out that the Philippines is a \"swamp of a place\" and that \"flippos\" and their food are \"dirty\".  That's when I decided to never sit in there again because I do not feel comfortable, nor do I have any tolerance, to having my culture and heritage blasted in any kind of space, much less a coffee house.  So, two stars.  Because I love Brothers' Roasters."}
{"text":"I'll start off by saying that I really want to like the Birchcliff. It's a great space & something the neighbourhood really needs, however the coffee is horrible.  After numerous visits, it seems that the staff have no idea how to make drinks. First visit, ordered a latte. Got the drink & there was so much foam I thought she gave me the wrong drink. Then I realized that I was the only customer there. I shrugged this off, and left to enjoy my now cappuccino.  Second visit, brought in a friend. Both got lattes. Same staff working. Both ended up with cappucinos. This time they tasted like 5 shots of bad espresso covered in foam. I think I had 2 sips before I gave up.  The last visit I got an iced coffee. Can't be that hard to mess up right? Wrong. I'm not sure what happened, but it was 90% milk, 8% ice & a drop of watered down brewed coffee.   The Birchcliff gets 2 stars because they carry non dairy milk & another star for the lovely space. But please, make better coffee."}
{"text":"Cute little coffee shop on Kingston road.  Came here to get some work done and also have a cup of matcha latte.  The cafe is cute and prices are like any other cafe in Toronto.  I like that they have a non dairy option for your latte.  I'll have to come back and try their food."}
{"text":"Really disappointing experience. The barista had clearly no idea how to make a flat white. I think he misunderstood it for a latte. The coffee was extremely weak.   Another major issue are the hours. The target audience for this shop are rich housewives who have nothing else to do while their children are in school. But when I get home from work, they are already closed.   The design of the interior is nice."}
