They are located on the second floor where Bonnie Jeans and Second Story used to be. This place has had a great late night reputation but is also really good for dinner."}
{"text":"I was at Second Story on the night of Februrary 25. Honestly, I was very disappointed with the service. I simply tried to order two pieces of pepperoni pizza, and they responded, \"Thanks Dickhead.\" Not making that up. I am a loyal patron to this establishment, but I may have to reconsider where I go to for late-night food in the future. I'm all for jokes and games with my meal, but I was throughly offended by the severity of this comment. I am honestly rethinking if I want to continue supporting this business, because I do not take lightly offensive language. I am all for positivity. I am not a \"Dickhead.\" I am an electrical engineering major. I am one of the smartest people at this school, and I will not tolerate being seen as less than.  Let me tell you how to make the fourier transformation while I tell you how to cook a hot dog in a microwave.  Sincerely concerned, University student."}
{"text":"Talk about a hole in the wall!  I heard rumor of Stone Baked Pizzeria from a friend, and last night after joining the mug club at the Illini Inn, we had to stop in and give it a shot.  We climbed up the long staircase, turned the corner and ended up in a very plain room that didn't really look like a pizzeria. The cashier immediately greeted us and asked what we wanted. I don't even recall there being a menu, but my roommate claims he noticed a little sign that said something about cheese, sausage and pepperoni slices.  I got a slice of cheese which wasn't too bad, but seemed like it might have been sitting for a little while before being served, which can be expected at by-the-slice places like this. It was served on a plain paper plate and the 3 of us did the eat-while-walking-to-the-next-bar routine.  The slice was a decent size, and only cost $2.50 tax included. This is not a bad deal at all.  I will have to come back a little more sober and try to figure the place out a little more."}
