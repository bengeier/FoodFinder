{"text":"I order from Golden Lake, Bovaird location a lot, usually delivery but today I ordered for pick up and it was terrible. The beef with black pepper is apparently 30% beef and 70% veggies. I barely even got 30% beef. It was about 2 full green peppers and one full onion with maybe 10 piece of beef, if that. I also ordered the Singapore noodles. I was told there was supposed to be eight pieces of shrimp and I only received five. The pork was also shorten but wasn't told how many pieces came for that. I called and spoke to the owner and also told him I always order from them and never have complaints but today was horrible and maybe it's because I saw one of the employees going in with two bottles of wine and they're drinking on the job, who knows. The owner asked me if I wanted to go and exchange it. I told him \"Why would I waste bus fair to come in for their mistakes?\" And he responded that it wasn't their mistake and I ordered on pick up so a driver won't come. Also, he said it's just based on my word so I am probably lying.. Thats disrespectful and completely horrible customer service. As much as I liked the food, because of this situation, I will never order from Golden Lake again. My order was $38 and I am disappointed with the food and now with the customer service so thank you golden lake for your amazing (NOT) customer service."}
{"text":"This is my family's go to Chinese food take out restaurant. We order here every few months and enjoy it. 

Honestly, the taste is rather basic. It's exactly what your expect, doesn't blow your mind but it is still really tasty. We do keep going back so that definitely says something! 

They get the food to you really quick and hot when delivered and the prices aren't bad. You get discounts when you pay cash and free rice if you order over a certain amount (I believe $35). 

They don't like to give out much soya sauce though... Even when you do ask for extra soya sauce they're pretty cheap with it. 

I do recommend them though when you're craving some North American Chinese food :)"}
{"text":"My favourite place to go in Brampton for Chinese food. Food is delicious and the service is amazing. The general tao chicken combo tastes great. They add extra stuff to your meal when you spend over a certain amount or pay with cash. This is my go-to whenever I'm in the area."}
{"text":"We ordered on new years eve and I have yo say it was great. All the food got here the service was great we ordered ahead before 4 and was told that in the evening you can wait 2 or more hours for your order understandable  I'm very happy and will order agian."}
{"text":"This is a very well run, excellently organized business. Everything from a website that's better than average to food that's also on the better side of average. Favorite dishes include their egg foo yong and chicken wings, but really I'd be surprised if you go flat our wrong with anything."}
{"text":"My go to for (Chinese food) delivery. Foods pretty decent and I really enjoy their wonton soup. Always a pleasant group to deal with, delivery is fast and they don't forget the fine details such a soy sauce etc.
I thoroughly enjoy their grilled dumplings. They are plentiful and the filling is flavorful.
The number 9 combo is my go to combo meal. It's a good variety, you get chicken fried rice, beef & vegetables and 3 chicken balls plus a spring roll and wonton soup for $12. Amazing value for very good quality food.
I do enjoy their barbecue pork, it is leaner than I'm accustomed to but it's still very flavorful.
The chicken lo mein is another go to classic for us as it's very flavorful and has a good quantity of meat, veggies and noodles. 
I begin to crave the Wonton soup as soon as fall hits, it's a delicious warm up."}
{"text":"All the food is tasty and authentic Chinese food! Great value and has a decent amount of assorted veggies in the noodles/rice which is nice. I also like how the takeout isn't overly greasy or salty. Definitely better than a frozen dinner from the grocery store. I enjoy the bbq pork the most. The people working there are nice too."}
{"text":"Wouldnt recommend to anyone.
