{"text":"Went to pick up my order before closing and while the girl is making another pizza she ask \"did you have a call in\" I then told her I did and she said \"oh I just sold your pizzas to someone else\".  Never did she ask to remake them.  Do not waste your time here. Only one nice employee that cares about his job."}
{"text":"Josh, a \"Shift Leader\" has no customer service!!!!This is the last time we order from Papa Murphy's!!!   We got a free pizza coupon from a different Papa Murphy's which I reviewed because they waisted hours of our time and three trips back and forth before getting the right pizza!  I explained this to Josh, this locations \"Shift Leader\". My daughter has a gluten and dairy allergy and we have to order accordingly. The Murphy Pizza on glutten free crust with no cheese is what we order.  We were given a free pizza coupon because of the big mess up so we could order another one for free because of the inconvenience. They wanted to charge me $3.50 extra because it was on a gluten free crust!!!  I explained all of this twice and didn't even bring my wallet in and it was the principle of it all. The shift leader Josh said he is running a business and we would have to pay the difference. The sweet girl at the register grabbed $5 of her own money and handed it to me. She asked me to take it and give it back to her!  Then she gave me her change. He asked her was that your money and she said yes. I asked him if he was really going to let her pay for it and he shrugged and laughed!  I was appalled with his behavior and poor customer service.   I explained that we will never go to the other location again and now I will never come back here!  He shrugged again!"}
{"text":"Extremely RUDE Staff. I have never been treated so badly as at this location. Based on that. I am telling everyone NOT to go there. They refuse to take their own coupons when you call state you have it, bring it in, and it is within the expiration time period. The coupon is valid and i am having to talk to the manager to take it, and that person is treating me like dirt.  I am so sick and tired of people not understanding that customer satisfaction leads to good business. Treat a customer like dirt repeatedly, and they will spread the news.  an NO this is not the first time I've had this issue at this location"}
{"text":"The pizza is much more fresh than compared to other fast-food pizza places.  I want to comment on the customer service.  They don't open until 11am on Sundays.  I wanted to get a pizza before the first football game of the day.    I called and inquired about the store hours, and the staff said they'd be happy to make my pizza early, allow me to come in early, and purchase my pizza early.  That is what has sold me as a customer."}
{"text":"Good store,  the kids that are employed ragout seemed to be trained well and are polite.  They make a good pizza and I can have my home smell like a home baked pizza and not a grease put like the delivery places"}
{"text":"Papa Murphy's is a staple for my family.  It's not much cheaper than any normal chain like Papa Johns or Pizza Hut, and in some cases more expensive, but overall the quality is much better.  I would say some locals are better, but for the convenience on a Friday night at home watching a movie, nothing is better.  The cowboy is our favorite, pan style.  2nd would be the spinach chicken for a more wealthy approach."}
{"text":"Great pizza. Very friendly and helpful staff. But they are no longer at this location. This is their new address:   565 S. College Drive Henderson, NV 89015 (702) 558-7373"}
{"text":"Love this place, great pizza and great service. The staff at this place is 2nd to none. Try putting the pizzas from here on a smoker, sooooooo good!!!!!"}
{"text":"Friday night equals Pizza night most weeks around our homestead.  True that Phoenix has an amazing assortment of pizza joints, notably Pizzeria Bianco, the Parlor, etc.  However for my time, energy, and money (plus it's on the way home), Papa Murphy's is an excellent bargain and a truly tasty pie.  The have a nice selection of specialty pizza-we always enjoy the Thai Chicken pizza (with extra sriracha at home). We save calories by opting for the \"delite\" extra thin crust and save money  by grabbing one of their ubiquitous coupon for a couple of extra dollars off (you can also get the coupons on their website).  It really is love at 425 degrees! Pizza only takes about 11 minutes to bake at home, about the same time it takes me to go pick some mint and put together a refreshing mojito and set the table on the patio to enjoy some good pizza and watch the Arizona sun fade in the west."}
{"text":"Papa Murphy's is a franchise I keep trying this one. I bought two pizzas and she only stamped my card once and seemed upset that I had a company discount. Ordered two family size thin Delites and it was 24.00 which is the highest I have paid with the corporate discount. Usually the family size is $14 and they charge $16. I know Glendale city tax is 2.9 versus Phoenix 2.0 still doesn't justify the $2.00 difference. I will have to give the Phoenix franchise my business because the pizza is good. They give me all my stamps for each pizza too!"}
{"text":"My mom comes in and gets the same pizza every week, and I try and order it. The lady working just shuts me down saying they dont have it, ignores me and pretty much discards what I'm saying. safe to say none of us will be returning."}
{"text":"Just tried their new Pan pizza and it is absolutely incredible! Love Papa Murphy's and this new pan pizza is the perfect addition to their already awesome menu!  Pan pep, cheesy bread and some Mountain Dew for $15...can't go wrong with that!"}
{"text":"Mmmmmmm good.  When you want an inexpensive and easy way to make the house smell like a home made pizza. This is the way to do it."}
{"text":"I drive by the Union Hills/32nd St store often, but it's a little far from home to bring home a pizza, so I had never tried it. Several weeks ago we noticed the sign go up next to Safeway. We didn't know if it was open yet, but two days ago we decided to give it a try. And thankfully it was open! On a Sunday late-afternoon, there were several employees, but only one other customer walked in while we were there. The staff was very nice and the cashier said they just opened last Wednesday. The prep of the pizza was a little slow, but nothing to complain about. They were training, so completely acceptable. We took our unbaked Family Size Chicago-Style Stuffed Pizza home. I followed the baking instructions and it came out perfect. It was even kinda fun to watch the center of the whole thing inflate way high up (they instruct to poke it to let the air out though). I was worried that with such a thick mound of stuff, the crust would be underbaked, but that was not the case at all. It was crispy, soft, full of toppings and simply delish. And the prices are very reasonable too! Definitely a new pizza place as long as you have the extra 30 minutes to bake it at home!"}
{"text":"The staff here really made it right. It's weird how they measure everything out but it's for a reason! Wow.. Perfect. Every time it's consistent and amazing! Good job, keep it up! You honestly can beat the quality and for the Price! My wife and I spend 10 dollars for the pizza. We make it the way we want. Bake it the way we want. We do half and half good for 2 dinners. Salads/ veggies and pizza. Simple and way too easy!"}
