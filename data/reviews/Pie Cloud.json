{"text":"The restaurant has awesome decor, the service was great, and the food, for the most part, was delicious.   I will say, as someone with allergies and intolerances, I should know better than to assume all of the ingredients are listed on the menu. That being said, it's incredibly misleading to call something a \"tofu scramble\" when it's an egg scramble that happens to have tofu in it.   My husband enjoyed the special, a corn bread French toast combo. The coffee was excellent. The hash browns, sliced tomato and toast that I enjoyed were fabulous. This likely would have been a 4 or a 4.5 experience if I'd ordered something else from the menu."}
{"text":"I had very high expectations for Pie Cloud but left very disappointed. For a diner that is supposed to specialize in pies I found the menu very basic and unimpressive and honestly something anyone can make at home. The slices were small and extremely overpriced and the quality was at best on par with most grocery store pies.   We asked about their popovers and pasties and were informed that they were not made that day and unavailable. We were also informed that they did not have some of the pies on the menu in stock. After a trip across the city to sample Pie Cloud I would expect to have all options available."}
{"text":"Pie cloud has great, fresh, real food for an amazing price.   The staff is really friendly - and the atmosphere is great.  It's cozy without trying to hard.   I'm seriously surprised this place isn't busier."}
{"text":"The food is great! I tried the banana cream pie lemon meringue pie and the macaroni and cheese pie , they taste so good! The service is excellent as well. Why not 5 star? Because one piece of pie is $8.00 plus tax which I think could be lowered a bit but other than that it's great definitely coming back next time!"}
{"text":"Had some great meals here. Wasn't sure what to expect. I'm a fan. They need to work on their turkey dinner pie. My expectations were not met. Too many onions. Everything else I have had there has been great.   Whatever you do, don't leave without having an apple pie milkshake"}
{"text":"2nd time...2nd disappointment....  Nothing special to write about on the first visit and today with an out of town guest, food took seriously over 45 mins to get on our table considering there were only 3 other tables being served during non-rush hours (2:45pm). Server was courteous and attentive enough but this was negated by long food wait.  Not coming back and no recommendations...sorry."}
{"text":"My gf and I ate here last night along with her 5 year old son. We each ordered a savory pie, one steak and one turkey. They were super good! Very homemade tasting. We were disappointed that there was no kids menu so we had to get the little guy a $17 entree, so we don't recommend for kids and we probably won't bring him again. However he chose the chicken and waffles meal and it was ridiculously good. I don't think I've ever had a better waffle. Such a perfect combo of crisp on the outside and soft on the inside and totally melted in your mouth. Great fried chicken too mmmmm. It was easy to help him finish it.  We finished off with the marshmallow mermaid pie and it was absolute bliss. I don't know how you turn marshmallows into such a wonderful texture.."}
{"text":"They have a mac & cheese pie with a bacon lattice -- need I say more? I chose Pie Cloud for my last supper. Or rather, my last lunch with my coworkers before I left my full-time job to be self-employed. More than half our table went for the mac & cheese pie, myself included. I never turn down mac & cheese. This did not disappoint. You think you don't want your heaping order of carbs and cheese served with pastry, but you really do. It was amazing. The side salad to balance out the ridic calorie consumption wasn't bad either. To guarantee a food coma, we tried some dessert pies as well. The pecan pie is to die for, and the mermaid marshmallow one isn't bad either. Based on our experience, I'd give the food six stars if I could! Restaurant itself is cute casual dining, and service is superb. It wasn't busy when we went, which suggests Calgary has yet to stumble on this little city gem. Why not get a slice next time you're in Kensington? You won't regret it."}
{"text":"What a cute places nice food.  Very good flavour.  Not boring. Would come again.  Would bring friends!  Had the steak and ale pie.  So yummy. No street parking but I hit up the safe way lot up the way."}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow. Do not deprive yourself of the deliciousness that is Pie Cloud. The pie here is simply AH-MAZING!! #heavenly"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a cloudy Sunday. We ordered the steak n ale pie with a side of soup and a cloud club sandwich with a side of fries.  It took about 25 minutes for the food to come out, but the wait was worth it. The pie was savory and they weren't skimpy at all with the portion. I really enjoyed the medley of steak, peas, potatoes and gravy hidden underneath the most buttery crust ever. The soup was also a plus.   The sandwich was solid but had a lot of mayo. The egg was a nice touch. Fries were decent as well."}
{"text":"Lovely lunch! Great staff and really fun pie flavors. Tried the steak and ale pie and the Mac and cheese pie. Cute atmosphere."}
{"text":"Piecloud is such a beautiful space and is a great addition to Kensington. My friend and I went for a late lunch on a Thursday so it wasn't too busy. The space is bigger than you would think when you look at the entrance of the restaurant, which is a pleasant surprise. I had checked out the menu beforehand and already knew that I wanted to try the  Mac and Cheese Pie (with a Bacon Lattice on top)! I had no idea what to expect when it came to portions but I was impressed to see that you got an individual size mini-pie plus your choice of side. The mac and cheese was nice and creamy and having it in a pie crust was sublime! My friend tried the Turkey Dinner Pie which I had a bite of and the flavor of that pie was on point and definitely reminded you of a traditional Thanksgiving dinner. For dessert we shared the Lemon Meringue Pie and again, received a generous portion. The tart lemon flavor was perfect! The meringue was a little too sweet for us so we didn't finish the whole pie, but we both agreed that we can't wait to come back to try more items on the menu."}
{"text":"I met with a friend for brunch on a Saturday. I ordered coffee ($3 is a bit pricey) and BBQ Pork Pie with cornmeal crust, mashed potatoes, and coleslaw. She ordered a massive breakfast sandwich. It was much larger inside than anticipated. Although they didn't have the pie ready at 11 AM, they made it specially for me. The pies aren't very large, but they are very filling. I struggled to finish!  This place is really nice for a special treat. Family-owned and operated with lots of items including my favourite: Chicken n Waffles. The owner came around towards the end of our meal and asked us how we enjoyed ourselves. That was a nice touch! My only beef is with the pricing. If they lowered the cost by around $2-$4 dollars it'd be easier to give a higher star rating."}
{"text":"Only Open this past four months and we're visiting Calgary and we thought we would just drop in for dinner. We had their turkey pie as well as seafood pie and both were delicious and we topped off to dinner with a large apple pie reminiscent of the kind mother used to make. I loved the food and service."}
{"text":"I took my two girls with me for brunch today. It was empty, but it was only 10:35 am and it was Tuesday after the long weekend. Perfect setting for us. We got tons of attention from the staff and owner who are all so sweet, kind and attentive! They let us sample their yummy cereal bars while waiting for our food. Think Rice Krispie squares but a million times tastier and chewier!! We tried, cinnamon toast crunch, fruit loops and chocolate Cheerios! I'd go back for those alone.   The place is super cute. Modern look with reclaimed wood and vintage accents.  For decor they had pie safes, an old retro kitchen stove and even the chandler is made from old pie tins and baking accessories!  It was very cool. It has a hint of mint colour based on a retro themed purse. The ketchup and condiments come in little mint tin buckets. Super cute!  The food.... Oh the food!! To die for! So tasty! My littlest got the mac n cheese pie. Creamy dreamy with a hint of hot sauce.  The pie crust with it is perfect!!  My older daughter got chocolate French toast and she could not stop eating. It was sweet, but not too sweet. She left way too full, but very satisfied.  I got the basic breakfast and it was delish!! The sausages are butchered and smoked/cured(?) in house. They were so plump and filling.  The eggs were perfect, but I fell in love with the hash browns! A perfect mix of fluffy mashed potato and crunchy outside seasoned to perfection. I usually skip the hash browns as I don't li, but these ones were the best I've ever tasted.   I got a whole lemon meringue pie to take home to the family for dessert tonight and I also go a slice of the pecan and a slice of the luscious lime pies! Taste tested them all and let me tell you... I was in heaven! Best pies ever!!!   The girls and I also split an apple pie milkshake and it was exactly that.., apple pie in a milkshake. It was delicious and so filling!!! We left there three very happy full girls."}
{"text":"Pie! Who doesn't like pie? My fiance and I went for a late brunch. The food and drinks were delicious! The first thing that hit the table were their mimosas. Not just your regular champaign and orange juice, these babies had mango and I think pineapple juice in them. They were amazing. The food was good, I got the veggie pie and the crust was very flaky, warm, and yummy. The gravy and veggies were good, but nothing to write home about. My fianc√© got the breakfast sandwich. That on the other hand, was worth writing about. The biscuit was fluffy and held up to the sandwich, the toppings went together well, but it was the extra gravy that made it special. We finished up with the lemon pie and that was the best part. The desserts here are worth coming back time and again for!"}
{"text":"Walking into the restaurant a customer leaned over and said it was to die for. They were right! The biscuit they made is amazing!!!! The pumpkin pie is wonderful and sweet to!"}
{"text":"Recently went here on two occasions to buy two whole pies. The 1st was a sweet addiction gluten free, which all participants enjoyed thoroughly. The 2nd was a cranberry mousse and it too was quite delicious. Pie Cloud keeps things interesting by introducing unique combinations on their menu and is never a bad bet to make for a special dinner dessert."}
{"text":"Two stars only for good service. Honestly probably the worse meal I've had in a long time. Pies are flavourless with chewy meat. Shame"}
{"text":"So my Lil sis bought this lime meringue for me to try, my older sister delivered, my mom flipped it over.  It was still delicious.  So I made an effort today to try this Pie Cloud.  I ordered the bbq pork pie.  Cornbread crust filled with bbq pork and a dollop of mash potato.  Side of coleslaw.  This was was spot on!  I even washed it down with the apple ie milkshake.  Chunks of apple and crust in the shake.  This satisfied pie Eater was full   I took a slice of maple pecan pie home.  Adventures, this is a must try.  Meat pies, shepherds pie, dessert pies, etc.  This asian sensation just became one satisfied customer and I look forward to coming to try the other savory meals here.  I posted my pic of my upside down pie."}
{"text":"Heart of Kensington, not easy to park, but worth it.  All I will say is when you have a real urge for Banana Cream Pie and you call Pie Cloud to see if they can help a brother out, they come through.  Even held a piece for me cause I said I was coming to get one. Great lighting hanging from the ceiling....check it out."}
{"text":"This place is open poor hours and are overly meticulous about who parks behind their store and for how long. I did not appreciate the woman on shift waiting for me to walk around the entire building to brashly tell me to move my car. Pie Cloud will never receive any more of my business  from today forward. As far as I am concerned the treatment that I received was not consistent with the feel of the neighbourhood. Additionally, the willingness of this woman to undercut the business of herself and others based on who puts their car where, is silly."}
{"text":"Super yummy, amazing service. It's a little pricey, but it's also a brand new shop so they're getting on their feet but the quality of the pies is excellent and the staff is very personable --can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"So, first time trying out Pie Cloud after a coworker of mine highly recommended it. My sister and I stopped by for a quick bite. We walked I and the place is very big, but it wasn't very busy - I imagine it's more of a dinner/late night pie craving kind of scene.  We were seated and given a gorgeous menu that included savoury pies, sweet pies, non-pie entrees and non-pie desserts as well. We decided to order the turkey dinner pie with coleslaw and the banana cream pie, and just split the whole thing.  The turkey dinner pie was AMAZING - Turkey, veggies and potato in a crust that resembled turkey stuffing were accompanied by this amazing cranberry sauce and some gravy. This is a little weird, but the coleslaw was the BEST coleslaw I've ever been served at a restaurant so I would definitely recommend that as a side.  The banana cream pie was also good - I'm not a huge fan of bananas, but if you're in the mood, this is an authentic and light pie that I would have kept eating had there been more. Both pies were appropriately sized - not too big and not too small, and the whole lunch cost us $25! I would highly recommend this spot if you're looking for something new in Kensington!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with the space and decor when we entered. Atmosphere and service was good. I had thr bbq pulled pork pie with cream of celery and mushroom soup. I found both items too peppery for my liking but lots of flavor. I also ordered their famous marshmallow mellow mermaid pie to go. I actually really like that one. Large cut and not too sweet! I'd return for their sweet pies..."}
{"text":"I'm just scoring this based on my experience here. I felt they might have more to offer, but it's up to them to eliminate all doubt regardless. I never tried their pies---their pies might be the greatest thing since sliced bread. I don't know---but they also claim to be a diner, and that's why I walked in the door. (I'd just love to try their pies though. Their lemon meringue looked promising, but BY GOD the price!)  Back to breakfast. I walked in about 11am, and there was just one other guy in the whole place---looked really empty (but that's fine; some places fill up around noon). The decor looked just super on point! Hipster, consignment, colour-coordinated, and clean (the washroom too)! Plus Heinz ketchup (in the glass bottle), and Tabasco at every table; the cornerstones of dinner etiquette! Points for that!  But, checking out their menu, holy cow! $12 for bacon and eggs? $8 for a piece of pie? $3 for tea? In other words, they're styling themselves as 'foodie-dinner'. Let's see how they lived up to that. I got the tea, and the $12 basic breakfast (sausage instead of bacon). In a normal dinner, I'd be getting my food in 5-7 minutes. This place took forever to serve me my plate, about 15 or 20 minutes. It was good. Nice seasoning and consistency on the scramble eggs (nicely done, but small portion); sausage was tasty, and potatoes crispy on the outside, and nice on the inside. Nice sea salt and seasoning. Alright then! Good sausage and eggs... but why did it take so long... and why did you charge me $12 for that? That's what I came away thinking. Overpriced, and took forever for (well above average) dinner food.  I'm still curious about their pies though."}
{"text":"Flavorless food, overpriced pie and to top it off the service was slow and unfriendly. Skip it."}
{"text":"Excited to check this place out we went on Saturday about an hour before close. I tried the Mac n cheese pie and my boyfriend had the pulled pork pie. He asked for an apple pie milkshake but unfortunately they were all out of apple pie for the day. He ended up getting a plain vanilla shake -- when we got the bill it turns out a plain shake costs the same as a shake that has a pie slice incorporated into it. I think a different price for a plain milkshake should be sorted out.  We were ready for dessert about 20 minutes to close. At that point there were only banana cream pie, mermaid pie, and one slice of pecan pie left. I felt bad for suggesting we check Pie Cloud out because my guy is a big fan of key lime pie and treating him to a slice of Luscious Lime was a big reason for wanting to take him there.  We were quite satisfied with our entrees; it is just a shame that we did not get to try out more sweets. I understand that you can run out of things near the end of the day -- especially if you want to only offer freshly baked items so I can't fault them for that. I just suggest to diners that you check out the place earlier in the day to make sure you have a bigger selection to choose from.  And if I could suggest something to the operators of Pie Cloud; maybe you could use Twitter or other social media avenues to update the public on what you have run out of throughout the day. It would create more of a sense of urgency for your fans to get what they want earlier in the day and would help others plan what day they would like to pay a visit..  Can't wait to nab a slice of Luscious Lime for my sweetie and apple pie for myself. The mermaid pie was alright but we're more classic pie folk."}
{"text":"I have had Pie Cloud recommended to me by several friends, but I am always skeptical as I have had bad experiences believing glowing reviews in the past.  This place actually lives up to the hype.  I had the Boston Chowder pie with slaw on the side, and I shared a smoked chocolate and whiskey creme pie for dessert.  I am a Maritimer and am extremely picky about my chowder, having grown up around the best seafood in North America.  This pie not only had excellent chowder, but the crust was an excellent textural compliment and the potatoes on top were a perfect blend of creamy and crusty.  The filling didn't taste at all \"fishy\", and had pieces of perfectly cooked bacon without being a greasy mess.  The slaw was fresh, crispy and delicious, slightly sweet and just the right amount of vinegar.  The smoked chocolate and whiskey creme pie was an experience.  The smokiness was strong, and at first I didn't know if I liked it because it was so new and unique.  But after the second or third bite I realized that it blended amazingly well with the whiskey flavor of the pie, which overall made me feel like I was having a delicious dessert and a glass of good scotch at the same time.  Brilliant and incredibly unique, I hope it becomes a regular feature (it wasn't on the regular menu).  I don't write a lot of reviews as, honestly, most places are too mediocre to warrant a positive or negative review.  This place most certainly deserves a review.  There are far too few restaurants in Calgary that take actual risks with their food, instead relying on old boring standbys.  Pie Cloud not only experiments, but absolutely nails it.  Do yourself a favor and give Pie Cloud a try, I certainly want to see it busy and become a permanent fixture of Kensington.  PS. I was so in love with the food that I forgot to mention the service and decor.  There are several charming little antiques scattered about, and a classy yet modern feel to the atmosphere.  The service was excellent, with a funny and knowledgable waitress checking on us several times.  We spoke with a woman (possibly the owner?) who gave us more information on the dishes and the restaurant."}
{"text":"Place specializing in pies! Sounds so great..  The restaurant is located in Kensington which is great. Their hours are a little weird. Closes a lot earlier than google says. I let them know and not sure if they've fixed that yet.  They ran out of ALL the sweet pies when we went.. They ended up serving us a custom order pie because there were still lots of people in the restaurant who were probably as disappointed as us that a pie restaurant ran out of pie lol. Maybe the bakers need to plan that better.   The savoury pie was pretty good. It really tasted like a chowder in pie form. The sweet pie was less than impressive.   I think although I wasn't blown away, I'll give this place another try when I am craving pie. Hopefully they figure out their demand and iron out all the issues of being a brand new opened restaurant by then."}
{"text":"I throughly enjoyed Pie Cloud. Hidden in the alcove on 10 street it could easily be passed by... Don't do it !!  Service is exceptional, the owner is a fantastic women.. Works super hard. Food is delicious and the pie selection is perfect... Way to go guys"}
{"text":"Pie Cloud... what was life like without you?  Oh yeah,  I remember... I wasn't even sure I liked pies.   Well,  life it much more open to pie now.   Also, my mathematically inclined friends,  did you know that Pie Cloud is named after Pi because the address is 314.   There, you're smarter for eating pies.   Yup.   First of all Mac and Cheese pie is amazing.   You should just order that to make sure you've truly lived.   If you are ok with meat,  there is a bacon lattice.  If you're veggie inclined you get two sides - woots all around are called for with that.  Lucky for you it's available lunch and dinner.   I reluctantly tried the veggie pie once (to challenge myself) and it was also good and something I would love to order but I felt sad I didn't eat Mac and Cheese pie... so I guess I have my regular here.  We tried brunch recently.   The cure is freakin' HUGE and I can't believe someone would order that much food knowing the portion.   I'm a food stealer and my husband has a hefty appetite and he openly encouraged the stealing because he was so full.   He is in love with biscuits and gravy though but will likely order a more reasonable size meal next time.   I throughly enjoyed my chocolate french toast and am looking forward to banana cream waffles sometime soon... mmmmm.   And I've gotten this far without mentioning the sweet pies....  well... they are also great.   I love the banana cream (wouldn't normally say this about banana cream ... well, ever),  the sweet addiction is a seriously sweet treat (even I recommend sharing this because a little goes a long way.  Also,  a current seasonal selection is hot chocolate and they really really need to make this a full time pie.   Chocolate pie forever please.  Thanks.   Overall,  this place is worth a looksie and they deliver through skipthedishes if you don't want to go down there."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast, lunch or for pies. This was a delightful surprise for me as we intended to go to DairyLane Cafe but the hour wait was not worth it.  We went here instead and glad we did, the BLT sandwich was special because of the good quality ingredients and the fried egg.  My roasted mushroom soup was delish.  My friend had a savoury pie and loved it.  I'm going to bring my family back for breakfast, the place is big and the wait isn't long I'm told.  They have breakfast on weekdays till 11 am and on the weekend all day.  Nice!  This place was also rated as one of the restaurants to try from Gilchrist, although at the time I went I didn't know that."}
{"text":"Located in a quaint corner, in Kensington this charming little restaurant greets you with a vintage mid century modern decor making you feel like you're visiting grandma's house in the country side.   The staff were very friendly and we got a seat right away on a friday night. They were really helpful in helping us select something off the menu from their long list of pie choices. We had the mac and cheese pie and the steak and ale pie. We finished it off with an apple pie a la mode and lemon meringue. It was wonderfully delicious. We will definitely need to come back to try out their other pies. Watch out for their pie sale days on Wednesday and try a pie for only $4.95 /slice."}
{"text":"Came for savory and sweet pie and was disappointed by both.  The steak & ale pie was lacking in flavor, the potatoes were hard and had and odd flavor and the beef was tough. You expect a pie to have an amazing flakey crust and it didn't, it was tough and there was no flakiness to it. Even the peas were hard.    They saw we hadn't enjoyed the savory pie so they comped us a sweet pie. We ordered the lemon meringue pie, it unfortunately suffered from the same tough, flakeless quality.   If you've had flakey home made pie crust, you may want to skip Pie Cloud."}
{"text":"I give it 4 stars for the unique PIE experience, but would give it a 3.5 if I could. Lots of savory and sweet options and cute diner vibe. I ordered the luscious lime pie ($7) which was fantastic. Loved that there was lots of whipped cream on top, and it was the right combo of tangy and sweet. Gingersnap crust and the lime zest on top made it just perfect. My friend, however, ordered the lemon meringue pie ($8) and it was quite a disappointment. The lemon curd was more of a cheesecake texture and the meringue was more like a goopy marshmallow than a pillowy meringue. My friend who is a self-professing \"pie snob\" was pretty bummed with it. Still tasted good and was definitely better than store-bought, but no comparison for me to a legit homemade lemon meringue pie from what I tasted. And I expected it to be darn good from a place that specializes in pies.   We went around 7 PM and it closes at 8 and was pretty quiet in there. Nice little spot and good server, so I would for sure go again for the lime pie or to try a different kind, but would definitely stay away from the lemon meringue as it just wasn't worth it."}
{"text":"TLDR:  Good pie, but -1 star for price.  Pie cloud has been on my list to try for a while, we finally had a chance to stop in for dessert after dinner and drinks elsewhere. Pie was good. We tried lemon meringue, keylime, and mermaid (how could we NOT order a slice of mermaid pie!?) The lemon and mermaid pies were a bit on the sweet side for our tastes, the key lime was spot on, probably because it is topped with whipped cream instead of marshmallow-ey meringue.  3 of us had pie and coffee, but with tax and tip the bill came to $50! OK, it was acceptable pie, but not worth the price I think. $3 for a coffee (small cup, no refills) is a bit pricey, as is 8-9 bucks for a slice of pie... It was definitely better than a supermarket pie, but not miles ahead better.    Also, there are only 8 choices for sweet pies, but most of them cream based. Only Apple and pecan are the other options, which seems unusual for a pie restaurant.... I would honestly have expected more fruit pie selection, or even a seasonal or weekly special.  I mean even Blackfoot  diner has the same if not more to choose from.  The pie was good enough to warrant a return trip, but the price tag has me second guessing that, and feeling like I would rather try elsewhere, unless I am really hankering for a slice of keylime. Even then though, I would get it to go, and grab a coffee from somewhere else."}
{"text":"Pie Cloud is Pie Heaven!  Finally got a chance to eat at Pie Cloud in Kensington.  We ordered the following: - Chicken Pot Pie - creamy and delicious with tender pieces of chicken amidst mixed vege of peas and carrots - Shepherd's Pie - Minced lamb with a dollop of mashed potato on the top - quite tasty. - Boston Chowder Pie - It's like eating a Boston clam chowder in a pie.  The clams were tender and didn't taste fishy.  Very well done. - Mac & Cheese Pie (without the bacon lid) - Very cheesy and tastes so good with a nice crispy top and flaky pastry.  Opted for not having a bacon lid which gave me another side to order and I opted for the mushroom soup of the day.  Delicious!  All these entr√©es came with a side salad, slaw, or fries.    Of course, we had to have dessert pies so we opted for the special dessert Maple Pecan Pie ala mode and the Banana Cream Pie.  The Maple Pecan Pie was chockfull of pecans in a nice sweet filing; it was well received.  The banana cream pie was just ok.  Sure, we'd come back for savory pies any day!"}
{"text":"So happy for the people at Pie Cloud!! I was in town for only one day and they had ran out of Mermaid Pie.  They found one tart left!!!! I was so happy.  The Mermaid Pie is awesome!! The crust flaky and crispy, the center light and sweet and the marshmallow topping is perfect. Definitely coming back for more next time I am in Calgary! This place would be a cute date idea, nuzzled in the heart of Kensignton it could be a lunch spot that you hit up frequently if you were in the neighborhood. Other menu items looked delicious.  Also, it had a quaint vintage cafe with a home style vibe to good eats.  It is family friendly place and I cannot say enough about the awesome staff they really went out of their way to give me much appreciated customer service and the pie I had been dreaming of!"}
{"text":"This was a fun outing. I took my girl out on a mommy & me hot chocolate date. We dropped in for the first time for their YYC Hot Chocolate Fest entry and ended up buying two, one was boozy and one not.  Think about a Cherry Bourbon infused Hot Chocolate with a whole lot of goodness mixed in. Yup it was super delicious. My mini me liked hers but didn't love it.   Pie Cloud offers a stellar selection of savory and sweet pies for lunch or dinner which had us drooling as we read over the menu. They also have a simple breakfast menu.   Great service, good times. Looking forward to sampling pies!"}
{"text":"Great location. Had the Banana cream pie. Can't vouch for the hot food just yet,  but those at the table next to us seemed to enjoy it."}
{"text":"Decided to try Pie Cloud after reading about it in the Herald awhile ago. The restaurant is bigger than I thought it would be - very comfortable and open feeling.   Between the four of us we had Chicken and Waffles, Roasted Vegetable Pie, Turkey Dinner Pie and the Cloud Burger. All of the meals were very good with the Veggie Pie and the Turkey Dinner Pie being real stand outs.   Although we were all pretty full there had to be pie tasting for dessert so we ordered the Lemon Meringue, the Luscious Lime and the Sweet Addiction.  I was hoping to try the Banana Cream Pie but sadly they were sold out. Lucky for us though as we were forced to try other pies and WOW they were tasty. Not sure which was the best as they all had such wonderful flavours.  I have to mention that the service was exceptional. We were made to feel comfortable and enjoyed Kaitlyn's attentive service. Prices were very reasonable for the amount of food you get for both main dishes and pie slices. Definitely worth another try - or in this case another slice of pie!"}
{"text":"I've only eaten one thing here so far, so consider this a preliminary review -- I'll update it as I sample more of their offerings.   We bought one of Pie Cloud's Sweet Addiction pies and it was tasty, but imperfect. The overall taste of the pie was enjoyable, if very sweet. The custard filling had a slightly gritty / grainy texture, and the cookie-based crust was tasty but a bit hard and brittle.   Overall we enjoyed the pie and intend to return to try some more, but based on the one thing we've had so far I can only give Pie Cloud three (and a half, if I could) stars.  ---  Edit: Came back for dinner and shared a steak 'n ale pie, a turkey dinner pie, and a slice of apple pie.  The pies were all reasonably tasty, but none were exceptional.  The crusts and tops of the savory pies were thin and relatively hard, not flaky as would be ideal.  The apple pie was ok but not mind-blowing, and the two dollar scoop of ice cream that accompanied it was a little bland.  Overall I like this place and will be back, but three stars feels about right, especially given the somewhat steep prices."}
{"text":"Liked the atmosphere, service was friendly! But disappointed in the lime pie! Nothing like I expected, it should've had meringue instead of whipping cream topping in my opinion, and not tart enough! More of a whipped filling. Lemon meringue martini tasted funny nothing like a sweet and tart drink! My hubby loved his Jim beam cherry bourbon. That is all!!"}
{"text":"Pie Cloud is located in the heart of Kensington, right near the trendy coffee shop, The Roasterie.  Street parking should be available but it could be hard, depending on the time.  I normally park on the side street and walk a bit.   I've been wanting to visit Pie Cloud since I discovered it on my own, walking down the street one time.  I attempted to go during a long weekend but they were closed :( so when my gf asked where I wanted to eat I said, \"PIE CLOUD\".  She was quite hesitant because she thought it was just a dessert place but I told her that we could have dinner there as well.  She was still hesitant....until she got to Pie Cloud before me and looked at the menu - \"Yup, this place looks good, we're staying\" aaaaannnd that's all she wrote.  But really, when I entered Pie Cloud for the first time I was too excited \"SEEEEE!!! I knew you would want to try, SEEEE :P!\"  The place is soooo cute with the color mint blue scattered throughout the restaurant.  The lady at the front was super friendly and there is a pie display near the entrance so you can gaze at that for a while.  We were all standing at the bar, too excited to even sit!  There were 3 of us on a Wednesday night around 7:15pm and they weren't busy at all so we got to sit anywhere.  I already knew from reading reviews that I wanted either the turkey dinner pie or the mac and cheese but they do offer other menu items aside from sweet and savory pies, like burgers, hot dogs, sandwiches and salads.  Our waitress was good at giving mouth water descriptions of the pies and that helped with the decision. We all got waters which came in high stem glasses and I decided to go with the turkey dinner pie with fries, Michelle went with the mac and cheese pie with soup and Michaela went with the chicken pot pie with salad.  I was going to try and be all healthy and get the salad but when she told me that EVERYTHING is made in house and hand cut, I knew I wanted to try the fries.  When our pies arrived, we were pretty stoked.  I thought the pies were going to be smaller than they actually were so that was a bonus.  I had a couple fries first and I knew it was all going to be good.  The fries are clearly hand cut and they had a nice light crisp. The gravy actually came with the pie but I dipped my fries in and was delicious!!! Not overly salty like the average gravy but peppery and tasty!! I was impressed. Now to the turkey pie...O.M.G., to be honest I didn't have super high expectations with this place but man, my turkey dinner pie was AMAZING. The crust is made out of stuffing, there are nice chunks of carrot, celery, onions and of course turkey.  The turkey was really moist and the mashed potatoes on top were scrumptious.  It came with a side of cranberry relish and more gravy.  Of course you need a little bit of everything to get the full turkey dinner experience and it's really heavenly.  I love cranberry sauce with turkey so it was unreal, I can really taste the sage spice too!  I think there was a moment I closed my eyes and thought it was Thanksgiving or something but nope, it's only September!  Michelle thought the mac and cheese pie was good and thought the lattice bacon was neat but overall, nothing to rave about, she mentioned the soup was good as well but salty.  Michaela enjoyed her chicken pot pie but didn't finish it so she packed the remaining's up.  They each had a bite of my turkey dinner pie and reallllly liked it and said they would get it next time.  Being at Pie Cloud, I HAD to get a sweet pie to go.  I saw many posts of the mermaid pie and was really craving a pecan pie so I was indecisive.  Our waitress told me about the mermaid pie which was orange with blue curacao that gave it a zing, I don't love orange so I didn't go with that.  I went to peek at the display to help with my decision and the pecan pie wasn't shouting out to me so I went on a tangent and decided to get a slice of lemon meringue (I had it when I got home and it was just as she told me.  Super light and airy, nice lemon layer with the perfect tartness, sweet sweet pie and the fluffy meringue to finish, YUM).  Overall, my first visit to Pie Cloud won't be my last.  Service was attentive and extremely friendly and knowledgeable and the food was really good AND prices are reasonable!! It's the perfect place for a night out with the girls to eat or if you just want a glass of wine with dessert and chat or date night with that special someone!     Ohh, I was told that they have a feature pie once in a while that is not listed on the menu but Facebook or Instagram is the way to keep up to date with Pie Cloud!  Next time I want to try the sweet addiction pie and everything else ;)  *daydreaming*....I'm on Cloud Pie..."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here for brunch. The first thing I noticed is how cute the decor is! They have pillows on the benches and the whole place has a very cozy feel to it. I had the healthy scramble and we shared the apple pie. The scramble was ok but the black beans in it weren't cooked enough, for my liking. The hardness of the beans were a little jarring compared to the rest of the scramble. The potatoes, however, were amazing. I don't know if they twice fry them but they were so crispy and the seasoning was perfect.   We got the last slice of apple pie and I don't think they make their pies everyday. Our waitress told us they were low on pies because they sold a lot the day before so I think they must make a big batch every few days or something. We asked for it to be warmed up a little more and I think she may have microwaved it because the pie collapsed and was a bit mushy. The flavour was just alright; I found the apples a bit sour and I didn't think the crust was anything special (although this may have been because of the microwaving).   Most of their menu isn't actually pies. They have burgers, breakfast, etc. Only part of one side of their menu is pies.   Overall, Pie Cloud is cute but I wasn't blown away. I would probably come back to try one of their savoury personal pot pies."}
{"text":"Had the Turkey Dinner pie yesterday and it was amazing!! The crust is made of stuffing - YUM!!! And chocolate pie for dessert - double yum! Plus the lemonade was really good too. I will definitely be returning to try out some of the other pies, both savoury and sweet :)"}
{"text":"We were craving pie one day and took the short walk to Kensington. The pecan and banana cream pies were both excellent. I was a little disappointed by the limited selection of pies offered. I was hoping for blueberry, Saskatoon or strawberry rhubarb but none of these or anything similar were options. They also only had drip coffee but it was surprisingly good."}
{"text":"This is a great place to come for a hearty meal or just a delicious piece of pie. The dining area is much larger than one would expect from the exterior, and very comfortable and welcoming. Service was excellent, and the food was well-prepared with high-quality ingredients."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff. Adorable atmosphere. Wish I wasn't getting takeout! They brought out the chef to answer my gluten free questions. I got a burger with a lettuce wrap. They didn't have buns but let's be honest people it's a pie shop. I would've gotten the shepherds pie but a little heavy with what I've got going on tonight. Not a lot of gf options but it is really hard with pie."}
{"text":"I love a good pie and the Pie Cloud does pie well. Unlike a lot of places, the Cloud hasn't tried to reinvent the pie: they do a traditional flaky crust beautifully. This is comfort food done well. Try the apple pie milkshake!"}
{"text":"I saw the reviews on yelp and had to try this place.  We came here to celebrate a friends birthday.  I had a hard time deciding what to get and we're lucky that both the breakfast and lunch menus were available.  I had the chocolate french toast while my friend had the turkey dinner pie.  I'll have to go back to try that one out.  It looked so good.  I was so full after the frnch toast but i did try a few bites of lemon meringue pie.  It was creamy rather than the typical lemon meringue.  Everything was great and the service was amazing.  Kudos to the staff and owners!"}
{"text":"Yummmmmm. Had lunch with a friend after hearing how amazing the thanksgiving pie was. I loved the decor as soon as we walked in and although the chairs were metal they were quite comfortable. We ordered the Mac n cheese pie and a roasted veggie pie - one with salad and one with slaw. We each ate half and then switched since we couldn't make up our minds what to order from the amazing menu. They have a savoury pie selection, a dessert pie selection, a not-pie selection and they even had a breakfast menu. Everything we saw come out of the kitchen looked delicious - including the chicken&waffles. Getting back to our order...the Mac n cheese was a little too strong on the onion - if they cooked the onion first it would've been great. But otherwise the flavour was delicious with just enough creaminess to not become overwhelming after a few bites. The crisp cheese top was a great contrast to the filling and was topped with a bacon lid that was crisp and tasted oven-baked - appreciated that it wasn't greasy and fried. The single crust was delicious. The roasted veg pie was very savoury, with a nice assortment of vegetables. The double crust was buttery and flaky, I could've had a pan of just crust and been happy. The slaw was fairly standard but the side salad was delicious. It included a variety of lettuces, red onions, grape tomatoes and beets with a light dressing. The service was very friendly and they checked on us just often enough to make sure all was good without being annoying. We were unfortunately too full to have a desert pie but will definitely be back to try some!"}
