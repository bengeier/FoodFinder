{"text":"The fried chicken, sides, and biscuit were all still top notch, same as it was years ago. Delicious, cheap, and satisfying.

Take out only, but there are two small tables you can use."}
{"text":"This is some Seriously delicious chicken.  I have lived very close, and almost drive by there daily.  Thought it was part of the convenient store, so I would not go there.  After reading the reviews and being extremely hungry, I took the plunge and I am more than glad I did.  I will be coming here so much more."}
{"text":"I went here after the good reviews and I was impressed. I had the regular/mild batter. The chicken was light, crispy and delicious. The rice and greens is ingenious!  They have a little kick them but quite tasty. The corn muffins weren't the Jiffy sweet corn muffins. They were buttery and lightly sweet. I enjoyed my meal and will return in the future."}
{"text":"Went to V's today. Had wonderful food. Took a little while, but the food was awesome. I had the Lemon cake for dessert.  PHENOMENAL!  Would be five stars but the wait was a little long!"}
{"text":"Best fried chicken in Cleveland. Possibly the world.

$4.25 gets you 2 pieces of perfectly crisp white meat and your choice from a wide array of awesome sauces. Beat that value, I dare you. For me, it's white meat in V's \"seasoned\" breading, and a side of chipotle BBQ sauce. My GF likes it spicy (heh heh) and opts for the \"cajun\" breading. Not only is the chicken spectacular, V's sides are also quite good: I dig the dressing and gravy, mac 'n' cheese, and the fries. Oh, and don't leave without a honey biscuit!

Hot Sauce who?"}
{"text":"Excellent fried chicken. Try the Seasoned. The honey soaked biscuits, mac & cheese, and rice are all must haves, too. The menu is enormous so you'll have plenty of options when you come back for more."}
{"text":"Generally pretty good food. Today, not so much. Picked up a Reuben. Get home and it's not grilled and no sauerkraut on it. :("}

{"text":"Oh my gosh this place has the best food. The chicken is superbly trimmed and seasoned to perfection. Normally I always get the fried chicken but tonight I went with the fish dinner for the first time and can't stop jumping up-and-down with joy. Make sure you get the honey biscuits and at least try the greens and rice. Thank you for such great service and the culinary gift you've given us"}
{"text":"Fried chicken as it should be. Crispy skin and warm moist meat. Some of the best I've had in Cleveland. The sides were good especially the stuffing with gravy, but the main attraction is the chicken. The honey biscuits are sweet sticky and delicious. It made me question the way I've always eaten biscuits (usually with jam). Definitely call your order in because the chicken is made to order so there is a wait time (my order time was about 25 mins)."}
{"text":"Worth the stop and any future excursions from the Near West Side in the future. I can't find one thing wrong with V's, and the woman taking care of us was just the nicest and personable person ever.

I settled on a 3/piece thigh and 2 wing meal with the seasoned breading, and the lady-friend with the chicken tenders. Opted for mashed with gravy and Mac & cheese, even wanted a couple extra sides which were the rice and beans as well as some cole slaw. All homemade and tasty as fuck. Really liked the rice and beans in that I wanted more. Honey biscuits are a must. Loved the chicken. Still hot, super crispy, and well seasoned.

For all the food we ordered it was very reasonably priced and held up well on the ride home. Stopping here in the near future is in order as it puts the lousy KFC's, Popeyes, etc to shame in terms of quality, price, and customer service."}
{"text":"HONEST, THIS IS THE BEST FRIED CHICKEN THAT I HAVE EVER EATEN

Went to V's Gourmet Chicken & Ribs today after reading Doug Trattner's review for Best Fried Chicken in the Cleveland Scene Magazine. There are so many things to choose from: http://www.vsgourmetchicken.com On the left hand side of the menu, from under Individual Meals, I chose the breast, thigh and wing combination with a cajun crust, potato wedges and cornbread stuffing with gravy and a honey biscuit. Hey, I thought, go for all your favorites if you are going to do this! The lady who took my order also gave me a serving of cajun beans and rice because she thought I would also enjoy that particular side with my cajun chicken. She included two different sauce so that if one was too hot for my taste, she thought that the chipotle cream sauce would still be hot but a bit milder. Both sauces were outstanding.
This restaurant is take out only, Everything is made to order and after you order your meal, it will be ready for you in about 15 minutes. They also have an extensive Catering Menu.
Great Food with reasonable prices and happy people making and serving. What more could I want except to recommend it highly to you. :-)"}
{"text":"Best fried chix I've ever had ! Skin so crispy can't be beat. Seasoned or Cajun or Western are my favorite breading coatings. Didn't like mild and haven't tried coconut or honey yet.Favorite sides are mac & cheese - rice & beans - baked beans - and mashed potatoes with gravy. Don't pass up the honey biscuits either. Not a fan of their corn muffins but I like their rolls. Haven't tried the sticky buns yet. Their 3 & 2 , great 3 xs & over cooked 2xs. Takes 30 minutes for fried chix,they make it fresh ! Had a slice of German cake for dessert , was good. Forget Popeyes ,here you get two sides with your meal. If you're near by give them a chance, take out only."}
{"text":"That chicken is ammmmmmazing!!!! OMG!  Cooked all the way through and not dry! The turkey burger is awesome too! Cake was dry... almost like cornbread!  The chicken however made up for it! THE ROLLS  THE ROLLS  THE ROLLS A MUST TRY! I travel an 1hr away just to get these one rolls from a bakery... they have met their match and they are huge!!!! That rice and greens soooo yummy! It's was a little dry... but the hotsauce made it peferct! Potatoes salad... average.  Ribs tender but I didn't enjoy the sauce."}
{"text":"Don't go here. I tried to go here through doordash as it was clearly advertised to order 20$ worth of food. They refused it because it was through doordash."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've walked out of this place.
Their chicken is terrific, but their customer service is terrible.  
It's not that they are not nice-they are very nice.  But they will tell you that your order will be ready in 25 minutes, and you'll still be standing waiting for it at the 45 and 50 minute mark.  So-even though I waited 45 minutes for dinner, I still don't have my food and finally left. 
Of course...I won't be going back."}
{"text":"Best fried chicken in Cleveland, crispy outside and very tender and moist inside. we order the mild favor, and love the cajun too! super friendly and excellent customer services, they cook to order, so it will take at least 15 minutes for your meal to be ready, totally worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Oh wow. This place has been around for over 10 years. I know the place changed ownership lately but the quality of food has only gone down a little bit. The chicken tenders used to be bigger and better. The only gripe I have is that when you call in an order, tack an extra 10 minutes onto whatever they told you."}
{"text":"Amazing fried chicken and honey biscuit! No warming lights here. It's all freshly fried to order. You can't beat the prices for the amount of food you get.

My partner and I ordered the 3pc (breast, thigh, and wing) meal for $7 and comes with 2 sides. You get to choose the type of breading you want for your chicken from a list of 6 types. It comes with a corn muffin, but costs a little extra for the honey biscuit and is totally worth it! This meal was large enough to feed the two of us and we could even finish all of it. 

Absolutely delicious and will be coming back! If you're in a rush, call your order in because they freshly fry your chicken and perfection takes time. 

My only advice for the owner is to put a couple tables in the business because there are only chairs in there so you can sit down and wait for your order. It's freezing outside and I don't want to sit in my car and spill fried chicken all over the place or eat cold chicken when I finally make it home. Perhaps place a couple tables and a rack with Tupperware so people can bus their own table after eating."}
{"text":"This place was totally worth the drive from Maple Heights. I love love love how they cook your food to order, Yes you may have to wait 15- 20 minutes but friends it will be worth it wants you get home and open that box of fried chicken goodness, Oh yeah the ribs were the most tender fall off the bone ribs you will have.. B & Ms and Hot Sauce SHAME ON YOU for the product you put out!!!! Only 2 flaws I found with V Gourmet, 1 the BBQ sauce wasn't the best it was just ok 2 there just to darn far away. If they were closer I'd eat here weekly, not to say I won't go back I definitely will go back soon. Fantastic place"}
{"text":"I'm usually a sit-down and eat something fancy kind of girl. But while exploring Euclid before a concert, I was intrigued by the excellent reviews on here, and ended up with a hankering for some of this \"best damn fried chicken in Cleveland.\"

V's did not disappoint.

Fantastic chicken, mouth-watering ribs, the best fried zucchini, and honey biscuits that are to die for. I got a little over ambitious with my order, and only ate half of my feast. The leftovers were just as excellent the next day for lunch, after being toasted back to their glorious crispness via toaster over.

The prices are great, and everything is made to order. (So keep in mind a 20 minute wait for the magic.) Also, there is one table in the place, but it's definitely a carry out place. I recommend Wildwood Park right down the road! 

Just go here and get some chicken my friends."}
{"text":"For those of you who are on the fence about going, I'll save you a few minutes: Don't take any of the random bad reviews to heart.  It sounds like there have been a few negative experiences with customer service or wait times for orders.  BUT it seems that often these folks leaving reviews just didn't understand what they were walking into.  The woman who runs the place is a ray of sunshine of a human being (you'll know her when you meet her) and the fried chicken served here is hands down the best in the city, and you'll likely say it's the best you've ever had.  

Just know these things ahead of time and you will be golden:
- Take out service only - no tables and no delivery. 
- Allow 30+ minutes for your order, whether you call ahead (which you should) or walk in, BECAUSE THEY MAKE IT FRESH.  It's scratch-battered and fried chicken - not served from under a heat lamp like at KFC or Popeye's.
- No walk-in's after a certain time (not certain about what time exactly)
- The price of your order will be slightly more if using a credit card in order to cover their fees - This is an OLD-SCHOOL take-out joint, so just be happy they aren't cash only like others :)
- You can't go wrong with any of their breading flavors, but it never hurts to start with original or seasoned.
- The honey biscuits are the truth.

Seriously, why are you still reading this?  Call V's, order some chicken and biscuits and go to Euclid Beach for a picnic :)"}
{"text":"Douglas Trattner wasn't lying in last weeks Scene. V's really does have the best fried chicken in CLE. 

There are several different choices for breading. We love spicy stuff but we found the honey crisp to be our favorite over Cajun and seasoned.

Sides are also bomba$$.. You should try: rice and greens, baked beans, and mac and cheese. 

Customer service is super friendly. Call ahead. Then give them about 10 minutes more. 

Yay Collinwood!"}
{"text":"Tried the food here for the 1st time. Had the fried chickens & ribs. Ribs was tender m, flavorful, and delicious. Chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside. I'd like it more if the inside had more flavor. Mac and cheese and stuffing was good. Rice and greens was ok. Someone suggested the honey biscuit but it was too sweet for my taste. I only gave 4 stars bc the amount on my credit card receipt did not reflect what was told by the cashier."}
{"text":"Ordered, the woman tried to oversell and upsell, told me it would be 20 minutes, it took 45 minutes. Ordered Cajun, the chicken was flavorless, the fry wedges were bland, the mustard sauce was pure fat. The cornbread was ok, the rice and beans was delicious, they used a yellow curry and it rocked."}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try V's since reading the write-up in Scene Magazine and reading the Yelp reviews.  This place is less than 15 minutes from home and is in such an unassuming location, I probably would never have stopped had I not seen the rave reviews.  I decided to have V's for Sunday dinner.  I called in my order, as the on-line menu recommends.  I was told that the order would be ready in approx. 30 minutes, so I timed my arrival accordingly.  The wait was a bit longer than promised, but no complaints, because the food is definitely worth the wait.  I ordered the 8 piece family meal.  8 pieces of chicken (2 of each piece), 2 large sides (I ordered mashed potatoes & gravy, corn and an extra large side of mac n cheese, and a small side of rice & greens). The meal also comes with your choice of bread.  I opted for the honey biscuits.   As other Yelp reviewers have commented, the chicken is AWESOME!   There are a number of options for coating, I chose the seasoned which was tasty.  The chicken was tender, juicy and the outer crust was crunchy and flavorful.  There was nothing that I didn't like about the chicken, and it was very evident that it had been cooked to order.  The sides were average to above average, although I did really enjoy the rice & greens, nice flavor combination.  The honey biscuits....OMG, warm, fluffy biscuits, drizzled in honey.  The biscuits were more like dessert, very tasty.   My total bill was $28.00, and I have a boatload of leftovers, for another meal.   I'll definitely return to V's.....soon!"}
{"text":"Five stars across the board!! Ordered the seasoned fried chicken, awesomely crispy and flavorful. Best fried chicken I have had in Cleveland  for sure!!
Meal came w 2 sides, the rice with greens were fantastic too, seasoned and a slight curry flavor. The vegetarian baked beans and a wonderful  seasoning too.
Staff was super friendly,  advised me that everything was cooked to order, so it would take about 20 minutes. No worries there, soooo worth the wait for great food, fresh and not put down in warmer all day.
Definitely my go to spot for fried chicken!"}
{"text":"Great chicken. The calamari is also excellent. The location could be better but with food like this it is probably a good thing. If it were closer, I'd be there to often."}
{"text":"It's a take out only place. You have a variety of options for chicken. It's fresh and so good! They have real jo jo fries!"}
{"text":"This place probably has the best chicken i've ever had. for $9 you get 4 whole wings and 2 delicious sides! It does take a little while to get your food, but thats only because everything is made fresh to order. Customer service was awesome too!"}
{"text":"Used to like this place but the service is terrible. You can call in and get there you still have to wait 30 minutes and the younger man that works there has a smart mouth and a bad attitude. They handle situations that they are wrong in terribly also. I have been a long time supporter but will never set foot in that establishment ever again."}
{"text":"Damn. DAMN. Some good ol southern food....fried and fattening! 

I guess before I showed up I should have paid more attention to the reviews because 1. this is a take out only spot (which if you're in the area and the weather is nice just drive down the street to the Euclid beach park and eat by the water, as I did today!) 2. they make everything fresh so after I ordered there was a 20 min wait to make my food...call ahead!

The food: 

Chicken - I got a 3 piece \"seasoned\" fried chicken (wing, breast, thigh). Oh man, this chicken was so crispy, so juicy and soooo perfectly seasoned. I couldn't stop myself...I just picked it up and went ol school feasting on it. Also, try one of their homemade dips!! I got the honey bbq and it was really good!

Mac and Cheese - Real deal. Very cheesy and you can tell that this is done right. Not some crappy \"elbow noodles\" stuff that your mom would make in a box when you were 9, nope...more like the stuff grandma makes when you eat at her house (Jeez Shawn, butt hurt much? lol)

Green Beans - They were out of the greens and rice which I was really looking forward to...They're just green beans but it almost taste like they're sitting in a buttery sauce, very good.

Biscuit - GET.THE.HONEY.BISCUIT. That is all.

Cake - Man....I REALLY wanted the Reese's PB cake....there is a pic on here of it and it looks incredible! My second choice was Strawberry cake, nope. My third choice (which you can only find at places like this) was 7-up cake (if you've never had it, it's amazing!) but nope not that either. So, I settled on the red velvet cake. The cake was very moist and you could tell it was homemade just by seeing the flaking of cocoa powder in the container. It wasn't as dense as it looked but something didn't taste right to me about the cake. It wasn't bad, just something didn't seem right. Maybe I'm used to a different recipe for red velvet. 

This place is so divey but damn it's good. I will be back!"}
{"text":"The fried chicken is the best in town. And the cake is enough for 3people and those rolls are great. And the lady behind the counter is so friendly"}
{"text":"Yea, this place is good. Normally we don't go out for chicken as we make it at home all day long.  But we went because of the reviews and don't make fried anything at home.  Totally worth it.  The onion rings are out of this world.  If you are in the mood for good fried food you must go here.  Funny, we got a little lost trying to find this place.  They tell you 25-30 minute wait time, yet there was no one there when we arrived and our food was ready.  Great deal for the price and very tasty!  They were out of the rice and greens which we wanted to try.  Chicken, onion rings excellent.  Love the sauces for dipping as they are home made.  Even the desserts are good, especially for $4!  The calamari very good as well."}
{"text":"Chicken wings could've been better for sure. I ended up not finishing my food. I can't say the quality is one of the best. I can't put my finger on the taste, but I didn't have the same experience as other reviewers did. Unfortunately, I won't return for the chicken wings."}
{"text":"Best wings I've had yet. This is a carry out only place. Call ahead because they make your order fresh. The breading and sauce selection are out of this world. I haven't been disappointed yet. 
DON'T FORGET THE HONEY BISCUITS!!!"}
{"text":"Hands down, best fried chicken in town! We love the Honey crisp and the Seasoned. Delicious hot and fresh, never sitting under a heater or warmer for hours. We host a lot of parties and people always ask for Vs!. The sides are mediocre, in all honesty I'm not a huge fan of them, however, the cornbread muffins are incredible! They're great plain or with butter or honey. I have gotten a piece of their chocolate butter cream cake as well and that's incredible, too! It's home made! I'm a huge fan of the old school look of the restaurant. In my opinion, nothing needs to change. Thanks for the awesome service!"}
{"text":"It's no joke, best fried chicken in cleveland. They've got plenty of sides, but don't kid yourself it's all about the chicken. While there's a variety of flavors the staff might not give you many clues past identifying the individual flavors. Luckily there's a brief explanation of them at the restaurant (see pic). 

Call ahead and order as it takes up to a half hour if you're ordering a full bird or a dozen pieces (enough for 3-4 hungry adults)."}
{"text":"The crispy crackle of someone biting into the skin of a piece of fried chicken is enough to make me salivate! And wow does this place have some G-double O- D goooooood chicken! Some friends brought two boxes full of their fried chicken for a party, and I just couldn't wait to dig in. The pieces were huge too! Although the pic I took doesn't really show just how big the pieces of chicken were, all the guests at the party were amazed because it almost looked like half a chicken could've made up just one piece. Although a bit greasy, expected since it's fried chicken, the skin is the crispiest I've ever had in CLE! We had the original, but I wonder how good the other flavors of chicken are (or their other food in general)? Regardless, we will definitely have to try more of this darn good chicken (in moderation, because I don't plan on dying so young), and you should too! Highly recommended for comfort food seekers!"}
{"text":"I was really anxious to try this restaurant after seeing the great reviews on yelp and their ranking as best fried chicken in the Scene magazine. After viewing the menu online, I called to place my order. I choose regular seasoned chicken, mashed potatoes, macaroni, honey biscuits and a slice of red velvet cake. My order was ready when I arrived and the staff was very friendly, which was a plus. Unfortunately, I didn't enjoy the meal. Let's start with the signature item, the fried chicken. At first glance I knew I wouldn't like it. The pieces were huge! Now I realize some may not see a problem, but I try to avoid meat that appears to have been modified with growth hormones. On to the sides. Both the potatoes and mac and cheese didn't taste homemade. More of a box imitation taste. The cake was just OK for me. I  probably won't go back."}
{"text":"For the price it's really good food. If you want to be full, fat and happy, this is the place to go. The sauce on the ribs were a bit thick for me, and the wait was long, so definitely call ahead because they make it fresh. I wasn't blown away, but the options really left me wanting to return. Coconut batter seems really intriguing. They have a lot of fried veggie choices and cakes too."}
{"text":"Very crispy fried chicken. Ordered the seasoned whole wings and was very satisfied with size of wings and quality. Mac and cheese is pretty good along with cole slaw. Honey biscuits are to die for! Taste like a donut. Fries are also exceptional."}
{"text":"This was so good and so worth the reasonable prices. I am definitely going back. I got the mild fried chicken, mashed potatoes w/gravy, Mac and cheese, and fresh baked rolls!!! Yum yum yum!"}
{"text":"Read the previous reviews so we decided to try their fried chicken. Although it is a half hour  drive for us we had to try it. OMG this is the best fried chicken I have had in years!! Their menu is extensive so I know we will be back to try other things. Can't wait to try their ribs."}
{"text":"Fantastic!  Great home cooked meal!  We tried the chicken, ribs and fish and everything was delish!  We had mashed with gravy, green beans and coleslaw for sides.  It is mostly a take out place but since we were driving through we sat at the tables and dug into our meal. The price was under $40 for a family of four... Our most reasonably priced meal of the trip. Owner was very friendly and accommodating. Couldn't ask for more."}
{"text":"Excited that I found this place the fried chicken, fish & zucchini is the best, perfect seasoning and not salty. The bun and biscuit with honey are great too . The coleslaw was a bit sweet for my taste and the mac & cheese a bit creamy . I will definitely go back and try other sides."}
