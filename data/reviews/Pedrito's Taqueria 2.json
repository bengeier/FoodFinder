{"text":"Excellent Mexican food!  You want garbage than go to Taco Bell and support corporate America and eat your pre cooked meat!"}
{"text":"Worst Chimichanga!  I love Chimichanga's but this was basically a burrito of boiled pork!  The pieces of pork had hard pieces......the combo plate barely had rice & beans on them for $8.99 its not worth the money. ..  We will not be returning. .. go down the street for better food!! On top of the bad food they charge .50 cents to use a card"}
{"text":"I'd give this place 0 stars if possible. I cannot believe that this place is still in business. They can't get your order right to save their lives. I ordered carne asada and got a chicken burrito. WTF. To make matters worse the burrito was disgusting. After one bite I threw it in trash. Save your money and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"On Wednesday you can't be the deal of 55 cent tacos! I always get the carne asada tacos and they are delicious.  If you looking for some quick grub stop by pedritos with CASH for the 55 cent tacos on Wednesday!"}
{"text":"Quick Review:      Looks bad inside and out. Not Clean. Food was inconsistent and fine on average but I could believe that some items are delicious. The service was not great either(although you don't come to these types of divey places for great service). Full review below including Health Inspections Report at bottom. From my experience and the Health Inspections Retrieved I'd say unless like me you have an Iron stomach and your curiosity needs to be sated i'd avoid this place.  Decision:      My wife and I took our son here on the Free Comic Book day in downtown Mesa having tried all the other restaurants in the area.  Appearance:      We're not one to judge a book by its cover so the re-purposed gas station restaurant didn't deter us. The cleanliness on the inside is exactly what you would expect from looking at the outside of it, which is not good.   Ordering:      Still undeterred we had an order of a taco-enchilada(cheese) combination plate and two carnitas street tacos. While ordering the man(seemingly the owner) asked if we'd like any drinks to which I replied that water was fine, (we had planned to get drinks coffee or other at another Mesa Establishment) He said that they had bottled water and I said no thank you to the bottled water and that was the end of it. By that I mean they didn't give us any water at all. He didn't outright refuse us water but did not default to it when we declined the upsell.  Waiting:      We were the only customers in the restaurant and still not giving up hope we sat down to wait for our food to come. There was however the son of the owner probably 4 years old just looking absentmindedly out the window of one of the booths, it was obvious that he spends good portions of his days in that restaurant. The place was not clean by any means, the salsa cart had two relatively watery looking but surprisingly good tasting salsas(green and red) but there is no chance that the salsa was at the proper temperature it was quite close to room temperature. after sitting down a regular customer was greeted as he entered the front door. He place two to-go orders on separate checks for him and a coworker to eat during a break. I can not imagine that our order was significantly more difficult than this regulars' but he got both orders all packed up and he was out the door a couple minutes before we got our food. There was also a drive thru order that came and went in our wait time. Now that said the wait time for our food was long considering the order but not so long that it was absolutely ridiculous my qualm was just that or food being ordered first was not prioritized as such. While packing the drive thru orders food we saw the same guy that took our order walk from handling money straight to putting his hand on the meat cone to shave off pieces of meat for their order. When we received the food a younger girl, quite obviously the daughter of the man, brought the food to us and then said, \"Is this your guys' food?\". Not a huge deal considering, and I would describe it just as a teenager not being present(attentively) while working at the family restaurant.  Food:      The carnitas tacos were just okay, the pico on the top was room temp and tasted of nothing but water. My food the combination plate had hot beans and rice which were good and the enchilada was conspicuously a much cooler temperature then the beans and rice. That being said the taco and sauce that came on the enchilada had good flavor. From the good tastes on my plate I could imagine that some other items were great, ie the other reviews about the breakfast burritos.  Overall Review:      Appearance and Cleanliness was bad, Service was not good(though you don't come to these types of divey places for great service), and the food was fine on average. With how numerous the \"...-itos\" mexican restaurants are all over Arizona I wouldn't spend my money here again.  Health Inspection Report:      After coming home and before writing a review I wanted to see if my assumptions about food temperature had any validity and so I looked up the Health Inspections report, Permit ID: FD-42528 if anyone wants to look it up. Formatting is (m/yy Purpose-Grade #ofViolations) any notes are in parenthesis: 3-15 Routine Inspection-B 1, 6-15 Routine Inspection-\"Not Participating\" 2, 6-15(next day) Re-Inspection 0, 10-15 Routine Inspection-B 0, 11-15 Re-Inspection 0, 12-15 Routine Inspection-D 2, 12-15 Risk Control Plan 0, 12-15 Re-Inspection 0, 3-16 Routine Inspection-\"Not Participating\" 3, 4-16 (1st)Re-Inspection 0, 4-16 (2nd)Re-Inspection 0, 4-16 (3rd)Re-Inspection 0."}
{"text":"This place take very long to give you your food waited 20 minutes in drive-through for a burrito ridiculous"}
{"text":"Although the place is a bit difficult to look at I have been coming back after my first breakfast burrito.  It's so good and a great bang for the buck as well. The staff has always been friendly even with the frustrating and less than high tech tools of the trade. (Must experience to understand) if it's your first time giving this quaint place a try, an open mind is a plus but once you taste the food it will all make sense with the bonus being the $$ spent for such a fresh taste. Even with some cons (ie: no rest rooms, parking and access is horrible) in coming here I still give it 5 stars. This place is also family friendly and really does feel, as awkward as it is, like your in Mexico :) -peace, love, explore and enjoy"}
{"text":"The food is pretty tasty here. Unfortunately that's where the good part stops. The customer service is atrocious."}
{"text":"No stars for pedritos.  Looks dirty, workers look unprofessional.  Guy on line texting with his gloves on. Cashier was rude as hell to me.  Started talking to another girl while she was taking my order.  Smiley to every other customer but me. I was pretty surprised.  Realized it is probably because I am a white girl. Tried to tell me they only accept cash, and pointed at signs I still have no idea where they were.  If you are a cash only establishment, you need to have a big ass sign that customers can see as soon as they walk in.  Or at the cash register.  Lispy bitch is pointing to the corner telling me theres a sign. Wasn't empathetic, coldly told me they didn't take card, no apologies, no nothing.  I was leaving (I had no cash) and the manager caught me on my way out and asked how many tacos I wanted, told me he could take care of it and the girl rang me up with my debit card.  She had a machine, it was easy for her to use, I don't understand what that was.   Chicken in my tacos was old, hard, dry.  Uninspired flavor.  Weak ass street tacos.  I will never go here again."}
{"text":"Really good breakfast burritos. Taco stand ambiance. Really good food at a great price. I really liked the salsa and the super grande made from scratch breakfast burrito. My husband has had the .55 cents tacos and says they are the best. The food is made from scratch so it does take a little longer but the taste is so worth a little extra time."}
{"text":"I miss my friend Pedrito who would always greet me with a smiling face with my food! Thank you for always keeping me full and making the best breakfast burrito (especially good for a hangover cure)!"}
{"text":"At least they're open late! Everything else in downtown Mesa has long since closed. It's like a little trip to Mexico."}
{"text":"Bean & Cheese burrito + pico + sourcream! For those days when you don't feel like meat...... Delish"}
{"text":"Pretty good food. Prepped pretty fast, price was ok. Not as much meat as I expected in a Carnitas burrito (stuffed with rice, beans, cabbage or lettuce). So, as a meat lover I was a bit disappointed. Still pretty good"}
{"text":"Carne + Chorizo burrito is not on the menu, but delicious and inexpensive.  Great service."}
{"text":"This was the worst!  I took my daughter here last Saturday to get 3 rolled tacos with cheese and guacamole.  She really wanted that and this was on our way to where we were going.  Pulled up to the microphone and a young gal asked me to come to the window.  We had to wait for a vehicle in front of us to order, wait for their food to be made and pay before we could even order.  It was soooo slow!  It took us 25 minutes from the time we pulled in until we pulled out.  For drive through that is CRAZY.  I would never go here again.  Ever!"}
{"text":"I came into this place today at 2:30 pm almost spending $30.00 for a business lunch... I was totally disappointed with the quality of my food ! It had a spoiled smell from the time it landed on my table ! Not only did I not eat the food but after speaking to the owner it was clear this wasn't or isn't the place for good food or service ! The owner offered me nothing more than more I would assume spoiled food ! Beware !!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for breakfast.  Had the huevos rancheros, and they did not disappoint.  I just wish they had Coke products instead of Pepsi, but otherwise the food is great."}
{"text":"I had pastor tacos and my husband had carne asada and lengua tacos. The rice  & beans were perfect. Delicious food and fresh salsa and super friendly staff. Restaurant was clean and air-conditioned. Very inexpensive yet super good food."}
{"text":"Some of the best tacos Ive ever had.. and cheap! Definitely a go-to in Mesa. And it's right outside of downtown so its a nice walk from the public parking"}
{"text":"I was waiting in the drive thru literally 25 minutes with one car in front of me. I only ordered 6 tacos and it took forever. They don't accept debit cards and I had to leave without food. They could at least post it on the window before you tell them your order and make you wait so long!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  Great little Mexican food restaurant!  The flavor and the people can't be beat, nor can the prices!  Get here and check them out.  It's a converted gas station and the food is the best I've tasted in years!  0.55 cent tacos on Wednesday and Thursday!  Holy cow they're delicious and fast!!!"}
{"text":"The food is good and worth the money, however refills on drinks are $1. The place is a bit shaggy, but they have a decent size menu and their breakfast burritos come out so hot just holding it will start to burn your hand. Worth the visit if you are in the area otherwise just another Mexican fast food. The staff is friendly and orders always came out correct."}
{"text":"I honestly love this place. Is the cheapest breakfast burritos or burritos in general that you can get that actually tastes great. It is quite the hole in the wall place though. If you're looking to take somebody out on a date or looking for a nice sit down restaurant. This is not the place! However if you're looking for a quick bite where the drive thru might not work sometimes, this is the place to not break your wallet! The staff is not super friendly, as they might give you weird looks as you wait for your food every now and then. Regardless of all, the food and price tags are quite worth it. If you're ever in Mesa this is the place to go. They have filibertos size burritos that are cheaper. There is also a small fee for debit cards, I think it's $0.50."}
{"text":"This place has great Mexican food at great prices.  However, if you are looking for fine dinning or an Americanized Mexican - keep looking it is dive-y.  Many of the items on the menu are commonly discarded cuts of meat, including tongue, guts and head (lengua, tripa and cabeza).  The fact that they have these cuts makes this place authentic.  Also on the menu is pastor, carnitas, suadero, chorizo and bistec... look them up - I did.  I really wanted to keep this secret treasure to myself, but they survive purely on word of mouth so I had to say something.  They also serve breakfast (omelets and breakfast burritos) and  camarones (shrimp) in several ways including a la diabla.  Why not 5 stars... the past two times I was there the soda machine broke down and that is how they serve ice tea.  I gotta have ice tea with my meal."}
{"text":"Absolutely awful. I noticed insect feces on our serving tray. Later I checked their health inspections online. Looks like the county has had corrected them for cockroaches and other sanitation issues they haven't resolved. Ick.  A kid took our order. When it was done no one called us or brought it to us. When I checked on it the kid had no clue. I saw our order sitting behind the counter and pointed it out to him. Then he gave it to us. The man cooking ignored us.  Lots of taco stands are run by folks who care. These guys don't. I predict they will be out of business by September."}
{"text":"Okay, if you're looking for a fancy or even a physically nice place to eat, this Pedtrito's is not the place.  However, if you want good Mexican food, sort of like the hole in the wall place that is quick and delicious, Pedtrito's is the place.  I was so wanting some type of quick Mexican fast food that was less Gringo style (not like Taco Bell or Del Taco), but not Filiberto's, which though in bulk food, it's not very tasty.  Anyway, I was craving a chili relleno burrito so I ordered this and a chicken supreme burrito.  The total for the two came up to just over $13.  My daughter had the chicken supreme, which I'm not sure what it had in it, but the chili relleno burrito hit the spot and was so yummy.  I'm not sure what was in this other than chili relleno, some rice, beans, sour cream, but it was really good.    My favorite place was Armando's in Chandler, but they closed down several years ago and there are no places similar to this near anywhere where I am normally typically.  Since we were in the downtown area of Mesa, I knew there were hole in the wall Mexican places like this and I wanted to try one of them.  My husband refused to get anything, as he doesn't like to go to places like this.  The place is in need of repair, the parking lot is a mess, everything looks a mess and the guy that took our order didn't speak much English, but he was friendly and could be the owner.  I paid in cash, but they probably had a credit card/debit card swiper.  The food came quickly after we ordered, which was good.  It's best to come in off of Country Club heading north if you want to go through the drive-thru.  If you come in off of Main heading east, you then have to try to back up and turn around to go thru the drive-thru, which is a pain.    This really is NOT a fancy place or even simple nice place.  On a scale of 1 to 10, 10 being fancy, I'd put this at a 1 or even less than a 1.  But the food is really good, and the service was good.  That's what I came here for.  My tummy is a happy camper."}
{"text":"This location overcharges you from their original menu price. When asked about the price difference, the female cashier with glasses was extremely rude about the pricing mix up. Her reply was 'that's just how it is' Make sure you do not get OVERCHARGED for what you order. The soda machine was down. Overall the customer service was really bad. We went for breakfast burritos."}
{"text":"Such good Mexican food. Great place for the family. Affordable  and good. Excellent service and good people."}
{"text":"So, every year we come back to this area for a conventiony thing. Every year, we stay at the hotel across the street, and every year, there's one time when we just need food quick, and there's a convenient Mexican place across the street. That was indeed the case when I was back in Mesa a couple weeks ago. Having looked up what I said about it last year, I got the breakfast burrito again... it definitely was not nearly as good as I had said it was last year - it was kinda dry, kinda flavorless, and the beef was edible, but not particularly great. Definition of a mediocre burrito. Felt dirtier than previous years, too. Wasn't bad, but I wasn't nearly as impressed as I was apparently last year."}
{"text":"Not a 3 star Mexican joint...more of a solid 2 with some highlights. Flavors are everything to me in Mexican food. The carnitas were bland but the shrimp was tasty. The salsa was ok as were the tortillas. Beans seemed house made and the menu had all the standard fare. I ordered 4 burritos and some how I received a side order of beans? Whatever. Might of been some communication problem, not likely though. I live in a town with a taqueria on ever block. It's cool, I'm full."}
{"text":"This is the first bad review I've given. Don't do it! You will be disappointed. Especially if you are a street taco enthusiast like I am. The place is sketchy; even for a hole in the wall. The corn tortillas were rubbery and hard. I asked for no cebolla (in Spanish, cause I'm fluent) and it came plain with meat and grilled onions. And the only reason they are getting 2 stars is because the service was nice. But the random strangers hanging outside and inside were enough to make me order it 'to go'. There will not be a next time for me."}
{"text":"Been twice and I would have given them 2 stars for the first time and none for the second time.   Both times I hit the drive through ...huge mistake unless you don't mind waiting 30 mins or longer...litterally...I timed it.  First time the food was just ok...not bad, not good.  Second time, they not only screwed my order up three times but when I finally got home,  it was STILL WRONG. After 33 minutes at the window and having to ask them to fix it, it was still wrong. Okay, I'll just eat it. At this point,  I was hungry and not going to drive back. Worst Mexican food I've ever had. My husband wouldn't even eat it and I had about 6 bites of various things and it was all horrible. I mean really bad...even the beans!! How do screw up beans!?!  I through away $25 worth of food and we are still hungry."}
{"text":"Authentic Mexican food!  I ordered the fish burrito for $6.75   Had lots of flavor and of course I threw in some salsa. The green salsa had a better taste.   The owner was friendly and welcoming.   Will stop in again when I am near by!"}
{"text":"So now this place is bad. I was starving and wanted a breakfast burrito so I pulled into this place. I ordered a simple burrito with chicken and potatoes. that's it. how can they get it wrong? I took one bite and it was unedible.  extremely salty. I put the burrito back n the bag,  then in the trash. This place is dirty, dingy, and looks like a former gas station. Stay away."}
{"text":"This place is dirty and overpriced. Just looks extremely unsanitary. Don't waste your money here."}
{"text":"As always the food here was incredible.  Just as a tip for all of you Wednesday is 55 cents tacos."}
{"text":"At $1.49 per taco, it was a steal. My tacos came with roasted jalepeno.. set up items for me where the Cabeza taco and the AL Pastor.  Bathrooms are in the back, outside of the restroom make sure you ask for the key, they were nicely tiled and clean."}
{"text":"Not the prettiest place to get food, and have been shorted a taco or two once. With that said, they have THE BEST milanesa torta. Me and my husband drive a ways now to get it since we recently moved. Had it last night and still as good as always. I do think they have newamagement now. The old owner was always there and was not last night. The green salsa had been better, but the torta and pastor tacos are so good they could be eaten without it last night."}
