{"text":"Hands down the spot to grab a coffee in the city. I feel so spoiled to have a clover machine and these tasty beans so close to home!"}
{"text":"Doesn't matter what you're looking for: a hot creamy latte or some plump, fresh muffins- P&S is always down for some good tasty sips and sucks, for every palette imaginable."}
{"text":"Preface: I love this business, live nearby to this location and come here at least weekly.   For cafes, I generally only give five stars to small local businesses that only have one location and are integral to their neighbourhoods. Because Phil and Sebastian is a chain, it loses a star. Chains are important and all, I know, but I'm a snob for place-making and unique neighbourhood features.   But apart from this, P&S scores really, really well in my books.  As far as chains go, P&S is  -local  -owned and operated by some super cool people (Phil and Sebastian...). I saw them at the Calgary Folk Fest, and they were onboard for a lot of great initiatives, ex. compostable cups.  It's on the more expensive end, but at least there's a rewards card available.   For this location specifically, I love the furniture, the lofty ceiling, the art, the lighting fixtures, the cleanliness, the friendly baristas, and the baked goods."}
{"text":"Wow. Having ordered an espresso, and Americano and a cafe au Lait from this business, I have formulated a hypothesis as to the taste-semiotic of North Americans. I know this seems reaching and simplistic, but a brief analysis of 'third wave' coffee rhetoric via the 'blogosphere' only affirms the exegesis you are about to read.      Up until the early 90's most North Americans desire for coffee seemed to be encapsulated in Folgers, 'hugga mugga' Maxwell House, and Nabob. These coffees are indicated by lack of complexity, no discernable body and the total avoidance of flavours which may be too 'intense' for the palate of the majority of the directed demographic. The semiotic problem here is of course a lack of culture, literacy (cultural literacy as well), refinement and experiential nuance. By extension the semiotic indicates lower class, not elite, plebeian, unrefined, lowest common denominator, et cetera.      Then, businesses like Second Cup -- under fiscal threat by the upcoming Starbucks phenomena -- alerted the aforementioned demographic to an entire subculture of (mostly) individuals who seemed to treat coffee as something other than a carrying medium for a legal stimulant. Arabic, African, Turkish, European and British (yes) taste history was presented by the above competitors in a conflated manner (IE Au Lait/Latte). The 'Hugga Mugga' demographic realized that out of every ten of them, one happened to (for instance) have immigrant parents who had sought out specialty roasters upon gaining residency (for example in Montreal, New York, San Francisco, Vancouver and Seattle). This one-out-of-ten happened to appreciate coffee in a manner not presented to most North Americans by the major coffee sellers.      A couple of decades,  a few corporations, and some Spectacular Recuperation later, North Americans have managed to recuperate the semiotic of coffee. Their manner indicates culture, literacy, refinement, and an experiential understanding of nuance. Of course, this is merely appearance -- a facade, a fake and two-bait switch. The proof of this end? Phil and Sebastian.      The decor is crisp, well-maintained. Beautiful in a streamlined and open-spaced fashion. I want to spend all day in the space. The staff? Knowledgable about the coffee, the machines, the sequence of various preparations, et cetera. The paraphernalia surrounding the experience (the cups, utensils, et cetera) are of an apparent quality above the 'fast food' level. Everything about going to Phil and Sebastian makes me feel good -- about myself, as well as the world around me.      Except for the coffee. The coffee is by no means offensive. It's not 'Charbucks'. It's not 'Fauxcal' (roasted in a high-volume and industrialized manner, yet in Calgary, so the product is local in the sense that Lakeside or Cargill meat is 'local'). In fact Phil and Sebastian's coffee (with the exception of its espresso) is at an antipodal position to offence. It's submissive. It lacks complexity, it lacks assertive body. It has no flavours or aromas that are 'intense' to the extent that they may bother someone.       In short, Phil and Sebastian makes coffee indistinguishable from Maxwell House, Folger's or Nabob. Except for the presentation and framing.      The hermeneutic exegesis which has occurred is cyclical. Throughout most of the twentieth century the major coffee companies determined that North Americans had a taste profile which was, in fact, what they wanted. What these companies failed to recognize was that this demographic also wanted the semblance of cultural and personal authentication. Most North Americans want boring, grey, submissive coffee while paying exorbitant amounts for a sense of literacy, culture, refinement, and nuanced awareness Bear in mind I noted that their espresso was an exception to the above. Almost unpalatable. Imagine a warm laser of lemon and sour cream wrapped in a towel soaked in used motor fluid. Now imagine sucking on that.      If you want an espresso based drink I suggest getting it made with any roast darker than city/viennese. Light french as the bare minimum. Single origin gets old quick. Go Italian roast, experiment with blends, and avoid African beans (not completely, but don't make the blend primarily African).       If you like submissive coffee go to P & S. If you wish to try how Arabic, European, African and Turkic cultures drink it, go somewhere else.       If you want to look cultured in a 'fast food' sort of way, go to P & S.      If you (as I) like well designed spaces, go to P & S. It certainly is fun to relax there. With coffee from somewhere else, of course...."}
{"text":"Phil's and Sebastian's opened in chinook mall a few years back much to my delight .P art of my daily routine is having a delicious single shot extra hot cappuccino every morning. It's an expensive habit but oh so good. The cappuccino is perfect every time due to the fact the baristas are well trained, the coffee beans are of the highest quality and yes even the service is of 4 season hotel caliber .    In conclusion p&s is the best coffee shop in calgary"}
{"text":"Phil & Sebastian recently opened up their second location -- the first was the always popular location at the Calgary Farmer's Market.  Located in a new building in the Marda Loop District (33rd Ave SW), Phil & Sebastian is quickly becoming the new popular spot for the neighbourhood serving up the best brew around.  Nice clean decor, young and engaging staff, fantastic coffee, this is a great spot for a java jolt.  They also serve sandwiches, soup, muffins, pastries. One of Calgary's best coffee houses."}
{"text":"The coffee here is outstanding. These folks know their java.  Having said that, it is tough to get a seat in this place. When you do, the seats are not that comfy. The atmosphere is a bit loud and we found it hard to have a conversation. Also, for the person whose back is to the coffee bar, other patrons were knocking the chair as they went by.  It's bright, with lots of natural sunlight, but there's just not a lot of space in there.  Great place to get a high quality coffee to go."}
{"text":"Great coffee seems to pair well with Macintosh computers and yoga pants. You'll find plenty of all three at Phil and Sebastian's. Love the patio seating."}
{"text":"Worst customer service ever experienced anywhere today at P & S 33rd Ave location.  Started with having no decaf beans available for purchase, then no coffee cream (only 1%) available for creamer.  I may be wrong but isn't the product they sell Coffee?  But to top it all off I asked the barista that since they didn't have creamer could I have a latte instead? You'd think I'd asked for a million dollars. The extremely rude barista told me that I couldn't have the latte without paying extra and that it wasn't his fault they didn't have creamer. Huh? What?And so its my fault that no one has bothered to run next door to buy a bit of creamer to tie you over until the next shipment? And you can't make me one stinking latte? So after I didn't give in to this arrogant person he said he'd make me a small latte 'only this one time'. We'll you're right, it'll be only that one time cause they've now lost a dedicated customer from the U.S. who used to order their coffee online, buy gifts for family living in Calgary, and sing their praises. All it takes is one bad experience. There are too many others out there that would appreciate my business. Bye bye Phil & Sebastian."}
{"text":"Best latte in Calgary. Crowded in the morn, but if you are doing take away, no prob :)"}
{"text":"Stopped in out of curiosity while I was working. I'm not sure what that contraption was  they used to make my coffee, but it was easily the best cup I've ever had. I've never experienced such a depth of flavour in coffee, and the knowledgeable staff made understanding the different options on the menu manageable."}
{"text":"I love the coffee here at Phil and Sebastian's. the Lamb sandwich, I just crave it! yummy! I just spent 2 hours there today and obviously I am not the only one who loves this place, it was hopping!   great service, great coffee....they are growing now as I remember when they were coffee purists at the Farmer's Market. I hope they retain their quality and commitment to coffee as they expand!"}
{"text":"Love the coffee and the atmosphere at Phil & Seb.  Great and random coffees from around the world are usually available, plus they also sell coffee related products for home.  I like to get beans here to use in my french press when I'm feeling too lazy to walk down to the shop.   Staff are always usually friendly, but occasionally it can be lined up and you might wait a little longer for your coffee than usual.  Also, they have coffee cards where you get a free coffee for every ten - bonus!  This is the kind of coffee shop that I bring out-of-towners too, definitely stop by."}
{"text":"I love this coffee shop. The coffee always tastes amazing and the customer service is always friendly. However, do too the procedure that is required to produce such great coffee the lineups can become very long. The atmosphere is great and very trendy, however if I am rolling in my sweat pants I sometimes feel out of place. One should be aware that because of the quality of coffee, cost is exceptionally higher then you would pay at Starbucks or Second cup, but on those nice Sunday afternoons it is totally worth the price. Based on my current situation as a student I cannot afford this on a regular basis.  If you have never been go... If you have been keep going!  I will definitely be getting one of these before I head back to Toronto! Yes, what i am saying is that the coffee here is better then the coffee I can get in TO."}
{"text":"My wife and I absolutely LOVE Phil and Sebastians hot chocolate! The designs that they do with the cream is the finishing touch that makes this experience such a memorable one. The staff at the chinook mall location is awesome, super polite, and very talented in their craft. Highly recommend this place.  - SM"}
{"text":"The quality of the coffee is great, their lattes are definitely of a higher end than the regular Starbucks. I find their quality is comparable to Artiggiano - mind you, I really like Artiggiano so that's a compliment.  The flipside of this chain is the price, their coffees are way overpriced for what they are. For example, a large latte comes to about $6 after tax. I understand that they have this fair trade, organic, yada yada concept but even for those standards I find it difficult to justify to myself paying that kind of price for a coffee, especially when I can get a similar quality at Artiggiano for a much better bang for the buck.  As for ambience, I find their stores to have a pretty standard coffee shop feel, and the same goes for the menu of pastries and food. I think it's ok for a very occasional treat, but I would probably not consider becoming a regular here."}
{"text":"I have only had their tea lattes, they're a little weak for my taste, but not bad overall. The atmosphere os great and so soothing."}
{"text":"Yeah theres real coffee in this town ! You'll only go here if you know what that tastes like !! Not your Grandma's cup of Timmy Hoes  !!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I always take out-of-town friends or newbies to the city here. The shop has a clean, current feel and the giant lamp near the door is a great touch. My favorite story of this place occurred when I was trying to impress a friend with my knowledge of the beginnings of Phil and Sebastian's while we stood in line. You can imagine my shock when the man behind the cash register said \"actually, I'm Phil and that story is all wrong\"...oops.  My favorite drink here is definitely the Manjari Mocha. They melt real Manjari chocolate from Madagascar into the coffee, which makes for a delicious finished product!  The scones, etc. are a little pricey, but Phil and Seb's is top notch!"}
{"text":"Great coffee, great staff, great atmosphere. Try the Clover press coffee; it's a little strong, but has intense flavor and personality. The sandwiches are overpriced in my opinion. Parking can be an issue around Marda Loop, but be patient because this coffee shop is worth it."}
{"text":"I tried Phil & Sebastian's for the first time at their new Simmons location and it was well worth the wait. The staff is really knowledgeable about their coffees/drinks and take the time to carefully craft each and every order. Their latte art is on point, too!   I tried their classic latte and taste-wise, it was excellent! The coffee wasn't bitter at all and it was creamy and delicious. I also had a dark chocolate brownie to go with it, and for someone who isn't crazy about dark chocolate, I was licking my fingers at the end of it.  The only disappointing thing is reaching the bottom of the cup.   Bravo!"}
{"text":"GREAT cafe. Just great. A little far away from the hustle and bustle of downtown but worth the trip. They care a lot about how their coffee is brewed. Not a spot I'd recommend for sitting and doing work- but a nice place for a quick espresso or date."}
{"text":"Phil and Sebastian in Marda Loop is a cafe like none other.  The interior is incredibly airy, the ceilings are very high and the walls are covered in light wood; which creates a very trendy and high fashion place.  The coffee is ofcourse very good - rich and as other reviewers noted, does have a certain smoky/campfireness to it.  The prices are very high but overall justifiable due to the quality of the service, the product and overall setting."}
{"text":"What can I say?  I love Phil and Sebastian.   It's by far my favorite coffee shop in Marda Loop, both for the ambiance and the beverages themselves.  It's a trendy spot -- expect to have trouble finding a seat if you come at a peak time (which seems to be almost all day long!).  Be warned, it can get quite loud during the busy times!  I love the coffee however I'll admit I'm so hooked on the cappuccino that I haven't tried much of anything else.  I'm sure that the quality of their other options is just as top notch."}
{"text":"On the prowl to indulge in a different coffee proprietor rather than my usual suspects, I decided to break out of the comfort zone and try something new. Upon researching prospects within the yelp collective, many have had a favourable experience at P&S so I headed over to the Loop to give it a try. Very happy I did!   In a word, awesome. The decor is stellar with the high vaulted ceilings being the highlight. The staff is friendly and expeditious. However, what makes this place the gold standard for coffee shops in Calgary is the coffee and pastries, go figure!   I ordered an American and Apple Croissant. It was the smoothest Americano I have ever had, even the right temperature. The croissant was heavenly. The texture had the perfect pastry crush with silky-soft texture in the middle. And the apple ... well ... that just brings it to another level. This has to be the best coffee shop in all of Alberta. Would totally recommend it as a great date spot or even to bring clients for some place positive casual.   It isn't cheap though. The large Americano was $4 and the Apple Croissant was $3. However, I think it's one of the few places in this city that is actually kind of worth the premium."}
{"text":"I've visited their locations many times, but recently I have been getting coffee on Stephen Ave at their little coffee stand in the morning on my way to work. Coffee has always tasted great, never have had a bad experience... and their staff is always friendly too, even though it was freezing cold this morning :)"}
{"text":"Amazing tea, cappuccino, coffee, and service- what more can you ask for? Pastries are on point- great almond croissants especially. Excellent place to sit and get some work done. Come with laptop well charged since outlets are few and far between. Hands down one of my favourite cafe chains in Calgary."}
{"text":"Chill, hip vibe. Great lighting. Lots of space. Friendly staff. Delicious (and beautifully decorated) lattes/cappuccino. Amazing breakfast sandwiches, including veggie option (plus they use real, whole eggs - say what?). Only wish the seating was a bit more comfortable."}
{"text":"First the good the food is typically tasty and the espresso is smooth, nice aroma and strong enough taste for those who enjoy the their coffee.   Now the bad. The baristas seem to range from aloof to indifferent and seem to get my order right about 50% of the time.  If I'm spending $6 for a cup of coffee my expectations are higher than say McDonalds.  Don't lecture me if I pick up the wrong cup that is left on the counter and seems to be similar to yours. Given the inconsistency you're never quite sure.  If there is a line up to the door maybe come off your break early and not hang out with your laptop. I like to support local businesses but time to take my business to a new shop. I'm fed up with the crappy baristas and hey lots of other options in the area."}
{"text":"I'm partial to the Marda Loop area. It's so incredible and has so much character. That said, it's no wonder that there's a location of Phil and Sebastian in this area.  Not only is Phil and Sebastian some of the best coffee in town, but the staff is exceptional. Being true java aficionados, the staff not only expertly suggests the drink that they think you'll like best, but they brew it and prepare it to perfection.  If you're having a 'cheat day', then you should splurge and try their baked goods. Their chocolate croissants are to die for.  They roast their beans in-house and from the moment you step foot inside, you know you've come to the right place for unparalleled coffee in the city.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Great coffee, great location, great place. Careful it gets super busy! There's hardly ever any seating so be prepared for that! But the coffee is worth the wait. The line was almost out the door but still service was fast!  As usual, the coffee was perfect. The espresso wasn't bitter or sour, delicious. The milk texture was also great, micro foam on point. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Recommended by boyfriend's sister.  they raved about the coffee here.  The interior is cool, I would definitely see myself sitting here reading and enjoying a cup of coffee.  It looks good for groups too and saw many groups of 4 having good conversations around us.    I shared an Americano with my boyfriend.  The drink was THICK, but in a good way.  The coffee definitely tasted AWESOME.  I don't know what they do.  I heard they are engineers who dreamed to design the perfect espresso machine that would make the best drink.  The beans they use, the art of it all amounts to a near perfect cup.  I didn't need a lot of sugar or cream as I normally do because it is not as bitter as your usual drink from Starbucks.  I was able to experience the full flavor of the bean and I am very impressed.  Will be back when I'm in town again."}
{"text":"My Phil & Sebastian story is a bit different from the rest - I actually stumbled upon them first in Chinook Mall when they opened up a branch in the expansion area. It wasn't until later that I discovered the Marda Loop location, the \"homebase\" (so to speak). I've been here a number of times now. I really like how bright it is in here during the daytime.  The only \"flaws\" (if you can even call it that) is that this place has built up such a following, it is near impossible to find a table inside. Parking often is tricky, but such is the case with many shops in Marda Loop.  Depending on when you go, they have different roasts and blends to try out. This is a pro and a con for me, especially if I find I really like one that they only carry for a limited time. Their espresso beans don't change, and that consistency is something I love - their lattes and Americanos are incredibly tasty."}
{"text":"Finally - Calgary is building up the number of places to go for excellent coffee.  Add P&S's free wifi and it just seems too good to be true. The espresso they use at P&S is superior, they make proper cappucino foam (tiny, tiny bubbles), and nothing is excessively sweet. Compare the dulce (espresso and caramel to anything at starbucks with that too-sweet syrup) - a hint of caramel, but not saccharine at all.  The mocha is the same: they use shavings of dark chocolate instead of that icky choc syrup you get everywhere else.  Also in their favour, pastries all come from Manuel Latruwe, who in my opinion makes the best croissants and goodies in the city (a little expensive, but a real treat). The staff are quick, friendly, and that one guy's tattoo is a button, not a bowling ball. Badass lime espresso machine, and cool lightbulbs (attention to detail wherever you look)."}
{"text":"Best americano I've had. Sometimes I find the single origins a little heavy with stewed fruit and vegetable notes but the espresso is always fantastic."}
{"text":"Stop calling this place pretentious!!! Calling other people pretentious is just being pretentious in itself. If you don't appreciate this quality of coffee, then save your bad review and go drink your timmies, where they confidently brew consistent-tasting coffee at an amazing price. That's what timmies is good at, it doesn't make them pretentious.   This place also does exactly what it says it does with no apologies. They simply make the best coffee that human hands can make and pass the expenses on to the customer.  They don't take longer because they hate you or they think they're better than you, they take longer because that's what you just paid them an extra dollar per coffee to do.   They don't suggest you not put milk in your coffee because it makes them feel smug, they do it because you will just waste the extra dollar you paid for your coffee and you should have saved the extra dollar and gone to timmies.  They don't taste the espresso and spit it out because they aren't confident in their ability to make coffee... they taste it because they are dialing-in the machine, because they actually know what it is supposed to taste like and they are making sure the coffee tastes like that.... because that's what you paid them the extra dollar to do."}
{"text":"Love this place the estate coffees are really a nice touch as are the tasting notes. I used to wait in the ridiculous lineups at the old farmers market. This store(Marda Loop) is a breath of fresh air. The design is functional and allows people to sit and work or read or meet. Lots of business meetings going on and moms meeting for coffee. Convenient under ground parking is a bonus as there is often parking on the street available. The staff at first seem a touch aloof but they are busy and do a great job in an efficient manner.  Highly recommend P&S. Puts other coffee shops to shame IMHO."}
{"text":"Finally got to try out Phil and Sebastian in Calgary! I've seen their beans sourced at various coffeeshops in CA, so definitely wanted to check them out traveling into the city. The location is off to the side of all the shenanigans of primary downtown, a lengthy single room with tons of seating and a large bar for coffee and goods. They primarily use an aeropress for their pour-overs. I ordered an Ethiopian single-origin, and thoroughly enjoyed the subtle fruitiness and smoothness to the brew. I would love to return to enjoy another sunny morning in Calgary!"}
{"text":"With a good location and great curb appeal, I thought I would try a new coffee shop out. I love great coffee and don't get me wrong, the coffee was good. However, paying just shy of $4 for a cup of Joe is too much in my opinion. I am a full supporter of organic, fair trade, ethics, etc, etc... But, this can be found elsewhere for less. All in all I found Phil & Sebastian to be pretentious and over priced."}
{"text":"Best coffee in Western Canada, I say! And that's no small feat! I also took one of their coffee tasting classes for my bachelor party and it was the highlight of my day. (I'm kind of a hipster.)"}
{"text":"How I love their coffee, they do such an immaculate job with the way they make it and every sip is oh so delicious!! Wish they had them in Vancouver - JJ Bean is close but not the same. The service is great and the staff are very knowledgeable.   If you're looking for a great coffee that doesn't have a burnt aftertaste then this is the place - as I've tried so many places, they're always so burnt that I need something to drink afterwards. lol    The Mission location is great with their high ceiling, chalk board style menu and the food is wonderful. You'll be paying a little more but it's oh so worth it for the coffee and food. In one word, it's - Amazing!!"}
{"text":"Unpretentious venue, high quality espresso.   And I'm glad to see it has not strayed far from its original brewed-by-precision approach.  Is the espresso as good as Bumpy's? I'm not sure.. the jury isn't out on that one and it's too close to call for sure. But Phil & Sebastian's is by far a go-to, with an accessible location and awesome atmosphere.    The staff seems quite happy to answer any questions you might have regarding source or process, or even (overheard) drink recommendations. No scolding or scoffing here. If you haven't tried a quality espresso in this city, this is a good place to take the dive."}
{"text":"David Chang's Momofuku \"crack-pie\" has nothing on Phil and Sebastian's \"banana chocolate chip\" cake. Pure decadence but not overly sweet. Lots of chocolate flavour and delicious cream cheese. This is not your average coffee shop cake!   Why didn't I know about this cake sooner. I've always loved Phil and Sebastian's but, this cake is only available at THIS Marda Loop location.   Friends, if you see me hanging out here EVERYDAY, don't be surprised.  On a side note, coffee here is solid. What else would you expect from this franchise?!"}
{"text":"Great coffee shop and welcoming atmosphere. Love the big long table near the side walk. Good and easy underground parking. (... don't forget if you are carrying a bike on top of your car ... like I did yesterday!)"}
{"text":"I come here about once a week for a freshly brewed coffee and a scone. Love the coffee, and even though they don't have the Clover brewers anymore, the Aeropress technique they use seems to work really well, and the single-origin coffee has almost always been really good. The scones and other baked goods I've had have also been pretty tasty, but I wouldn't recommend their other food, as it's always tasted a little bit boring to me, especially considering what you pay for it. The only real knock I'd have is that it's not really a place to spend a lot of time; it's always busy and the seating situation is sparce."}
{"text":"Raving fan... this is my second visit to this location. I have to say once again how impressed I was with the experience.  - - - - - - - - - Not the Review - - - - - - - - - -  When I arrived, around 11am, the place was pretty close to full - of course, lunch hour was coming.   I found a table for two. On my right, a table for four with three very nice ladies sitting at it. They were older - maybe old enough to be someone's grandmother (which is something you don't often see in coffee houses. Tims, yes. P&S's, no). These ladies were full of life and were having a great time catching up.  The table to my left was set up for 4 - with two people sitting at it, a man and a woman, enjoying coffee and conversation.  I was there to meet a friend - she had never heard of P&S so I figured she had to try the place out.   My friend was a no-show. Instead, I decided to do a little work and enjoy the great atmosphere.  A few minutes later a young man comes along - and asks the couple to my left if he could share the empty side of their table for 4 - they agreed and he sat down between us.  I kept working.   However one thing led to another and very quickly all 5 of us are talking. She's Maria, her friend is Steve and the young man that sat down between us I Joal.  End result - it turns out I actually knew who Maria was - I coached her son and his hockey team's fitness. I didn't know Steve but he and I hit it off right away while Maria and Joal were lost in conversation.  Maria and Steve eventually leave. Joal and I continue to talk. Joal turns out to be Joal Kamps, who I find out is an up-and-coming musician, just releasing his 3rd CD (which I happily ask to buy).  So what  has any of this have to do with coffee? It's my appreciating for a great cup of coffee and great atmosphere that brought me back to P&S.   Had my first visit to P&S been a negative one, I would not have come back a second time.   Had I not been there that day, the second time, I would not have met these people.  Maria and I meeting for coffee this week - catching up.  Joal and I have a lot in common, have met a couple times since and will meet again soon.    - - - - - - - - - Actual Review - - - - - - - - - -  Great coffee, great coffee house atmosphere and great people.   The food was amazing. It was fresh. Not processed and served in a plastic bag - I had the turkey sandwich with potato salad - one of the best turkey sandwiches I've had in a long time and the potato salad - which I'm normally not a fan of - was crazy, zesty, tasty and good good good!   Loved it.   And of course - such friendly and professional staff! They're the icing on the cake.   Thanks!"}
{"text":"bar none the best coffee I have had in calgary is at any phil and sebastians. I love their dedication to honest business with fair trade coffee growers and distributors etc... Every one in my office loves them too..."}
{"text":"I have to say I wasn't overly impressed. They do have a wide selection of coffee and the like, but I find the whole place comes off as being pretentious. It has a very fake, yuppie feel and I can't say the service was that good.   Maybe it was just an off day.  What's that saying about first impressions..."}
{"text":"Oh Phil & Seb, do I long for thine cuppa coffee, so carefully crafted and delicious and energizing... Oh the tall ceilings, simple light-coloured wood, large arty works on the walls, and smile-inducing presence of natural light. The merch on display is set up in a eye-catching fashion, and well-placed with no risk of bumping the cabinet and products toppling to the ground. Much love for the stunning ampersand symbol coffee mugs!  The only reason why Phil & Seb doesn't get tip top marks from me is because on a few occasions I asked whether they had skim milk to which the answer was yes. I later found out that they don't actually have skim milk... which is fine by me, I just would have liked to have known, ya know? But once I take a sip from a coffee bevy, topped off with the beautiful touch of latte art, it's allllll good.  Despite the long lineups, waiting-to-order time seems to go by super speedily. Perhaps it's because I'll be subtly people-watching or am always just plain easily entertained by my surroundings.  The Dulce de Leche Latte is super creamy with a hint of sweetness!"}
{"text":"Perfect temperature cappuccino. Looking for coffee in this area, look no further. Hard to find a table but that's a good sign, they're getting lots of love from the hood. Staff really friendly too"}
{"text":"Love this place. I've been in Calgary for two days and have gone here twice (along w a trip to Analog). Their almond milk latte is so good as well as their croissants. I had the chocolate croissant and it was flaky and soft at the same time. Breakfast of champions for sure!"}
{"text":"The coffee taste is excellent BUT the lattes and cappuccino's are NEVER hot enough (and I'm one who usually has to cool her coffees) so are generally cold by the time one has finished. AND, they really should take a page from some other coffee places and ditch the Wifi completely. The place is generally loaded with 30 somethings monopolizing seats with their laptops for hours on end so that if you DO actually want to meet someone for a visit, you can never find a place to sit."}
{"text":"I liked this shop the first few times I visited but I now find it quite unclean.  Yesterday I visited 4 th St location. Brownies or something chocolate in a glass jar, not covered with a fly enjoying a Bite!  It just never looks clean in there.  They also are out of stuff all the time with the crummy stuff still there.  Note for now I will stick with Starbucks and Analog which is fabulous.  Way better value and coffee!"}
{"text":"Crowded, loud and getting your coffee takes forever but still worth it. Their brew process yields a fantastic tasting cup of coffee. If you really enjoy coffee you'll really enjoy it here. Everything else is totally average and finding seating can be a pain as half the tables will be taken by people alone with their Macbooks."}
{"text":"I adore Phil & Sebastians. The coffee is always superb. It can sometimes be hard to get a table, but the turnover is pretty quick.  Whenever I order a large coffee, they make a point of telling me it will come in a take-away cup. I appreciated the honesty at the beginning, but now I am wondering why they just don't go out and purchase large mugs?!!"}
{"text":"Phil & Seb is an amazing coffee shop. The coffee is always perfect. I've tried both the Mocha and the Dulce and loved both. They also have a large array of teas available - if only they had the list somewhere instead of relying on the patron asking for a list from the barista's memory.  The atmosphere is always fun - people are generally very friendly and chipper, unlike sitting in the Starbucks at times. Just wish there was more seating available - it can be difficult to get a spot during peak hours."}
{"text":"Great coffee, which is the main reason you'd want to be in a coffee shop. They only brew on the Clover, sadly, though for a roaster I expected they'd do Chemex or V60 as well. The tables in the space are also a little cramped, the upside being there is plenty of sitting available."}
{"text":"I like Phil & Seb's. Yes, part of it is because they're a local success story. I thinks it particularly awesome that they've got a location in Chinook. As far as coffee goes, I'm admittedly more of a big brand snob than an all out coffee snob. The black stuff you get that's been made by one of those old school diner coffee machines just doesn't do it for me anymore, neither does most cup-at-a-time domahickeys that you often find in offices these days. But I do appreciate the americanos and mistos that are now available to me at local spots like P&S.  This location in particular is a little busy. I stopped in yesterday for a meeting, the tables were all spaced really close together and all but one table was full. That's not such a bad problem to have though, and it feels good to see something started here being just as busy as any S-word, and with better coffee. The girl working the till seemed a little nervous in her but she was cute and friendly and quick.  Their coffee isn't a must for me, mind you, I haven't yet found the coffee that is a must for me. Perhaps I'm still in the coffee bean palate refinement stage.  Either way, if you're an S-word drinker, do yourself a favour and switch to P&S. All that sugar isn't good for you anyway. And if P&S isn't close, there are plenty of other independent alternatives."}
{"text":"Met a mentor of mine for coffee here just the other week to chat biz and babies (she's prego and I have an eight month old). Though never been to Phil and Sebastian's Marda Loop shop, I HAVE had their coffee before via the former Calgary Farmer's Market location. I knew what I was in for.   I arrived at 9am to a nearly packed house. Luckily, the guys and their interior designer were smart enough to place a long bench on one side of the shop and at the back, plus a large communal table at the front for early stragglers and solos. I found a table for two along the bench.  The thing I immediately noticed about the space was the enormous ceilings and airiness. They've painted the interior the smoothest cream I've ever seen; perhaps in contrast to the dark coffees they pour with love, and in comparison to the creams used in au lait's. Very enjoyable.  My drink of choice is always an Americano. Only with this can you truly enjoy and appreciate the buttery espresso. Of course, it was piping hot, with a slight froth on the edges, and absolutely delicious. But what else can one expect from award winning baristas!  Go here for a beautiful morning pick-me-up, quick meeting to exchange ideas, or to meet a long time friend for a moment to reconnect. You'll love it."}
{"text":"As much as I've adored the P&S location at the Calgary Farmers' Market, their new cafe in Marda Loop has it beat on pretty much every imaginable regard. There's food- really delicious food including pastries from Manuel Latruwe that will slay you. There's seating- lots of seating. There's hours, open 7 days and (note to Bumpy's, Artigiano, et al) they're open every evening until 9. There's a nice walk from my house. There's the coffee- ohhh lord the coffee. P&S won three of the top five spots in the Prairies Regional Barista Comps this year and that reflects both the skill of the baristas and how well they've matured as roasters that are a formidable force for the entire country to emulate.  I cannot say enough good about these guys."}
{"text":"P&S.  My first experience with P&S was at their original location, in the Calgary Farmers Market.  Getting a P&S coffee whilst doing our Sunday shop quickly became a routine for my whole family. We each had our staple; as I've mentioned before, I never venture from my Americano.  Apparently the Dulce (previously called the Latin Passion) is d.i.v.i.n.e (it's a bit like a caramel macchiato, made with dulce de leche)  The modest stall that made P&S famous is now closed, as the Calgary Farmers Market prepares to move to a new location.  As far as I know, P&S didn't renew a contract to be a vendor. They have opened 2 other locations in as many years, this location on 33rd Avenue in Marda Loop being their 2nd, and a swank new shop in the new Chinook Mall expansion is their 3rd.  Both stand alone locations are lovely, with sand colored wood accents, classic chalkboard menu's, and a very clean yet inviting vibe. This location is a long & narrow unit in a relatively new mini-mall, also housing a bank, a private gym, and a Shoppers Drug Mart.   Be warned, parking is tricky during business & rush hours, and especially during the brunch rush on Sundays. (Nellie's Diner, and Belmont Diner are a stone's throw away)  Hands down, P&S produces the best cup of coffee in Calgary. That's all I'm going to say about that.  They make pastries and sandwiches in house, sourcing from local suppliers & farmers (A list of these can be found on their website) They also use Organic Milk from Vital Greens Farm. Huge points for this. They roast their beans right here in Cow-Town, and I just found out yesterday they also roast for Caffe Rosso. Talk about being a good neighbour.  Phil & Sebastian know their coffee. They provide exceptional training to their barista's - who in turn offer education & knowledge to their guests.  They also attend ((and WIN!)) competitions, both regionally, and nationally.  My 5 stars say it, all the other 5 star reviews say it - P&S is a work of art, and something the chaps at all locations, and every coffee lover in Calgary should be proud of.  ((insert java-appropriate mug clink here))  KLM"}
{"text":"Phil and Sebastian roasted the best coffee I had during our trip to Canada.  My only complaint, which is very minor and trivial and you can judge me harshly for it, was that this location doesn't do pour overs, just Aeropress.  That wouldn't have been a problem except that I was traveling and when traveling I bring my Aeropress with me.  So I was almost burnt out on Aeropress and was really looking forward to a pour over and ended up sulking a bit upon finding out they didn't do them.  I really am that pathetic."}
{"text":"Excellent joint. My lady and I made a visit here seeing a friend in Calgary. We really liked the grilled cheese snack that we got. My girl got the Dulce, which is their sweetened latte since hey don't have the typical flavored syrups and I got a regular coffee. It was good."}
{"text":"Why do people like this poor coffee? The espresso is akin to sour barley left in my grandmothers church shoes. I've read in articles that this is the new taste of espresso these days- sour tart and acidy.  How sad. This is probably either because they have never tasted the sweet delight of an original Italian espresso or they cannot make an authentic one.  :("}
{"text":"Why you'll go: They have great coffee. The baristas really know what they are doing and make outstanding espresso/americanos. If you're lucky, Quinn will be working, who is (in my opinion)  the top barista in the city.  Why you'll keep going: The food is good too. I drool over the Pain au Chocolat whenever I'm in there. They have great salads and soup as well. Moderate portions of high quality food.  Why you'll love it forever: They LOVE coffee. They'll let you smell beans, try things and explain anything you're curious about. They have a shortlisted menu of beans for you to try, but none of the experience comes across as being pretentious. They're just passionate about coffee.   What could improve: I'd like to see a couple of gluten free options aside from salads. Some small chocolates or nuts are my ideal pairing with coffee. Also, if they were the first place in town to start serving a small glass of sparkling water beside their espresso, I'd consider not going anywhere else."}
{"text":"I can't really decide if I actually like P&S, or if I find it overly pretentious, and its reputation inflated by people wanting to like P&S. I'll just be straight up at the beginning here, and state that I am outright a Bumpy's homer, and that my only satisfactory substitute in the city is Kawa. Plus Kawa is licensed, which puts the two on a lofty but equal pedestal.  As P&S is developing into an institution for Calgary's self-appointed coffee elites, I feel the place deserves as well a thought-out review as I can type. Prepare to be disappointed.  The decor is OK, I do enjoy the high-vaulted ceilings like someone else mentioned. There are plenty of tables, and chairs. The bar is cool, and the set-up for dishes, cream & sugar is well-planned and efficient. I do find the cafe's general feel to be somewhat irritating. Not sure why. I get too much of the IKEA over the chic vibe here. Maybe it's because the cafe is jammed into a big-box strip mall.  The coffee was just OK. After reading the slavering reviews of just about everyone, I truly expected orgasm-inspiring coffee. It just wasn't. It was good, but it just didn't bring it home. The espresso was good, I found something was off with the milk. I also had the clove coffee, which was a lesson to me, because I never like clove coffee, and I should never have ordered a $5 cup here.  The staff is nothing incredible. A bit too cool for school, probably because everyone in Calgary seems to think they are too cool for school.   And everyone seems to go here. When I arrived at 7:45 on a Saturday, the place was empty, but by 9:00, the place was practically exploding with pre-natal moms, hipsters with macbooks, and generally anyone with a flannel shirt in Calgary.  Yeah, this review is a bit snarky. I find P&S to be ok, just ok. That means absolutely nothing because as my experience shows, even a somewhat refined taste is completely relative. I probably wouldn't make the trip to Marda Loop again, but that doesn't mean anyone else shouldn't go to P&S. Maybe I missed something."}
{"text":"Standard modern/vintage style coffee shop. Has wifi obviously as there can be quite the issue getting a seat there.   Coffee and Tea are great."}
{"text":"Oh Phil & Seb, how I love thee.  I can't put my finger on exactly why I love Phil & Seb so much.  Yes, the decor is funky and the staff are crazy knowledgable.  Oh, and the coffee is redonkulously good.  I tend to buy their beans and make coffee in my Aeropress. (Sidebar - if you do not own an aeropress - BUY ONE)  P&S beans are just so damn smooth, it's the type of coffee that you don't need cream or sugar to mellow out any sort of bitter taste - because there is NO bitterness.   If you decide to stay awhile, rest assured that the other offerings are equally delightful.  If you're not yet convinced, go and support a local business and see for your self.    Oh, and don't make the mistake that I did and assume that everyone that works there is named either Phil OR Sebastian.  They have other names too.  Like Sarah.  Or Guy-that-thought-my-Phil-&-Seb-joke-was-lame.  Have fun!  (3/30)"}
{"text":"P&S is a cute spot for having a coffee with a friend. I've been there several times, but found it slightly awkward to get a seat since it is usually quite busy. The expresso is great, and I love the open concept/organic decor. There isn't a lot of privacy because of how the seating is set up, but that's not something out of the blue. Good energy, and lots of natural light, which i love. I will return."}
{"text":"I'm not a fan of lattes or anything in my coffees for that matter.  A friend suggested I try the dolce and I was hooked.  I think I may be trading in my espresso card for a latte card from now on... but only at Phil & Sebastian.  I'm also a big fan of their business plan and how they support their growers.  We need more ethical companies such as these.  It's not all about the money."}
{"text":"How have I not yet written a review of Phil and Sebastian's in Marda Loop?  Sapna and John pretty much said it all, but it bears repeating.  The coffee is amazing.  The location is vibrant and full of life -- even on a cold winter day.  The entire room is well-lit and conducive to conversation.  Sure, they don't offer syrups for their drinks, but people don't go to P&S to get a tainted latte.  (Okay, they do at the Chinook location, but that's because Chinook mall and its patrons aren't ready for a Phil and Sebastian's.  A lot of people I've seen there are expecting another Starbucks, and are disappointed when they find that's not the case.)  Back on point -- awesome baristas with extreme skill and a great care for espresso.  This really is one of the top cafes in Calgary."}
{"text":"Good lattes, americanos, pour overs and drip coffee. Speedy treats. Well designed / comfortable spaces. I especially like the Simmons building location."}
{"text":"Coffee is pretty good. However the service at the Marda Loop location is pretty insecure and elitist. If you don't know everything about the newest coffee trends, don't go to this location. P+S Chinook location offers much better service."}
{"text":"If you haven't been to Phil & Sebastian... you're you need to drop what your doing and go there right now"}
{"text":"This is my favourite coffee shop, and my local one. It's part of the reason I moved to Marda Loop. I feel like kindred spirits with these guys since they are U of C Software Engineers who gave up their Office Space jobs to follow their coffee dreams.  The coffee beans are amazing. They've turned me into a full-on coffee snob. I stopped using cream and sugar and just drink it black now. Even my wife has started to become converted. She says I've \"ruined her\". Timmy's just tastes gross by comparison. Easily worth the $16-$20 for a bag.  This Marda Loop location has 2 Clover machines, which can't be purchased new anymore because Starbucks gobbled them up. It's a $10k machine that makes the perfect cup of coffee. You can really taste the difference, it brings out all the flavour in the beans and makes it more acidic and bright. Note that the Chinook location doesn't have a Clover. All of their normal coffee is served by the cup and made on a Clover.  They also have a lot of great merchandise for coffee lovers for reasonable prices. (Well, insanely expensive but at the going rate for these things). I bought my Frieling french press here. They sell the Aeropress, burr grinders, Hario kettles for the pourover method, etc.  They have classes here like Home Brewing, Intro to Espresso, and Latte Art. They also do roasterie tours and Thursday night tastings. I've never taken part in any of these but I really want to. I think it shows just how dedicated they are to coffee.  The reason I give it 4 stars is that the service can be super slow. They lose my order surprisingly often. Also, the coffee shop is insanely busy and it can be really tough to get a seat. If you do, it's very loud and tough to carry out a conversation. This is a good problem to have for P&S, but not so great for the customers. I rarely actually stay in the shop but always buy my coffee here.  Tip: You can park underground in the back. Enter from 20th St. Tip: Use their loyalty cards to get every 10th drink and every 10th bag of beans free. I always save these up for the most expensive coffee or beans. :)"}
