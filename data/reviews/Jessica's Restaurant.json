{"text":"Everything was triple battered and deep fried.  No filling in these weird eggrolls or the chicken balls.... just batter! I  found it impossible to find anything, somewhat edible to eat off my $70 order. The red pineapple sauce was good and the rice.  I pass"}
{"text":"We order takeout often when we are in the mood for some fusion Chinese food. Our staples are Ginger beef, stir fry vegetables in garlic sauce and chicken fried rice.  The stir fried vegetables are fresh and delicious unlike other restaurants. The ginger beef is just awesome!  It is one of the best I have tasted. I have recommended this restaurant to my colleagues at work and they love it as well."}
{"text":"Ok this town has some people that just don't know what good food is. After reading that the food is real good we thought we give it another shot. And I just can't find one good thing to say! I guess I can my water was hot for my tea"}
{"text":"I love the food, doesn't make me sick, and you gotta try the candied fruit for dessert! Friendly service, and reasonable price! Too bad they don't deliver to Calgary"}
{"text":"I've now ordered a couple times from here and it has been a good meal every time.  It's typical dishes you'd find in any Chinese take out menu, but it's not massively as some places tend to be. Even though this is the only Chinese food restaurant in Chestermere, it's a restaurant I'd recommend to others looking for a good place to dine."}
