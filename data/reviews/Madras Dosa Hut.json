{"text":"This is probably one the worse places I've been to. The place look sketchy and the food was average. But the seventy dollar price tag for three appetizers and two main  plates was not worth it. The waiters were nice but the menus were Android tablets which would have been cool if the menu was designed well. I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"This place has the best dosa in town. I have tried almost all places in Toronto and GTA for South Indian food. Trust me this place beats them all. We have been frequently visiting this place from last 4 years. It never disappoints! We always order paper masala dosa and it feeds atleast two people. Dosa quality is better than gurulakshmi. They offer unlimited sambhar and chutnies. We never have to wait in queue and staff is really nice. They are always ready to suggest different stuff from the menu. Thumbs up to madras dosa place for maintaining the same quality every time we visit."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Tasty and filling. Service was fine, but it was a Friday lunch, and hardly anyone was in the restaurant.

Unfortunately there is a MANDATORY 10% tip that the cashier adds on AFTER TAX.

If I choose to tip, that's my decision, not the restaurant's. Maybe the owner could just raise prices 10% and pay their staff better.

As long as that mandatory tip is in place, I will not return."}
{"text":"Sambhar was terrible. They use chickpeas in sambhar and it tasted like Choley Masala. Sambhar rice was my order and my friend ordered Rava dosa which had raw mustard seeds in it and so it tasted bitter! It's a fake South Indian restaurant with no clue of any of the South recipes!"}
{"text":"It was pretty empty when we arrived; one family occupying one table. We (2) were told we could sit at any square table.

I ordered the egg masala dosa ($8.29) and my wife the palak paneer dosa ($9.99; most expensive thing on the menu save the $27.99 5-foot dosa). Had the onion badji to start ($3).

Our server was nice and attentive without being overbearing. The food was absolutely delicious. We've been looking for a good dosa place near to us and this place certainly qualifies. We'll definitely be back. In fact, we liked it so much we were talking about driving out to the No Frills here once every couple of weeks instead of going to the one around the corner from us just so we can do dinner at Madras Dosa Hut. 

They also have an AYCE lunch special for $8.99"}
{"text":"We were feeling like having a Dosa and I had bookmarked this place quite a while ago. After reading their menu I was very intrigued on the choices of Dosa they provided. 

The restaurant is very nicely decorated and has a good number of seatings. The service was quick and the lady was very friendly. They have free wifi, bunch of tvs playing Bollywood songs and a kids play area. They have an app and provide you with a tab to look at their menu, quite funky.

Choices...Choices...Foodwise, I choose Palak (Spinach) Paneer Masala Dosa - This Dosa was huge and fully stuffed with cooked palak and paneer with special herbs and spices stuffed with curried potato masala. The Dosa were exceptionally good and fresh as well as crispy. They were cheap on the Chutneys (sauces) and gave us plenty. 

My buddy tried orders a vegetable briyani which was quite good as well. 

Overall, the experience was quite good and satisfying."}
{"text":"I've had Indian food before but never a dosa. Loved it. I'm a big fan of crepes and this was so unique (huge) and very tasty. The sauces were delicious, I especially liked the tamarind sauce. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I was happy to see that this place is near to my home and we were excited for our visit and moreover for the food. Food is good but the way they do the calculations are not. According to there convenience they add \"service fee\" extra excluding the exact bill and taxes. And these \"Service Fee\" is compulsory. We gave extra 10$ just for there \"Service\"!! So I'll not recommend this place to anyone. They are a bit slow too."}
{"text":"Amazing as usual. Love love love the all you can eat Chutneys and Sambar. Got the Cheese Masala Dosa!"}
{"text":"This restaurant deserves more credit for its \"oh so gooood\" food. The location and the look of the restaurant doesn't do justice to the delicious food they serve. We ordered ghee dosa  and ghee egg masala  dosa. After 10 mins  or so waiting, when we got our plates I was amazed on how large the dosas  were. I didn't know where to start! With unlimited sambar and chutneys, generous portions of dosas and friendly staff this is a restaurant for any dosa lover to check out!"}
{"text":"Place is good but boy do they charge a lot for extra's. $6 for extra white rice. $4 for yogurt on the side. The ambience and service are very good - place has a lot of seating.

I ordered the Dozza (pizza dosa). I didnt like it at all. I wanted to try somethind new but it didnt work. The meat was not done, mushrooms tasted super raw and the cheesy taste was over whelming. Mostly cuz i guess you cant heat a dosa to the point where the toppings all get cooked to a tea.

Thankfully we had ordered other items on the table. The thali was delicious- and the tikka masala was good as well. However for the price- most likely not going to be coming back.

Try Karaikuddi in Scarborough for a better value."}
{"text":"Very good dosas and vegetable soup. Prices are fair. Meal does take around 20-25 minutes to come."}
{"text":"From the outside it might look small but there is tons of space to sit inside. The staff is fairly nice, and are available to help you choose if you need some help. Asides from the food, there mango shake is amazing! It tastes like real mangos.. delicious! 

The first time I went it was with my friends we got two Mysore Masala Dosa, which tasted amazing. At a reasonable price of 7$. They bring all the side chutneys to your table so if you need more you don't have to ask. 

Since that visit, I have gone another two times with family and we noticed they jacked up the prices and now it's $15 for the same dosa. The food overall tastes the same as the last time. I'm just a little disappointed as to why the price increase was double compared to other places."}
{"text":"A great Restaurant to experience authentic Thali and Dosa. The service is second to none and the atmosphere is spacious and cultural. The service is always delivered by friendly staff. Ask for Sunny and your guaranteed to be treated like Royalty."}
{"text":"The food is all right. The portion sizes on the other hand are not. There was literally 5 pieces of chicken in my butter chicken order!! The prices are really expensive too... Service was not great either as we had to flag down our waiter multiple times."}
{"text":"Our usual place was too full with it being a holiday Monday so we decided to check out Madras Dosa Hut. I ordered the vegetarian thali and shared a masala dosa with my roommate. 

I've never gotten around to trying dosa before but I was impressed. It's just a giant crepe (which I love) stuffed with aloo (which I love) served with a bunch of chutneys. I couldn't tell you what they were exactly and neither could my Indian dining partner but there were white and orange sauces that were savoury, a green one that had a nice sourness, and a brownish one that was sweet. They were all amazing. Made for an awesome first dosa experience. 

The thali was good too. Although I recognized the dishes they were different in flavor than the North Indian food I'm more familiar with. I was served what I would call channa, matar paneer, something which a root or tuber that I thought was potato and my dining partner thought was cassava in a yellow coconut gravy, and eggplant along with rice, achar, dahi, naan, papad, and some condiments. It was all delicious.  The matar paneer was pretty spicy and the paneer had awesome texture. Sadly I only got one cube of paneer while my dining partner got three. The yellow coconut curry went perfectly with the naan. I'd order a basket of bread and a bucket of that stuff in a heart beat. The only real disappointment with the food was that the naan was pretty much president's choice packaged stuff and the papad was pretty much patak's straight off the grocery shelf, or at least that was the appearance and flavor. 

The service was fine. I wouldn't write home about it but the server didn't do anything to annoy me either so I'll give it a pass.

I'll definitely go back. I'm especially interested to further explore this whole dosa thing. I read they have one with palak paneer. That is the stuff dreams are made of."}
{"text":"Best dosa I have ever had. Period. In Toronto or anywhere else. The crispiness and flavours of Madras Dosa Hut's dosas really set it apart from places like Sarvana Bhavan. I used to like Sarvana Bhavan, but now I am a through and through fan of Madras Dosa Hut. The Dosas are paper thin and so crispy, and extremely large (but you can finish one if you are fairly hungry). 

My favorites are the podi (very spicy) and the garlic ghee. In fact most of their dosas that have ghee and spices on the inside are very delicious. We even tried the Dosa Pizza (Doza?) and it was very good. 

We always end the meal with their delicious south indian filter coffee...yum!"}
{"text":"I am not sure what to say, I expected this place to be a lot better than this, at least from what I remember.  
The initial service needed a bit of a kick start, once that was as done, the service was good. 
The food to me, wasn't the best. I have had better dosas and Sarvana Bhavan. The side dishes were not as tasty as I expected, lot of it was pretty bland. 
They really need to up the game a bit."}
{"text":"It's hard to think that anyone can mess up dosa but I guess Madras Dosa Hut has found a way. I ordered a nice big paper dosa and while the actual dosa was just what it was supposed to be - crisp and huge, the sambar and chutneys were terrible. The sambar had too much salt and obviously tasted terrible and there was too little coconut chutney to eat instead. Dosa isn't normally eaten with mint or tomato chutney but there was some of it served to us. The service and the actualy location weren;t that great either but its more or less what you should expect in the area. Toronto has much better places for Dosas and I would not waste my time with this one."}
{"text":"They used to be good.  I had not been there for a couple of years.  I took a friend and was quite disappointed.  The food is not good.  Mild flavors. 
 We had a couple of dosas and fish cutlets.  Dosas look nice but the masala was not good.  Fish cutlets pretty bad.  Chutneys average.  They did provide a lot of sambar but that was average.  Service - it seemed the staff was new and untrained.  It almost seems as if there is new management. It was my favorite place for dosas but I will not return."}
{"text":"This is the most disgusting place. There was a BIG RED BUG in the food that I accidentally chewed on
Never go to this place. They must have a ton breeding in their kitchen"}
{"text":"I had their Masala Dosa and my friend had the Uttapam. Both good. They give you chutneys in jars and also Sambhar in a jug. Which means you can munch/sip as you wait for your food. I liked all 3 chutneys. Very flavourful. They have added North Indian food as well but I wanted to try their South Indian offerings. And was not disappointed. There is a lot of variety amongst Dosas themselves.

Service was good and friendly. The owner is a very gracious person. There is a lot of space inside, it looks small from outside. It is clean and roomy and they have a phone charging station as well."}
{"text":"At times I wish I'd trusted my instincts telling me not to go. I'll be nice, starting with the ambiance bleh, not good not bad. Typical 2 decade old or so look. Two of the servers quite nice. Time to get the food not bad. The medu vada (South Indian Doughnut)was the ONLY saving grace of the meal. It was actually nice. 
Now the real review. That was one of the WORST south indian cuisine I've ever experienced. An I've experienced a lot. The Sambhar (Veggie Stew - A South Indian Staple) was overwhelmed with salt. The consistency was completely off and no drumsticks. The chutney (savory condiments) were either from a bottle but absolutely horrible. lastly the Dosa's...seriously? white dosas? Are you kidding me. The Uttapam was huge, the onions that are supposed to be cut up in tiny pieces were large and caramlized and instead of being on top were all inside the uttapam. As if all this wasn't enough the server was so rude. All in all one of the worst experiences I've had in food. Did I mention there is a MANDATORY 10% Tip? Seriously?"}
{"text":"Beside Sambhar .... the quality of the food is bad

The coconut chutney is really bad 

Not a Dosa place ......"}
{"text":"These might be the best dosas in Toronto. The decor is amazing:red lights and giant TVs with Bollywood films and elaborate fake bouquets. With the largest selection of dosas in the GTA. Everything is fresh and cheap."}
{"text":"One of the best dosas in Toronto .. ask for Arvind ... and he will make sure you leave with a smile ... the the size of the dosa is huge and the uttapah is even bigger ..!! Never seen before all in all an amazing place for South Indian food ..!!"}
{"text":"They should probably call themselves \"Sour Dosa Hut\". Way too much lemon (actually tasted more like amchur powder) in chutneys and Rasam. Totally spoiled the dinner. 
We went for Rasa Vada as a starter, followed by a Plain Uttapam and Masala Uttapam as main. Vada was good - quite soft and well made. However, Rasam was very sour. We practically left Rasam and ate only the vada. 
They serve four type of chutneys as a standard for any meals. However, the chutneys let the whole meal down. To begin with, they didn't taste fresh. Coconut chutney was okay actually - not great as it is other places like Anjappar Chettinad or Guru Lukshmi. The tomato chutney was very sour again. Green chutney (supposedly mint-coriander or something) was heavily salted and sour as well. Plain Uttapam was okay. It was a little rubbery though. Masala Uttapam was okay again - no real spiciness or kick in the masala. Their sambhar used to be pretty decent from what I recall from our earlier visits (there wasn't any sambhar offered along with Uttapam). Overall, the food was very big let down. We left half of the Plain Uttapam and Masala Uttapam as eating them alone wasn't possible and eating with chutneys would be a suicide. 
The ambiance is quite good for the place. Quite a good seating capacity. The staff and the service are good. However, they need to improve big time on their food."}
{"text":"I haven't been here in quite some time because I normally would go to closer places in the West. My friend took me here for the first time and this is the location I had my first Dosa ever. I must say, from that moment on till now, Dosa is one of my favorite dishes and I actually crave it now at times. The restaurant isn't very large and does get packed in the evenings with the parking in the back of the restaurant almost running out some times. The staff are fast and friendly. 

Down to the main point, this place has the best dosas that I have had in Toronto. And there are a few places I have been to in the West which are also good. Everything is fresh and the price is so reasonable. I would def recommend this if you haven't ever had Dosa or want great tasting Dosa."}
{"text":"I haven't been to this place in few years but looks like the owner has changed and so has the look of the place ( no ugly red carpet). It's a South Indian restaurant run by a Punjabi owner ( questioning authenticity?). 
Food quality has surely gone down. I ordered Mysore dosa and my hubby got cheese dosa and both were ok. Our 2nd order of cheese dosa took forever and it was soggy when it arrived ( dosa are supposed to be crispy). Everything was below average tasting but pricey. 
We wouldn't be returning any time soon. Oh yeah, service was awful! We were sitting in the front of the restaurant and our waitress came perhaps 2 times to check on us, we got up to order our 2nd dosa and got up again to check what was taking so long."}
{"text":"We ordered takeout. Two plates of chicken tikka masala, a thali and some naan bread. Food is pretty well seasoned, not too spicy or greasy and keeps in the fridge for atleast 3 days!

Nice spot for some Indian food at cheap prices!"}
