{"text":"Very friendly service, great daily lunch specials and tasty sushi.  The restaurant is quite cozy and quiet, which lends to a very relaxing lunch experience. When I was there, there was one server and one chef working, which meant that the food took a little longer than expected to come out, but the quality was good. Hilariously, the music was mostly softly played Korean pop music, but interspersed with some English language songs (Cher's \"Turn Back Time\")  Seeing that this spot is right across from my cousin's workplace, it's the perfect spot to meet up for a nice lunch."}

{"text":"This is literally a mama and papa shop with only a husband and wife team cooking and serving. The food was ok - nothing remarkable but passable. Service was very attentive and the prices are great     The portions were generous. We all ordered bento boxes but the best valued one was their Mikasa Special Bento for $14 - it came with shrimp tempura, veggie tempura, teriyaki (you pick beef, chicken or salmon) 2 gyozas, 3 pieces dynamite roll, 3 pieces salmon sushi, miso soup, salad, 2 small wedges of a sweet potato pancake, and sesame bean sprouts.   We also ordered agedashi tofu, which was done remarkably well.  But their grilled unagi was a disappointment.  It must be a rarely ordered dish, as they microwaved it (we heard the microwave when they were preparing our order) and it tasted like it was nuked food.   All said and done, it's a good value meal and you get what you pay for.  It isn't he best sushi (not by far) but if you are looking for value and decent quality and you are in the hood, give this place a try."}
