{"text":"Slow, disorganized service. Potatoes were soggy (microwaved).  My merguez pita sandwich was good, though. And the prices are good."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular but it's good fast food for the price. I've tried a beef sandwich and a chicken sandwich. Each is listed at $4 but If you buy two chicken sandwiches it's $3 for each one. If you buy another sandwich of higher value and a chicken sandwich, you only get charged $3 for the chicken one. There are some tables but it's a rather small place. Even though the prices are cheap, surprisingly they accept credit card."}
{"text":"My friend was telling me about this place saying they have super cheap stuff.  $3 for a shish taouk or shawarma sandwich, $2 for a falafel or vegetarian sandwich. Most other plates are between $5-10, and they offer fast food items like wings and burgers.  A lot of places that are super cheap (normally next to student areas) fail since they skimp on so much like quantity and quality and it's just not worth it.  I stuck to a couple of sandwiches and a soup (lentil), the chicken sandwich was not bad and the size is comparable to what's served elsewhere.  They were running low on beef shawarma, so the guy proceeds to plop 2 huge spoons of hummus, and places about a dozen beets and tomato slices in the sandwich to make up for the lack of beef. As if I can't tell.  The guy at the counter had such a poor attitude, serving the people before me with disdain and not even acknowledging me for 2 full minutes as i'm waiting there. Even his co-worker had to tell him to chill a bit.  Everybody's allowed to have a bad day, but if he's like that everyday, he's driving customers away.  I guess it's ok if you minimize your interactions with this guy (he has the glasses) or ask for delivery.   I might give it an extra star if i ever have to go back and the service is better."}
{"text":"Delivery order here.  I have to order 11 dollars minimum and pay 50 cents extra to qualify for delivery. My first order was a falafel with potatoes and a mango juice. I received a small mango juice for the price of three dollars. I could have a bigger bottle by adding one dollar more on my order if I go somewhere else... it was too small for the price I am paying.   On my second order, I ordered a shish Taouk, a coca cola, a small poutine and a lentil soup. I like everything on my order except the lentil soup. I think they skip on the lentils and add more oils in the soup to make up for the taste.   The price is alright for delivery. It does the job to satisfy my hunger."}
{"text":"I always like to stop here when I am on a hurry for quick lunch.  It is conveniently located near the Jewish Hospital / St-Mary's and metro cote-des-neiges.  I always order the same thing. You can have a shish taouk sandwich for 3.99 + tax or a falafel one for 2.99 + tax, and add in a few dollars for a trio. Shish taouk plate for 9.57 + tax.  Service is quick, the sandwich is not deceiving. Cheap.   J'aime arrêter ici pr un quick lunch. C'est proche de deux hôpitaux et du métro Côte-des-neiges. Je commande tjrs du shish taouk, du poulet grillé libanais !!  C'est pas cher et c'est bon. Je demande la sauce épicée dedans ;)"}
{"text":"Most inexpensive place in the area for Shish Taouk and Shawarma pitas. Tasteful, though a bit light on the toppings for the pitas (more than acceptable for the price). Quick service. Small dining area but not busy at all even during lunch. A safe choice."}
