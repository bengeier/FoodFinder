{"text":"They make the best pizza I can buy.  We get one a week ( during Football, basketball , hockey , and the Olympics, and during special holidays.  What I am saying is, we order a lot of pizza. Before we found Wiseguys, it was a gamble. Sometimes the pizza we would buy from many different parlors  was ok, and other times it was terrible. But since we started buying Wiseguys pizza, we have been very happy with the pies we get. Sometimes Dar picks em up, and sometimes they deliver, And we're not easy to find. We live in the woods. But either way the pizza is always great. We love their crust, and it all tastes good the next day or 2.  They are very polite on the phone and in person.  We tell our friends and family all the time how much we love Wiseguys Pizza . We have had them over to taste it too and they agree they are good at pizza.   Most important they aren't over priced. I'd rather tip well than to pay over priced pizza.   Wiseguys  keep up the good job.  We appreciate it."}
{"text":"Great local pizza shop. They have some of the best prices around. They put an add in the newer penny saver that comes to the house and it's one of the few pizza shops you can still get a large pizza at for under 10$. Will definitely go back."}
{"text":"This is one of my family's favorites! And who can blame us.... The pizza is affordable and very tasty! My family gets this pizza every time we are in town! If you haven't tried Wiseguys yet, what's holding you back? Give the Don a shot."}
{"text":"Was so excited to get your pizza today. It's been a few months since last order. Very disappointed in the quality of what I got.  Pizza is burnt on 1side not done on other. How sad is this   So not happy. What happened here!!! Used to be the best I've ever had. Now have to settle for second best down the street"}
{"text":"This place is a true north side establishment and that's why I love it.  It's raw.  You will wait while trying to place an order on the phone and upon arrival, however the pizza is the best bang for your buck! It's not the best pizza in Pittsburgh, but it is nice for the north siders who are trying to get their grub on- cheap!!  Pizza is def dee-licious , but not Rt.51 good!"}
{"text":"I have come to the belief that one thing Pittsburgh has A LOT OF is pizza joints. Some better than others. With that said there is a jewel in the crown of Pittsburgh's Northside called 'Wise guys pizza'. Their menu has a lot of great gangster names and sayings, and adds a bit of mystic to ordering for first timers. Specials like 'The Don', The GODFATHER,  'the Luca Brazzi' fish and The KINGPIN. Additionally there are phrases like; side action, and a hoagie you can't refuse. While the menu is good, it isn't the star of the show. My experience with Wiseguys is that their food is a GREAT meal for a GREAT price. Their salads A#1, their wings not too greasy, fatty, OR dry. To quote my friend Goldilocks,  these wings are JUST RIGHT. Now earlier in this review I spoke of stars. The star of Friday nights show was the cheese steak hoagie. Brimming w/meat FRESH I say again fresh vegetables, and (a pgh thing) fries. Me, and my two growing carnivores left our dinner table quite sated.  Have I eaten there before yes will I eat there again oh heck yes. They are a good bang for your buck with several specials everyday. I end my reviews with this statement and my review of Wiseguys pizza will be no different. I vote with my money and feet, and rest assured that both will be making many more trips to this eatery. If you haven't tried it. Try it. It almost makes it worth your time to move into their delivery area!!!"}
{"text":"Wise Guys is your typical off beat pizza shop. There are no frills, there are no items I would particularly recommend. However, if you'd like cheap pizza and the typical sides that come along with that then this is your spot. No room to sit and eat so pick it up and get out of there. I am not saying it's bad by any means, it just isn't anything special."}
{"text":"The make it quickly and the price is good. 2 times was enough for me to pass on a 3rd. The cheese and sauce are not the best. I hope they can make some improvements as it's close and I would love to have a good shop close."}
{"text":"i have had so much bad luck with this pizza place    so i stayed away itryed again and sooo disappointed the french fries were so burnt and tasted like they were cooked in old grease the tomatoes on the hoagies were not ripe they were green in some spots they need to get their act together i spend alot on pizza and hoagies they wont get my business any more i tryed to give them a chance you blow it wise guys"}
{"text":"Honestly, my mother LOVES this place whereas I on the other hand am not much a fan.  For me personally a pizza has to have a good sauce with flavor and spice. The crust has to have some volume. The cheese has to be melted and not like a thin sheet laid atop the pie. I enjoy eating pizza from here when it's my mother option to order....but for me, I need a thicker pizza with more flavor embedded into the sauce. Be sure to try it out for your self though and enjoy!"}
{"text":"There pizza never tastes the same Also if you order a salad always ask for dressing because they will not offer any. There are other better pizza places in the area."}
{"text":"If u just want a quick pizza this place is decent... If you want to enjoy your pizza look elsewhere. The changed something with the cheese and sauce and now it tastes terrible... Tastes old, bland and the dough is thin and burnt... Wings re good though"}
{"text":"This place seriously just took my order for delivery, charged my card taking my last $15 (hard times) only to call me back 30 minutes later saying they don't deliver to my street!!!! So my son and I won't eat tonight because these idiots can't properly train their staff by having a list of 'do not deliver to ' streets!!!  Thanks wise guys!!!  I'm literally in tears wondering how I'm going to feed my kid tonight..."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, Brighton Heights only has a few places within walking distance (or free delivery distance) that make good food.  Wiseguys is one I'm still on the fence about. 

I've had several items from them, wings, sandwiches, and pizza. Their pizza is par with the rest of the city, nothing special to write about. Their steak sandwich was bland and overcooked, but the veggies they added on were cooked well. They have several other sandwiches that are covered in obnoxious amounts of toppings, probably just to confuse your palate to thinking that you're eating something good. I must say though, their bread is really good. And this is coming from a South Philly girl. 

Their wings are hit or miss. The first few times I've ordered them, they were big and cooked well. I ordered last night, and they were puny and soggy. And now they charge 25Â¢ more for crispy? So I paid the extra charge and still got soggy wings. Oh, and don't tell me about delivery times,  I live two minutes from wiseguys. 

I think if they could get their consistency down, I'd be happy to order more often. They're great in a pinch, though. 

Happy Eating!"}
{"text":"Moving to Brighton Heights after living in Squirrel Hill, and Oakland and Monroeville before that, one of the main things I miss is great pizza. We've ordered from a bunch of places around Northside and Bellevue and they have all been super disappointing. The only place we've liked so far has been Wiseguys. The crust is thin and very crispy, even after being refrigerated, and the sauce is plentiful and well-seasoned. The sausage is mild, which I liked (perfect cold breakfast pizza!) but my husband wasn't impressed with it. Great price for the extra-large Don with coupons from the Pennysaver. It can't compare with my Squirrel Hill favorites, but if I want delivery, it will probably be from Wiseguys."}
