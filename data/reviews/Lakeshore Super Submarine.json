{"text":"This place is a great way to support hardworking Lakeshore folks and be hugely satisfied in the process.  We tend to splurge and go for the double meat, which may seem pricey (about 13 for a footlong meat lovers) until you see all the goodness. Toppings all very fresh, too."}
{"text":"Stopped ny for a sub today and parked out front thinking they werent open yet so we waited a few minutes. The owner recognized my wife and i in the car and 5 minutes later when we thought they were to open at noon the owner walked out handed over a free sub. He said im sorry we're closed today but here you go! Very nice man and we are always happy to go there."}
{"text":"I come by this place whenever I'm in the area.  The subs are great and George is great guy.  I get the BLT with double meat and its a hundred times better than Subway. Definitely worth it!!"}
