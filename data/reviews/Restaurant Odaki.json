{"text":"It's an all you can eat sushi bar with an interesting marry go round of sushi available if you get the all you can eat. It's decent quality, for the price. The environment is nice, very spacious and fancy. I would recommend this restaurant for those looking for sushi in downtown mtl"}
{"text":"As a sushi \"beginner\" I can tell that I like this place. The food is good and they have a huge diversity. It's basically a buffet where you can order off a menu as many times as you want, anything you want. They even have a small conveyor belt that goes around the restaurant with small plates of sushi, desserts etc.. Pretty cool if you ask me.   2 big cons for which I chose to give this only 3 stars:   PRICE. I went twice in the weekend and in the evening and I paid 70$ for 2 people. All you can eat..but still.. you can find cheaper places. I think they have a different price during the week.  SERVICE: waitresses seem to forget when you ask for an extra fork, glass of water etc..and they seem not to enjoy working there too much..   Overall a good place to eat."}
{"text":"Been there twice.  On my first visit the service was great and so was the food.  On my second visit the service was lacking and was the food. Very weird.  I guess I'll have to return and update this review."}
{"text":"traveled to Montreal with my friend. The sashimi tastes UNFRESH at all. If compared to any sushi AYCE in Toronto, I won't give any star to it... My only tips is..Just don't go there!"}
{"text":"I've been here a bunch of times. It's very modern, and clean. Has a very cool conveyer belt that brings the sushi to you straight from the kitchen, if you're sitting in a booth. The sushi is really good, especially the Dragon Eye(Or tiger Eye). They also have this desert sushi that is really good. I recommend it for a night out with friends for a nice experience in downtown Montreal."}
{"text":"This was the worst japanese food i have ever eaten. The manager admitted that the breaded scallops were frozen from a box but thought this was normal and did not seem to care about the fact that half the food was left on our table. The service was awful. The food was old, dry and not seasoned at all. The fried salmon had no salmon...the calamari was overcooked..even the tempura tasted awful. Must avoid at all costs!"}
{"text":"Food isn't that tasty, a lot of regular items were at an extra cost. Sashimi was an extra 3$ for 10 pieces, the dessert is extra as well."}
{"text":"I went there last weekend with my boyfriend. We were quite happy and excited to see that this restaurant had a rail conveying sushis to tables. We took the all you can eat combo. We ate so much sushi! they were very good and fresh and the service was excellent. The ambiance is also very quiet and relaxing. The only down side to this restaurant is the price. We payed 80$ (Saturday night for both of us). However, I will definitely come back for the yummy sushis!"}
{"text":"The food is good, the place looks good but the attitude of the attendent and the waitress is unacceptable! EVERYTIME I go there they ASK for the tip like if it eas an obligation and if you don't give any or not 15% they yell at you and argue with you! They don't know how to give a good custmer service!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. There are a variety of dishes to choose from  - sushi, makis, sashimi, teriyaki type dishes, tempura, soups, etc, which makes it a good choice for people who want to try different things.  You can eat a la carte (for lunch, I'm not sure about dinner time) or all you can eat ($17 for lunch, closer to $30 weekend nights).  Not all items are available on the lunch menu, however (seaweed salad, for example).    The makis are okay/good for an all you can eat place, which I think tend to be held to lower standards than a la carte sushi restaurants.  They wouldn't fly at an upscale sushi place, but we come here to pig out :P  Sometimes the flavours seem to have melded a bit (from being made a bit in advance?), but they're okay regardless.  The vegetarian maki with the pickled radish is pretty good, as are the california roll and the spicy salmon roll.  There are many more sushi/maki options available for dinner. A word of caution: don't order scallops from the wrong part of the menu.  And don't accidentally order six of them. You will be served giant raw scallops. Gulp. With a $1 charge for every piece left behind.   From the kitchen menu, the edamame beans are always a hit, and the general tao (yes, at a sushi place!) is pretty good, as are the teriyaki beef and chicken.  The tempura shrimp are nice and crispy.  I found the squid tentacles to be over cooked and charred, but the body (not offered during lunch) is good.      Service tends to better at lunch hour than at dinner, when there is less clientele.  If you're in the area and want to chow down lots of food, check it out.  But it isn't wow-worthy."}
{"text":"Went there with a friend on a Friday. The place looks great! But it took time for the us to be seated even though the place was empty. Got our seat, on my bench there was a mat (The kind you put in your bathroom). I asked the waiter if it was normal and she stared  laughing and said yes. All the rolls were pretty okay but we were disappointed that the sashimi was not included in the all you can eat. Another thing that I disliked was the teriyaki meat, the sauce was terrible."}
{"text":"The most basic, and worst, sushi buffet I've ever been to. We asked to change tables, they didn't allow it and made us sit in the section with the conveyor belt (which was the only interesting thing they had there). Other than that, we waited a very long time for someone to get our order and no one ever paid attention to our table.  I was fed up and decided to give the papers myself to one of the waitress and she started telling me rudely to wait and sit down. Ten minutes later, we finally get the waitress to take our paper and we were hungry ass hell by now. Not much sushi options and they all tasted so basic. Worst buffet experience in my life."}
{"text":"Worst sushi place in Montreal, period. Not only is the food horrible, but the service is bad, and the management is even worse. The last time we went, we were so upset with the service (we were there for over 2 hours on an empty Saturday for lunch!), and left the minimum tip of 15%. The manager CALLED US BACK on the way out angrily saying that 15% is not acceptable, and that we HAVE to put at least 20%. I was shocked and appalled and then had to explain to her that the food was horrendous and that the service was practically nonexistent, so the 15% we left was already more than anyone in their right mind would have left. Ugh, how rude."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time, I have to say I was impressed. They have a conveyor belt, but it mostly just brings dessert and ginger. The sushi is fresh and they have many creative types of sushi (there was one that was wrapped in cucumber which was amazing). The salt and pepper shrimp was fantastic, along with the pepper beef and tempuras. The service was also very good, the food came quickly and the waitress came to check on us every 5 minutes.   Definitely coming back to this place"}
{"text":"Great concept. Lots of sushi to choose from and a great selection of non sushi items as well.  I love the conveyor that brings other random sushi around. Although I ordered from the menu mostly, the conveyor allows you to see and try some types of sushi that I may not have known about before.  A bit pricey, as it was a bit more expensive than most all you can eat places. Although I won't go too often for that reason, I still think its worth trying."}
{"text":"I've been here twice now and the conveyer belt draws me in every time! Its so cool!  I wouldn't recommend all you can eat sushi here though, the selection is not very large and what they do have is only decent for the price you pay. You also have to buy your own ice cream afterwards! shocking, I know. While your waiting for your checklisted sushi to come, you can take anything off the conveyer belt as it is included in the all you can eat.  The food is good I will give them that and the conveyer belt wins my heart over."}
{"text":"Worst sushi of my life!, worst place ever, the sushi it's not fresh! It's old!, be careful taste like almost decompose, no coming back never, just writing this to advice be careful!"}
{"text":"I've never been to a restaurant before that had a train of sushi pass by your table every few seconds, and all you had to do was grab the plate you wanted.   If sushi is not your thing, or if you want a more specialized sushi item that doesn't appear on the train, you can order it on the extensive all-you-can-eat menu.  Pros: Convenient location, the service was friendly, and the food arrived fast. Portion sizes are just right, and you can always order more if you want. The only place I've seen dessert sushi. Cons: The price is quite high, even for a sushi-bar. The sushi train only works if people sitting at the other tables don't scoop up all of the items before it arrives to you. And also some items were missing from our order, so we had to order them again.  All in all a decent experience, and I would return again for a special occasion, but probably couldn't afford going here on a regular basis."}
{"text":"I'm not clear on why all of the negative reviews of this place....my wife and I were in Montreal, and found this place accidentally.  We ate there two days in a row because it was so delicious, and the service was wonderful.  My wife is vegetarian, so good sushi options are not often found.  The veggie \"mini pizzas\" were amazing, and she commented that it was the best sushi she has ever had.  The sake and beers are all 2 for 1.  What's not to like about this place?  The fish is also outstanding, the atmosphere is very comfy and stylish.  Go Odaki!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty much one of the regular spots that my sister and I like to get together with friends. We make sure to get a booth by the conveyor belt, and then order as much as we think we can consume. I think that between 4 of us we got so much stuff, it's not surprising that we walked out with food babies. It's not the most creative place, and it's not the highest quality, but you can stuff yourself silly with a variety of items. In NY you can't really find sashimi when you have AYCE sushi in a lot of places, so I can happily get a few types here, which eases the guilt on over-eating. The warm foods come in really small portions, so remember that when ordering."}
{"text":"All you can eat but served to you.  Tea not included..  They took too long to seat us even when it wasn't busy I had to ask to be seated 3x.  We also called in reservations...retardo!  Too much rice on the maki rolls.  They didn't really check on us.  We had to ask for water a couple of times, wasbi, and soy sauce.  I don't really like to come here but friends wanted to meet and that is why we suggested not to come..bc of bad service.  I'm just sayin.. annoying!"}
{"text":"I love this place, I find it comparative to Kanda's. The Dragon Eye is to die for and is served topped with a yummy spicy mayo *drool*. The sushi is fresh and served fast. Good wait staff that even ran over with a fresh pair of chop sticks when my friend dropped hers. Two dollars more expensive than Kanda's but it's worth it. The only thing I find is that the sushi pizza isn't as good as at Kanda's but they are two very different things which should have different names."}
{"text":"Nice looking sushi place with all-you-csn eat or a la carte  options.  Depending on what table you sit at, you can order either a la carte or all you can eat, but not a mixture, so everybody needs to have a similar appetite. To supplement the all you can eat menu items you can order they also have little sushi boats on one of those conveyor belts  that are popular in Japan, but at least when we were there there were not enough clients to assure that the circulating sushi was really fresh. Perhaps as a result,  the circulating plates tend towards highly produced items with fried (tempura) exteriors,  as opposed to simple things like sashimi."}
{"text":"Quite honestly the worst restaurant I have ever been to. I ordered the Alaska roll (which everyone knows has salmon sashimi and avocado) and asked my server if they had any rolls with shrimp tempura. She told me that the Tempura Maki did, so I ordered that as well. The server came back with two rolls that did not remotely resemble what I had ordered. The \"Alaska roll\" had imitation crab instead of salmon and the \"shrimp\" tempura maki did not contain any shrimp, just more imitation crab and some egg. When I politely asked the server if this was the correct order, she brought it back to the chef and was told that it was. I figured that they might just use different ingredients in their rolls (which they should have mentioned on the menu) and decided to just eat them. I thought the rolls would taste fine, but I was horribly mistaken. The Alaska roll was ok at best; the imitation crab was dry and slightly tasteless. The tempura maki, on the other hand, was downright mediocre; I could not even finish my plate. Furthermore, my sister ordered the pork katsu, which had weird-tasting sauce and only nine measly pieces. To add to all this pain, the prices were way too much for the quality. Avoid this place if you can."}
{"text":"I would recommend this restaurant for late munchies, if you're craving sushis at night and everything else is already closed.  Sushis and sashimis combos were ok. Nothing special here, just fine. When you buy 2 of these, 2nd is 50% off.   Service was pretty good, maybe because it was so late restaurant was empty."}
{"text":"I found it a little too pricey for an all you can eat sushi place.  The cost was $30 per person which from my experience is one of the more expensive all you can eat sushi places.  The service was slow and the food was okay but nothing to write home about.."}
{"text":"Very nice! And they have actual wasabi, not that fake stuff that MOST places in Montreal carry. The 'Beauty' roll is delicious, crisp, and refreshing (it's wrapped in sliced cucumber). Between ordering and being served, the wait time is pretty short. The servers are quite helpful and attentive. This establishment also has one of the better miso soups I've had in Montreal so far as well. Finally, it's quite inexpensive to go the 'all you can eat' route (the wait time for their regular menu can be a bit lengthy). Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Soirée particulièrement agréable au restaurant Odaki. Un accueil sympathique, des serveuses disponibles sans être collantes. Le service était rapide et ce n'est pas très cher. Nous avions commandés des sushi, un m'avait fait succombé mais je ne me rappelle plus du nom :( J'ai gouté la soupe udon, super bonne !! Je recommande ce restaurant pour les couples."}
{"text":"J'ai très apprécié ma soirée au restaurant Odaki. Le service était rapide, sans être \"rush\". Nous avons dit à la serveuse que nous voulions prendre notre temps avant de commander elle a été respectueuse et n'est pas venu nous demander si nous voulions commander 50 fois. Ce qui est particulièrement intéressant dans ce restaurant est la possibilité de prendre le menu à la carte pour des sushis ou d'autres types de repas ou de prendre le menu régulier. Le repas de crevettes tampura et de général tao était excellent.  I love this restaurant. The service is fast but not too rush. I had tempura shrimp and general tao and it was delicious. You can order sushi or other dishes on the \"all you can eat\" menu or in the regular menu."}
{"text":"this place is really not good at all, probably one of the worst all you can eat sushi restaurants that I have been to. Really not worth the price for what you are getting, not to mention that they don't even include any type of dessert on the menu or even green tea. Way too many extra charges and small bland portions.  I won't be returning"}
{"text":"Pour une premier fois que je vais chez odaki pas dessus Sushi a volonté pour 18.99 du lundi au jeudi et 20.99 vendredi au dimanche beaucoup de choix nourritures très bonne je vais revenir ses sure"}
