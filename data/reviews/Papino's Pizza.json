{"text":"This is one of the best pizza spots! You definitely get your money's worth at Papinos. The wings are always nice and saucy. The pizza is always tasty. The potatoe wedges are real potatoes. What else could you ask for?!?"}
{"text":"Good pizza and prices. Papino's has been around for years now, maybe even over a decade. It's a no frills pizza spot, and no room to sit down and eat your pizza. This place is best for pizza take-out."}
{"text":"Sometimes it takes forever for them to answer the phone. But its worth it 11$ for and extra large pepperoni with extra cheese...can't beat it.. You can get 24 chicken wings, wedges or fries, 4 pops and a large pizza for $23../ I called pizza pizza just for kicks... Guess how much almost $60"}
{"text":"Papinos is probably my go to spot if I want a quick fix for dirt cheap wings. You can get 10 wings and wedges plus a can of pop for $7.50. I don't think you can find a deal like that anywhere else. Also they are very generous with the amount of wedges they give you. The wing flavors aren't amazing but hey I'm not going complain about it, you pay for what you get. The only thing I have to say about it that the area is a little sketchy. Not  the safest neighborhood. I normally just call in my order and they are usually done within 15-20 mins. It's a quick in and out as long as there's no line up. They also offer other food items such as pizza but I usually pass because you can probably find something similar in pricing up better quality elsewhere.   Pros: Dirt cheap for the amount that you get   Cons: Neighborhood is a little rough  Minimal parking spaces Customer service could be better"}
{"text":"Great deal for pizza or wings for take out. Dining isn't really the best choice with only one table and 4 seats. Take out is definitely the way to go to eat here!   Pros: - Price: You cannot beat the price here! You can spend less then $10 a person for an order  - Food: Wings here are pretty good for the price point. I also like the garlic bread and the    Cons: - Parking: Very little parking in this lot. I believe its about  - Calling: Sometimes they don't pick up, sometimes they do. You will have to keep calling repeatedly to answer, but when you place your order, it takes about 15 minutes which is standard most places.  - Store: The store itself is a little rough around the edges, but everyone is very nice!   Foods I like: - Wings with Wedges (Honey Garlic is really good. It has a sticky texture, so recommend eating your wings in one sitting and not keeping for overnight. I personally like the wedges over the fries because they are thicker and more flavourful.) - Garlic Bread - Pizza"}
{"text":"I used to come here as a teenager so often Cheap pizza and wings, I mean you cant go wring. Its been over 10 years since Ive came here. I was in the area we were starving so dropped in for a combo. 3 pops, 10 wings,wedges and a large pizza w 3 topping for 20$ Thats a steal. The pizza was quite thin and didnt have much taste. The wings are so tiny , l didnt understand how or why  I definitely wont be back this is the kind of place you go to late at night when your starving and/or drunk and need a quite cheap bite. Otherwise issa no for me!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times and sometimes I don't mind paying less for food that isn't as good as the next place taste wise, but makes up for it quality wise. You can spend a fraction of the price at a typical pizza place at papino's and get enough to feed a family and have leftovers. The wings aren't that great but when you're spending $25 for a bunch, plus fries/wedges, pizza and 4 drinks you can't complain at all. Perfect for a couple guys getting together to watch a Raptors game and pitching in together for dinner, speaking for myself. I wouldn't eat inside though, it's hotter than a sauna inside. Some people don't trust Asian people cooking pizza, but they know what they're doing."}
{"text":"Small family pizza store with cheap prices. My mom loves the pizza here so it's usually where we buy it. With that said, it's not the best pizza, but for the price it's pretty good. The wings are alright, pretty small but fried on the spot and drenched in sauce. It's definitely a take out/delivery place as there's only one table for dining and it's quite hot in the shop."}
{"text":"This place has decent pizza and great value. It is definitely a little rough around the edges but the quality is there and you won't find better prices for what you're getting."}
