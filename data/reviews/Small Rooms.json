{"text":"A coworker and I visiting from Seattle picked this place off of our rental's GPS system.  We had no internet access to preview our meal.  Thankfully, modern technology paid off tonight.  

The setting is charming, a 60's-70's blast from the past.  Very different on the inside than the out.  I had 8 oz New York and Shrimp.  He had the 16 oz New York.  The entire meal was fantastic, from the olives and fish pate opener to the main course closer.  No room for dessert.  I haven't had a steak that good in a while.  Also, the shrimp were perfectly butterflied and cooked.  For a Mom & Pop Steak Shop, I got exactly what I wanted, an awesome meal while out on the road.  A perfect cure for sleeping early to adjust to the time zone change,  Food coma imminent!"}
{"text":"We love to come here, the food is great steaks and sea food plater are Yuuuummmmmyyyyyyy

Yes the decor is somewhat dated, yet the food as mentioned is superb."}
{"text":"The food at Small Rooms is comparable to The Octagon Restaurant and David Duncan House. They definitely know how to cook their meats and their prices are lower. If these points are high on your list of priorities then this is the place for you.

There are a few things I would like to add to ensure you have a good experience:
1. The environment is old-school and rustic. Probably not the best place to try for the first time if you want to entertain someone.
2. Call ahead of time to make sure what you want to order from their menu is available that night. Unfortunately, I came in for dinner early in the week so they didn't have Prime Rib or Oysters.
3. Don't expect too much from the sides. Focus on the main attraction--the meat! My table had the Rib Steak, NY Striploin, and Filet Mignon. They are spot on with their execution.
4. Service is pretty straight-to-the-point. The lady server was charming in her own way. I think some people may find it a bit off-putting but I didn't mind.

All in all, there's something honest and simple about Small Rooms. I respect this family-owned restaurant. My entire experience may not have been perfect but I can't help but smile. Sort of like a real ain't-perfect-but-that's-family-that's-life kind of smile. Maybe I'm projecting :)... LOL!"}
{"text":"Small Rooms is one of North York's best kept secret. I wasn't expecting much due to the dated decor, but was blown away by the food. We ordered the charcoal grilled steak and it was cooked to perfection. Moist, juicy, tender, thick with just the right charring.

This is a place that obviously cares about good-quality food... Even the paté and olives that came with the bread was really good. I seriously cannot wait to go back.

We went on a Friday night, and it it was moderately busy. If you're not a steak person, the menu has many options such as fish and chicken."}
{"text":"Well based on the reviews we were excited at the propect of making a find. We did, but not a find you'd want. The toasted garlic bread and taramusilato was good,and the appetizers were passable. Then the main courses came,as we had steaks last night we chose dishes involving fish. The Neptune Chicken with hollandaise was disappointung, as it was cooked too much, and the hollandaise was not good, separating and the fries were frozen. The sole stuffed with crab, again that hollandaise sauce and the fish was not any sole I've eaten before. The pungence of fish was overpowering. The rice was not warm, and the veggies were hard, not cooked but flashed to heat. All in all it was an extreme let down. Waste of $100, not to be repeated. Shows you you can't rely on reviews, as people aren't honest."}
{"text":"I've now been to Small Rooms Steak house about 15 times as it is very close to my work. This is a steak house so when you go here gotta get the 6oz filet with garlic mash and veg. For an appetizer try the garlic sautéed shrimps they are very tasty and the garden house salad with oil & vinegar. Finish off with a cappuccino or espresso.

The owners are very nice and the hospitality is great."}
{"text":"This is one of my top five restaurants in Toronto, lots of reasons why but foremost, I love Star Trek the original series and I love good food.

This place has awesome food, and real variety. I like to pretend I am in the Rat pack when I go here.

My wife doesn't like it because its too empty, but I do a lot of business lunches here because its not too busy and the food is awesome.

I had never had Taramosalata ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taramosalata ) or Oysters Rockefeller ( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oysters_Rockefeller ) till I went here. Now these are my two favorite dishes there.

There is lots of cool retro seafood dishes that make you feel like a big shot from the 50's or a Good Fella.

Hit me back with you thoughts.

Open Invitation!

I am going here for lunch on June 22nd 2010, at 12:00 with some new friends, come join me!"}
{"text":"The environment of the place is romantic.. Good place to go with your date.  Food was just right,  delicious and fast service.. It was a hidden gem"}
{"text":"This place is quite nice.  You can't tell from outside but once you go inside it's very different. When we went in it was not very busy.   In fact there were only us and one or two other people there.   So it was super quiet.  The decor was quite nice, but the lighting was a bit too dark for my taste.  The food on the other hand was quite lovely.  I really enjoyed the garlic bread with the caviar patay they gave us.  It was delicious.  For the main I had the stuffed Sole with fries and a creamy garlic salad. It was quite good.  Overall it was a nice experience.  I would recommend checking the place out."}
{"text":"This is definitely a hidden gem! I've gone here a few times the past 6-7 years and I'm never disappointed. You will have to keep an open mind as you step in though as the decor is a little (ok, VERY) outdated. Picture the scene on the old tv sitcom, \"Cheers\" lol It's a more quiet/private dine in experience, so great for you if you enjoy a place where you can talk. Wait time is a little longer for orders to come out but it's certainly worth the wait. The steak we order is always cooked to perfection with just a simple side but it is delicious. Portion I would say is good to generous. Price is extremely reasonable! Please don't come in expecting over the top fancy plating. The food is simple but it's all about the star of the plate, the meat! (The seafood is fresh and delicious too) I can't really recommend anything specific as I've tried pretty much everything on the menu and nothing has disappointed me. The complimentary appetizer that they always give before bringing the entree out comes with garlic toast, fish paté and pickles. THE FISH PATÉ IS TO DIE FOR!!! I have dreams about it! *droool* LOL The older woman that is always there (I'm assuming the owner) is a sweet heart!!! She always takes great care of us. Even gift us a little fish paté to take home on my husband's 30th birthday cause she knew we loved it so much!"}
