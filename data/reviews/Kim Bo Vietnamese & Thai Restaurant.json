{"text":"The soups are good. The broth is flavourful.
I would like to see more grilled options on the menu though."}
{"text":"The service at this restaurant has downgraded significantly. The waitress was talking on her cell phone as she showed me to my table and gave me a piece of paper to write down my order. The food is not different from any other Pho restaurant in Markham. I don't think I'll be returning."}
{"text":"Wheni first walk in it was a good breathe of fresh air. New renovations, very clean very comftorable. Ive been to other kim bo/po or whatever and they've all been pretty good. It seems like they are going through a whole bunch of rennovations giving their places a cleaner feel. I order the same thing everytime i goto a Kim. The house special Fukein Noodles.

It came in about 5-8 minutes so it was fairly fast. The taste was spot on exactly how i like it. (Dont forget to add some hot peppers). I always liked it because they gave 2 types of noodles. Its always refreshing, never really get bored of eating just the one kind.

I managed to pay the bill around $11-12 including tips. I thing most kim po's are pretty good, but i like this one the most because its only 5 min drive from where i live lol"}
{"text":"I usually get the house special, soup is good but the bean sprouts and green onion always look dirty with a tint of brown... I usually pick it out. Noodles soup usually comes with thick noodle unless you request for dry/thin noodles (but even their dry noodle is thicker than normal). Service there is awful; the waitress is rude, talks on her CELL phone while taking orders/bringing food to the table and refuses/makes a hassle to bring extra anything - she will tell you the meal comes with whatever you're asking for. But nonetheless the food is decent."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Food was very flavorful!!!! The staff and owner are so friendly. Very warm comfortable environment. Definitely recommend this place !!!!!!!! The pho is sooo good!!!"}
{"text":"beware everyone!!! please take caution when ordering anything chicken or beef. they're not actually chicken and beef. they speak vietnamese here.  i overheard the staff talking behind the cash."}
{"text":"No matter where you live and no matter how many times you go to certain plazas, malls, etc., there will always be that one place that, for some reason, you always seem to miss.

Well, until this past weekend, that place was Kim Bo in the Middlefield and Steeles plaza (Scarborough).  So, after a nice round of shopping at T&T (same plaza), I decided to have some lunch, finally, at Kim Bo.  

**A bonus - there is a wonderful Viet deli next door that sells those amazing Banh Mi subs!!**

Be forewarned...on a busy day, parking is like it is in your typical Chinese-store dominated plaza...i.e. it makes you want to kill someone.

I actually thought this place was a franchise of a similarly named place near Keele and Finch (called KIEM Bo...but it appears that the Chinese characters are virtually the same for both places...odd.)

First thing I noticed was the decor.  Unlike most Pho places around the GTA, this place was NOT primarily decorated with those old-looking dining chairs with the black metal piping and the weird, plastic, crappily-decorated seat and back pads that make a *PFFTT* sound when you sit on them.  In fact, this place looked rather nice, and I understand that they had renovated the place some time ago.  Definitely a plus, despite the fact that I don't go to Pho places for the decor.

Now for the food.  Unlike most people, I don't usually order Pho (I hate hate HATE cilantro...except in fresh salsa, but that's another story).  So, I can only comment on the Co'm Su'o'n (BBQ pork chop, shredded pork and fried egg on a bed of steamed rice), the fried spring rolls and the Viet coffee:

Appetizer:  The fried spring rolls appeared to be about 10% or so larger than the ones at Pho 88, Pho Mi, etc.  Nothing spectacular, but definitely good if you don't mind the fried stuff.

Main dish:  Be prepared to eat, because everything about my dish was LARGE.  My order came on a rectangular plate that was covered with rice!!  I also got TWO fried eggs, and a nice big piece of pork chop.  The dish was good, but I found it to have too much ginger.  Perhaps that's not always the case, but in any event, it did not detract from the good taste.

Drink:  I LOVE coffee.  Maybe I could even be called a borderline coffee snob.  Despite this, believe me when I tell you that even I considered their Viet coffee STRONG.  Now this was not a negative for me, as I love a good strong coffee.  Just be prepared.  The strength of this drink knocked me back a bit!!!

ANYWAY, it was an altogether satisfying meal.  I will definitely be going there again."}
{"text":"I wanted to love this place, but the best I can give is 3 stars. I ordered the \"PHO\" - very freshly made thin rice noodle rolls. The filling was a bit under seasoned but the noodle was great."}
{"text":"I really love their House special noodles! Especially the soup and the garlic bits that you can add to it. Their pho is okay tasting as I have had better elsewhere. Service is okay. Portions are too small and hours of operation is too short (last call at 9:45pm). Prices are too expensive for some items like spring rolls. Would not recommend this place for pho."}
{"text":"Quick Simple review: 
-  many parking spaces
- good location!
- noodle soup quality is not bad
- the ambiance...there really is no real ambiance.. feels like you're in someone's house with strangers. Not complaining though!
- inexpensive
- okay manner from staff
- not a fancy place for a first date unless your date is down to earth af. 

- if you're high maintenance and expect no water mineral stains on your cups - don't come here. you will complain.

Highly recommend : Bun Bo hue!"}
{"text":"Something warm on a cold night. This restaurant wasn't crowded on a Sunday night during dinner hours. It was rather tidy and cosy for an asian place.

Each of us ordered our own beef rice noodle soup of different variations. Mine was #063 on the menu: Pho Tai, Gan (rare beef and beef tendon rice noodle soup). As a group, we also ordered a food platter #014: Mon Khai Vi Kim-Bo. This is a house assorted appetizer with spring rolls, sugar cane with wrapped meat, and shrimp cracker with pork meat on top.

I really loved everything that came in the platter, especially the shrimp cracker wrap - it was quite tasty and not too salty for its style of cooking. The noodles were quite soft and thin, plus the soup base was well made too.

On the flip side, the service was mediocre because when they served the noodle soups, the waitress didn't even mention which bowl was which. She also wasn't sure where to place the bowls and kept pushing away our chopsticks in a rude manner.

Overall, I still wouldn't mind going back again for the food!"}
{"text":"I really like this place.  The soup for their pho is delicious. When I eat here,  I usually order a small pho because it's quite a lot. I also recommend their vermicelli dishes too. The meat is not fatty like some other places and grilled to the right temperature. Their shrimp rolls are 4 dollars. They are pretty decent size too. Recently I tried their appetizer platter. I recommend it as it gives a sample of all their known for appetizers. It's never too busy here so I like that. When you need something, the waitress gets it to you quite fast. The owner is also really friendly,  we came to eat around closing time once and he said not to worry, he is in no rush and would wait until we are done. I've been here maybe 7 or 8 times in the last 3 years. I think the quality has been consistent."}
{"text":"I come here often for Vietnamese noodle. I come here mainly for the convenience, because it is close by my house, and the service is fast. 

However, the quality of the food is not particularly great. The noodle is generally soggy, the meat and brisket is hard, the soup has a lot of MSG. Well, you get what you get for the price you pay. The dishes are actually quite cheap. This place isn't bad if you want to cure your hunger with some Vietnamese noodle fast!"}
{"text":"I am pretty spoiled when it comes to Vietnamese food since my mom was born and raised in Vietnam.  So I get the good stuff at home.  I don't get easily impressed with the stuff I get when I dine out.

I decided to opt for something other than Beef Pho this time and tried their House Special Noodles which is a duo of egg noodles and vermicelli, with a huge shrimp \"cracker\", thinly sliced pork and Vietnamese ham.

For $1 more, there's no reason you shouldn't go for the Large.  The broth was very flavourful, but just as msg-laden as everywhere else.  The shrimp cracker had one of the smallest shrimps I've seen embedded into it.  Stingy!  However, the shrimp cracker was full of flavour and added a nice crunch to the dish.

William T.'s \"Three Colour Rice\" was delicious.  The pork chop had a nice fat to meat ratio and was charred nicely.  The pork quiche was fresh and light, not hard and unsavory like most of the store-bought stuff that most Vietnamese restaurants slap onto your plate.  

The Vietnamese coffee here is probably one of the better ones I've had.  I bet the restaurant owner is a coffee connoisseur because it was not just a sugary cup of java they labeled as coffee.  The coffee is rich and full-bodied.  

Cash only."}
{"text":"My wife and I ordered had very high hopes for this restaurant--it was recommended by my wife's cousin. We ordered a pho dac biet and Thai red curry. 

Their \"Pho Dac Biet\":
The essence of the pho, the broth, was horrible. It seemed like they took two parts chicken stock to one part oil/grease, threw in the pan drippings from the cooked meat and then added two-times the salt (or msg) they should've. I will say, the meat in the pho was actually quite good, excluding the \"meatballs\" that were made from an unidentifiable, rubbery meat. However, the meat becomes irrelevant when the soup's broth is SO BAD.

Their \"Red Thai Curry\":
My wife ordered it with vegetables. We still have no idea what they actually brought to the table. It was green, contained no curry and had the consistency of raw egg whites. The only flavor was of ginger. My wife had one bite and spat it out. It was, in fact, inedible. (Note: red curry is usually RED, contains Thai red curry, with a coconut milk base.)

All that said, not only was this restaurant's \"pho\" the worst rendition I've ever had, this place actually has THE WORST FOOD I'VE EVER HAD AT A RESTAURANT. It's quite annoying how bad the food is there."}
{"text":"House noodle was alright... I like their banh xeo but it was slightly soggy underneath"}
{"text":"I ordered the house special soup. The soup was delicious and flavorful, although it was a little saltier than I'm used to. My boyfriend ordered the grilled pork chop and chicken with rice. He loved the dish and finished it all within minutes. The only downside to this visit was that the two servers working were extremely rude and when it came to paying for the bill there debit machine wasn't working so it was very inconvenient."}
{"text":"As previous reviews have mentioned don't go in with expectations for a fancy experience.  It is very down to earth and the food is still really good but it's more so a casual lunch place. The pad thai is absolutely amazing!! When I'm craving pad thai this is where I go for a huge portion for a comparably small price.  Don't bother with chains like Thai Express when you can get twice even three times the amount. 

Another MUST TRY when there is the salt and pepper tofu..it's so flavourful and again it's priced so low for the quality.  

The service is good, atmosphere is just okay and could probably use a modern update.. Even just a fresh coat of paint would help immensely."}
{"text":"One of the closest places for pho around here, I decided to try it out.

Walking into the restaurant, we were asked how many people there were and were greeted nicely. The servers offered us tea and gave us a chance to look at the menus. I was still looking through the menus and I sensed the server standing right there looking at our table as if they wanted us to hurry up with our order, so we quickly ordered.

We got the pho and the rice with lemongrass pork. The food tasted average for a Vietnamese restaurant, pork was cooked nicely, etc. However, I'm giving it a lower rating because most of the food was not hot enough. The pho got cold pretty quickly, and the noodles weren't the fresh type of noodles that I like to eat. The beef that was in the pho had quite a bit of fat in it as well. In addition, I felt quite thirsty after eating the pho, indicating that there was quite a bit of MSG in the soup base."}
{"text":"Modest house over here - in no way is this place fancy. The decor itself is decent but as a whole the entire restaurants vibe tells you how their food will be. I'm always coming back for a great priced bowl of Pho or Pad Thai and ALWAYS getting their Salt and Pepper tofu for $5 (nice portion too). I'm a local here and this place has been with us for awhile and I hope it doesn't go."}
{"text":"I'm a pho connoisseur, and this place is just mediocre. The portion size is quite nice for people with large appetites. They don't skimp on the toppings either, but the broth is not up to standards. The broth does not taste anything like an oxtail and basil consumme. Besides the broth, the rest of the dish is pretty good. Their other selections are not bad either. They use the Vietnamese-style shredded rice for their rice dishes, which makes them pretty authentic. Their fish sauce mixture is pretty flavourful, without being over-powered by too much garlic or chili. Prices are fair, and seating is comfortable. 3 stars, because I label these types of restaurants as 'pho joints' and never really order other dishes, unless I'm sharing with a friend. Otherwise, they would deserve a 4-star rating overall."}
{"text":"This place was a random choice for myself and friend as we were in the area and looking for Vietnamese food and were starving. I've been to many Vietnamese places, and in comparison to those this place was a major disappointment. 

The Good:
We mistakenly ordered a milkshake that wasn't wanted instead of my main meal. Although I did add prices when jotting down my order that should have jogged the waitress in verifying the order, as she did with my friend's order. But in the end I did not have to pay (after speaking with the manager) for that shake. 

The Bad:
The service was absolutely horrible. And the food mediocre. 

Not only were we ignored from the get-go but we constantly had to repeat orders and flag the waitress or manager down for things that should have been provided. For instance, my friend ordered Pho, typically this comes with basil, bean sprouts and lime wedges. We didn't get that but the table next to us did for theirs. We also didn't receive any water or tea while the other tables got theirs right from the start. I had to ask and then ask for a refill. 

For the food my friend order a tripe with rare beef pho. She specifically requested for more tripe and didn't receive it. Portion size was decent but you barely saw any tripe. 
I order vermicelli with pork, shrimp on sugar cane, and a spring roll. Portion size was decent and it was ok. I did find the sugar cane stale though. I also tried the avocado milkshake which I was extremely disappointed with as it lacked any flavour. 

Overall, I wouldn't go back or recommend this place as the food wasn't that great and the service horrendous. I can't even say that the poor service was due to a language barrier because both the waitresses and manager were able to communicate to us perfectly when they did talk."}
{"text":"Amongst the busy T&T plaza, small shops and banks, Kim Bo is a hidden gem if you're ever up for some Vietnamese food.  When I first walked in, the spacious layout, and simple yet elegant decor had some good appeal.  Thankfully when I arrived the place was not too busy, with a few clientele here and there.  
The service was very efficient, and their menu with pictures were well layed out.  
In the end I ordered their classic Vietnamese PHO noodle soup with 'all the works' in either Small $6.50 or Large size $7.50, I opted for the small bowl which was more than enough.  Portions were satisfying, taste was perfect (no too salty) and their prices are very reasonable.  We ordered their spring rolls served with Fish sauce for starters which was an enjoyable eat :)
Overall I'm glad I came here to Kim Bo, great service, great food, clean place and reasonable.... what more can you want?"}
{"text":"Quite standard as far as Vietnamese food goes. Pho was quite tasty and clean tasting. One of the better pho restaurants in markham. 

Spring rolls on the other hand was on the oily side. 

Prices were reasonable for portion sizes.

There are 2 locations.  This is the second. The original located right across Pacific mall on Steeles."}
{"text":"April 4 2018 - Firsttimer - I asked a friend for a good Pho spot.. he told me to try Kim Bo at Kennedy and Steeles but my gps only found the one at Milliken and Steeles ?. The restaurant was empty when we got there but soon after ppl started to come (windy day in Scarborough). I ordered Pho Raw Beef w/ beef balls . The portions are very generous and the price is very good. I can't remember what I paid but it was a good price. The flavour was very good I really loved it . I really like Pho with Hoisin sauce & Sriracha ... sorry I can't remember the name of the other dish, but it was good (when you squeeze lime on it, it highlights the flavour)"}
{"text":"I enjoy good Vietnamese food, although no restaurant has matched the dishes cooked by my Vietnamese friend's Mom. It kinda proves that home cooking is often the best.

Anyway, I met some friends for lunch at this place in North Scarborough. The parking lot was deserted since T&T Supermarket closed down, so parking was not an issue. I arrived before my friends and was greeted and seated promptly in a friendly manner.

My friends had eaten here before so I ordered the Spring Roll with Grilled Pork and Vermicelli as they recommended. They also recommended we pay a little more ($2) to get extra pork. Hmmm, okay. Well, I guess they really love that dish because they both ordered the exact same thing!

It didn't take long for the food to arrive and the presentation was very attractive. The portion size looked good but I don't know how much \"extra\" pork we got. I may just have to order it that way whenever I come back.

The flavour was good, maybe not fantastic, but very good. The spring roll was crispy, and hot on the inside. The pork was well seasoned and cooked properly, with a little carmelization. Crushed peanuts added a little texture and a mix of sriracha and hoisin sauce made the perfect complement.

I'll be back..."}
{"text":"To me and my girlfriend it sucked noodles over cooked meat portion was tiny service was horrible they looked miserable I don't know this just wasn't worth it"}
{"text":"Tried the house special noodle and really didn't find anything special about this dish. There was a mixture of thin noodles and thick noodles and some beef. For $7.50 it was okay but nothing special and I have to agree with Jennifer K. - this dish is small and not really filling. And just to add to this there was very little beef which made me sad. To make myself happy again I also got the chicken skewers for $6. When ever I see chicken skewers on the menu I will never say no to it. It came with four pieces and they were covered with peanut sauce. I could eat these all the time and never get bored of them."}
{"text":"Good portion of meat served.  The broth is not as good as I have tasted in other pho places. I've traveled to different countries including Vietnam to try both the beef n chicken pho. Their beef broth is 7 /10 and chicken broth is 3/10.
A bit oily on the soup.  The Vietnamese spring rolls is good."}
{"text":"3.5/5

Kim Bo, Kim Po, Kim...man why can't they all just group and standardize the actual restaurant name?

Kim Bo is the 4th Kim branch I've been to (Richmond Hill, Scarborough, and original location are the others). This is definitely the quietest of the restaurants I've been to, but considering I had lunch at 4pm...I'm not too surprised.

I decided to try something different with this restaurant. I ordered the crab meat with Vietnamese udon thick soup. My dad had this dish at the Scarborough Kim Po and really liked it, so I thought I'd give it a shot. Indeed, I overall enjoyed it. My experience was dented a bit as I burned my tongue at first sip (damn that soup is hot!), so I didn't actually properly taste what the soup actually tasted like. The udon was definitely an interesting texture that I can't describe, but it's nothing like Japanese udon.

Service was typical Asian \"do it yourself\" style. That is, don't expect much in terms of service. Write the order yourself, give them the order form, and that's pretty much all the communication you'll need for this place. I'm not frequently in this plaza, but if I'm shopping at the T&T and am hungry, I would stop by here.

Free wifi! Ask for password."}
{"text":"the food at this location is mediocre at best , i have eaten at this franchise for many years
this this owner used to be located in kensington market besides the bad food there was a very rude waitress that made me not ever want to come back

1/5 stars cause this particular franchise location is really bad"}
{"text":"A small gem hidden in a busy Plaza. This establishment has plenty of variety. Their Pad Thai isn't too bad... big portions.

I ordered the Pho house special. Having been to alot of Pho restaurants the most important thing for me to try is always their house special beef pho because if they can't make it proper then you must avoid the place... if they can't make this staple dish. Then don't waste your time... but this place has decent Pho. A little bit over salty but bearable. The meat portions are ok... the beef balls are a little bit smaller than most places. If you're not expecting too much this place is good to go to.

They do take debit and cash only so if you have credit you're out of luck."}
{"text":"As someone who loves pho, I am somewhat disappointed with this place. 

2.5* for the pho ($8.50 for large). I got the house special pho that has every topping. The beef contained some fat and didn't seem fresh. I felt disgusted so I removed half of my beef away. The broth was very bland. It tasted very flavourless and watered down... as if they didn't have enough soup and just put boiling water in it. On the bright side, they were pretty generous with the noodles and toppings. 

After I got home, I felt very thirsty. Seems like they put a lot of msg in it? Or maybe I'm just thirsty?

Service is the typical Asian service you would experience. Our waitress was just watching tv while wiping the bowls."}
{"text":"The flavour wasn't bad for the special pho & it was okay'ishly proportioned for the price.
The hue beef noodles was a big nono.  

Honestly, the place wasn't bad overall but the food wasn't appetizing.  
Won't be back. ]:"}
{"text":"ordered the grilled chicken, pork chop and fried eggs on rice.
definitely not up to standard in my opinion, the main sources of flavour were from the vinaigrette and some of the seasoning on the chicken. everything else was quite bland. then you remember this dish was $9.50 before taxes and you start to wonder how something so basic can be so pricey when other places charge less and taste so much better."}
{"text":"This is in a quiet plaza where there used to be a T&T, so I imagine this restaurant must have lost significant traffic when T&T closed down, which is too bad. It is a small family owned business with decent service and food. I actually only order one thing from here which I love, and that's the Crab Meat Vietnamese thick udon. I can't remember the exact name but it should be #34 on the menu. It has a thicker crab paste flavoured broth, with a thick transparent noodle that is homemade. It is extra chewy which I really like. There are a few slices of pork and fried fish cake, and 2 small crab claws. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Kim Bo restaurant just opened at the right next to T&T Middlefield replace Super 7 (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/super-7-restaurant-scarborough#query:7%20vietnamese).

The interior of the restaurant has been completely redecorated with new booths seats put in and the size of the main dinning room is only half the size from the old business.

House Noodle Large ($7.25) was a little small. I finished eating that and I was just half full... I can't imagine how small a small would be!! Taste wise I found the broth quite oily as there was this layer of oil floating on top. Taste wise was a little bland... 

The services here was so friendly and fast! When I asked for some chili pepper, the older waiter just ran into the back and got for me with a huge smile on his face..

I might give their Pho a try... and hopefully the experience would be better!"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner last night and I enjoyed the food here.  Their soup broth is pretty delicious and not too salty.  Also felt like my body was so clean from drinking it lol.

Their deep fried king oyster mushrooms are also a hit.  They are on the spicy side though.  I would come back here for sure."}
{"text":"Unbelievably salty 

Only had a small noodle soup - my tongue is literally still burning 2hrs later

Would only recommend this place to my worst enemies wow

Honestly, they would need to take their bowl of soup and add 50 cups of boiling water to bring in down to regular standards

I eat pho A LOT, trust me and skip this place......"}
