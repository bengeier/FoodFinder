{"text":"Besides Tao, this was another Venetian hotel restaurant that I did some research and looked forward to experiencing. Also; I think Mario Batali is one of the least obnoxious Chefs on the Food Network AND I LOVE, LOVE GOOD AUTHENTIC ITALIAN FOOD!! It also reminds me of past travels abroad.   Simulated outdoor dining ha! Your view is a pretty good replica of St. Mark's square in Venice, ahem... minus the Cathedral, sexy Italian guys, and pigeon poop LOL!   I like to eat earlier rather than later in the evening (better for your health) so I did not have to wait for a table at 5:30PM. Before I talk about what I ate I have to share that while waiting for my libation; I saw that there was a crowd gathering and I noticed that they were mesmerized by a damn Mime that was supposed to look like an ancient, white, venetian statue. The Venetian Hotel was playing along, with strategic lighting and a platform for her to stand on. Of course she only moved when a tourist gave her some money - and then they took pics standing next to the sham. I totally detest that kind of shiz but did not let it upset my appetite and just laughed at how funny people are *rolling eyes*   MMMMmmmmmmm okay here were go:   I actually chose starters again but all were so delicious and are ranked by delectability below:   Fried Risotto Balls = OMG! I forgot the actual menu name, but I think you get like 4 of them for $9. Imagine if you will; warm, cheesy risotto rolled into a ball and flash fried to a crunchy golden brown. Non greasy goodness and they were gone within a blink.   Prosciutto di Parma = Dry cured ham that melts in your mouth. This is not your down stream prosciutto but actually imported from a little but well know town of Parma. To learn more about why I had to try this specialty: http://www.italyinsf.com/2008/10/21/prosciutto-di-parma/   Roasted Beets with Saba = Even if you are not a beet fan, this is a pleasing, light and healthy balance to the fried risotto balls. I was happy to see their choice of yellow and orange beets instead of the same ol boring red. The roasted flavor is immediate and the Saba, which is a cooked grape juice really made it pop, another good choice.   I'm actually going back to the Venetian in a few days and will plan on trying their squash blossoms, grilled radicchio w/ smoked mozzarella and braised pork shoulder. Stay tuned!"}
{"text":"We stopped here almost at closing time for some light fair and a glass of wine. The wine list was very impressive and reasonable price. A 2006 Barolo for 13$ a glass. A delicious cheese platter and a dessert canolli rounded out our eats. Leo was our server. Very helpful with the wine and all I all very accommodating. I only wish I had come earlier for a full supper."}
{"text":"So delicious! The arancini and squash blossoms were so yummy. The pepperoni pizza was perfection and the featured pasta  was sooo good!"}
{"text":"Team Batali and Bastianich have done it again. We have eaten at both the New York location as well as the one in Las Vegas. The quality and consistently of food,service and atmosphere is remarkable. The pasta dishes are superb and very authentic.  My favorite pasta is the beef cheek ravioli. The vegetable dishes are imaginative and .unique. I tried the cauliflower with olives and orange zest,eggplant caponata,and peperonata.  The main courses are also terrific. We dined there on 12/24/11 and enjoyed the seafood fra diavolo. The seafood was cooked to perfection , and the sauce/seafood broth was outstanding. If you like desserts try the olive oil gelato, and or any of the other offerings.   Thanks Mario & Joe"}
{"text":"we shared their ragu with big round pasta for an early lunch.  one of my favorite pasta dishes ever.  beats my favorite bolognese from back home in sf.  service was efficient, if not particularly friendly.  but i'd choose efficient over friendly any day, so five stars it is."}
{"text":"I was excited to eat here. I made a point to have lunch here while visiting in Vegas. Overall I was disappointed with the food. The Pizzeria is in a perfect location. I had a pretty good app with parsnips and apple. For my entree I had the Pizza Margherita. This is where my major issue is. Now MY expectations were very high. The pizza just wasnt very good. The crust was thin and the cheese was good. BUT the sauce tasted very very cheap. I feel like this place is in a beautiful location and has a good name but overall is/ was disappointing."}
{"text":"Delizioso!  I had the best puttanesca ever!  I changed the pasta style to spaghettini and it was amazing.  The service was also excellent.  My husband had the spaghetti and meatballs.  He said that the meatballs were very good.  There was live entertainment in front of us, which added to the fun experience.  There's an Otto in New York.  I'll have to try that one, too.  Hopefully, the New York version makes awesome puttanesca.  Fingers crossed!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  The reason I say this is because we went in expecting the worst and left wowed.   Let me explain a little, my family and I had been walking around all over the strip since 10 am, tired, hungry and irritated, around 6pm we finally stopped and chose the first place we saw to eat. Im a big foodie and didn't even notice this was Iron Chef Mario Batali's Restaurant (yeah, I was THAT tired).   First thing I have to say is that the Olive Oil they bring out with the bread (ask for bread service, not only is it delicious, its free!) is amazing, easily the best and the most flavorful olive oil I have ever tasted. What I recommend is to order a few different dishes and share amongst your party, italian style after all! We ordered the Pancetta and Goat Cheese, I'm not a big pizza person but boy was this delicious I couldn't stop eating it (The pizza's here can easily be shared by 2 people) We also ordered the Penne alla Norma, very tasty! But the real winner of this meal was the Marinated Chicken Paillard!! I HIGHLY recommend ordering this when eating here, it cannot be missed! AMAZING is the only word I can use to describe this dish, I still crave it each and everyday and so does the rest of my family! I could not figure out why this meal was so great and flavorful, this meal had a special quality about it that I couldn't put my finger on, but then I turned around and I saw, very discretely, Mario Batali's name and I quickly understood why this was a high quality meal.   Thank you Chef Batali, I praise you for this glorious meal.   Everything about the meal was perfection (service was so-so though, that is until it was time to leave the tip! wink-wink) The atmosphere is also great, feels like your outside and they have some great entertainment. I will most defiantly be back on my next trip!"}
{"text":"I had a great experience with my family that has two young kids.  The service was fantastic from the server to the water guy, the plate guy ( I guess he was the bus boy.)  Food was very good and the server knew the menu well.  We've never had an experience better even at other fine dining places in Vegas.  It was a one time hit for us and hopefully the next time would be the same.  Our food choices: Octopus salad was great, a little spicy and not that chewy just like the server described.  The Pork shoulder was enjoyable. The fried mashed potato was amazing.  The potatoes were just slightly crushed so the center can get fried too.   The other stuff we had were as expected so I leave that out but nothing was disappointing."}
{"text":"A little disappointed, we ordered the calamari as appetizer and they were very stiff and tasting like the bottom of the ocean, the waitress gently took it back but went to see another waitress with my plate and gave me a funny look.. My main course was a goat cheese and pancetta pizza which was not bad, but the tomato sauce taste like Hunt's tomato paste straight from the can. My gf had a plate of linguini and mussel and saffron, she liked it ok. The busboy was really nice and friendly. Ambiance is good. The wine glass starts at 11 but raise quickly to 40$+, only 3 choices below 20$ a glass! Vegas I guess.."}
{"text":"Lunch here with my young children.  Great seating.   We could watch the show with the man on stilts and opera singers.  A long time before the waiter came to our table and I was ready to get up and leave.  The waiter came over, not apologetic, asking what we wanted to drink.  Me grumpy - replied that we were ready to order.  Waiter very calmly replied, yes, but what would you like to drink.  So then from that point, service was great.  Food came out quickly.   We ordered the margherita pizza with buffalo mozzarella - crust was perfect crispy but chewy too, sauce flavorful, mozzarella slightly smokey.   Also had caprese salad - expected balls of mozzarella and cut up tomatoes that you get at supermarket, but this was so good with soft mozz cheese, herbs, olive oil.  I've never raved about caprese salad before.  Now in retrospect, I liked the waiter - seem so European, no apologies, lunch should be enjoyed not rushed.  If I blurred my eyes, I was in Venice, St Marks square."}
{"text":"I have watched Mario on TV and have never been that impressed but my opinion just changed after a meal here. Located in the Venetian, open air next to the ongoings in the main \"square\" food was a great surprise. We ordered the ricotta and pancetta fritters, one was cheesy other was salty, mix those and it was delicious! Paired them with 2 glasses of Italian wines (recc by the staff) and the sausage-pepper pizza. Yum the crust was just right with burnt edges, fresh ingredients esp the meats, he has a rotating meat stand in the center of the restaurant. Loved it! Decor is lovely reminding one of a outdoor place in Italy. Definitely worth a stop here!"}
{"text":"I had two occassions to visit Otto recently. The first was a 5-star lunch that exceeded our expectations.  Two of us shared appetizer portions of brussel sprouts and gnocci fritters.  The sprouts were absolutely delicious, and were quickly consumed.  The gnocci fritters were frankly weird, and reminded us of ballpark fare.  After the appetizers, we had two salads.  My wife had a mixed green salad with balsamic vinegar and prosciotto.  I had the octopus salad with celery and potatoes.  Both were excellent.    On a later occassion, and needing a quick meal, we revisited Otto for lunch.  This time, it was only a 3.5 star experience.  Service was adequate, and the food was fine, but lacked flavor.  We each had a salad (good) and shared a clam pizza.  I am a fan of seafood pizzas because they provide so much flavor... not this one.  It was undercooked and bland, regrettably.  Overall, this is probably a 4-star restaurant.  I hope that your experience more resembles my first time rather than my second time."}
{"text":"I would give the place 4* but for the price. I don't mind paying more for food if it is warranted, but i felt a little robbed here. The service was very good. The pizzas are just ok for the price (I've had better at my friends' house where they had pizza caterers cook in their outdoor pizza oven). The wine was pretty good. The dessert was tdf. Mama Mia! Defo go here for the dessert called \"Dark Chocolate\". It has a gorgeous little rich chocolate lava type cake with dark choc gelato, salty caramel gelato, and a blow torched soft gooey meringue topping. Omg. I'm salivating just remembering the dessert! I will go back for this dessert. The price of this dessert and the wine (we only went for a cheaper 250ml portion of red to share...can't remember which one...for about $15) are reasonable, especially considering that we had an operatic floor show in fake St Mark's Square. I think next time we will have dinner elsewhere (Zefferino's around the corner has much better food for the price) and maybe just have dessert here."}
{"text":"We came with big expectations. We got gnocco fritto, ptosciutto di parma and a margherita pizza. Prosciutto was so salty! Gnocco fritto was nothing like authentic gnocco fritto and it was covered with an un-identified grated cheese. Pizza was ok: tomato and mozzarella were good, but the dough was nothing special. Pricey for what you get."}
{"text":"Stay for the Amari.  Pizza - good.  Charcuterie - good.  Cold starters - okay.  But, the amari!  Interesting, delicious and fun - and quite a bargain to boot!"}
{"text":"The menu should point out the origin of the pizza because pizza is different in each region. My favorite is Napolitana. Mario serves a very crispy thin crust, like a cracker, that I dislike. I think it's Romana style but not sure. The crust and sauce lacked salt, very bland & $18!  I should have asked but his pizza at Eataly is Napolitana, so I assumed. Mistake. He charges $18 in Las Vegas & $14 in Manhattan.  I won't go back to Otto."}
{"text":"The tuna & white bean salad is delicious as was the cauliflower.  Pizza was okay.  May have been our choice -- pancetta, carmelized onion and goat cheese.  Pancetta undercooked and the goat cheese was in blobs that just overwhelmed.  Crust fantastic and service was excellent."}
{"text":"Been here a couple times. Food on dinner menu tasted so good back in the beginning in 11' , but it just got worse in Aug 11'  FIve stars for:  * \" BRAISED PORK SHOULDER\" is just so tender, juicy and flavorful inside out * SHRIMP PIZZA W/ PESTO - thin slices of pizza with shrimp, ricotta, pesto and olive          oil toppings. Slightly oily though. * \" DARK CHOCOLATE \" - served in a martini glass. Beautiful warm chocolate cake,           vanilla meringue, dark chocolate gelato... love it! * \" TIRAMISU\" - not an ordinary kind. Served in a martini glass w/ espresso gelato,          lady fingers,...  love it!   MINUS 2 stars for: - Spaghetti & Meatballs - MEH! - SHRIMP PIZZA W/ PESTO , MEH for the 2nd and 3rd time! - Very careless servers who mixed up the checks, rude and inattentive !!   Might go back for dessert and oh...let me see who's serving today...!"}
{"text":"Ok, where to start.  Figured I wanted casual italian from a celebrity chef, and made the family walk from the Cosmopolitan to the Venetian for what I heard would be a better meal then Scott Conant's  DOCG Enoteca (especially any fish based on what two 'foodies' had told me).  All I can say is big mistake, BIG MISTAKE!  The atmosphere at the Venetian - well designed and entertaining (despite being older then some of the newbies) - was worth the walk but the food was ok, sub-par if you consider that the menu and items were done in conjunction with a  celebrity chef (Mario Batali).  There was not one item ordered (except the Penne alla Norma) that was up and beyond what I get locally in a Detroit suburb's italian restaurant.  We started with 3 Verdure dishes (olives, beets in saba, and farro verde) - the farro was good, but the other two tasted grocery store bought level at most (lacked depth and uniqueness) never again. Next I ordered another item recommended by the server - Insalte la supurba (I think), marinated tuna and white anchovy salad - what a disaster, not only did the tuna lack any kind of oomph or upgrade from Starkist albacore white, the anchovy (white, house cured) lacked character and carried an unusual stench rendering it inedible for me.  The salad was returned only after one bite and I genuinely feared furthering my culinary adventures here.  Thank god my wife had ordered a spring pasta(the only pasta made in-house) with english peas and vegetables, that was acceptable - otherwise I would have rated the place as a solid one star eatery.  Not all is bad here, the location (in the middle of the 'Piazza de Marco' (of the Venetian Hotel)) is outstanding all it needed was a few pigeons to complete the experience - but in retrospect, we should have ventured to Wolfgang Puck's place just a few steps away then waste a Franklin on something not worth the mile walk on the Vegas strip."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this place; made reservations and everything.  The ambiance is perfect. The menu is short and sweet which makes it easy to make up your mind.  To drink, I opted for the house made Italian Lime Mint soda ... DELICIOUS!   For dinner I had the Margherita Pizza which looked beautiful; but that is where my love affair with this restaurant ended.  The pizza was overly salty. I love salt, but not to the point where I can't taste anything else.   The staff was friendly and courteous.    Sadly, I left feeling underwhelmed."}
{"text":"Context: This  was the last thing we did on our way out of town after a chaotic weekend visiting family in from the east coast. I don't gamble and I am not a fan of Vegas culture, but I had hoped this meal would be a deperature from the slick and tacky and over the top.  I was looking forward to an authentic, quiet meal in a kitchy, yet relaxing (by vegas standards) environment.   First Ominous Impressions:  The whole meal started off badly. We waited nearly twenty minutes for our order to be taken, even though the restaurant was half empty.  The music was grating and loud (this, coming from someone whose boyfriend has a gold album from his punk band) and it clashed horribly with the music coming from Saint Mark's square. When I come to an Italian place, I really do want Italian music, either Italian classical or opera or Italian modern or vinatge pop, or hell, Sinatra in a pinch, but not whatever that awful American meathead stuff was that was blaring from the speakers.  The Meal, the goodish bits:     Once we were seated, the staff were kind and attentive, and my Venetian Spritzer was refreshing and balanced. The fried squash blossom was pretty good, and reminded me of the ones my great grandmother used to make, but the rice flour batter got too chewy very quickly and the frying oil tasted old.   The Meal, the horror show:   The vegetable plates came out discolored and overcooked and yet, ice cold (should have been room temp) and soggy with oil. My boyfriend nearly broke a tooth on a stone in the farro (but refused to complain, because he is exceedingly polite). But the worst were the pastas! They were so salty that it was actually painful to eat them. Even my boyfriend agreed to tell the truth when the server came by to ask about our meals.  We were told our pasta was salty because the pasta water is salted. Um...I salt my pasta water at home, with a generous handful of salt, and I love salt so very much, but this tasted like a full tablespoon in the finish of a single, small (23 dollar) portion. Even after we got our pastas back, they were still like a salt lick. I'm not entirely convinced they did anything different at all, and with a fairly spendy price tag, I'd hoped for something actually edible.  Overall Experience:   This meal was a disgrace, made even more crushing because I adore Mario Batali's show and personality (and, swoon, that red beard!). I had such high hopes, but my dear Italian grandmothers are spitting in their graves.   Mario, do you read these reviews? Do you understand that this experience was supposed to be a high note for us? A redemption? The sole tasteful experience of a weekend in hell, I mean, Las Vegas? Meals create memories...and this memory is  tarnished."}
{"text":"the pork belly rigatoni was amazing. i couldn't get enough of it. our service was really good. with a large, not so sober group, that's hard to come by. i also loved the anchovy pizza and cheese selections (although i wish they had bread for the cheese. the foccacia they service is great, just not for pairing with cheese)."}
{"text":"Met a friend here who was at a conference in the Palazzo. Lovely seating... feels like you are in a cafe is a square in Europe, especially when the lights went low and a great place to talk. We started out with an appetizer of french bread spread with goat cheese and topped with roasted beets and herbs and was really, really tasty. Wine choices by glass were a bit on the expensive side... but they did give you a small carafe.   Had the grilled chicken topped with eggplant parm, sun-dried tomato and buffalo mozzarella, which was good, We split an order of gelati and biscotti, which were both ok... definitely had better. I thought the consistency was off, and when you are paying top dollar for the ambiance and Chef Mario Batali's name, I expected a full above average experience and the food just did not have the pop it should have had."}
{"text":"I have eaten there 3 times. Two of the times the service was great, friendly, attentive.  One time not so much but still OK  The food is fresh and tasty.  Overpriced like everything in the big hotels but not too outrageous. Most of the seating is out on the patio but there is a cozy, quiet seating area inside if that is what you want.  My wife makes the best pesto I have ever had but this was pretty damn good."}
{"text":"I dined at Otto Pizzeria this past weekend and my friends and I had a wonderful experience.  I had called about a month in advance to make a reservation for 12 ladies for our friend's bachelorette.  The woman with whom I spoke was extremely friendly and accommodated our request for sitting outside.    The ambience is lovely - we felt like we were sitting outside in the middle of a piazza in Venice.  The sommelier was extremely helpful and recommended two lovely bottles of wine well within our price range.  The service was impeccable - the bachelorette was surprised with a dessert at the end of the meal.  The food was excellent - the standouts were the fried mozzarella discs and the mint pasta.  Prices are reasonable especially considering that this is a Batali restaurant in a popular Vegas hotel.  I would absolutely return the next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"Service was great.  Brussels Sprouts pizza was amazing.  Finished with the olive oil gelato.  Overall a wonderful time!"}
{"text":"great food, spectacular viwe of the san marcos square ( Las Vegas style) great wine selection. everytime we came to Vegas we always stop here and never once we were disappointed. keep up the good work"}
{"text":"Otto's is nicely located inside the Venetian, great decor and when the band is playing in the square, it's almost like you're in Italy. The cheese was excellent: The Parmesan and Pecorino were standouts. Yet as well as the night began, the dinner fell short. The gnocchi and the ravioli both were cooked well enough though the sauce tasted like Chef Boyardee and for the price and small portion it didn't make us want to come back."}
{"text":"I had the sausage and peppers pizza and my mother had the margherita pizza. We both LOVED our food!  I love pizza and this was some of the best pizza I've ever had. Definitely would return."}
{"text":"Poor service. Food is one of the worst Italian I've ever had.  Bread was cold. Pasta assumed to be with pork and veal is full of the bacon fat and when I asked where the veal is I was told it's in the sauce but the sauce is nothing but tomato.. through the whole meal no one asked me whether I was doing okay.."}
{"text":"Expected high price casino restaurant with more focus on presentation and fancy names for otherwise everyday fare. We had a pleasant surprise with our wild mushroom bruschetta. Very yummy! Our appetizer was one upped by our entrees. My wife wouldn't share her linguini with mussels and saying mmmmm between bites. My black spaghettini with calamari was in a tomato based sauce that had just the right amount of zip. The staff was attentive but not stuffy or over bearing. Our expectations were exceeded and we are back tonight for seconds."}
{"text":"Holy goodness Batman! This place was pretty amazing. The service was spot-on and the food was awesome.... so much so that I ate there twice during my week long stay. Have some cheese - I highly recommend the taleggio. It is fantastic by itself and even better with the honey, cherry, or apricot they bring out with the cheese. I got the cheese both times it was just so good. The fried cauliflower was hands down the best fried cauliflower I've ever eaten.  It didn't need any dipping sauce, just a little lemon juice that's it. They make their own ricotta in house and you can tell.  We got great wine recommendations from our waiter.  Of the 4 main courses I've seen/eaten not one was disappointing. The spaghetti and meatballs was simple and tasty. The veal meatballs on polenta I will definitely have to have next time I go."}
{"text":"Snore....  Out-of-towners who have never eaten at a Batali joint will go \"ooh\" and \"aah.\"  For the rest of us, this place can be skipped.  Go to Il Mulino instead.  The lunch crowd at I Mulino (at Caesar's Forum Shops) is non-existent, so it's easy to get a table and experience some really good Italian food.  This place was seriously crowded on a Sunday night in the off season.  So we knew that it was either (1) really good or (2) a sucker for tourists from the Midwest.  Sadly, we found out it was the latter.  The olives were great, and the wine selection was super.  The salumi platter offers a nice choice except . . . when you order \"all five of the salumi\" you get two versions of head cheese.  Now we are not sqeamish but we had no idea that two of the five would be head cheese and frankly . . . head cheese tastes like DOG CRAP.  (No, we've not tasted dog crap, but we have a pretty good idea of what it must taste like.)  We gobbled up the other three and nudged the waiter a bit \"Hey, what the heck was that stuff?  Was that head cheese?\"  He says, \"Yep.\"  We said, \"We're not fans of head cheese.  We sure wish you would have told us it was on the platter.\"  He giggles and says, \"Huh, Huh, yeah, not many people like that stuff after they order it.  Huh, huh, huh.\"  (Note to self - kick waiter next time he chuckles at you and doesn't bother to offer a credit.)  The pasta dishes were ho hum.  Again, if you want really good sauces, go to Il Mulino.  And Rao's is great too, if you can get in (also at Caesar's, but in the main section.)  We skipped the rest of the meal and instead grabbed some gelato at the little kiosk just outside of the restaurant.  Sorry, Mario - we will NOT be back.  Too many other great choices in Vegas."}
{"text":"MY FAVORITE dining at the Venetian!!!  If you enjoy great wine and cheese pairings, you'll ADORE Otto!  My husband and I enjoy delighting in a bottle of wine along with a great cheese plate. We weren't familiar with Otto so we asked our server a bunch of questions. He was EXTREMELY knowledgeable and once we picked a bottle of wine he helped pair up some cheeses. It was an amazing experience!  The wine and cheeses were top notch. The ambiance was fantastic. The staff friendly and knowledgeable.   We stayed for a few hours to enjoy and then ended up ordering more. Unfortunately we didn't try this place soon enough in our week stay. But we'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"This was my favorite dining experience during my vacation last week.   Food: Our starter was a three cheese plate with Gorgonzola Dolce, Pantaleo, and Robbiola Bosina. The fruit paring it came with was amazing.  Our salad was a beautiful greens salad topped with Pecorino and more importantly a fantastic piece of Prosciutto.  We had to ask for olive oil and bread separately, as some people have complained. Personally, I don't see the problem. It was high-end olive oil and I can understand them being a bit conservative.  My dinner plate was the real reason I went there though. I wanted scratch made pasta and the server informed me that only a few dishes that had that. Consequently, I ordered the Maccherona and it was perfect. Once you've had fresh made pasta, everything else pales in comparison. Kudos to the chef.  For dessert we split a gelato trio that punctuated a great dinner.  Service: Excellent. Surprisingly, we were able to walk up without reservations at 7pm and were still able to get a seat in under 10 minutes. Our server was very attentive and was very knowledgeable about wine.  Ambiance: I will admit it's very European in the close proximity of the tables, but this is the Venetian so I'll chalk it up to \"authenticity.\" We were seated outside and although a but busy, was nice because of the live performers across the way."}
{"text":"I felt that this restaurant takes short cuts and the food is not up to the standards I had expected from Mario Batali   I suppose this is typical Las Vegas.  I think the pizza was a frozen crust."}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I'm Italian so when I go to an Italian restaurant I expect what I was used to eat when I was back home. Particularly when you go to a place with popular chef ...  So here are the things that I did not like in Mario Batali's restaurant 1) Gnocco fritto is supposed to be served with meats and cheeses not alone! If you don't believe me check out  Wikipedia http://it.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnocco_fritto#section_1  ... I know you can't read Italian but just look at the picture! There is salami next to it!... You could get it right if you order Gnocco fritto for 9 $ then a couple of cured meats for 20$ and one cheese for 5$ but it gets pretty expensive for an appetizer! 2) mozzarella di bufala was subpar at best. I'm actually fairly sure it was just plain mozzarella, not bufala ! 3)the pizza had a gallon of oil on top. Seriously it was was  dipping! I've had better pizzas (even in the states!) 4) my husband got spritz and was perplexed... He thought the mix of wine/aperol was Not right (and usually there is not olive in it even thou i googled it and found out that one version of spritz has olive in it so maybe this is what they were going for.)  Here is what I liked: 1) prosciutto di Parma and bresaola were good 2) my husband seemed pleased by his pasta with clams even If it was quite spicy 3) the honey served with the mozzarella was good  So, overall...food was ok but since it's a famous chef and all I expected more... Maybe Mario batali could take another trip to Italy? And pick up better titles for his books (Molto gusto sounds pretty weird!)"}
{"text":"We were sat promptly and the service was excellent. We had the margherita pizza and the prosciutto de Parma which we added to the top of the pizza. Both were phenomenal (!!) despite being such simple items. I would highly recommend this restaurant and we will be returning when we are in town!"}
{"text":"I wish I could rate the food, but we didn't even get a chance to try so full disclosure only rating the service. We made a reservation a day before, get to the restaurant and it was clear by the hostess' reaction they weren't expecting us. It was clear they made a makeshift table for our party...in the hallway.   There were people coming and going and it felt we were in their way. My dad had politely requested a clearly open table, and was told it had already been reserved for a larger table. The table stayed open for a while, only to be filled by a party our exact same size.   After seeing this my dad again, politely, requested a table that wasn't in the middle of the hallway. We were eventually told they could accommodate us, then we waited. And waited and waited some more. We ended up waiting an hour and sipped on cheap yet overpriced wine. We finally had enough and then packed our things and left when we realized not only would we not be moved to another table we were purposely not going to be served because of our table request.   We left an hour after we were \"seated\" in the hallway. When we let the manager and hostess know we were leaving, without making any sort of scene, they threw their hands up in the air emphatically as if to insinuate our leaving was our own problem.   We left, went to I heart burgers instead and had a fabulous, low key night with delightful food and wonderful service. And most importantly we actually were seated and treated like human beings. Moral of the story: overpriced food and horrible service, GO SOMEWHERE ELSE"}
{"text":"OH MY GOODNESS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You have not lived until you have tried the \"Fritti\" Fried cauliflower!  I am from the south and I can tell you this is the best breading!  Lasagna is outstanding and the meat and cheeses were fabulous!"}
{"text":"Mediocre food at inflated prices. I have had much better italian food for much less. In fact I make better Italian dishes and I am a lousy cook and not even Italian! The only thing redeeming about this place was the wine and a great waitstaff."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a nice lunch at Otto during our stay in Vegas. Bread: you have to ask for the olive oil and vinegar: they don't just bring it to you.  Starters: calzone and fried bread things (I forgot what they called them).  $2 extra for marinara sauce Salad: pesto caprese salad - the fresh mozerella was REALLY good 2 pizzas: margherite and sausage/peppers - this is thin crust pizza. Don't expect chicago deep dish. I thought it was pretty good: but not as good as the stuff you get in the real Venice!! :) Great location! You really feel like you are outdoors enjoying a meal in \"St. Marks Square\" under the blue sky! Definitely recommended if you want a bite to eat in Venetian/Palozzo."}
{"text":"Went here on a Saturday night with reservations and had no problem! The pizza was amazing and the gelato was great too!"}
{"text":"Steak Tagliata, Veal & Ricotta Meatballs, Lasagna Veal Bolognese and Spaghetti & Meatballs were excellent. We paired the dishes with Dolcetto d'Alba, perfection. Service was wonderful. Experience delightful :)"}
{"text":"Ate a late lunch here. Husband had spaghetti with meatballs which he enjoyed and finished. I had the choose three cheese board with the cheese condiments. So good! We shared dark chocolate, espresso, graham gelato for dessert and it was the best gelato we've ever had. Marissa was our server and she's the nicest server we've had in Vegas. Very knowledgeable about the menu and very kind and helpful. Will probably eat here again before we head home!"}
{"text":"Our favorite place we had on our trip to Vegas! We came here on a Sunday night and it was pretty filled up. It had great ambiance and we were sitting \"outside\" on their patio. The service was quick, efficient, and informative and our bus boy was actually AMAZING. My boyfriend, who is a heavy water drinker, never had his glass go half empty.   We ordered the veal ragu, seafood linguine, lasagna (special), shortrib ravioli (special), and a sausage and pepper pizza to share. The pizza was SO GOOD. The crust was really crisp and thin just the way I liked it and the ingredients were all really top quality. Our favorite dish was surprisingly the seafood linguine which had really awesome flavor that was unexpected. All our other dishes were really good and both specials really delivered on flavor.  A little pricey, but that's Vegas for you and definitely a place I would recommend to go if you are staying at the Venetian or Palazzo!"}
{"text":"I was craving Italian food for our last meal while on a girls getaway trip to Vegas so we decided to stop here for lunch while strolling through the Venetian.  Ingredients are fresh, food is tasty, and the service was fantastic.  We started with a Caprese salad (can't go wrong with that), 3 different types of cheeses, and 2 meats (prosciutto and salami), a margarita pizza, wine, and pear sorbet to finish off the meal.  Delicious!"}
{"text":"Other Yelpers sum it up pretty accurately: overpriced and disappointing.  We were seated on the patio, so the ambiance was nice, but the food was quite lackluster.  Ordered the prosciutto arugula pizza, braised pork shoulder, gelati& sorbetti for dessert, wine,and a cappuccino.  I love prosciutto, but the pizza crust wasn't good, in addition to being overcooked.  Although the pork shoulder was moist, it did not have much flavor.  The highlight of the meal was probably the dessert and cappuccino. The cappuccino was good, strong enough, but not bitter."}
{"text":"What do you expect from a restaurant catering to tourists who're anxious to get back to the slot machines, with \"outside\" seating near a simulated canal, under a high ceiling painted sky blue with clouds?  We had a wonderful meal, although electing to eat \"inside\".  The server was friendly and attentive, and each of our pastas were delicately flavored.  The wines were accurately described and generously poured.  We'd eat there again"}
{"text":"One of the best lunches we had in Vegas. Go Batali! We shared a Sausage and pepper pizza which was very delicious. But my favorite was his Capress salad! It was so addicting I kept thinking about it! The mix of pine nuts with the fresh juicy cherry tomatoes and pesto sauce blended with cheese (not mozzarella sorry forget what he used) was out of this world refreshing especially in Hot Hot Vegas! The we had a blend of Olive oil, almond milk, vanilla bean gelato. Can we say YUMMY, and yes maybe the Olive oil kind of sound weird but it was a light salty flavor which only just enhanced the other 2 flavors we selected. The servers were attentive, it seemed like we had two with a main one, but not overly friendly. Service was good until we got to dessert because I think the girl forgot to put our order in (oops). But nothing could deter our experience because the food was just that superb!"}
{"text":"My husband and I were here for an anniversary. Love Mario's other restaurants but the ball is dropped here!  Pizza ovens were not working, ordered a pasta and a side dish of saluted broccoli rabe with olive oil and garlic.  Pasta was cold and rabe was steamed with a drizzle of oil and raw garlic..awful.  And worse yet was our waiter, rude rude when we wanted it taken off the bill.  Manager not much better, should have comped the whole meal with our total disappointment of the evening...but he did not!  The only shining star was Erika at the bar. Mario..what's up, you need to pay more attention to wait staff and customer service.  This was a BAD Italian experience. I'm all Italian, this was bad!"}
{"text":"On my most recent trip to Vegas, my girlfriend and I decided to try out Otto.  My girlfriend is a vegan and I am a vegetarian.  The kitchen refused to make any of their pizzas without cheese and the serving of pasta I got for $20 was smaller than a pool ball. Needless to say, I was pretty disappointed and I will not be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING! Their pork shoulder might just be the best thing I've ever eaten! When I first took a bite, I thought I had died and gone to heaven it was so good! First of all, the sauce complimented the pork really well. It was a great balance of sweet and salty with a little bit of tangy-ness. Second of all, the pork itself. There aren't words to describe it. It was juicy, flavorful, and tender. I've had a lot of pork that was dry and overcooked, but this one was complete perfection! Sure, the service was a little slow, but it was very crowded, and once I had a bite of that pork shoulder, all my annoyance at the wait vanished! This one dish almost made me wish I lived in Las Vegas so I could have it more often!"}
{"text":"This place has the worst management and rude front end welcome staff.  After waiting for 20 min, the so called manager told my wife that \"are you still interested\", we said yes. We continued to wait on this not so busy Christmas Eve night. The front bar area was busy but the core restaurant inside was completely empty with only one couple.    Places like this give good service and great restaurants in Vegas a bad name.  My son was hungry and I sat him twice, the rudeness continued with asking him to get up as those seats where reserved, for whom, a ghost that never came.  After I told her your entire restaurant is empty inside, I turned around and went right across 10 feet with my kids and family to Mercato Della Peshheria. Fantastic service, incredible fresh made pasta and wonderful family friendly authentic Italian food.  Otto, it was a disgrace and horrible experience to say the least. Thank you Mercato Della Pescheria, thank you for treating my family with respect and making great food.  I would give Otto a zero if I could. Replace your rude so called wait staff and manager. If you look below, another customer had a similar experience with the amateur wait staff."}
{"text":"Service was impeccable! Soda refills were prompt every time, which was about 8 times. Pizza was fine, but not the best I've had, and a mess to eat. Cheese kept sliding off. More cheese would have been a good thing too."}
{"text":"OOOH MY! this restaurant is amazing! We actually visited it twice while in Vegas for a week! From the food, to the staff, to the serene ambiance of the courtyard type setting and often live entertainment not too far away...one could truly sit back relax and just take it all in after a day of walking and shopping through the Grand Canal Shops or have some dessert and drinks after a ride in the gondola.  It is definitely a must experience type of restaurant.   The staff are SO knowledgeable and will offer informed suggestions if you are deciding between items on the menu. All of the staff are simply amazing...from bussing, to wait staff, to hostess,  to management...they are all great.  Be sure to save room to have dessert...the Lemon Meringue Pie is SOOO good...it is a deconstructed version of the pie with a twist.  SOOO SOOOO GOOD! I kind of want one right now!  Thanks for an incredible experience. - Kerri -"}
{"text":"Had lunch here while in Vegas. Food was awesome, waitstaff was very friendly/efficient, desert was seriously yummy. Would eat here again in a second."}
{"text":"I gave a star for the Bruschetta it was good and salad was good. I give minus 5 stars for the Spaghetti and meatballs. The pasta was hard, we sent it back and the waiter said we just cook it longer and won't give a new fresh pasta. We said fine. It was still king of hard but we were hungry and just ate it. The meatballs were super dry. Like they were frozen for a long time. The portion was for a kids meal. A joke. I was so sad. Expecting fresh yummy Italian food since this was Mario Batali's joint. I thought they would make fresh pasta! It wasn't that cheap for boxed pasta. The pizza was okay. It needed more sauce. Now the service was terriable. The waiter never came by to ask how things were so we had to flag him down to let him know the pasta was not cooked. They never re-filled our water. I had to flag the bus boy down for water. He spilled water down my leg and food and didn't even say sorry. This place blows. I was disappointed since I really wanted to try Mario's food. Don't eat here. Vegas offers a ton of better places. Bobby Flay's Mesa Grill was way better and the service was a 10. Spot on."}
{"text":"We are experienced New Yorkers and had some wonderful meals in Vegas.  This ranks as one of the poorest for both food and ambience.  And, even though the signage clearly stated beer on draft, once we were seated we're told only the 12 dollar bottles were available.  The pizza was awful and extremely salty.  The pasta special portions were enough barely enough for an appetizer.  The bread was literally thrown onto the table.  The dessert was the waiter telling us he agreed with our commentary.  He was from New Jersey!"}
{"text":"I met up here with a group of 8 for dinner here on a weeknight, and I can't say I was happy with this place almost from the get go.  I should preface this by saying that I've been to other Mario Batali restaurants, specifically Carnevino and Mozza, so I had hope that this one could live up to the other two.  I was sadly mistaken.  The service was spotty and for the most part rather bad, the busser or server assistant didn't even know what types of hot tea they had, and also didn't think they had honey for it either.  It also took half an hour for the server to make his way over to our table even though he only had the 4 tables in the backroom we were in.  The food also didn't make it's way out in a timely manner either, but I don't know if this was the kitchen's fault or the server was just slow at putting the food order in, but the table next to us, who sat down 20 minutes after us, go their food first, very disappointing.  Now for the food.  I had their version of cioppino, and was not pleased with the quantity/quality for the price.  I'm not saying I didn't finish it, but I was starving at that point.  I was happy to have some of the pizza the table ordered and also had a few bites of the pasta norma, which was quite tasty.  The cold salads that they offer at the top of the menu were quite good, and I thought were honestly the best part of the meal.  The lentils were dressed nicely and cooked just right, they were al dente so held up well.  Their eggplant caponata was also quite tasty, although it had more peppers in it then I'm used to, but still tasty.  Overall, I am not planning on coming back here ever again, there's way better Italian here in Las Vegas for the price."}
{"text":"I am vegan.  I was going out on a business dinner with 3 others who chose the place.  I try so hard not to be a pain, not to draw special attention to myself and just order a salad.  Not one salad was vegan.  It was a big production to get them to make one.  The waiter was not sure that the kitchen could make me a vegan salad!!!!  the manager came over and suggested a fix, then the waiter came back to talk about it - AGH!  I didn't need this to be the center of attention.  Finally what came was NOT what they described to me - I just ate it -  they failed to bring any letttuce or greens of any sort... BUT I WAS JUST EAGER TO GET OUT OF THERE, it was so uncomfortable......"}
{"text":"Food was awful, I ordered the Margarita Pizza, and let's just say Pizza Hut does a better job.  The dough seemed pre made  and it was smothered in what tasted to me like canned tomato paste not your traditional home made sauce.    The Calzone appetizer looked more like an empanada and the Ravoli stuffed with Braised Short Rib in tomato sauce was cold with hardly any filling. In addition, the dipping olive oil was bitter to the taste. Thank god the crusty bread masked up the rancid flavor, gross.  What a waste of my hard earned money.  Dear Joe and Mario, I expected more from a restaurant backed by the both of you. The only reason I gave it a \"One Star\" was because of your friendly staff."}
{"text":"Every time I visit Las Vegas, I make it a point to stop and enjoy my favorite food from here.   It is  located in the food court of the Venezia Casino, overlooking the plaza.   The service is ok, but the food is spectacular. We always get the  Pancetta and Goat Cheese pizza with caramelized onions, scallions and Cypress Grove goat cheese.. YUMMMY!!!  It's a large pizza so two people can share it."}
{"text":"We were seated in a good table in the patio.  Nice greeting and everything goes downhill then.  DO NOT come to this restaurant if you have a chance to read my review.  Both service and quality shocked me.  How could restaurant of this level survive in the competitive Vegas strip.    My gf and I ordered a glasses of champaign that was served in a wine glass.  The bubble evaporated way before she could finished the glass.  So unprofessional!  As for the food, we ordered the Octopus Salad, Vongole Pizza and Pork Shoulder.  The salad came first and within seconds everything else came.  We were shocked.  The table was small and the waiter just dropped everything on it and left.  We had to put everything plate in order ourselves.  This is terrible service!  Food sucks too, the salad was not very impressive.  The pizza was baked hours ago and served dead cold.  The pork shoulder was the only dish that i would recommend for the night.    Another interesting point to note was the waiter came over asked \"how's everything?\".  He literally was gone before he finished asking.    It was my first diner for this Vegas trip.  I know everything is going uphill only."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza and merlot.  Went here a few years ago and it's one of the reasons I would go back to Vegas.  This and Firefly's tapas.  Yum!"}
{"text":"Very mediocre and just cashing in on Mario's name.  The pasta with mussels dish (which the moron server called clams) had mussels that never should have been served to anybody.  The \"served\" a couple slices of bread with no butter or olive oil and were indifferent to any requests.  Nice location, but that's about all."}
{"text":"First of all, I love the fact that this restaurant  is located in the midst of the fabricated Piazza San Marco. I was in Venice last month, and it is a very modern smaller version of San Marco Square, non-the-less it was a perfect spot for the restaurant of the infamous Mario Batali.  This will always be memorable, because my parents are locals of Vegas, so they were meeting us here for lunch.  Meeting my BF for the very first time, so yes I was nervous. So he ordered a bottle of red wine knowing that a glass would help me.  I have to say, that I was never a big fan of Italian food and perhaps I take that after my father.  So I was a little apprehensive that my dad would not enjoy his lunch with us. Fortunately everything we ordered was a hit.  We started w/ arugula salad... my favorite. But you can't go wrong with that, it's pretty simple. We also shared  a margharita pizza as an appetizer.  I love that it's thin crust. It was delicious. Both my dad and BF ordered the steak. My mother had the lasagne, and I ordered the grilled succulent pork chop.  We all shared a bite of everyone's main entree, and they were all incredibly yummy!  Our desert was sundae of 4 different gelati. coffee, pistachio, caramel, and chocolate.  Sinfully good! Our friendly waiter was very patient and attentive.  And best part was my parents enjoyed their lunch and getting to know my bf. It was sort of preliminary rendevous to get a taste of where my parents were off to... they were getting ready to leave for Europe... They are about to spend the entire summer in Italy... primarily Venice. So how cool was that?"}
{"text":"I am giving 2 stars only because the service was excellent.  Reagan was very helpful and Robert out waiter dos a fine job with his service and really knew his stuff when explaining the dishes and \"selling\" us the food.  His descriptions were mouthwatering,  but unfortunately the kitchen didn't deliver.  We ordered 5 dishes and shared family style.    Braised pork shoulder - the The first one we received was fatty and overcooked.  We ended up sending it back to the kitchen. The second time they served it to us was definitely a better cut of meat was a proper temperature, but really lacked overall taste.  Carbonara Pizza - this was simply OK. Didn't wow us and really wasn't that hot. I have had much better pizzas even at California pizza kitchen.  Black Ink Pasta - temperature was good on this one it tasted OK. It really lacked flavor.  Veal Meatballs on Palenta - this was a good helping size. The temperature was very good on these. But again lacked overall taste. I wasn't impressed.  Carrot Side Dish - oddly enough, this was my most favorite part of the entire meal and it's a side dish!. They were perfectly cooked tasted absolutely fantastic and I could've made a meal of them all alone by themselves.  To wrap it up, the service was excellent but the kitchen just didn't deliver the food. I've had way better meals for $120 tab than I had last night. It was just OK.   Put this place last on your list. Of all the fine dining locations In Las Vegas don't make this one of them."}
{"text":"I had the caprese salad.   It was very good.  I loved the way they do the tomatoes. I can't even describe it.  But it's like a cross between a stewed tomato and a sun-dried tomato.   This place is overpriced simply because Vegas loves to slap on a celebrity chef's name to a place and charge 40% more than what one would normally charge.   The service was good, the quality was good, and the presentation was very good.  I'd go back if there weren't a million other restaurants in Vegas to try."}
{"text":"Thankfully, after leaving Lagasse's Stadium, we gave Otto a chance.  We were greeted by a friendly host and quickly sat at a table waited on by Chad.  Chad was not only a great server, he guided our food orders as to not order astray.  We started with Mozzarella and Anchovy in Carrozza (a fried anchovy and mozzarella sandwich served with a fennel salad), 3 cheese plate consisting of burrata, buffalo mozzarella and goat cheese.  The cheeses were served with black truffle honey, macerated apricots and cherries.  Wow!  The cheeses and accompaniments were amazing.  The sandwich was good and quite rich.  We decided to go with pizza as our main course.  I chose pacetta and goat cheese and my wife ordered the pepperoni.  The pizzas were good.  Mine was on the salty side and mellowed out by the slightly sweet sauce and the richness of the goat cheese.  My wife's was basically an upscale pepperoni pizza.  We opted to pass on dessert.  So how does this deserve 4 stars?  It was upon our return the next evening.  We asked to be seated with Chad and he delivered once again.  We started out with the same cheese plate as before.  Equally delicious.  I opted to go for the Vongole pizza (olive oil sauce, mozzarella, clams and chili).  The pizza came to the table with the clams still in the shells.  The pizza was rich and creamy without being overload.  My wife ordered the Gemelli pasta (house sausage and broccoli rabe).  The pasta had a nice bite from the rabe.  We passed on dessert this evening as well.  Otto had consistent solid food with great service.  I will be back on my next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Service was great. We had arugula salad and cheese/ salami plates for aperitifs. Then sausage pizza. Nice crust, crispy and delicate. Cheese and peppers finished it off. Atmosphere is amazing see photos."}
{"text":"I can't believe the other reviewers were eating at the same place. We paid through the nose for small portions of tasteless food and even worse service.  I appreciate good food, but our party of three agreed after we left that we would have gotten *much* better fare even at a local 'Olive Garden' for about 1/3 of the $150 that this meal cost. The waiter was unhelpful, never came back when we asked for some extras like grated cheese or another drink, and generally ignored us. The beer menu was TWO beers, one bottled and one on tap. Both boring. I can go on and on about just how un-enjoyable this place was, but I've already wasted more time on it than it deserves.  This establishment proves what we should have known from the start... it is nearly impossibe to get GOOD food so close to tourist attractions. They don't care about or need repeat business since they get an entirely new crowd of gullible tourists every night looking for an experience.  Well, my advice is skip THIS one."}
{"text":"Otto Enoteca Pizzeria is one of my husband and my favorite restaurants when visiting las Vegas.  I read some of the reviews commenting on the pizza not being good and I completely disagree. I was in Italy last summer for three weeks and the food at Otto's is as close to true authentic Italian cuisine as I have found in the U.S.A. The problem is that most Americans eat Americanized Italian food not true Italian food.  In italy chicken comes on the side and never smothered in cheese or sauce. I love the bellini's at Otto's. For people who have never tried a Bellini, it is the national drink of Venice. I also love the pizza at Otto's, it is light and flavorful just like Italy. American pizza is smothered with cheese, not Italian pizza. It's too hot in Italy to eat heavy meals. On saturdays they make homemade lasagna which is light and delicious, one of my all time favorite dishes at Otto's.  Make sure to leave room for the gelato which is also very authentic to Italy. Real Italian gelato should be light and airy and bursting with flavor and that's exactly what you get at Otto's. If your looking for authentic Italian cuisine then Otto's is the place to go, but if you want crappy Americanized Italian then try olive garden."}
{"text":"Dear Mario,  Being a retired chef and visiting LV on business with the family and being Italian, I couldn't resist visiting The Venetian and visiting Mario's restaurant.   Really cool spot, Mario. We requested to be seated in the piazza area, but were told it was full, but would try to get a table out there. well, after 10 minutes, we were told it couldn't be done. Big surprise. We then were escorted to the back dining room area . Nice room with wine bottle decor and a very smart elegant atmosphere. Loved the taste of the room. That was great, Mario.   I don't know how to tell you this, Mario, but I'll try stating my overall experience with all the respect and admiration I have for you.   We ordered the penne dishes and the Taliatelli dish for my daughter and had the cheese appetizers.  Pasta was prepared adequately and tasted great. No problem, except portions were extremely small compared to the other Italian restaurants we've visited in LV.  So small in fact that we all stopped at another restaurant within an hour because we were all hungry still.  Unheard of from an Italian restaurant where the food at the table is abundant.  Ok, so you have ambiance.    Other issues.  When we were seated in the dining room, there was already a full table of 6 people having dinner and were sometimes too loud for the room.  No biggie.  Then after a half hour or so, servers were scrambling to put 4-5 tables together for about 20 people who had shown up.  In this small room? Are you kidding? Since this room was small these people were very loud and disturbing to everyone.  So much so, I couldn't hear the server explaining the desserts on the menu.  It was so disturbing, we chose to leave the second we were finished with the entree.   We were sorry we didn't do 'Trattoria Reggiano' on the way in.  The food looked out of this world and everyone seemed to be having a great time.  In short, nice place, but needs some work on the portions, selections and stuffing about 40 noisy people into a small room.  Server should have moved us out before.  And Mario, no Gnocchi or Cavatelli or Lasagna on the menu?? Whaa??  Very disappointed with our initial visit and will probably not visit your restaurants.  Best wishes,  Sincerely, Sal Carone"}
{"text":"I ordered the Ravioli di Brasato which tastes amazing. The service was top notch. I sat at the bar in the entrance and my waitor made a great wine pairing for me. I don't normally drink wine but felt the meal deserved it. When the meal came I was a bit concerned that the portion was too small, of course I didn't make a fuss of it but I suppose the manager could tell something wasn't right by my general posture and he asked if everything was ok. I mentioned that the portions were a bit small and he immediately offered to speak with the chef and possibly add more pasta. Moments later I was presented with a second serving. Thankfully I still had some wine left!"}
{"text":"Service, atmosphere and food were top notch.  Margherita Pizza and Spaghetti with Meatballs...perfect.  A little more expensive than usual but well worth it."}
{"text":"Nice location, loud but fun. Attentive waitstaff and some unusual dishes. Had the hazelnut pasta. It was oily but tasted good."}
{"text":"Worst Italian restaurant we have ever been to. Mario battali needs to answer for this abortion of a restaurant. You would be better served getting your own jar of Ragu, linguine, and sour cream and cooking it yourself. Additionally, horrible service staff, terrible ambiance, and absolutely abysmal service. The beer was flat and the servings of wine less than satisfying. Being a famous chef doesn't give you the right to serve terrible renditions of a great culinary tradition. Their version of the classic caprese salad is a great representation of everything that is wrong with this cash grabbing cash cow. The hotel /casino should remove these amateurs from the ranks of other great restaurants that are there."}
{"text":"I so wanted this to be a complete experience with a memorable meal at Mario Batali's signature Italian restaurant followed by a gondola ride at The Venetian.  Albeit it is a beautiful setting with the surprise of live music in the public space.  Once seated, we ordered the fried cauliflower, which received rave reviews of Yelpers saying it was lightly coated and very good.  Ours had a heavy hand when it came to being almost over fried, but the batter did have a slight heat to it, which was appreciated.  The gnocchi was dense with a flavorful tomato sauce.  The mozerella alla caprese, comprised of mozzarella, pesto, pine nuts and tomatoes seemed fresh and was fresh tasting.  The penne alla Norma was also well received.  Unfortunately, dessert brought salted caramel gelato that lived up to its name as it had large bits of sea salt that weren't entirely welcome and harsh.  The olive oil gelato was silky and definitely interesting.  Overall, our meal was pleasant, but sadly, lacking the finishing touches that should be a Mario standard.  Mario should pay a visit to Giada de Laurentis' new restaurant, as it truly reflects her style, point of view and provides an outstanding presentation."}
{"text":"Went to eat here with the wife during our Vegas trip. Was not expecting much but turned out to be one of the best meals of the trip. The lamb ragu and bacatini were both excellent. Their wine list is extensive as well including bottles and individual glasses.     The restaurant is located in the middle of the Venetian court so we were able to watch a live performance as well, which was pretty good."}
{"text":"I am a fan of Mario so I couldn't resist Otto after shopping in Vegas. It's located in the Venetian Hotel, known for its \"Venice\" theme with gondolas, water way, quaint shops and 65 ft ceiling painted to look like the sky. Sitting in tthe middle of an indoor town square, which is where this restaurant is located, you really do feel like you are outdoors at sunset.   This is \"no quick bite before heading back to the hotel\" place, at least you shouldn't let it. I don't mean the service is slow, it's quite the opposite. Allow yourself enough time to savor fine wine and food.   I couldn't resist but ordered cheese and wine, Italian-made, of course.   The  Lucerne Chardonnay ($17 a glass) and it's light, smooth, refreshing.  I then ordered a cheese plate with fresh Ricotta -- smooth, light, and buttery, not too salty. This cheese is made at the restaurant.  I finished with a Whole Wheat Pasta with proscuitto. The one thing I admired about Mario's pasta is that the al dente is cooked to be slightly crunchy but also soft at the same time. I could never repeat this texture at home.    You can't go wrong with any Mario restaurant, and this one is no exception."}
{"text":"no muss no fuss.  great service, great food, reasonably priced for a celebrity chef restaurant in vegas. i ate with a bunch of old men as we were in town for the shot show.   the server was well versed in the menu, answered all my silly questions like, what kind of flour do you use for the pizza crust:) i had a plain jane margherita pizza.  19 bucks.  super thin crispy crust, the mozz is to die for, the sauce was a little on the acidic side but worked great  with the mozz and basil.  my so's dad had the pork shoulder which was also soooo good, the sauce was an iverna (sp?) and apple juice reduction.  he's getting up there in years and often doesn't finish a plate, but he asked the waiter for more bread so he could mop up the last of the sauce on his plate. the pasta was great! cooked perfectly, cute little meat balls.  good sauce. the caprese salad was awesome, they fire roasted the toms because it's january and real tomatoes are out of season.    we also had the brussels and speck which was amazing.  the sprouts were carmelized without being mushy and the speck was nice and only a little smokey.  a little dash of vinegar really livened it up. the gelatos were great too, caramelized cara cara oranges with orange gelato and vanilla gelato... tasted like the best orange creamsicle EVER. all in all, we were 6 people.  two glasses of wine and a beer and three coffees and the bill was only 250.   fine dining for the unitiated!"}
{"text":"Went to Otto Enoteca Pizzeria last weekend and had to say it was the worst dinner we have had in Las Vegas.  From the minute we got there the waiters were rude and the manager was worse.  The music was so loud in the back wine room and when my husband who is not at all picky asked they turn it down they said No because  Mario Batali wants it loud -not that he was there but that is how it HAD to be. After even the manager refused to turn it down since we did not want to cause a further scene, we ordered spaghetti and meatballs (easy right) It was very small and dry- looked like it came out of a can.  Meatballs were gross! Very dissaponting for the money.  Also had pasta puttenesca that was more of a tasteless paste then a puttenesca sauce.  I would never go back!  Sorry that I had recommended to friends- we were all disappointed.  Even the wine was bad.  Stunk!"}
{"text":"The caprese salad was amazing. The rigatoni was not. The pasta was well too al dente/ even for Italian standards. It was just one of those places where the dishes were so simple you could make it home, but the star is the ambience and the ingredients. The ingredients are definitely fresh and wonderful. However I just can't get over how they ruined a simple pasta dish with such a rookie mistake."}
{"text":"The decor and atmosphere were very nice.  I went with a group of coworkers for cocktails and appetizers at 2:30 in the afternoon the restaurant was half empty, I realize this is Vegas and whatnot but I felt the service was rude:  Hostess \" Drinks and appetizers... well... we normally reserve these table for people who are eating, but since we're slow we can accommodate you, we may have to ask for the table back though...\" Us: \"OK, that's fine\"  I never realized appetizers weren't food.... What if we ordered a $500 bottle of wine? Would they let us take up space then?  Waiter after taking 20 minutes to talk to us: \"No food, we may have to ask you to leave since we save these tables for people who are eating: Us \"Yes, we already told the hostess, and she sat us anyway!\"  It took 20 more minutes for 2 beers and 3 glasses of wine to be delivered, and by that time we had to leave, needless to say the waiter did not get a gratuity from us.  First time I've ever done that!  We felt unwelcome and the waiter never offered us appetizers or anything else, he was condescending to the people who ordered a beer and asked for a beer list..  \"Enoteca means wine bar, so we only have one beer to choose from.\"  Meanwhile the bar is fully stocked with every type of vodka you could ever want.  I wanted to like the place and possibly go back for dinner, but after this I would never go back, there are plenty of other places to spend your money in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This is a review for the margherita DOC pizza. 4.5 stars.    Nostalgic for the bufala mozzarella we had on a margherita pizza in Florence, Italy, we decided to try the margherita DOC (it's a measure of Italian authenticity) at Otto.  We were not disappointed.   If you have not had water buffalo mozzarella (bufala), it's much more buttery (higher fat content) than american mozzarella--a different animal altogether (no pun intended).   The crust, because it's DOC, was also magnificent-- thin, crispy to the last bite, and you could taste the wood fire in it.  Just wonderful.    Incidentally, we also had the arancini and fried cauliflower (yummo).  Both were good.  Had two different glasses of red wine--both very nice.  The service was attentive.  Overall a very nice visit."}
{"text":"Our group had lunch here on our last day in Vegas. Service was strange, we think we were served by a hubrid.   The food was a mixed bag, and overall disappointing. One in our party ordered a caprese salad, which was served with hot stewed tomatoes. This was communicated to us ahead of time, but given the warning on the menu that they do not adapt menu items based on 'capricious whims' we assumed the chefs knew what they were doing. In this case, they did not.  The truffle pizza delivered on truffle goodness. The asparagus and preserved lemon pizza was fine, but I wouldn't order it again.   The vegan at our table was stuck ordering a side of broccoli rabe. The broccolini was so stringy that she nearly choked. Not recommended.  There are a lot of great dining options in Vegas. Our group experienced several of them--Bouchon, Sushi Samba, and even the unassuming La Pizza in Paris were better than this. You have other options--keep walking."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places in Las Vegas. The food is amazing. Great location to have either pizza or pasta and people watch. Staff is polite and helpful. Would definitely recommend this for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"A group of friends & I sat at the bar and Gregory took amazing care of us. The food was great but the bar service was spectacular. He was professional, friendly, attentive and had a great personality. He knows his menu, liquor & wines. The black truffle pizza is amazing, my friends enjoyed the pork shoulder however it wasn't my thing. I enjoyed the ensalata caprese and their dark chocolate dessert it amazeballs. I will definitely be back just for Greg & that dessert"}
{"text":"Phenomenal experience- service was beyond compare. Food was fantastic. Would recommend and come again 100%."}
{"text":"Exceeded expectations.  Excellent reception and service staff. Attentive manager. Exceptional food. Beautiful setting.   Mixed olive and the eggplant caponata were perfect starters and extra bread was delivered to help soak up the goodness.   Black spaghetti with squid and Sicilian pesto was done perfectly and the gnudi was great suggestion by our server.   Extensive wine list made choices difficult, but a good problem to have.    Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Hands down one  of the best Italian restaurants!  We wanted something basic for pasta - they have taken spaghetti and meatballs to a whole different level. The pizza (pancetta and goat cheese) was so good.  The chocolate cake with gelato was a perfect ending to a amazing meal. The service was excellent. I can say the restaurant provides an overall experience Mario Batalli would be proud to associate his name with.  Quality and excellence in both food and service.  Prego!!"}
{"text":"A nice, quiet place for a glass of wine and a late lunch. The staff are really attentive and helpful, very knowledgable about the food and wine."}
{"text":"We've been here twice now, and would highly recommend. Great food. Had the black spaghettini wit calamari & hubs had sausage and pepper pizza - very reminiscent of the real stuff from Florence. Good prices and excellent ambiance."}
{"text":"I was underwhelmed after my dining experience at Otto Enoteca Pizzeria.   Our server was attentive, personable, and on point. The ambiance is that faux Venetian vibe with the artificial sky above you and the feeling of being in Venice, which I have indeed visited and I wasn't teleported back in time by the surroundings. There was live music playing on the courtyard stage which was very pleasant.  We were given three small pieces of bread or as Al Bundy would have called them \"toaster leave'ems\". We asked for olive oil which helped. I was ravenous by this point because it took a good ten minutes to read over the extensive wine and cocktails list.   My quattro formaggio pizza was meh.  It tasted like those Kashi pizzas sans the fiber aspect that makes it tolerable because it's good FOR you. There were no spices used in the sauce at all. However the cheeses were delicious. I enjoyed my (yes, you read it right MY) bottle of Prosecco Flur. It was not too sweet and a nice bubbly to accompany the \"meal\". The saving grace of the evening was their dessert--their dark chocolate cake with whipped salted caramel, toasted vanilla meringue, and dark chocolate malt gelato was utterly sinful. Thank goodness for that dessert! Would I return? Only for that dessert and Prosecco!"}
{"text":"I bit expensive, but the simple fact that you can get higher end wines by the glass (or even a 2 oz pour) makes it forgivable. Cheesy outdoor singers, bit that is the fault of the venetian, not the restaurant. Friendly staff and great cheese!"}
{"text":"This place should not be called Italian! 5:00 on a weeknight and they are out of pepperoni, they didn't have angel hair pasta and the server was totally inept and very unprofessional.  We ordered sausage pizza and got a pancetta pizza, we asked for spaghetti and meatballs with angel hair pasta and were told they only had one kind of spaghetti so we declined the spaghetti.  When the order came we got the wrong pizza (not even anything close to pizza) and they brought the spaghetti.   After seeing the portion size for the price we were glad we had declined it.  In the middle of dinner our waiter disappeared and another server had to take over his mess.  When the bills came they were wrong and had to be corrected.  When we asked to speak to the manager he acted like our complaints were a daily occurrence and no big deal.  Needless to say we won't be going back to this restaurant and would advice others to stay away.  This place seriously need better training and new management."}
{"text":"Sitting under a faked blue sky, ALMOST feel like I was in Europe...almost. The service was pleasant. And, the pasta was yummy. It was a nice chilled late sunday lunch."}
{"text":"Underwhelming. Pizza was too crisp and was not worth the price. If you're going for pizza then you might as well go to Grimaldis pizza at Palazzo."}
{"text":"We went here for a family dinner the first night we were in Vegas and really enjoyed it! I would go back again, as there were many things on the menu that I'd still like to try! The fried cauliflower was just as delicious as the other reviews say. We got the corn pizza and the prosciutto pizza and spilt them between the two of us. I think we both agreed that they were both good, but the corn was better! It feels like you're eating outside (even though you're inside) and it's really beautiful. Yum!"}
{"text":"an awesome dining experience. the service was impeccable. we were treated exactly how a customer should be treated. the food- spectacular- grilled raddichio with smoked mozzarella, a mushroom pasta, gelato, short ribs ravioli. it would be worth going back to Lost Wages just to go to Otto again."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my experience here, but reading some of the other reviews, it may be because I dined on an expense account. The highlight of my meal was actually the wine- I was guided towards some amazing tastes by my server. I really like how you can construct your own tasting flight by size. The second thing I really liked was my burrata caprese. Absolutely tasty. You know that scene in the movie Ratatouille, where Anton Ego the Critic is transported, with one bite, back to his childhood home in rural France? I had a moment like that, back to a sunny cafe in Italy. I had a pasta, the carbonara special, which was nice but somewhat heavy. I regretted ordering it, despite having had a hankering for carbonara which had actually led me to choosing the restaurant, because it was just too much. A light series of sorbetti helped me recover, and of course, the finishing off of the wine. Mmm."}
{"text":"IF you want a Margherita pizza that tastes IDENTICAL to what you'll get in Italy... AND you are willing to pay $20 for it... THEN GO HERE NOW!!!!!!! The bread is pretty good too. Arancine are great... Fried risotto balls with a chunk of mozzarella inside, in a tomato sauce... DELICIOUS."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a whim on Saturday early evening. Service was pleasant and ambiance was okay. Had roasted broccoli (okay) and grilled radicchio with mozz, drizzled with balsamic. It was one of the most fun things I have eaten. It was bitter, salty and sweet and the interplay was delightful. I could've eaten a huge plate of this!  Partner enjoyed sausage and broccoli rabe pasta (very good) and I had three cheese selections and the prosciutto. Loved the honey with black truffle, brandied cherries and apricot jam that the cheese came with, and had a fine, fun time, wrapping up different packages of cheese and condiments in the prosciutto. Too full for dessert though I liked the gelato offerings. Drinks especially are overpriced."}
{"text":"The food was ok, we sat outside so the view and atmosphere was great.  Food was ok for the price, service was slow and not very good"}
{"text":"Second time @ Otto in Vegas- both visits were great!  Pasta dishes cooked to perfection.  The food is fresh, delicious & not overwhelming.  Would highly recommend.  Going to try their NYC branch to compare!!  Really like this place!!"}
{"text":"I have been in search of 3 things in this town.   1. Good Service  2. Better tasting food then my friends or I can cook at home.  3. And a final bill that is in line with the entire experience.  The Service We decided to eat at the busiest time in the evening so much of the issues with the service were understandable. In fact we were there right after a large convention let out on Tuesday. The hostess was very nice and was able to seat us at the bar which ended up saving us from a long wait. Once at the bar we received our water and menus. Later the bread and oil made its way to the table/bar. Our waiter was as attentive as he could be seeing that the place was crazy busy.   The Food We had a salad, rice balls, and the pork raviolis, and of course bread and oil. The salad was so simple it didn't inspire me to want to finish it. The rice balls were just tasteless. And the raviolis had a processed taste to them which wasn't too bad but I could definitely make better ones at home. Bottom line...if you have to eat here just get the bread and oil with a nice over priced glass of wine.  The Experience Unfortunately poor Otto's gets a one star because the food just didn't pass the \"Can I make this better at home test\" plus the price was not in line with the taste. The portions were all out of line with what a normal human consumes at dinner which made us search for a hefty desert after we left. Thank god the Venetian has tons of places to get a tasty desert. I mean it's amazing what a tasty treat can do to make you forget about an tastless dinner.   Here is a tip for the management! The view of all the goings on in the court yard at the Venetian is priceless. And the fact that the huge Sands convention center brings in countless hungry visitors in the evening who will eventually fly back to their home towns, makes your place unique. In other words you have a captive audience. So you really don't have to change a thing. Many of your customers are expensing  their meals and could careless what the food taste like. Perhaps it would be a wise idea to raise your prices and ship in food from Fazolis. The food would taste better for sure and the profits would sky rocket."}
{"text":"First, I understand that in a touristy place like the Venetian that the food doesn't necessarily have to be good because there is limited return business. This place was a total miss for my dinning companion and me. They wanted to seat us at a small table right next to another couple when there was almost no one else in the  restaurant.  The beer list consisted of one choice and the wines were very over priced. We had to ask for bread as we watched other tables get bread as they sat down. Our bill came to $72 for one beer $8 glass of wine $16  the Rigatoni Ragu , which included some gelatinous material that should not have been on any plate, $21 and so so ravioli for $23 .  Save your money and go someplace else."}
{"text":"had spaghetti and meatballs. meatballs were too small and tasted as if they were from a frzoen pack. overcooked and chewy. eggplant appetizer was good."}
{"text":"This place is so yummy! We stopped for drinks and ended up getting dinner. The atmosphere is great, right in the middle of the Venetian. We had the fried eggplant, meatball pizza, cheese pizza, and spaghetti and meatballs. Everything was great, the pizza was to die for! Perfectly thin and crispy crust, fresh cheese and homemade sauce. I could have eaten ten of these pizzas. So good. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"I love this place and visit it everytime I am in Vegas.   I love the cheese boards,  Margareta pizza,  arugula salad and all of the pastas.   The dips that come with the cheese boards are amazing.   The honey truffle is my favorite but the cherries are awesome with the goat cheese."}
{"text":"Not sure why the lower ratings...on 3 occasions, on 3 different trips to Vegas with 3 different groups of people - we all loved it!  It's the perfect location on St. Mark's Square in the Venetian and just steps down to the auditorium to watch \"Rock of Ages\".  The portions are a bit small and wish they would be more generous.  We ordered the dishes family style for the 6 of us and felt it was not enough to share.  But the quality and taste of the pasta and meet dishes - was great!  Really enjoyed the overall experience and would come back!"}
{"text":"The octopus salad is so good. Tender pieces of octopus with slices of celery and arugula with hearty potatoes. I don't know what dressing it is but it's just right.    Another must have is the buccatini. Perfectly al dente and the spicy sauce is heavenly!!! The onion slices and pork pieces.... Oh man, it's so good!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Our group of 24 had dinner there on Friday Nove. 30th. Salty!  Nice atmosphere but some of the food was inedible.  Just way too salty.  Pizza was the only highlight. I really wanted to love this place, but was sadly disapponted."}
{"text":"I'd even bump this up to 3.5 stars.  Look, it's not mind-blowing food but if you are with a large group (and so MANY Of us are in vegas in a large group) there's something to satisfy everyone and as long as you hang in the small plates/pasta/pizza categories, it can actually be pretty cheap, compared to other Vegas places.   Pictures and more stuff here: http://www.eattalk.net/2013/02/postcard-from-las-vegas.html#.USfVZOgRQtU"}
{"text":"Our bachelorette party group of five ended up at Otto Enoteca Pizzeria for Saturday night dinner recently. We were walking through the Venetian earlier in the day and decided it would be a great spot for later. A four star review is probably a little generous however there were definitely four and five star aspects to my experience so I'll err in their favor.  We showed up for our 8:15 reservation were seated immediately in an \"outdoor\" table. It was nice to enjoy the views of the Venetian Courtyard while being serenaded by the nearby musicians.  The most daunting task and possibly my favorite part of the experience was selecting the wine. The rest of the group wanted red and I was in the mood for white so my decision was pretty simple. As a big Sauvignon blanc fan I just went with the only sauv blanc being sold by the glass. Now the other ladies got the pleasure of working with the sommelier to find their perfect bottle of red wine. I don't recall his name but he was just a plethora of knowledge. I could have listened to his descriptions and stories of the wine all day. If I could give 5 stars for just the sommelier I would.   We decided to go family style with our food and ordered the Caprese Burrata Pesto Tomatoes, Mozzarella Di Bufala, Cypress Grove Goat and one other cheese as our starter. For our mains, we split three pizzas which included the Margherita 'D.O.C.', Truffle and the special of the day, which was a pesto pizza with a garlic white sauce. So the cheeses were phenomenal, specifically the goat cheese. The caprese salad was pretty good too, as I'm not a tomato fan and the tomatoes almost seemed like roasted red peppers. Sadly, the pizza was the least favorite part of my meal. I only sampled the margherita and pesto pies, but they were just overall bland. The best part of the margherita pie was the fresh basil, but it just slid off the slice along with the mozzarella. The pesto pie was just lacking the usual burst of flavor that one would expect when eating pesto.   Aside from the sommelier, the rest of the service just seemed a little off. For example, after we finished our cheese and salad appetizers they did not remove our small plates. The cheese came with honeys and spreads which wouldn't have mixed well with the pizza that was just served, and we had to ask for new plates for dinner. That was the only faux pas but they were just generally lackadaisical. It took a pretty long time to settle our bill, even when paying with just one credit card for the group.   I'm not ready to write off Otto Enoteca entirely as the appetizers, sommelier and atmosphere were pretty great. I'd just hope that if I were to return the other pizza options were more palatable."}
{"text":"We had dinner the other evening and were disappointed.  Service was slow even though the Resturant was not to busy and a lot of staff were standing around.  The food was truly ok - not amazing in any way.  We also ate at Mario's other Resturant in Resturant Row.  It was a bit better but not overwhelming either.  Disappointed."}
{"text":"I like most of his New York restaurants but this place is some big disappointment! We were visiting Joshua Tree and flew out of LV. Had dinner here .  Over priced mediocre at best.  We thought \"oh Batali it must be good...\"  Wrong!   Pizza crust was not brick oven.  Tasted like pre-made and frozen.   Really no joke!  Over priced wines etc... Appetizer of raddcichio  and cheese tasteless with a lot of of just he bitterness you get from that vegetable.  Can not say more because the rest  of the food was not at all memorable. I hate to leave a bad review but we were in town for one night and this place disappointed big. Very nice waitress though...very very nice.  We tipped her well because of who she was not because of the food. Mario-stop worrying about your  \"Chew\"  and public image and start worrying about the quality of your food in your restaurants again!"}
{"text":"was here with a group of 8. the service was really good, especially when one of the little ones came down with a stomach virus. they pounced on the mess and took care of us with such patience and compassion. i had a pasta dish that included sausage and broccoli rabe, it was really nice. we also ordered some cured meats and cheeses, no complaints. we sat on the patio, which was nice... good people watching but at the same time, not too distracting."}
{"text":"The food is amazing and the service is good.  What a relief after our nightmare of food at Bellagio - not going there again.    Coming back to Otto's - excellent.  We got Aragula salad - crispy and fresh.  Margherita Pizza - excellent - crisp, flavorful and wonderful crust - brought back memories from Italy.  We also ordered pasta dish - the Bucatini - rich and with a bit of bite - lovely.  Prices were reasonable and mid-range - will visit this place again if I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Came here b/c there was a 1.5hr wait for Postrio. Pricey but not uncharacteristically so for Vegas. Food was good but not mind-blowing. Was a little turned off that the breadsticks came in cellophane wrapping. That's strange, right? I mean, even if it is imported breadsticks, having to unwrap them like they were an after-dinner mint felt strange at a place that's $30/entree.   The pork shoulder is easily the best option. Otherwise, expect good-but-not-good-enough-to-cost-what-it-costs food."}
{"text":"This was a really great meal.  I had the pork shoulder with a 2006 Montevetrano.  The food and service were equally on point.  Having eaten here and at the Wolfgang Puck eatery adjacent to it, I would recommend Otto."}
{"text":"The best part of this meal was the bread and olive oil and the salad. Seriously!   My coworker and I dined here while in Vegas and looking for something quick and plentiful after spending the day at Hoover Dam. Volume we got; but on the whole it was just so-so.   At least we got to people watch while dining \"outside in St Mark's Square\" indoors at the Venetian.   We each had the Acetaia \"Vinegar Maker's Salad\" and shared two pizzas: Pancetta & Goat Cheese and Sausage & Peppers.   I loved the salad! Nicely sized portion of lettuce, shaved parmesan reggiano, prosciutto and more! The dressing was really tangy and tasty!  The Pancetta & Goat Cheese pizza tasted better, without the HUGE ASS plop of goat cheese. Really, that was too much goat cheese on each slice. And the other pizza just seemed kinda sloppy. The sausage tasted good but overall, I wish I had ordered another pizza.   Gotta love celebrity restaurants in Vegas because they seem all over the place. Next time, I'll skip this one. I liked the Otto in Manhattan much better!"}
{"text":"this restaurant single handedly made me lose faith in mario batali for life. i've been here twice. both times, i was extremely disappointed by the quality and taste of the food. the pastas and pizzas lacked the rich, heartiness of italian flavors- uplifted by herbs and arromatic cheeses. the food tasted like it came from a cheap wannabe italian deli. for some reason, the ice cream cone waffle tasted like fried fish? service was spotty with a bunch of servers standing around and giggling. and of course, completely OVERPRICED for the experience."}
{"text":"Really bad restaurant food over cooked and cold, I learn a listen long time ago if yelp gave less than 4 stars and from many customers that mean something wrong, I fail to apply it today"}
{"text":"I hate to say this about a Batali restaurant, but this is a tourist trap.  The following were ordered and I sampled each: Romana Pizza (anchovy pizza) Lasagna Ravioli  All three were mediocre and something you would find at a buffet at Vegas.  That would be fine if I was visiting a buffet, but I tend to avoid the petri dishes that we consider buffets as much as possible.  So...if you go to a restaurant, you expect decent food for the price you pay.  You don't expect overpriced beef a roni.  We all paid relatively high for raviolis that were not filled with anything (not sure if the chef screwed up or the filling was cooked out in the sauce), lasagna that I could cook better using a Batali recipe, and my Romana pizza that obviously had old anchovies.  The anchovies tasted like sardines that had been sitting out for a few days and were sometimes licked by a cat.  Super fishy..more than a normal anchovy.  The sauce on the pizza had the taste of a canned sauce, and the cheese was flavorless.  The capers were the only thing decent on the pizza.    I asked the waitress about the anchovies, and she just said \"yes...that is how anchovy tastes.\"  No...that is not how they taste when they are new.  I have eaten at 5 star restaurants and the anchovies were fresh.  What they gave me was horrible.  Batali has cookbooks all over the place in that restaurant and I noticed we were right next to the Venetian streetscene play...so I put two and two together.  This must be his throw away restaurant (place where he sends his older food) and he believes the touristy area of the place will suffice for driving traffic.  Also, the service was sub par for a supposedly higher scale restaurant.  It took them some time to seat us (although there were a lot of tables) mainly because nobody was at the station for about 10 minutes.  This didn't just happen with us.  Other patrons were standing in a line with about 7 tables open because the hostess was nowhere to be found.  Bad experience, but it is a learning experience.  Apparently a top chef's restaurant can suck, and this one sucks.  I also learned that if push comes to shove that I can live off of cat food.  That will help in the zombie apocalypse."}
{"text":"It was a lot better than the last time I was here.  The pizzas we got (Margherita and especially the Funghi Misti) were pretty good... but the Rigatoni... it was served raw in my opinion.  It was crunchy in the middle.  We tried telling our server but he made it sound like it was meant to be undercooked because that's how the real Italian makes it.  He then took the pasta back and made it sound like he was doing us a favor by cooking it a bit longer.  What a snob?!?! I know some people undercook the pasta just a bit for better texture.  But what we got was not undercooked a bit... it was undercooked a whole LOT."}
{"text":"Pretty good overall.  I ate here with my husband and we shared an order of Mozzerlla Caprese  (fried cheese) and A Hot Soppressata pizza.  Soppressata is an Italian salami that is slightly stronger tasting than pepperoni.  The pizza was simple but the cheese, meat made for a nice tasting combination and the crust perfectly cooked, thin and crunchy and was very good."}
{"text":"Fresh. Homemade. Pasta.  Phenomenal meal by a master chef owner!!  We had the almond pesto and Telefono pasta dishes that were out of this world!  We did have a bit of a hard time understanding the menu as most of it was in Italian. Good wines, mostly from Italy.  We found the prices to be very reasonable given the quality of this kind of food. We went to carneVino, Mario Batali's other restaurant here in Las Vegas, and I would say this is a much better value for your dollar."}
{"text":"Great place for a glass of wine and cheese board. Many classic Italian wines by the glass to choose from and top notch cheeses."}
{"text":"Worst dining experience I've had. Went looking for a casual restaurant (as advertised on the Venetian's website) after just arriving in Las Vegas.  The waiter took 10 minutes to show up, then was pretentious and rude when we only ordered a small amount.  He then made us feel uncomfortable by sneering at us to the other wait staff after we declined food we did not order, and laughed at us when we didn't order dessert. Tonight we ate at CUT by Wolfgang Puck and cannot stop raving of the service and food.  Otto is not a casual restaurant or inexpensive. If you're looking for something in this price range or a little more, try CUT."}
{"text":"We were excited to try Mario Batali's restaurant. It has a nice atmosphere. We were greeted warmly and felt  welcomed right away. From our table, we could see the performers in the court and enjoyed the music. It was just lovely. Our service was great. Those are the highlights. The food was a let down. We ordered a pizza and lasagna. My bf and I shared the dishes. I ordered a glass of wine. Our pizza was small, could have been an appetizer. It had a nice crisp crust, but it wasn't special. It was fine. Maybe I was looking for wonderful. I've had margarita (I know I'm spelling it wrong) pizza before that was so special in it's simplicity, because it was handmade and oven-fired, with flavors and textures that made your brain light up, but this pizza was just okay and not worth the $20 you end up spending on it. The lasagna was good, solid. Still, not amazing.  When we got our bill, $71total, it hurt a little bit to spend that kind of money on this meal, even with the great atmosphere and service. I hear Mario's food is generally good. I might give one of his other restaurants a try, but I will not be back to this one again."}
{"text":"We decided to come to Otto as we are a BIG fan of the Farmers market on Thursday that Mario puts on. The food at the farmers market is organic, locally grown generally is used here at OTTO. We love great quality food and meats, and this place has it! It is a Green Restaurant, they have their own source for the meat( - grass fed, organic, family owned and operated), they make their gelato in house and from those fruits from the market. YUMYUMYUM Wonderfully prepared, tasty, foods and great service!  Next time we are trying the meat platter. The prosciutto was divine!"}
{"text":"My husband and I dined at Otto a few years ago and wasn't impressed.  We decided to try it again as the restaurant was full and there was a wait of 20 minutes.  Caneletto and Postrio restaurants nearby weren't as crowded.  We started with prosciutto fritta (deep fried prosciutto balls) which were extremely salty and over fried, topped with Parmesan cheese that made it even more salty.  Next we had an escarole pear salad which was fresh but nothing special.  We ordered a tagliatelle pasta dish but received a pork belly ragu instead which was pretty delicious so we ate it and didn't say anything about being served something we didn't order.  Ended with a dessert called dark chocolate which was a dark chocolate cake with chocolate gelato and whipped cream and cappucini.  Again just okay.  Cocktails and wine are pretty pricey.  Our server was on the snooty side.  Seemed put out when we asked her what various dishes on the menu consisted of.  She gave us someone else's check and when we brought it to her attention she just said \"it's okay, it didn't go through on your charge anyway.\"  No apology at all!  The busboys are really friendly and attentive though.  I don't think we'll be giving this place a third try."}
{"text":"Liked the sweet onion pizza and melon salad we ordered for lunch. Good service, relaxed ambiance and nice view of the square.  If it were overly crowded I'd pass - but overall a nice relaxing and tasty lunch."}
{"text":"It's an \"OK\" place.  Definitely a tourist oriented place. Food is average, and with service expect to be pushed out from the time you walk in.  Frankly, do not understand the hipe about Mario Batali. This another QSR pretending to be something else."}
{"text":"For those of you who are new to Vegas...I don't envy you.  There is SO much to choose from!  You need to accept, right now, that you will not possibly be able to experience all the amazing things Vegas has to offer.  In fact, as much as I plan my trips (and boy do I plan them!) there is inevitably a moment when I walk by something and think, \"why didn't I make time for THAT???\"  I tell you that - to tell you this.  Understand that Vegas is a lot about knowing your price points and researching the best value for your money.  Example:  If a quick McDonald's breakfast and coffee (yum) is just as good as a gourmet omelet from Mon Ami Gabi (at the Paris - YUM!) then save the money and spend it somewhere else.   Ok, back to the review.  Why you should try this place: -Ambiance, Ambiance, Ambiance, value, value, value for that ambiance -Located in the Venetian along the Canal shops, with occasional live music nearby -Great food for Mid-Price point ($20-30 entree, with apps separate) -Extensive Wine List, approachable prices -Service is quick, lots of tables, easy to get reservation (use opentable.com!) -Food is authentic, southern style with red sauces, lots of garlic and homemade sausage (not as good as my Nonna's, but then again, nothing ever will be!) -Skip the dessert and grab a gelato at the nearby gelateria and stroll your way back through the shops -Consider splitting a pizza (6 thin crust slices) and some side appetizers  What you need to keep in mind: -A reservation is a good idea, just because Vegas can get busy FAST. -This is not superfine dining.  Don't expect a really posh atmosphere but understand that everything in the Venetian feels a bit classy and you can totally be dressed up if you want to, either way, you will fit in.  Mangia!"}
{"text":"My husband and I have been fans for a long time, but were sadly disappointed by our dining experience here. Our food was sub par, our server completely forgot about our table after only one stop to say hello. We were done with our food for 20 minutes before we had to actually get up and ask for our check. We found our server in the back playing drums with his hands on the counter without a care in the world. Save your money, don't eat here."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had lunch here on a Wednesday. The place is beautiful, right inside the shoppes at Venetian. You'd think you'd be getting superb service but no, our waiter didn't even greet us when he got to our table. He just said \"you ready to order?\" And throughout our dining, we barely saw him like once. But asides the crappy service, the food was great and there was an opera performer outside and we loved that!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for the past 6 yrs. and have never been disappointed. I love everything about this restaurant. Made reservations for a special event, our 24th anniversary. We were treated very special from the moment we arrived. The cheese platter with the apricot preserves, truffle honey & my favorite bourbon cherries (which we always get extra.) Because of the name I've always ordered the pizza & feast away blissfully. The service is impeccable (thank you Rocco) & the environment is the next best thing to Venice even though it's not even close-but one can pretend. ~Ciao Belle"}
{"text":"This place is full of itself.   There are no real vegetarian options.   The margarita pizza has a fairly basic pomodoro tomato sauce. It was flavored well for a pomodoro but seemed somewhat out of place on the pizza over all.    Each slice of pizza had exactly one slice of mozzarella and exactly one leaf of basil, $18.    For those that are under the impression that Mario Batali is laboring back in the kitchen, you should reconsider.    This is a celebrity endorsed restaurant nothing more.    The wine list is kind of a joke.    Many glasses are in excess of $20 and some as much as $64.  Only two reds less than $15 and only one dry red.   I've had plenty of good wine in the $12-15 range why not offer some of those here?  I don't expect to pay $25 a glass even if it was, in theory, fine dining."}
{"text":"There's no way Molto Mario got his muscular physique eating portion sizes this small.  I am a huge Mario Batali fan from a traditionally Italian family who has eaten more than his fare share of Northern Italian food in Italy.  The prices were a bit on the high side for casual dining, but hey, you're in Venice. Kind of.  The real disappointment was the portion size, which was a bit absurdly small. The food was good. My wife and I had the all'Amatricciana and a goat cheese pizza between the two of us. The hostess said that the pasta was a good amount of food for one, but it really was pretty meagre.  Both meals were well prepared and delicious. For $50 before drinks, it's disappointing to clean your plate and leave hungry, though. I'm not a huge either, either. This was disappointing."}
{"text":"1 star for the food, and an additional star for the cheese plate and service.  The food was HORRIBLE!  Pizza sauce tasted like it came out of a can!  The pasta was under cooked (some pieces were crunchy).  The waiter even said that is exactly how he got his when he had it too.  He knew it was under cooked as well.  Also, the food was fairly over priced (especially for what you got)... the $1.00 frozen pizzas had LOTS more flavor than the margarita pizza (and better sauce)!"}
{"text":"i am sitting here watching an episode of Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares and it reminds me of the awful food we ate last week at Otto.  The expensive wine was very good.  The server was Ok.  The bus boy was Ok (except for when he said right beside me that he need to take a break to use the toilet).  The appetizer was decent.  But the part that was just disgusting were the two pizza's we ordered.   I cannot believe how bad they were.   I have had better frozen pizza's.    I had no idea until I came to this review site that this was a Mario Bitali restaurant.  He needs to get out to this restaurant or have secret people eat there to see how bad the pizzas were.  For the price paid this was totally unacceptable.  That said shame on me for not speaking up at the restaurant it is just I am very unconfortable about doing that.  Hopefully the owners will read my feedback along with the others I see here and make it better for the next customer."}
{"text":"It pains me to give this place 3 stars, but I have to. First the good...  The service was good and setting was nice. Be sure to sit \"outside\" so you can watch the action.   We started with the prosciutto which was the best we've ever had...and we've had a lot. The flavor and texture were amazing. Order this!  Next was the caprese with burrata. This was also quite delicious. Love the pesto with it.   Unfortunately the pizza is why I gave a  3 star review. It just wasn't great. We were expecting mind blowing pizza like we had at Eataly in NYC and it didn't come close. The crust was not light and airy like it should be. The pizza across the way at Postrio was much better.    I wouldn't say don't go here, I'd just recommend not getting pizza. Be sure to get the charcuterie though!"}
{"text":"BEAUTIFUL ambiance, but I think it is over rated. Too expensive for a pizza and the tomato sauce tasted...well different. And not different as in authentic bececause I have had pizza all over Europe. I had to eat off my friend's plate who had no sauce on the pizza. My other friend ordered a pasta that looked like a kid's meal. Our server forgot to ring in our two appetizers so we got our dinner first, but the manager gave it to us for free so that was the only appealing thing. The fried mozarella is actually fried bread with a tiny piece of mozarella in the middle so I would skip on those."}
{"text":"For a Mario Batali eatery in The Venetian, Las Vegas, this was reasonable and tasty. Nothing terribly special, but the view of St. Mark's Square is great. When we were there, some opera singers and performers were doing their thing on the square, and they actually were great! I had a salad, nicely proportioned, with escarole, pears, walnuts and pecorino. The pears were browned around the edges from age, meaning they'd been sliced awhile previously. It's little things such as this that made me realize this is just an overpriced touristy place. In Las Vegas! Who would have thought! Since this is a pizza place I should have gone with that but just wanted something light. Service was a tad snooty but adequate. I wasn't expecting anything special and got exactly that. Go to Eataly instead!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a business meeting. I took the waiter's recommendations and ordered the BBQ pork shoulder. It was just a chunk of meat with not much vegetables so I ordered a side salad. It was very tender and juicy.  The others ordered pasta and corn pizza. All the pasta were WAY TOO SALTY! Had a taste of linguini w/ clams. SALTY. We ordered a kids penne pasta it was hardly eaten. TOO SALTY. Ravioli was salty. Corn pizza was unimpressive."}
{"text":"3.5 stars overall.  My girlfriend and I stopped in here for lunch while the hubbies were off playing hockey. Located right in the center of the Venetian shopping plaza, you have great views to do a little people watching and even watch the show they randomly put on throughout the day on the nearby stage.  I liked the outdoor seating area. Very cozy and very European. It was nice.   For lunch, we decided to share the Tuna salad and the Margherita pizza. For the salad, the menu read, \"Tuna Roasted Tomato Artichoke Caprese Burrata Pesto Cherry Tomato Salad\", a lot going on so I was a little intrigued at what the salad would look like.  It could also use some punctuation too.  The salad overall was a 3. A little too tangy for me to rave about it but nevertheless, it was tasty and enjoyable. I think they if they can simplify this salad, it would really go a long way.   The margherita pizza is what made this lunch for me. The crust was nice and thin, very tasty and had the right amount of cheese on it. I know it's pretty authentic to just place the whole basil leaves on the pizza but I never understood why restaurants do this because you can't get the taste of the basil in every bite. I prefer cooks and chefs to chiffonade the basil and then sprinkled on top. That way, the basil goes a long way.  The service here great. Our waiter was very attentive as well as the rest of the wait staff. We didn't have to ask or wait long for anything. My first visit to a Mario Batali restaurant and while he's in between a 3.5-4 stars for me, I'd definitely come back and try other things on the menu despite the mixed reviews here."}
{"text":"This was a pleasurable experience.  Came here for a business appreciation luncheon so we started with a large apps course that had a bunch of different cheeses, platters came out with some candied peaches and cherries that were beyond heavenly!  got a misto-platter of different meats too and some pickled (I think they were pickled) beets and pumpkin that was pretty fantastic! This is a Pepsi-contracted company, so unfortunately the soft drinks taste like typical Pepsi terribleness. All of us ordered different entrees, most chose pizzas.  The Quattro Formaggio was a great pizza!  I had a cheese (don't remember the type) and sautéed mushroom pizza (the Thursday special).  I've never had that type of cheese before and it turned out to be one of the \"smelly\" ones.  It was ok but I personally wouldn't do it again.  The pepperoni pizza looked good. Finished off with a Tiramisu dessert.  We were all surprised of the prices of the desserts...like $12-$15 range.  Surprising to me since I manage a fine-dining steakhouse across the street and this price is almost twice what I charge.  The waiter \"warned\" me that this is a deconstructed tiramisu ice cream...it sure was.  A generous portion of ice cream (soft serve consistency...though not saying it was) with the lady fingers and chocolate and whipped cream on top. The atmosphere was cute.  It was in one of the main \"courtyards\" of the Venetian mall area so twice during our meal they had a show performance.  The seating we were at was made to feel like an outdoor Venice bistro which was cute that there is even a slight breeze."}
{"text":"En skøn restaurant på torvet på Vinetian. Hyggelig lille plads, hvis man ikke vidste bedre ville man være sikker på man sad i Itailen.   Maden er god og prisen acceptabel, specielt kan jeg anbefale deres hvid pizza med trøffel og kartofler.  Eneste minus er at der hver time er et show på pladsen der larmer frygteligt, men det bidrager nu også til stemningen."}
{"text":"Otto is  one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas for the quality of the food, price and service. Yes, it is not Babbo (my favourite MB and JB restaurant) but you don't have to call a month in advance for over an hour hoping to get a reservation, and it is a completely different experience.   The appetizers and pizza are amazing, the pasta is superb and the desserts are to die for. Mi favourite pasta is the signature MB salty pasta and the strawberry shortcake is one of my favorite desserts ever! I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Everytime I come here, its never a disappointment. Always delicious food and very fresh. Food items always change seasonally. Try their seasonal food items! :D the appetizer eggplants are amazinggggg."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant with high expectations and was so excited to eat here.  The food was very good, but too spicy for me. I would still eat it again.  However, the service was very poor.  It took away from my dining experience.  We went through our entire meal without a drink or water refill, even when we asked the waiters response was \"I am sorry I am training someone\". I noted that he went to all the other tables around me 3 and 4 times and refilled their glasses and offered assistance.  When our main course came he handed us back our forks and did not replace them. I have eaten at Wolfgang Puck's across the way many times and did not experience this.  I eat out at least 5 nights a week. I really felt like it was a social economic status issue relating to the waiters perceptions of my party.  What he did not know was that I was dining with my daughter who was paying for the meal who is a forensic psychologist.  She is a college professor and builds programs for the LAPD.  I felt like Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman.  He missed out big time. I will never go back. Wolfgang will be getting all my money!  Edna W."}
{"text":"Otto wasn't on my Vegas food-genda but was a delicious surprise!  On our last day in Vegas, we found ourselves hungry and tired in the Venetian at lunchtime.  I didn't have the energy to trek back towards Bouchon so we scanned the Otto menu and were sold.    We were seated in the very back corner of the indoor patio.  I was a bit concerned that we might be forgotten but our service was very friendly and attentive throughout the meal.     The meat and cheese selections were alluring but for our last day in Vegas, we went for broke and ordered a couple of the fritti selections.  The Arancini and Calzone were both delish.  The saffron risotto of the arancini was so perfectly flavored, my guy declared them the best he's had.  The calzone was very yummy and very rich.  I was surprised not to see some tomato sauce to cut some of the creamy fattiness but didn't mind a bit.  For main courses, we continued to indulge and went the pizza route:  Pancetta and Goat Cheese for me and Artichoke and Prosciutto Cotto for manfriend.  We both enjoyed the crisp, cracker crust.  Good amount of toppings.  The goat cheese on my pizza had perfect tang and creaminess.  Mine was good but I reeeeally liked the artichoke pizza.  Delicious cheese and prosciutto, great subtle lemon flavor.  Very nom.  Vegas is pricey but Otto's items were only a couple dollars more than a comparable place in the Bay Area where we're from.  No sticker shock here but I can imagine other blanching at paying $20 for an individual pizza.  That said, they were a generous size and very filling.  You definitely get your money's worth.  Thanks, Mario!"}
{"text":"Come here for the appetizers and bread, especially the fried Brussels sprouts(get this), skip the pizza and the desserts(gelato wasnt great plus all the desserts were really a big glass of gelato with a mini slice of cake or whatever was advertised)"}
{"text":"I was a bit disappointed overall. Pizzas were ok, but not very authentic and was not a fan of the crust - certainly would expect better...rigatoni with pork with swiss chard didn't look appetizing and though it was comforting, it was also very salty. 4 oz pours at 10 bucks were a bit expensive..and I probably would have been inclined to rate it 2 stars had it not been for the dessert (though again 12 bucks?)...overpriced - so 2 stars it is...  8 is not so great - and I really had hoped it would be.  Will not return."}
{"text":"Came in for lunch with my three kids. We ordered the crab ravioli and it was delicious! Also ordered the margherita pizza to share . We didn't like it at all. The sauce was very runny and when we picked up a slice, everything would fall off. Not worth it for the price."}
{"text":"Solid 4 star restaurant.  I love Batali's restaurants in LA - Osteria Mozza - droool - and Pizzeria Mozza - double drool.  I'm happy to say another good experience at a Batali establishment. Otto's pizzas honestly were pretty good but not special (especially when compared to the ambrosia at Pizzeria Mozza). BUT, their antipasti and the pasta... SO good.  We had a selection of 4 vegetables with bread as an appetizer. The bread could have been warmed which would have been a nice touch. The veggies were AMAZING. You can tell that they put a lot of thought and effort into the food knowing that even their roasted vegetables were so delicious. The eggplant was a standout favorite and the star. The broccoli was pretty darn good too.  Pastas. We had a selection of 3 - the daily special lasanga, eggplant with some tube pasta, and a third flat noodles with a meat ragu. The lasanga was amazing - whole milk mozzarella in all its creamy goodness. The eggplant in the tube pasta was so soft and tender - really tasty. The ragu was good, too... but our third fave.  At $30 pp for 6 girls... a steal!"}
{"text":"I was hoping for a better experience on my birthday for lunch here especially since gnocchi is my favorite but it was pretty bland and my husband didn't really care for his penne dish.  Service was meh with the exception of the bday gelato which for some weird reason was concave like they scooped out the other half.  Overall it wasn't what we hoped for."}
{"text":"I had the octopus celery and potato salad to start with and the linguine con le Cozze for the entree. The salad was nice and refreshing with lots of arugula although the octopus was bland and had no flavor to it. The best thing about the linguine was the saffron they used in the dish and the dish was way too salty. This place is nothing special except for it's owned by Mario Batali. It is a little over priced for the quality of the food. DO NOT ORDER SPAGHETTI WITH MEATBALLS or GRILLED RADICCHIO WITH SMOKED MOZZARELLA. They weren't good at all, not even edible. Try the pizza's. They looked great."}
{"text":"Went last night for a family dinner. We had a party of 7 including my two small children. Our server Edith and the rest of the staff were difference makers. Edith made fantastic recommendations and took excellent care of my children. The food was amazing too. Appetizers included an array of meats and cheeses as well as some fried options. The entrees were limited in selection but prepared and plated expertly. The wine lost was extensive, and the Toscana we had was perfect. Desserts were rich and tasty. Overall a great experience. Expensive in cost but rich in experience. If you go, see if you can request Edith's section. She's a great guide."}
{"text":"Mario Batali - Joe Bastianich - I expected more from you guys...in fact, I chose Otto based on Mario's name (sorry Joe - not a fan).  That said - here's my review of your Otto Enoteca:  We started with the Gnocco Frito,  Eggplant Caponata, and Grilled Radiccio salad with smoked mozzarella.  The apps were okay - certainly not bad - but nothing special.  (also some drinks and wine which were just fine)  Then we had two pizzas.  The Margarita DOC pizza and the Pancetta/Goat cheese pizza.  The Margarita DOC was truly disgusting.  The thin crust was tasteless and soggy.  The tomato sauce was as if someone had taken campbell's cream of tomato and slapped in on cardboard.  Then there was a dab of mozzarella.  Overall a tasteless, soggy, bizarre tasting mess.  C'mon Mario - please don't tell me you actually think this is good?   The other pancetta/goat cheese pizza had a little more flavor but still mediocre at best.  (btw: note to restaurant - those breadstick packets you put on the table are old/expired/have a funky chemical aftertaste).  The setting in St. Mark's square \"a la Venice\" is charming and romantic.  Really a lovely setting - and reminds me of my trip there many years ago.  The service is eager, but weirdly clumsy - like they  are trying too hard to let you know that this is a serious dining experience - overly explaining every little thing - and educating you on every ingredient if you ask a question about the menu - which is nice but just too much.  They also push certain dishes or desserts - but they go on forever when you really just want to cut them off and let them know you hate Pumpkin so no need to do five minutes on the\" deconstructed pumpkin cheesecake in a jar\".  Just sayin....   Somehow - we spent close to $200 on this meal - a lot given what it was.  I had read the mixed reviews on yelp - including one that mentioned the Campbell's tomato soup tasting pizza - but I figured they were probably just being bitchy - and the location worked for us as we were going to see a show at the Venetian.  But the mixed reviews are accurate - and we will not be returning to Otto anytime soon.  Mario - still a fan - Joe, still not a fan."}
{"text":"What a surprise this was.  The food was excellent.  Went for lunch and had the arugula salad and the seafood stew.... wow...  the stew was amazing....  Filled with clams, mussells, calamari and fish.  The broth was to die for.  Also had the Otto Sundae which was soooooooo good.  Pistachio, chocolate and vanilla gelato in a crispy wafer cone.  Deeelissssshh.....  Service was attentive.  Kept my water and ice tea filled throughout.  You gotta love it, when a restaurants food and service are both excellent.  Hats off Mario - you got a great restaurant!  Love this place."}
{"text":"The pizza is quite good, as are the various cured meats. The wait staff is hit or miss. Sometimes they've been great. Sometimes not so much.  The location is sort of annoying. I've been seated at the railing and had tourists come right up to see what I was eating. The dining area is so crowded that it's hard for people with disabilities to maneuver. But my biggest gripe is the wine prices, especially by the glass. They wanted $65 for a glass of Tignanello. I had bought an entire bottle of exactly the same wine at K&L for just $85. Outrageous."}
{"text":"Miguel, the server made dinner great. Attentive, knowledgable, and friendly. Lasagna was the best dish we had."}
{"text":"Huge disappointment with this restaurant. I expected bay better considering who the owners are. No vegetarian options to choose from, almost every meal has meat in it in some way, shape or form. I've ordered \"Love Letters\" which is a rectangular shaped ravioli like pasta, filled with puréed squash and swimming in \"brown butter sauce\". Brown butter sauce in nothing but melted, slightly burned butter, and seeing your pasta swimming in butter is completely unappetizing. Bland tasting, considering the amount of butter on the plate, and very small portioned. I'd say, portions are lunch sized even though we went there during dinner service. Do not waste your time or money there."}
{"text":"I'm giving it three because I eat here all the time. It has always been good all around. I don't know what happened but we had probably one of the worst experiences ever.  It was all due to HORRENDOUS service. I've been in the restaurant industry for 20 years, so I tend to be pretty empathetic with servers and kitchen problems, etc.  We split the cauliflower, a pizza and the Fra Diavlo. All were good, however, when we wanted to order dessert, we had to flag down a manager, after 30 minutes.. Our server never checked back on us. I noticed she was busy with a large group, but acknowledgement would have been nice.  We ordered our Americanos from the manager and when she came by to take our dessert order, she was rude and probably assumed we were going to stiff her.  She was wrong, we left her 20% just to prove our point and make her feel stupid.  After years of eating here, its really questionable if I would go back. We were there for nearly two hours, wasting time with her lousy attitude."}
{"text":"After 2 days of camping at the Grand Canyon and Zion National Park and eating rice and beans, it was great to come back to civilization and get a good meal at Otto. That is, if you can really call Vegas civilization.   I've always liked Mario Batali's food philosophy and I just read Joe Bastinach's Restaurant Man so I was pretty excited to try this place. It was right in the middle of the faux square with music and the fountain and everything which set a nice mood for the man date with my friend before we hit the blackjack tables.  We split a good bottle of Gewürztraminer and people watched for while. Our waitress was  nice and attentive. The arugula salad with pecorino Romano was the perfect start to a pizza dinner. I ordered a white pizza with wild mushrooms and, all in all, it was good. The crust was a little too crunchy although it was as thin as I like it.  I can't give it a five though because my expectations were high and the price was high relative to the value. I know it's Vegas but, come on, pizza is pure margin. I know Joe Bastinach knows all about that. But I guess that's just good business."}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a quick lunch.....stayed for two hours!!! 2oz after 2oz of incredible Italian wines from the enomatic machines. Braised pork shoulder? Yes please!! Manager came over and said hello, bartender was very friendly. Will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Not very good for price paid.  22 dollars for pasta with no sauce and mushrooms.  The beet bruschetta had a rye taste that was over powering.  Pizza also only o.k."}
{"text":"Try their Cauliflower pasta! It was my and my entire party of 10 girls' favorite dish. We ordered several off of their prefix menu. DEE-licious.  Their appetizers were fun. They brought us a giant plate full of compartments that contained different appetizers. There were a lot that were reminiscent of Indian food: black lentils, egg plant, green olives, etc. Since I'm a vegetarian, I can only discuss the Veggi dishes.  The Cauliflower pasta sounds like it would contain a weird taste, but their sauce and consistency of the pasta was made and blended to perfection. Their Margarita pizza was to die for. I had incidentally had margarita pizza the night before as a late night snack at Grand Lux Cafe, and I was blown away by how incomparable Otto's Margarita pizza is. It's rich, soft, fluffy, and delightfully tasty. The final Vegetarian dish that we had was the ricotta cheese pasta with marinara sauce. That was cooked to perfection as well.  I especially liked that they provided each of us with skinny bread stick packets. I wasn't a fan of their wine, and unfortunately I don't remember which kind we ordered.   The prefix menu also included several desserts, and they were all delicious, especially the marshmallow one.   Service was impeccable, but the only issue was that they seated us off to a corner where we weren't under the cool Palazzo daylight sky ceiling."}
{"text":"Otto is my happy place!  The smells, sights, and sounds of St. Marks Square in the Venetian are the perfect back-drop for a casual, relaxing, and thoroughly enjoyable dining experience. How amazing is it to be greeted with a glass of Rose Prosecco? The perfect aperitif to cleanse the palate, and there's something about bubblies that starts off a meal with a happy note.  If you haven't tried the salumi options, you are missing out! House-cured meats? Yes, please! Try the Coppa & Mortadella - mmm... And don't forget the variety of cheeses that are served with a trio of accoutrements: apricot mustardo, brandied cherries, and truffle honey. The Taleggio dipped in the truffle honey is a-MAZ-ing!   Next up, Reagan helped us with the extensive wine offerings, and we usually try something new, but on this visit we opted for a favorite, Quintarelli's Primofiore 2010. So good! Now it was time for some fritti: the brussel sprouts with Fresno chili and a little squeeze of lemon on top, these things are addicting, as is the fried ricotta.   Since there were three of us on this visit, we opted for two pastas served family style, the black spaghetti with calamari that my husband was craving and a special, papparadelle with mushrooms. My mouth waters just thinking of it... The fresh pasta is cooked perfectly al dente. The calamari in the black spaghetti is fresh and tender, and chef surprised us with the addition of shrimp (thank you!). The papparadelle with mushrooms has an wonderful earthiness and creaminess - really nice dish!  Our server, (JR or RJ?  I'm sorry I don't remember which!) recommended a rosemary & lemon gelato - thank you! The cake on the bottom was moist and flavorful, the gelato was refreshing, and the cookie on top was dusted with rosemary. Seriously?! Rosemary dust - how cool is that? I'm told Chef Denny came up with this one... Nicely done! The new GM, Matt, offered a tasting of Cardamaro, a wine-based amaro infused with cardoon and blessed thistle, and Matt was spot-on that it went with the rosemary lemon dessert. We would have finished everything if our bellies weren't so happily full. Thank you, Matt and your wonderful team!"}
{"text":"Las Vegas is Disneyland for adults and dining at Enoteca Otto Pizzeria in the Venetian is a pretty good representation of that.  Enoteca Otto Pizzeria has both indoor and outdoor (or pseudo outdoor) dining here.  To get the maximum faux design, you will want to eat in their outdoor dining area that is modeled after an Italian train station.  The pseudo outdoor area has nice tables.  At the center of the restaurant is a cylinder train tower that appears to be used for curing meats.  The canal shoppes surround this restaurant (fake buildings, statues that come to life and that blue sky, which I think looks better here than the skies at the Forum Shops or Paris).  Otto (as well as its surroundings) features that Disneyfied decor/atmosphere, but it also has the backing of a celebrity chef (Mario Batali).  We went here for lunch and the pricing was reasonable (when compared to the many overpriced Vegas restaurants).  Pizzas went about $18 while pastas were about $20 or less.  You would expect to pay at least that for most sit-down restaurants in nice Vegas casinos.  The complimentary bread was packaged crispy breadsticks followed by focaccia bread (with olive oil and balsamic vinegar).  Standard stuff.  We ordered the tomato, mozzarella, prosciutto, and arugula pizza.  This is one of the better pizzas Mario Batali and Nancy Silverton serve at Pizzeria Mozza in West Hollywood.  This pizza at Otto was okay but not great.  The pizzas had a thin and crispy crust, but it lacked both the flavor and the chewy and crispy texture of the Mozza crust.   The flavor of the pizza at Otto was okay.  It was a little salty, but that is kind of common with these prosciutto pizzas.  The pizza had too much tomato sauce as it oozed out with each bite.  We also had the Brussels sprouts with pancetta.  Brussels sprouts can be a little off-putting, but I have had good versions of it like the Brussels sprouts salad with vibrant fruit at The Bazaar or the tender Brussels sprouts with salty pancetta and creamy parsnip puree at AOC.  These Brussels sprouts were boring in flavor.  In addition, the pancetta was not good.  It did not really taste like pancetta.  Instead, it tasted like country ham.  While I was not a big fan of the flavor, they were definitely generous with the portion size.  Before ordering, the staff informed me that none of their pastas were housemade.  It was disappointing, but we forged ahead and went with a thick spaghetti dish that came with tomato, cured pork and onion.  Unfortunately, the pasta was served a little cold.  Also, the tomato sauce looked like it had dried on the spaghetti; it appeared that it had been sitting around for a while (it also had that appearance of re-heated pasta though I doubt the cooks would do that here).  The flavor was not that great.  It just tasted liked cold tomato sauce. There was not much of the pork and onion.  My friends really did not enjoy the dish and asked the server to remove the dish.  Not something I would do.  No matter how bad I usually eat whatever is put in front of me.  What can I say?  I am a good guest.  The staff did kindly remove the item off the bill without further discussion.  For dessert, they were out of our first choice (fried dates) so we settled on a scoop of housemade salted caramel gelato.  The gelato was not well presented.  They filled the gelato in a cold sundae cup.  There was not much gelato above the rim of the sundae cup though.  It was flat too--like someone had flattened the top with a spatula.  Despite the presentation, the gelato was actually quite good (and better than the gelato we had at Mario Batali's other and more expensive Vegas restaurant Carnevino).  The gelato was cold and creamy.  The flavor was good.  It was both salty and sweet.  They sprinkled some sea salt on it to give it a more pronounced salty taste.  Despite the salt flavor though, the sweetness of the caramel still came across.  Service was very good.  We were served by a waiter and a waitress. Both servers were dressed casually and they were friendly and funny but also polite and attentive.  After having mostly positive experiences at Mozza, I was hoping that Otto could become a good Vegas spot for tasty food at reasonable prices.  Unfortunately, most of the food here was average to below average.  Otto is definitely a Vegas restaurant in how it makes the most of its faux but still nice atmosphere.  Unfortunately, the food here is too similar to many other Vegas restaurants in how it is not worth the money and lacking in both flavor and quality ingredients.  Complimentary parking (including valet) is available at the Venetian Hotel."}
{"text":"Amazing food. The pizza is flawless. The pasta amazing. The ambiance, like ur in a town in Italy. We loved it. Actual Italian waiters."}
{"text":"This was an unexpected find! I've been to the other Italian restaurant next to this and didn't love it, so took a chance on Otto's. What a great experience!   The meats and cheeses are divine. If I could I would drown in their truffles honey - it's that good. The rigatoni with braised beef was absolutely perfect - the noodles had a great aldente bite to them. The Brie was also especially creamy and delicious. And while you're seated, Venice-type street performers sing and perform outside. It was fun! Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza; I had the potato, truffle, and fontina pizza. Vegetable sides were delicious. Good selection of wines at a fair price. Service was professional and fast.  I will come back next year. This is a good Italian option in Vegas where everything is overpriced."}
{"text":"Hands down the best, real italian food you could ever eat. My girlfriend and I eat here every time we visit las vegas, and ive been true to all of batalli's retaurants since living in New York. Every bite is loaded with flavor.. Now I gotta visit Mozza in LA!!!"}
{"text":"Been coming here for years & it never disappoints! The spaghetti & meatballs is amazing. Corn Pizza A +++. Service is excellent!"}
{"text":"After my mediocre experience at B&B I needed my faith restored in Mario Batali since the dishes I tried were good but nothing out of this world. I have been a fan of his for many years and was left disappointed with my dining experience at B&B. Otto is located in Plaza San Marco and has outside seating which adds to the ambience. Performers in the Plaza sing every couple of hours so we were lucky to catch one of the shows. First We ordered the Burrrata and cherry tomatoes which was amazing. The pesto added the perfect balance with the sweetness of the cherry tomatoes. We also ordered the Prosciutto de Parma which was thinly sliced and was a perfect match for the Burrata. Lastly we had the sausage and pepper pizza. The pizza crust was thin and crispy and the contrast of the spicy sausage and the sweet peepers was a great pairing of flavors. Thanks To Otto my faith has now been restored and all is well. This is a great place for a quick lunch or a nice dinner since there are other Italian dishes offered other than pizza."}
{"text":"Great lunch spot if you're not in the mood for something too fancy but better than the usual fast food place. I had the prosciutto and arugula pizza which tasted so fresh, light and wonderful. If you're not a big eater, I recommend splitting the pie with someone and if you're still hungry get an appetizer. The hostess sat us outside, so I got to enjoy the free opera show in the plaza. Overall prices were reasonable. My pie which can feed 2 ppl cost only $18. I would definitely come here for dinner too."}
{"text":"We'd eaten at the LA branches of the Mozza group and were excited to try the Vegas branch. It didn't disappoint!  The service was spot on from the second we walked in the door. They graciously seated us outside so my girls could see the show. I was happy to be sitting in. Piazza sipping an Aperol Spritz - very generously poured!  The kids Bolognese was one of the best I'd tasted! Our Prosciutto Arugula pizza was crispy and delicious, the truffled cheese gnudi were divine. But the star of the show was the deconstructed Key lime pie and the sampler of gelati! Ahhhh.... I'd just go for 2 big scoops of the slated caramel and the olive oil.  Don't miss this meal or location when in Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Great food and even better service!! The food was amazing, everything tasted so fresh.  The Gelato sampler was the best....loved the olive oil and sea salt Gelato, sounds odd, but it was my fav! The Blackened Spaghetti was sooo good! The pasta is made in house and the sauce you could tell was made from all fresh ingredients including almonds, which was a great addition."}
{"text":"Always love a lunch here. Fantastic food and good staff. Not sure why it rates lower than what I believe it should be."}
{"text":"Always my favorite for a relaxed lunch when I come. Even present when Mario and Joe did a dedication when Otto opened officially.  Enjoyed the food, staff and surroundings. Win or lose I come here.  You should to, and I am not employed by BnB."}
{"text":"It is a very, very rare occasion that I visit a restaurant that cooks their pasta al dente. The moment that fork touched my mouth with my spaghetti and meatballs, I knew the pasta deserved a resounding 5. It's excellent. Eat it. Enough said.  The bread/oil and vinegar are the only other thing I ate at this restaurant and they were also especially excellent. The rest of my party enjoyed black spaghettini and grilled chicken served over eggplant. The pasta dishes weren't too generous, but enough to make us full while the chicken dish was definitely enough for 2 people to share. No complaints on either of those. Both delicious.  The hostess up front was unfortunately annoying and our waitress was sub-par at best. The service isn't anything to write home about, but this place is definitely worth a try if you're looking to give yourself a belly full of al dente carbs!  Also... Look up. The painted clouds are fabulous and as long as you aren't hungover, the performances done in the square are even fun, enjoyable and entertaining."}
{"text":"OMG! If you have kids steer clear. No children's menu and they don't care... They make you feel like a big bother!"}
{"text":"If we would have had better (more attentive) service than our experience at Otto probably would have been a lot better as the food was decent.  None of us ordered a pizza because they looked good but a little too much for our appetite.  We all had various sorts of pasta and it was good but definitely not the best I've ever had.  We sat outside which I would recommend as there was a lot going on to watch and see."}
{"text":"I remember eating here a few years ago and I think I missed the whole point of this restaurant.  I had something very heavy with a glass of red wine and it was not just heavy, it sat in my stomach like lead.  On this visit, however, I wised up a bit and made my own lunch by selecting from their light bites menu.  I highly recommend this option, especially for lunch.  I had my salad fix by ordering arugula and nectarines and zucchini with parmesan on top.  Very yummy.  I got my meat fix by ordering the bresaola carved to order.  Yum.  And I ordered one of their vegetable pots.  These pots are served cold and there are several to choose from.    The service is impeccable and the staff really seems to enjoy their work.  There was a lot of smiling and laughing and joking without anything raucous going on.    I had two glasses of white wine and left feeling as if this was my favorite dining experience in Las Vegas in quite a while.  And that is weird because I have been to many celebrity chef restaurants in Vegas.  I was shocked and impressed by how simple the dishes were but how much care had been put into them.  Maybe that's why I was impressed, this restaurant was NOT like most of Vegas."}
{"text":"For a vegas restaurant ,  exceptional!  Had both great service and great food.  Shrimp linguine an pasta primavera excellent and a very nice by the glass wine selection.  Nice tuscans. High but Not too spendy vegas standards.  If you go and are a fan of asparagus, you MUST order theirs.  Perfect cook and a fresh sauce to die for - light, spicy with roasted almonds and hazelnuts.  I want it again now!  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Was taken here by my Dad because it was a Mario Batali restaurant.  The setting was awesome, inside of the never-dark Venetian Hotel.  The food was pretty good and the ambiance was nice.  I just think the menu was expensive.  Sorry, can't remember what I ate, but I do remember that the food was really good."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely phenomenal!! The service is outstanding. We received constant attention, service and hospitality every second of our dinner. The staff was so respectful and welcoming. Our server in particular, Kealoha, was extremely knowledgeable and professional.   Such a great place and atmosphere, can't wait to come back!  Thank you again for the awesome service!"}
{"text":"Me and my hubby came for our anniversary, we shared a pear walnut salad... Wow it was the best.."}
{"text":"Batali was smart to change the name to Otto, it's much easier to say and remember than the mouthful prior: Enoteca San Marco.    A few tweaks need to be made: -Get rid of the hostess, she's the face of the resto, seriously?  I was too tired and hungry to complain.   -Gemelli w/house sausage and broccoli rabe needs to have a lighter sauce and a lighter hand w/the sodium, $18  LOVED the: -Cavatappi, $21, loved the light tomato sauce and the lamb ragu.  Pasta perfectly al dente.  OK: -Smashed Fried Potatoes, $7, nice fragrant rosemary, some of the spuds could have been crunchier and it would have been nice to know the type of potatoes, as there were two served.  Wine is pretty pricey at about $15/4oz pour.  Nice selection.    FREE entertainment at the heart of the square.  Great post outlet shopping refuel."}
{"text":"Loved the food here, it was our first stop for lunch upon arrival into Vegas.   The menu there is very easy to share and taste with a group of people or solo.  My favorite was the Preserved Tuna, beans and lemon salad, rich in flavors of olive oil, lemon and basil. I could eat that alone. For our main entree we shared a Truffle pizza,  (white pizza with fontina and real shavings of black truffles), the flavor combo was rich and very satisfying."}
{"text":"Worst meal I had while in Vegas.  I ordered the pasta & meatballs.  The waiter told me it was a LITTLE spicy.  He was way off.   Even the pasta was spicy.  My lips were numb after a couple of bites.  I ordered coffee.  When I asked for a refill I was informed that there were no free refills & I would need to pay an additional $4.00 for another cup of coffee.  Would not recommend this eatery."}
{"text":"I really like Mario Batali, but Otto really didn't live up to his name.  My friends and I dropped by because we were shopping and had a hunger attack.  It's located in an indoor plaza, designed to look like the streets of Italy.  Beautiful location and lots to look at.    Overall, we had a good experience.  Ordered a few pasta dishes and a pizza.  However, it didn't leave a lasting impression.  What I remember is that portions are small, so don't eat here if you are famished.  If you do, order a dish you can all share in addition to the food -- like a pizza.  Worth checking out once to say that I've been there and ate that, but I'm not sure if it's worth another visit."}
{"text":"This was our third and final dinner on a recent trip to Vegas. After exquisite meals at Yellowtail and Scarpetta, we were ready to be impressed (in a more casual setting) by Mario Batali's joint.   Finding the place was our first hassle. The Venetian could use some updated signage. Finally someone told us to \"bear left at the canal\" and we were on our way. We arrived in a quintessentially Vegas setting: a pseudo piazza with a few designer shops and restaurants. After two meals overlooking the Bellagio fountains, this was totally mediocre. We took our \"outdoor\" seats and reviewed the menu.  Once we picked our food, we placed our orders in one of the most irritating interactions with a waiter I've ever had. When I ordered the arugula salad to start, he said to me, \"Do you know that arugula is bitter... are you sure you want it?\" Wtf? I guess we were in Vegas where folks from all walks of life, including those that never encounter arugula, eat out. I guess he was trying to be helpful. Mostly I was insulted by having to explain that I do in fact know what arugula is and do in fact want to eat it.  Then I ordered the gnoccho fritto as part of our fried appetizer. Again, the waiter explains what it is as though it's definitely not what I have in mind and possibly won't like it. I don't care what it is. I want to try it.  Then I ordered the gemelli for myself with their housemade sausage and broccoli rabe. AGAIN, \"Do you know what broccoli rabe is? A lot of people don't know.\" Yep, I know what broccoli rabe is. Thanks!   Yadda yadda, other than the above mentioned experiences, the food was pretty solid. We asked for the bread and received it half way through our entrees (and no olive oil to speak of, though I guess we should have been more clear about that). The fried stuff was fried stuff. It should have come with more sauces for dippin'. The arugula salad was tasty, but there was nothing particularly special about it. The girl who brought our wine commented, \"I love that salad. It's so... simple.\" Indeed.  My pasta was delicious. I scarfed down the whole plate, which was impressive given the massive amounts of fried food I'd just had. The housemade sausage was spot on, and the broccoli rabe was plentiful and well-prepared. My sister had the pesto pizza and loved it, though I thought it was a bit too rich and couldn't imagine eating much of it. My mom had the bucatini and loved it, as well.   If you find yourself near this place, give it a try. But don't go out of your way. They have some work to do in the service department, and maybe they should just write out explanations on the menu if customers are frequently confused about arugula and broccoli rabe. I say spend a little more and do Scarpetta instead if you have time to plan."}
{"text":"This place was disappointing on many levels. Tried the only two beers they had, the first (Mario beer) tasted worst than miller lite. And the other was $21 for a pint of mediocre beer. The pizza sauce tasted like raw tomatoes. A good pizzeria should make sure the sauce is cooked properly. The desert was another thing. I ordered two types of gelato and they told me they wanted to charge me more if they serve them separately!? WTF? Oh and you can't change or alter any menu item because the great Mario wants it served a certain way.   I won't be back here ever again."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to dine at in Vegas!  First off, it's located in Saint marks square in the Venetian. It has \"outside\" patio seating and indoor wine rooms. The decor is warm and home-y and it has a live show with a band that plays classical music every hour. The ceilings are around 80 feet and they're beautifully painted and they resemble clouds so it feels as if you're outside! The food and service are both spectacular!  I have tried the braised pork shoulder and it was so tender and flavorful and the cucumber salad on top was great! I also had the rigatoni pasta with veal and it was so rich and hearty. The veal was cooked to perfection and it was very savory! I also tried the caprese salad which was to die for. It was during a time that they had cherry tomatoes in season and I liked the sweetness of it. The deserts they had to offer were also so amazing! They had pistachio and olive oil gelato and it was so creamy and amazing!  The service was great! Everyone on staff from the managers to the servers and even the hosts were all so kind and warm!  I love this place and want to continue coming back for as long as possible!"}
{"text":"This is my first time here, it may be my last. I'm a huge fan of Batali! I've even been to his mom's shop Salumi in Seattle because I admire this guy but I have to say I was really disappointed with this pizza.   I think to tell how good a pizza place is you have to try the Margarita Pizza due to its simplicity and freshness of the ingredients which should be used. This has to be the saltiest pizzas I've ever had in my life. The sauce was probably the saltiest. Horribly disappointing! SMH. We even started off with a meat plater and allowed the waitress to select the meats for us. Biggest mistake ever. Nothing was memorable.   I kept it simple and ordered the house wine. It was good. One of the best house cabs i've ever had.   We got the bill and found that the wine I bought was $20/Glass. Seriously? I could've ordered my own glass! Wow. If we subtract the glass from the tab then it was reasonable. Around $50 for a appetizer and pizza was decent for a Batali restaurant. Batali - you have salted my last pizza. Needs work. Has Batali even came here to taste his food yet or is he busy spending time at Carnevino. Which is fabulous BTW."}
{"text":"The summer I lived in New York, I visited Otto as often as possible, taking advantage of the $4 vegetable pots that combined to make excellent light take-out dinners. I remember getting little containers filled with beets and rabe and mushrooms, and eating them alone in Washington Square Park. This Otto is less affordable than the original--even New York can't rip you off quite like Vegas--but it's equally pleasant, with excellent food and a casual, friendly ambiance.  Otto is in the Venetian, in the central spot formerly occupied by Enoteca San Marco, which was more or less Otto by another name. You dine faux al fresco, under the painted Venetian sky, and you yield to the gleeful corniness of your surroundings. My husband and I came for a late dinner, right off a Friday night flight to Vegas. We had a reservation, but it looked like we could've walked in. Our waiter Eli L. was excellent. He took his time recommending both food and wine, and attended to all our needs with warmth and absolute competence.  We drank red wine by the glass--Montepulciano and Barbera--and indulged in a wonderful meal. There was fresh bread with olive oil and balsamic, and we ordered a big spread of starters. We got prosciutto di Parma and coppa, which were both excellent, as well as a plate of gooey taleggio served with black truffle honey and syrup-stewed cherries and apricots. We also got a pot of Otto pickles, which overflowed with baby carrots, cauliflower, fennel, radish, and turnip, all crisp and zippy with brine. Feeling extra indulgent, fresh off the plane, we got the caprese with oven-roasted cherry tomatoes, pesto, and milky burrata. Entrees were probably unnecessary at this point, but we did finish our pastas with alacrity. I had the linguini special, cooked a nice al dente with shrimp, garlic, and chile. My husband had the tagliatelle with butternut squash, brown butter, and sage. This one was too sweet for me, but he liked it. We ended this decadent meal with a bowl of sorbet and gelato--huckleberry, lemon, and olive oil, all perfect and perfect together.  Dinner was expensive, but that tends to happen in Vegas, and I thought it was very worthwhile. The food, service, and atmosphere were all on point, and I'd recommend Otto to anyone looking to sit down to a good Italian meal."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant twice during my visit to Vegas.  The first time everything went well.  But the second night we ate here our server, Sabrina, had a really bad attitude.  Maybe she didn't want to be at work that day.  However, we did inform the manager and he didn't seem to care much.  We ate our appetizer and visited another restaurant to continue our dinner.  I was pretty amazed that Mario Batali would associate his name with such a horrible restaurant."}
{"text":"Some reviewers have adored Otto Enoteca.  I think that they \"Otto\" get their heads examined.  (sorry, I couldn't help it)  On their side, the pizza was thin, crispy, and as close to real Neapolitan pizza as I've had in a long time.    Other than that, the service was fair to good:  the place was very busy, but service was kind of slow and bordering on not attentive - long waits between the waiter's visits to our table.    Dinner was longer than we wanted, and it felt even longer due to the setting at \"St. Mark's Square.\"  I realize that many people find the the fake street scene environment at the Venetian to be novel and even charming.     However, to me, the location was simply not relaxing - loud echoes like a gym full of people, lots of people.  The music of the amplified \"acoustic\" street performers sounded like it was in an echo chamber - the \"sky\" was vaulted and reflected any sound below.  People-watching was interesting, but only one or two steps above the freak show on the strip, with the typical bachelorette parties in crotch length dresses, wasted dudes re-enacting The Hangover, and tee shirt covered pot bellies.  In short, a lot of American tourists.  This kind of sucked the charm factor down to near empty.  Ultimately, it was a mall...  in Las Vegas.  And was a big mall.  Entering through Palazzo might have provided a shorter path to the restaurant.  As it was, the walk through the Venetian shops was looooong - both in and out.     To summarize, the food was good, but it was pricey.   However, with lack-luster service in a setting that I found to be harsh, I don't need to return."}
{"text":"|                ***VEGAS WE HAVE A PROBLEM ***  I wrote them a letter about how sick I got after eating there and general manager Paulo Duran followed up with me as soon as he got back from a few days off to offer profuse apologies and assurances that this is the first time that this happened and that it would never happen again.  Here is the back story: I am a celiac and am careful to the point of being anal. I spent 15 minutes on Monday night going over the menu with the two women at the reception desk. I was told that they have gluten-free pasta for most dishes and that the homemade sausage is also gluten-free.  For my Thursday lunch I ordered the gemelli with house sausage and broccoli rabe, made gluten free by substituting GF pasta. The server returned to my table several times to let me know it was taking a long time because they boil a fresh pot of water for all gluten-free orders to prevent cross-contamination.  My order was not delivered by my waiter, but by someone else. She said it was gemelli without cheese. I said that mine is supposed to be gluten-free and not without cheese. She said that she made a mistake and it was gluten-free and she would bring cheese to my table.  Right after lunch I picked up my luggage and left for the airport, giving myself plenty of time to catch up on work in the Amex Centurion lounge before my 7:00 flight.   As I was walking to the lounge I felt queasy and knew I was starting to have a major celiac reaction - which I did for the next 3 hours. Anna took very good care of me letting me lie down in the children's room with a cold compress on my head.  After talking to the chef and several employees, Paulo determined that there WERE two special orders of gemelli at lunch; one gluten-free and one with no cheese. I got the wrong one and paid the price. He said they are very, VERY careful with food allergies but something went wrong at the last moment - and he is determined to ensure that it doesn't happen again.  Okay, so I will give them another chance when I am next in Vegas. Paulo - thank you so much for your follow up."}
{"text":"We dine here every time we go to Vegas. Consistently great in every way. The Christmas carolers in the Venetian were annoying as heck but they were not related to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Incredible is the only way to describe the food. I had pasta carbonara which was cooked to perfection. My wife had the lightest gnocchi I ever had. Wonderful service. We waited two minutes for our table at 6:15 when it was fairly busy. Definitely a place to go. A bit pricey but worth every penny of it."}
{"text":"Our experience at Otto's was mixed. They brought the breadsticks that are imported from Italy. We ask for bread, which came with no butter or oil. They brought oil after we ask. I has the braised pork shoulder and would give it a five. The apple reduction was out of this world. My wife had spaghetti with pepper and butter. It was just average. I ordered Lemoncello and it was terrible. I sent back and the waiter said the bar tender did not shake it up. The second glass was better, but still not good. I would not recommend. We share the three flavored of Gelato and we only found two favors and they were just OK, again I wouldn't reorder. Our service was good. The prices were high, but for what I have seen of Las Vegas, they were about right."}
{"text":"So.... Like other low rating reviewers I join in with the same complaint. A restaurant obviously existing due to celebrity association, food is mediocre in quality, service is ok and the wine list is acceptable though. That is not enough. I went to B&B tonight hesitantly because it was serving later than anywhere else. It was so amazing so I had to write up how bad Otto was.... And under the same chef names. Joe B.... Really? Otto needs a major overhaul. Sticky tables, pepperoni pizza none of the four kids at the table would touch ( and then the grown ups too). Not even a question from the waiter as for why a pizza is not touched in a table of eight. The meatballs are bland, the chicken tastes like a Greek souvlaki, the mushroom appetizer bland as well.  Very disappointed."}
{"text":"This place was packed, but we were able to get a seat at the bar without waiting, which was cool. It was odd that it wasn't a regular bar, just people making the food, but I wasn't complaining.  I started with the arugula with shaved parmigiano, and while the salad was very green and the cheese awesome, I felt it was underdressed. It was decent, though.  I went with the pancetta and goat cheese pizza and it was out of control delicious. The cheese and meat were both cooked perfectly, and the pizza was so crispy that I was in heaven. I forced myself to eat every piece. My friend went with the margherita pizza and he loved it, too.  The service was just okay.. we ordered drinks, then food, and our drinks came out with our meal. After we finished, nobody stopped to see us, and after 15 minutes of waiting (we were on a little compressed timeline.. not too bad, but I was itching to get to an event), I stopped a server that wasn't mine. I hate doing that, but they were nice. The prices were pretty good all things considered.  However, I also have to give mention to who I believe to be the manager. I forgot to take my receipt with me for reimbursement, and when I came back, she moved mountains for me, going through all of the restaurant's receipts and making a copy. It probably took 20 minutes of her day and I appreciate it so much!"}
{"text":"If you like rustic italian than this is for you! We were seated in the wine room in which you were surrounded by wine, very nice. The server was good nothing special to note. They gave us our drinks and a 2 packages of bread sticks laid on the table. No olive oil, no butter, no bread basket etc. Okay fine, i'm not here for bread sticks bring on the pizza! I savored the buffalo mozzarella plate it was so small it seemed to tease more than anything else. The pizza was typical wood oven thin crust pizza. Overall it was good but I am spoiled by having great pizza in Providence, RI."}
{"text":"I had such high hopes for Batali's Otto, and left very disappointed!  The location is fun in the promenade of the Venetian so it is great for people watching.  The wine list and  menu seems impressive but the service was just AWFUL!  I received a dirty small plate to share our burrata and tomato appetizer.  It was visibly dirty, looked like it was stained with someone else's balsamic vinegar.  A server took the plate away and quickly replaced it , so I tried to forget about it.  Then for my main course, as I am enjoying my tuna steak I notice a small black hair on my plate.  It was clearly not my own, and I showed the waiter who took it away.  While he offered to get me something else, my appetite was lost at this point. It is a shame since the wine was great and my bf was happy with his food, but the overall quality of service is just not acceptable, especially for a chef who I greatly admire.  I would only return for wine and still think they should have comped a dessert or something for us given our experience."}
{"text":"Really a 4.5, but not a 5. My stars:  (5=epic \"best of\") (4=really tasty and want to go again and again) (3=good and will go back once in a while) (2=fair, might return for a visit if there was some glimmer of hope) (1=avoid at all costs)  Go or No?  Go!  Tease:  Iron Chef, Mario Batali's small Italian Pizzeria and café in the Venetian casino.   Why I went:  We were in the mood for a nice lunch before flying home and this seemed as good as any to try.  We love his place Mozza in LA, so why not give it a whirl?  When: 11/20/12, we went for lunch early.  It looks like it could get crowded.  It wasn't when we went.  Food:  For drinks, I had a really solid spicy Bloody Mary ($14), and my wife had a tasty glass of Lambrusco ($12).  We enjoyed an app of olives, and 1 cheese that were exceptional!  The olives were good, but the cheese was amazing!  Sadly, I can't recall the exact one...but it was a harder Italian cheese served with the most ridiculously tasty truffle honey we've ever had!  We over-ordered so that we could take some food home with us...  We had a pepperoni pizza.  Very good...but not Mozza good!  Nancy Silverton's influence on the crust in Mozza is apparent when comparing it to Otto.  There just is no comparison!  However, the pork shoulder and the buccatini Amatriciana were SUPER good!  The pork shoulder at $26 isn't inexpensive, but it's worth every penny!  It's Mario's signature dish and is packed with flavor.  Also, the pasta was simply perfectly prepared.  It had some nice spice and was so good...I overate and finished it!  The pasta was $19 as was the pizza.  All reasonable given the quality.    Service:  Good.  Cruz T. did a fine job serving us.  Hints/Final thoughts:  Get the cheeses, apps, pastas...and pork shoulder!  Save the pizza for elsewhere.  It's good, and if you are craving it, it does the trick.  But if you've been to Mozza...don't expect similar."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere is great ! Sat outside on patio. Good service . We had a good time there . Food calamari was good! Pizzas yummy !!"}
{"text":"This is the lower end of Italians restaurants go in the Venetian, but since it is the Venetian is still isn't that cheap either.  It's far from \"fine dinging\" but maybe a step above casual as well.  The bread was good and so was the service.  But with the food it seems like they were just not trying too hard.  The food has always been good, but not too amazing, just decent.  A lot of it looking like it came out of a can and was Microwaved.  Mario Batali's name is plastered over the place, but  it seems like many of the Vegas restaurants in Vegas where the famous chef might have came up with the fancy sounding names on the menu, cashes his check and disappeared.  Plus, they are very pushy on the wine, which looks to be where the money is.  Don't order wine, don't expect to see your waiter much  Some of the other reviews kinda hint at fake Italian for tourists, but it's Vegas, is is pretty much all \"Fake ____ for tourists.\"  This is clearly that, though.  It's not great, it's just not good and far from authentic or exciting.  I suppose it is still good food and a decent atmosphere, but you can do better, especially in Vegas."}
{"text":"I loved how the menu was set up with lots of small plates and many vegetable options.  The portions were small and perfect for sharing.  The spicy broccoli, eggplant Milanese and grilled radicchio were very tasty. My spicy bucatini pasta was outstanding and the perfect size.  We left full but not stuffed.  Nice decor and great for people watching. I did not care for how the wine list wad set up and some of the prices were ridiculous even for Vegas.  Food prices were in line with quality.  Recommend."}
{"text":"The food is rustic and delicious. The wine is varied and not to over priced. However, the best part of the meal was the service. Kudos to the servers, the bus boys and the manager."}
{"text":"Okay I'm currently sitting here for over an hour.. have not received any food since ordering.. the people next to me receive their food and are practically done.. ONLY thing positive is that my water has been refilled every time it goes down. So props to that. But seriously.. I'm about to leave. This is ridiculous. If you want to wait an hour for okay food, be my guest. But who wants to for place that forgets about you completely. Oh and to top it off guess what I ordered that took an hour to make.. grilled chicken with olive oil broccoli.. yeah lovely.   Update got my food. It looks pretty but tastes super bland.."}
{"text":"Absolutely by far my best meal in Vegas! Loved our waiter JR sweet guy...great recommendations. My meatball pizza left a flavor in my mouth screaming for more...what was in that? Mmmmm....The dark chocolate desert was by far the best I've ever..ever...EVER had and I'm a big time foodie!"}
{"text":"To be sure you're impressed and don't forget who created this menu, a picture of Mr. Mario Batali greets you as you arrive.   The Good: The waiters were pretty snappy and overall, the service was on par. The atmosphere was pleasant after a day of running around Vegas. It was plenty quiet enough to have a conversation with people sitting across an 8 top round table. The lights in the very high ceiling were turned down as well which made the entire experience relaxing. The Italian wine selection is extensive.   The Bad: Independent of price, this restaurant is over rated. Price adjusted, it is out right poor. The quality of the pasta is at best Olive Garden. The portions were small. The pizza (the 'Truffle') which I would give at best a 3/5 was the best part."}
{"text":"Service was good and appetizer ,Caprese,was good !!so thought we were off to good start. And the Venetian is a very cool place to hang.  Husbands Ravolis were ok and overpriced of course (it's vegas!$$$$$) My dish was interesting,Rigatoni Allan Napolitana...kept having flashbacks to my husband's Irish Lamb stew he made for St. Patty.   Wasn't a fan of the dish at all.     If a well known chef star has his name tied to something I'd hope it would be good ?! Overall been sorely disappointed with the nicer dinning places in Vegas.  From now on think we'll stick to the lower priced options, pubs, bar food etc."}
{"text":"Mario Mario another city another restaurant.  I would give this a four but on principal I can't because it's another Mario Batali place.  Hey I love the guy but in a way I have to say this is a little like rating Chili's but they call it Wili's.  Anyway ate their while I was at a trade show in Vegas.  In all honesty I like the place a lot.  What I liked most about it is that they have a very good selection of Italian cheese.  Which I love and they have Broccli Rabe which I love more.  Sat at the bar by myself after a god awful day at the trade show.  Had a nice glass of wine which they sell by the ounce. I thought I was back in high school buying  pot but the selection was great and while worth it.  The staff at the bar was atentive but not the best.  All in all a fun time but Mario knows how to do that.  Check out Eataly.  OK it really is a four."}
{"text":"I was honestly disappointed with the pizza here. I've been to Italy and had authentic Italian pizza and this wasn't like the pie I had in Naples or anywhere in Italy. The crust was more like a cracker than a pizza crust. I had the Margheritta pizza which would've been good had it not been for the sub par crust. The mozzarella, sauce and the basil leaves were delicious and fresh. I did have an awesome salad here with arugula and prosciutto. That along with the setting in the grand canal make it worth a try."}
{"text":"After being seated and waiting approximately 15 min I was never acknowledged - no bread, water or greeting. Next...."}
{"text":"I was a big fan of the restaurant that used to be in this spot.  The current Batali and Bastianich pizzeria that took over did not disappoint our group of six.  The pizzas (the Romana and a sweet onion w/ proscuitto!) were delicious, the salads excellent and the deep fried cauliflower was awesome.  Only complaint - it wasn't at all busy and everything seemed to take forever!"}
{"text":"One of the nicer spots on Vegas; Otto offers outdoor seating (indoor ;)  There is usually a performance in the courtyard that can be entertaining. Our server (Riva, i think) was fantastic and very well acquainted with the menu. The service in general was very good here.  The food: lets start with the desert - the dark chocolate item on the menu is a must get. The gelato is delicious! The bread pudding is picture perfect; however it was a bit dry (compared to others I've had).  The appetizers - The fried cauliflower was delicious and decent quantity to share with atleast 3/4 people. The Pan e formaggio served here was really just fried cheese balls, this was not that great and I wish they had stuck with the bread and cheese slices.  After all of that, there was no room for the main course ;) Kidding. The cauliflower pizza was ok, ask about their specials."}
{"text":"A best an average pizza. Ordered a $21 Margarita Pizza. The prevention was nice with large fresh basil leafs arranged on top. However, the red sauce was far to sweet. It tasted like sugar. I could not taste the cheese or the basil. Just tasted like frozen bread dough rolled out with sugary sweet red sauce on top. If a pizza place can't get a plain pizza right, they can't get anything right. Skip this place. Hidden Pizza at Aria is much better"}
{"text":"3 stars sounds brutal, but really it comes down to the food. I'm a big foodie, and I love Mario Batali's other restaurants.   I'm totally a big fan but this particular restaurant is his lower end, budget type, not so special place. For what it is, and what it's trying to be, it's ok. But if you're in town for a great Italian meal, then do not come here.  - caprese salad: they use cherry tomatoes (which I've never seen done), and instead of fresh basil, there's a pesto mix blended in  Not your traditional caprese, and not different in a good way. Budget style. - prosciutto & arugula pizza: great crust, good sauce & topping ratio, but the prosciutto was extra oily & salty. I've had this before at other restaurants and it doesn't taste this way. Also, the arugula should be generous and crispy/fresh. This wasn't  - veal lasagne: not enough cheese, or sauce. needs more fresh herbs/spices. It tasted bland and just not delicious.   It's hard to believe any MB restaurant isn't delicious, but believe it. This is a pass. You're better off a at Olive Garden for the same price."}
{"text":"The Venetian has more choices than you can imagine, so we were very happy to dine here - and I just don't give out five stars, but we really had no complaints.  Even when we were walking around, the staff was very pleasant, even handing us a menu to review instead of reading the board.  Our server was Eli and he was great.  He recommended a couple fresh fruit drinks for us (non-alcoholic), some special strawberries mix and a blood orange juice and both were much better than described.  My husband got spaghetti and meatballs and the meatballs were small and very tasty and there were alot - he said he almost could not finish his portion and we did not eat the bread they served us when we ordered.  I ordered the Caprese salad - the cherry tomatoes, basil and pesto all came from local farmers - one of the best salads I have had - the aromas and flavors were so fresh.  I also ordered the Artichoke Bruschetta - an excellent choice.  Lots of flavor just holding it up before the first bite!  The flavors were very balanced and I brought 1/2 home - still very good hours later as the bread was nicely toasted and thick enough to hold up to the ingredients.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"Let me say if the service would have been better I would have given them 5 stars. The food was fantastic, i had one of the pizzas with goat cheese and pancetta and my husband had the pasta with homemade sausage...both were fantastic. We split the dark chocolate dessert which is great as well. I think we just had a server who was just not attentive....every other server seemed in point. I would recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Had the prosciutto and arugula pizza, plus a sausage and peppers. Both excellent. Great location in the Venetian, and there was even entertainment at 6. Was skeptical about the Italian lager, but it was great."}
{"text":"I got the sunchokes pesto penne. It was good, but didn't quite blow me away. I liked that the pesto was a really light walnut, celery pesto, so it wasn't overly creamy and filling. I normally absolutely love sunchokes, but these were just chunks of roasted sunchokes. They were also a bit too tough to go with the pasta. I would have liked them to be roasted a bit more, to the point where they're really creamy and almost \"melty\". I though that would have complimented the pasta in terms of texture a bit better. It was odd to have to stop, cut the sunchoke (with some difficulty), and then continue eating. Roast it a bit longer, and then it will probably just seamlessly meld in with the rest of the dish - and be a bit easier to cut through!"}
{"text":"In Vegas for a convention, and didn't make reservations at the better places early enough, but found room at Mario Batali's casual Italian place.     The location is nice, especially when dining alone, as it in St. Marks square in  the Venetian, so you can get a seat on the edge of the patio and people watch.  The service was very friendly and prompt.  They have an extensive wine list.    I ordered Orecchiette \"little ears\" pasta with house made sausage and their take on arancini.  The dishes were basic and ok, but nothing special.  The best thing of the evening was the nice glass of  Montepulciano wine I selected for myself."}
{"text":"Food was over priced and not great.  Service was slow and not knowledgeable.  The tables were very close together so it felt very crowded. I had to keep moving my chair for people to walk by.  Don't bother going here."}
{"text":"Great food great service. Olive oil made Fettuccini pasta was great! The sweet bruschetta wasn't that tasty. But overall a great place."}
{"text":"This was our second trip to this amazing restaurant. It seems by the location, it's a casual place that you'd get moderately good food but actually once you are there you receive 5 star service with what I feel is some of the very best Italian food on the strip. I would recommend it for a romantic date or as our last trip was a large group celebrating Birthdays! The pizza is amazing but the pasta dishes should not be overlooked. I highly recommend indulging in the salumi and cheese platter options! There are great cocktail options and an extensive wine list as well. We won't take a trip to Vegas again without carving out at least one night for dinner here."}
{"text":"Showed up at Otto's for a quick and tasty dinner with my parents during their first time visiting Vegas. They all wanted different things to eat so I figure this place would be it and suit all their taste buds. I am a HUGE pizza lover so I was excited to eat here. The husband and I decided to order the truffle pizza ($25) that has fontina and potato on it. The cheese is the bel paese kind which is mild in flavor. I was hoping the pizza itself would be more truffle-y. The dough was good, the crust was flaky but it just lacked that truffle taste in my opinion. It was a light hint of taste cmon! More truffle please."}
{"text":"This place was highly recommended by a friend who lives in Vegas and eats out a lot. I thought well, if this is the place he recommends above all then we must go.   It's a bit of a labyrinth to find in the indoor walkways and canals but worth it!!  Incredible wine list, spot on service and I think the stuffed squash blossom apps were my favorite. Or the meatball pizza. Or, oh wait this pasta with peas, truffles, mushrooms and prosciutto. Yep - that was my favorite!!!"}
{"text":"I really wanted a good pizza on my last night in Vegas, but sadly was disappointed at Enoteca Otto pizzeria. Should have known better than to expect authentic pizza in a major tourist area!  Oh, well!  I had the prosciutto/arugula pizza and my hubby had the pancetta/goat cheese. The pizza crust was thin but not flavorful and the sauce was too tangy for my taste.   I'm Italian-American and have been to Italy several times and this pizza is not what Italians consider acceptable!  Oh, by the way-I ordered Prosecco and was served in a wine glass-not a flute. Picky, I know-but they are not shy about charging top dollar for inauthentic experience!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food~amazing octopus salad. The ambiance is great, a 3 piece instrumental band plays while you eat. Marisa our waitress was great. She was very knowledgeable and loves her job for sure, which makes all the difference in service. Even the chef comes out and talks to the tables. Black pasta was great along with the cheese tray. Not a tourist trap, just a great restaurant!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a couple of pasta dishes one evening here. It was busy but we were seated right away. Our waiter was slow trough out the service but the rest of the staff was great. I had the Rigatoni Ragu Napolitana with veal and pork and perfectly cooked pasta. It was good but didn't really wow me at all. My wife had the Gemelli with sausage and broccoli rabe. I tried it and again good but nothing that I would ohh and ahh about. She cared for it even less. I did enjoy sitting it the pretend outdoor cafe and being able to watch all the goings on in the square. We shared a simple dessert of vanilla gelato with espresso over it which was tasty. Overall I would say I was a little disappointed. I'd probably go back and try the pizza though."}
{"text":"I'm really not sure what to say about this place. We had a LOT of good food here, but there were some disappointments.  We started with the croquettes and squash blossoms off of the fritti menu-- both were excellent. I would definitely recommend the squash blossoms. We also had the roasted beets, a small arugula and Parmesan salad, and the prosciutto. These were all good as well. Finally, we had three of the cheeses-- I let the waiter pick those, and I don't remember what they were, but they were amazing, and they come with some delicious accompaniments-- honey, some cherries, and some dried apricots.  Then there was the pizza. Meh. My husband really liked it, but I consider myself to be a pizza connoisseur, and I was completely underwhelmed. The crust was very very thin-- think cracker, with a tomato sauce, and a little dollop of mozzarella on each slice. It was not great.  My biggest problem was the server. Every time I ordered something it was like he was questioning my order... for instance: Me: I'd like the margherita pizza please. Server: OK, that has a very thin crust with sauce and one piece of cheese on each slice.  Me: I'd like the roasted beets please. Server: You mean you don't want to try the lentils or the eggplant? Both are very good.  Me: I'd like the arugula salad please. Server: OK, well that has some arugula with shaved Parmesan and it is VERY simple.  Do you see what I mean? Annoying. Yes I did actually read the menu before I ordered these things.  Overall, the food was good, but I doubt we'll be coming back."}
{"text":"I came here with a group of friends on our trip to Vegas - there were 9 of us. The decor and service of this place is great. Our server always came back to ask us if we needed any help or recommendations. She recommended two alcoholic beverages (the Blood Orange Martini & the Bellini), both of which some got, but were NOT satisfied. Maybe our taste buds weren't up there, but it certainly didn't taste as delectable as our waitress made it seem.   Next, we got the cheese platter which had everything from soft, medium and hard cheeses. Our server explaining the right way to eat the cheeses (with apricots, cherries, etc.). All the cheeses were delicious [it went great paired with the wine]. For dinner, I got the Penne Carbonara, which was pretty standard. It had pieces of eggplant and basil, which I thought was great. For dessert, my friend got the in-house gelato (vanilla bean & olive oil gelato). OLIVE OIL GELATO!? is probably what you are thinking, but some how the flavors work and it actually tasted like olive oil. It wasn't too creamy or heavy, it hit the spot :)   Also, at the end of our meal; the manager or someone that worked at Otto came and gave us complimentary discounted tickets for TAO nightclub (which is actually where we were headed after our meal). Overall, great service, decor & food. Check this place out when you visit Las Vegas next!"}
{"text":"Terrible place! My dad has dietary restrictions due to his heart and they would not accommodate him at all! It was like pulling teeth to get anything. Terrible service! Don't go!!!"}
{"text":"We shared a Margherita pizza and an arugula salad.  The salad was very good, but the pizza was not.  And it took forever for the pizza to come out when the restaurant wasn't full.  Sorry, but we won't be going back."}
{"text":"The worst tiramisu I have ever eaten.  During my nth trip to Vegas... In between gambling and eating..I was craving tiramisu.  Landed up in Venetian and a there were a number of Italian restaurants to choose from.  Picked Otto at random The tiramisu was horrible. The cream was tasting like butter in my mouth and the lady fingers were so gross :(  Not going back here for dessert for SURE"}
{"text":"The prices are to be expected in Vegas and the portions were a good size.  Can't say that I necessarily enjoyed the food here though.  It is a nice place located in the shopping and dining area of the connecting Venetian and Palazzo hotels and it has a spectacular view of the indoor but what looks to be the outdoor sky.  The service was simply wonderful as I did go with a group.  They were very respectful of the group and even split our bill for each individual person with a pen and own check book for each.  I was quite impressed that they didn't have the typical look of resentment that many other restaurants do when they have to split bills, so they get an A+ for customer service! I would go back just because the service was amazing. 1-5 Scale - (5 being A+) Quantity - 4 Quality - 3 Price - 3"}
{"text":"Terrible service.  Granted, My husband and i are a huge iron chef and food network fan and had high expectations for the place because we thought Mario batalli's restaurant would impress.  My hubby and I had a pancetta pizza and beef ravioli. They were both prepared well and tasted delicious but both were luke warm at best.  The back waiter gave us bread without olive oil and balsamic we saw him pour for at least 3 other tables.  Our waiter left us unattended for at least a half hour and didn't bring our drinks until after the appetizer.  We asked for additional bread to finish our ravioli sauce but it was forgotten.  With high prices like this I expect great tasting food and attentive service.  Disappointing."}
{"text":"Food is generally good. Typically has a small wait for seating. I being a vegetarian don't usually find many choices. Same was the case here but they were willing to customize the dish. I have eaten there twice. Here is what I learnt, if you customize the dish they don't get the order correctly, at least the first time. :) I still like the food so would go again."}
{"text":"Had birthday dinner for my dad here tonight. Our server Miguel was attentive and friendly. The food here was decent but Miguel just made our experience.   The pizzas are thin and crispy crusted. The toppings are great but the flavor and grease level took away from the taste. Broccoli pizza was dripping in grease. Sausage and peppers wasn't bad but kinda bland. We had the bruschetta app and it was delicious, but it had way too much arugula. Bucatini amatriciana was very salty and lacking in flavor sadly. Usually my favorite dish at an Italian restaurant. Dessert sorbets were good. Lemon orange and hazelnut flavors were a hit with my family. Not the best Italian food around but a great place to come nonetheless."}
{"text":"Nothing special. Just overpriced pizza.  Awesome atmosphere right in St. MARY'S square at the Venetian-Palazzo."}
{"text":"Excellent ... Excellent ... Excellent!  Everything I had was just over-the-top excellent.    The Bruschetta was fab.  The pizza was fab.  The moscato was ice cold!"}
{"text":"Awww. Was so good when I was here before. Went for nice dinner. Was disappointed. Best things were the entrees. Got the pork shoulder. Good. All friti and vegetable things that were so good before but lost it now. Sugar settled in the wine. Bottle shouldn't have been served. Would recommend skipping."}
{"text":"Went for dinner on Saturday 7/11. We got there late since we missed out reservation at Ruth Chris. The service was impeccable, the food delicious, and the decor is eye candy like you were in a piazza in Italy! I have to say if you want to eat at late dinner, go to OTTO's. The food is amazing, and the service was excellent. I can remember our waitress' name but she and the host, and the manager were all very attentive."}
{"text":"Had a great late night meal here. Me and my girlfriend were looking for something satisfying but semi-casual.  This place hit the spot. The meal started off with the fried ricotta and the eggplant appetizer. Both were delicious. The waitress recommended a bottle of Lupi E Sirene 2007 that was delicious and inexpensive. We shared the prosciutto and arugula pizza and it was solid. Definitely will be coming back and looking to get the pancetta and goat cheese pizza."}
{"text":"I give it 4 stars in consideration of some nostalgic value (to me). My wife and I have come here each time we stop in Vegas for a number of years. The pizzas are good, creative, and with high quality ingredients. The setup with the round bar in the middle, soft lighting, with location in the St. Mark's square recreation, is welcoming. The lighting with displays of aged meats make me think of some trattorias I have been in Emiglia Romagna. The food is on the pricier side compared to national averages but not awful relative to standard prices nearby on the strip. The service seems to have fallen in quality. The bathroom last time was a little bit on the side of disgusting. The place was less crowded. All make me fear the place will not be here forever (the puck restaurant on the other side of the square closed over the past year)."}
{"text":"What a disappointment. My wife, son and I were looking for a great italian lunch and Otto looked like a great place for a quick bite as nobody was there (maybe that was a clue). My son ordered pepperoni pizza, and his first bite looked as if he took a bite of a rotten sock with his expression. My wife took a bite and just about threw up on the table. apparently, the pepperoni is actually cured salumi. Maybe they could explain that before ordering, it's probably an acquired taste, just not for us.  The server actually said the pizza gets returned a lot and the salumi comes from Marios fathers shop in Seattle. Take it off the menu if it's that bad or place a caution \"May cause severe stomach cramping, diarrhea  or vomiting.\""}
{"text":"Service was memorable for being almost non-existent.  We were greeted by a hung over, burnt out appearing server who promptly went away and didn't come back.  Another server finally spotted us as we were preparing to leave and came over to say our waiter was a bit overwhelmed and she would take our order.  Since we were eating mid-afternoon there weren't many patrons around, so I don't know what overwhelmed the waiter.  Anyway, when the food finally came we still hadn't seen our drinks.  The food was memorable for how forgettable it was except for the pepperoni pizza which had an off taste.  So the overwhelmed waiter finally returned to us magically refreshed and very upbeat.  I can't imagine how such a change occurred so suddenly.  So upbeat, in fact, that he mistakenly charged me for an extra glass of wine and when I brought this to his attention he slapped his forehead and exclaimed that he had indeed caught that and had prepared a new bill but had forgotten to print it and present it to us.  No, don't worry, these things happen (when you're trying to scam your customers).  $115 for 2 for lunch.  Is that really normal?  To think we were sent there by an enthusiastic concierge from the Palazzo.  I know great food and I know great service and this place has neither."}
{"text":"We had a bite to eat after seeing Le Reve.  I was sort of worried based on the mixed reviews.  They have a great wine list and I thought they were priced well.  We ordered a bottle of wine and started with three vegetables for an appetizer - olives, asparagus with pecorino, and roasted beets.  These were definitely hits and i would highly recommend any of them.  We had the pancetta pizza with goat cheese.  The pizza crust was very crisp and good - I wouldn't call it great.  I work for an Italian company and haved travelled to Italy quite a bit and just don't think the pizza was all that \"authentic\".  I would return here for some wine and appetizers but probably would skip the pizza.  One final comment.  This place is ok, it's not great, but I find the vehemence and prsonal attacks directed towards Mario Batali a bit disturbing."}
{"text":"If you're looking for good pizza (tried the Quattro Formaggi; taleggio, cacio, ricotta, mozzarella) and (Italian) beer on the strip, this place won't disappoint. With great service and great food, I'll definitely return."}
{"text":"Mario Battali definitely phoning it in for this one.  The only plus is the ambiance in the middle of St.Mark's square in Venetian but our rude waiter mostly ruined all of it.  I came with a party of 6 so gratuity is automatically added to the bill so our waiter pushed us to order as many pricey items as possible.  When we refused, he was condescending and rude.   The food looked better on the menu than it tasted.  Not bad, but not stellar either.  The portions were petite but pretty standard.  Wouldn't mind it as much if it wasn't for our snotty waiter."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Sitting is a palazo in the Venetian with opera in the background...excellent.  Arugula salad was amazing.  Perfecting dressed.  I thoroughly loved their pizzas.  The tomato sauce is so fresh tasting!  The prosciutto was lean...winner all the way around.  One of my lunchmates is a vegetarian and found many items to make him happy.  I'm fortunate because there's an Otto in NYC so I don't need to come back to Las Vegas to enjoy, again."}
{"text":"Last day in Vegas. We stumbled upon this great place our last day in Vegas. The food was amazing! The pizza was fresh, tasty, and succulent. The cheese was flavorful and the toppings were fresh. The bread that was served warm with a great dipping oil. This place was a pleasant surprise. My companion chose this place and it was indeed a winner!"}
{"text":"Great food and wonderful service. I highly recommend it. The Caprese salad was delicious as was the Parmesiano Reggiano and the truffle honey was amazing. I recommend the black pasta with calamari and pesto as well.  I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this restaurant 2 stars instead of 1 is the service. The staff is super nice and accomodating. The service was pretty deficient even when the restaurant was extremely busy.  The food left little to be desired. The dishes are all insanely salty. I totally understand how tragic an under-salted or under-seasoned meal is, but I couldn't taste anything but salt in both the pasta dishes and the pizza that we ordered.   There are so many great in dining options in the Venetian/Palazzo compound, this just isn't one of them. I definitely won't be returning."}
{"text":"I was visiting Vegas last weekend and wanted to dine at one of Mario's Italian restaurants. My friend and I chose Otto and I must say I was very disappointed! They did not have a great menu selection and the food was terrible. I had the short rib ravioli and it tasted worse then store bought ravioli. It was hard and thick and not freshly made as to be expected from a high end Italian restaurant. My friend had the spaghetti and meat balls and felt the same. The meat balls were tiny and very hard. She wound up just eating the spaghetti and leaving all the meatballs because they were that bad. I would recommend to skip this restaurant and go somewhere else!"}
{"text":"Lunch for six on 5/12/13.  We were happy with the pizzas and appetizers that we ordered, and service was good.  The drinks could have been stronger (c'mon it's Vegas!).  A tad pricey - we paid $48 each for lunch with one drink.  You can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"I eagerly await a visit to OTTO Enoteca every year when we travel to Vegas.  We originally happened upon this restaurant when we were window shopping at the Grand Canal Shops in the Venetian.  It has now become a must each visit.  Everything on the menu is great, but they offer a specialty pizza that is out of this world.  I am not even a real pizza fan, but this one is one I dream about!  It is a CORN PIZZA.  Yup, corn.  If you are looking to taste something different and amazing, please try it.  It is a white pie with a creamy corn spread, mozzarella, cherry tomato slices, scallions, and a hint of red pepper.  The only reason I am not ranking this establishment with 5 stars is due to the lackadaisical nature of some of the staff, particularly the hostess.  However, that would never stop me from returning."}
{"text":"It was time for a happy hour snack which starts at 3. We opted to sit at the bar and enjoy a few small plates. They have a sampler that is 3 for $5, so we had a little bit of everything.  Tasty Salami, Mortadella, Olives, Bruschetta, deep fried bread balls stuff with cheese and roasted beets with Saba.   After the small plates it was some some deep fried squash blossoms filled with delicious ricotta cheese.  Excellent choice I must say. We wanted to try something a bit heartier, so it was the short rib ravioli up next. Very tasty and a generous portion. The only drawback is the ravioli could of had more short rib meat inside, but still flavor tasty. The final course was some tasty cheese with cherries, apricot and black truffle honey. An enjoyable afternoon and tasty snack at this Batali restaurant."}
{"text":"This place is beautiful. It's in the Venetian mall area and looks like youre eating outside but youre really inside. The service was good. The prices were high - but hey it's the Venetian so you can't expect anything else.   Ok so here's the whammy. We ordered a margherita pizza and a pepperoni pizza for the group. The margherita was excellent. The pepperoni...was DISGUSTING. The pepperoni was rotten!!!! So gross.   After trying to tell us that was supposed to be the taste, they ended up replacing it with another margherita.   Good place. Just don't order that nasty \"pepperoni\"."}
{"text":"Loved this place - server was wonderful, food was delicious. We had two in our party who were gluten free - the fresh made gluten free pasta was great - the burrata was excellent - I had a dish with a chicken Tahi sauce that was delicious and rich. The short rib ravioli was great as well. Would definitely go back"}
{"text":"Always great food.  Price point for strip is great among the Italian options.  Eat here often.  Charcuterie always a great option here. Ordered the sorbet for two dessert it was also yummy!"}
{"text":"Being a fan of both Joe Bastinach and Mario Batali, the bar was set high when deciding to dine here. I am very happy to say it met my expectations in every way, from service, to food, and even price!  My other half and I came here on a random date night. Even though the restaurant wasn't easy to get to, I love the location. It's fancy, but still semi casual with people in jeans at the bar. Also a great place to people watch as its an indoor patio inside the Venetian's canal shops.  Our server was so on point. Literally the second the hostess seated us, she was behind her offering wine and water. We asked about appetizers and I told her the type of cheese and meat I usually like and she came back with the perfect platter. The truffle honey to pair with the cheese is to die for. I could eat that on anything, and continued to dip my bread, cheese, meat, and even Brussel sprouts in there.  With the wine, cheese, and brussels so good, I was waiting for something to be wrong! Nope, did not happen. Our entrees were served and they were Italian perfection! Fresh al dente pasta, with ingredients that matched perfectly. The pasta servings were actually decent sizes, not huge where its unfinishable. Even the herbs used made a noted flavor to the dish. I felt like Mario Batali himself was back there critiquing and Mr. Bastinach was across from me judging the plate.  I will make a point to come back here and try the pizza and other pasta dishes.  Amazing in every sense of the word."}
{"text":"If you've been to the Otto in Manhattan, then maybe you'll be tempted to try its Las Vegas counterpart like my wife and I were this past Saturday. Our hostess was cool enough to give us a 4-person table (there were just the two of us) outside on the patio, despite the fact that it was pretty full. Blessings to you. What a scene: from the people milling about outside, to the human statue across the courtyard, to the beautiful \"sky\" painted on the ceiling.   Wife had the Margarita pizza. I had a salad and some pasta. The food was eh; much better in NY. Service was good. Prices are...well, it's Otto. Figure on $70 - $100 for two, depending on your beverages."}
{"text":"It was around 5:30 in the evening and we came here for a drink and an appetizer. We weren't sure why all of its neighboring eateries were packed with people waiting and this one was completely empty. We sat down and ordered a beer, wine and a 3 cheese plate that came with truffled honey, cherries and apricot jam. It was only then we found out that their happy hour ended at 5PM, while all of the neighbors run until 7pm.  Again this is Vegas and you have to keep up with the trends and not to mention demand, but for some reason these guys weren't which explained an empty eatery on a Sunday, in the middle of the grand canal shops. Others couldn't accommodate their people waiting. The beer was ice cold and the wine went perfectly with the cheeses ordered. Of the cheeses we selected, the Parmigiano Reggiano was clearly the best one. Our waiter and the rest of the staff we came in contact with were friendly. Its a shame they couldn't serve more customers. Hopefully they'll change that soon."}
{"text":"Mario Batali...is a master.  Had Linguine with shrimp, it was awesome.  Had fried green beans, they were awesome.  Had the roasted cauliflower, it was awesome.  This is worth paying a little extra."}
{"text":"Wow the pasta is really good at this place. The Rigatoni or Spaghetti a la Napolitana was al dente and really good. Also the pizza with panceta and goat cheese was very flavorful. Pair the food with a couple of Italian ambers. Best of all is the service, A+++ service!"}
{"text":"Our party of six really enjoyed the place. Excellent service. Meats and cheeses and olives were a great start. Pizza was very good."}
{"text":"Great food and service but this is what you should get when you pay $5 for a slice of prosciutto that measures 3\" x 1\" x 0.0001\".   The pizza and pasta that we had were tasty but the portion was rather small.  We also tried the fried mozzarella and the preserved tuna with beans and olive. Both came out delicious especially the olive oil dips that comes with the mozzarella. That olive oil is blended anchovies.  Mario Batali is definitely as Iron Chef."}
{"text":"This was a surprisingly good experience. The food was tasty and the service was decent. I ordered the truffle pizza because they only serve the famous carbonara pizza on Fridays. I was surprised they couldn't accommodate and make one upon request. The server furthrr explained it would take an hour to make the carbonara sauce, which puzzled me, since the carbonate I know is egg, pecorino and salt/pepper.  Either way, the truffle pizza was good. The truffle oil was a little heavy, but overall a pleasant addition to the truffle and new potatoes.   I also tried my family members' Matriciana, squid ink tonnorell, but very good, as was the short rib ravioli and braised pork rigatoni. Apps were good too.  Overall the quality of the food was very good, but I think they charge too much for what they serve."}
{"text":"Service was excellent!  The location was nice - almost like dining outdoor but indoor.  We had 5 people and did the 3 Cheese for $15 as a starter.  It came with honey, jam, bread, etc.  It was a great starter for sharing!  Instead of picking the cheeses, we asked the server to do so, and he did an excellent job.  Loved the Brigante cheese the best!  I split the Pepperoni Pizza and the Spaghetti & Meatballs.  Both were pretty excellent.  My friend slightly liked the spaghetti better, and I slightly liked the pizza better.  The pasta wasn't a huge portion, but it just right.  Glad we tried it."}
{"text":"4 star food, with 2 star, somewhat indifferent service."}
{"text":"I love this place. The Margherita pizza is out of this world. For dessert, I get the dark chocolate dessert which is a warm chocolate cake with peanut brittle, dark chocolate malt gelato and peanut butter gelato. I highly recommend it. Can't wait to return here for my next vacation!"}
{"text":"What a disappointment. The pizza was watery and luke-warm. I can get a better pizza back home."}
{"text":"We enjoyed Otto several times while in Vegas.  Our first visit, we started with Caprese (Burrata, Pesto, Cherry Tomatoes). The burrata was amazing and the pesto tasted fresh and bright. The cherry tomatoes seemed picked at the peak of flavor - they were so wonderfully sweet! We enjoyed the Caprese so much that we ordered it the subsequent two times we dined at Otto.   Next, we tried the Grilled Pacific Tuna with Sicilian pesto with broccoli rabe as a side. The tuna was grilled to medium rare and has a great, fresh flavor. The pesto and greens scattered atop the dish added to the great melding of flavors on the plate. The broccoli rabe, unfortunately, was bitter to the point that I couldn't manage more than one bite.   Dessert was a trio of gelatos: dark chocolate malt, salted caramel and pistachio - YUM!  The next trip to Otto, we ordered the Caprese again, along with the grilled tuna (no more broccoli rabe for us, though). To round out the meal, we ordered the Bucatini all'Amatriciana (tomato, cured pork, onion), which we'd somehow missed on our previous trip - if we had seen it, we would have ordered it from the beginning! Again, the Caprese was sublime, as was the tuna. The bucatini was also amazing, to the point that we needed more bread, then our fingers, to make sure we got every last bit of sauce left on the plate.   Our third trip to Otto, we varied it slightly. We went with the Caprese and the bucatini, but mixed it up by ordering the Marinated Chicken Paillard (arugula, fried eggplant, ricotta). The Paillard was delicious, so simple yet expertly prepared. The eggplant was a nice, thick slab and the creamy ricotta complemented the rest of the dish nicely.  All in all, the only disappointment was the broccoli rabe, everything else was just wonderful! If the Shoppes at the Palazzo were a bona fide neighborhood, we'd have our favorite neighborhood restaurant right there."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar. Delicious margharita pizza and a generous prosecco pour--I really enjoyed it! Looking forward to trying the salad my bar mates were enjoying as well as the cocktails and extensive wine list.  I had to edit my review to add that the gelato is delicious!"}
{"text":"Was at the Palazzo for a conference and needed a gluten free healthy choice within my per diem.  Was not disappointed! Located along the canal in St Marc square of the the Palazzo, Otto Enoteca offers excellent pizza and farm to table salads (the Arugal salad with shaved fresh Parma is amazing) as well as a host of gluten free and traditional pastas.  Taste was precise and authentic.  Great wine list for a pizzeria pairing well with the food, exactly what you would expect from Chef Mario Batali."}
{"text":"Food was great, though the servings were small and price expensive for what it was.  I guess that can be expected from a place like this.  What drew the negative review was the really rude server we got.  I dont think i'll come back just because of him."}
{"text":"This restaurant reminded me of a mix between Pizzeria & Osteria Mozza in Los Angeles.  The food was fresh & service was good.  We shared appetizers - fried cauliflower was the best!  3 pizzas: truffle, cabonara, and one other...but the best in my mind was our 3 pastas selections: one with bottarga, bucatini ala amatriciana, and I forgot the last one.  Good italian food at the Venetian, but be prepared that you may be seating in their outdoor but indoor dining area.  :)"}
{"text":"Was very disappointed by my meal. Ordered a salad and margherita pizza. The pizza was all tomato sauce with about 6 circles of mozzarella cheese with a leaf of basil on it. For a couple of pieces if it wasn't centered on the mozzarella your slice was just tomato sauce and nothing else. Very unimpressed and very expensive. Had eaten at Wolfgang Puck's the day before across the walkway and would give that 5 stars."}
{"text":"Located at the St. Mark's Square at the Venetian is a hidden gem. We did not have reservations and were told the wait for a table outside would be around 45 minutes. If we opt for inside at the wine cellar room we could be seated immediately. Although the atmosphere outside would have added to the meal we decided to sit inside due to time. I was surprised at how warm that room was. Next time I will remember to make reservations for outside.  My first time here and I did not have much expectations but I knew it must be good because it is a Mario Batali's restaurant. We had been to a place of his in New York and I loved his food.   We ordered a few appetizers to share, a pizza and a pasta.  I highly recommend getting the 5 items of vegetables. We ordered the olives, the beets, the eggplant, the parsnips and pickles. Super delicious!!! We ordered the fried mozzarella spedini and sweet potato croquette. They told me both were tasty. My family really enjoyed the pizza and said best pizza ever. I did not try the pizza nor the pasta due to my wheat belly challenge. They told me the crust is thin and crispy. Usually due to the sauce, thin crust pizza gets soggy but this pizza bottom was crispy throughout. The broccoli rabe pasta was cooked perfectly al dente. I did not have the pasta but did try some sausage and the broccoli rabe and that tasted amazing.   We did not have room for dessert but left with a happy belly. We will definitely be back for more."}
{"text":"Was there for dinner last sunday. Had a pizza and did not like it. Crust was too thin for my taste and too much sauce. I was expecting a real Italian pizzeria not pizza with meatballs. Beer was good. Had a Menabrea Amber."}
{"text":"Wanted a quick tasty bite with friends. Nothing quick or tasty about this place. The service was horrendous and extremely slow. The pizzas were bland and lacked any sort of flavor. Should have saved $120 and gone to sabarro  Wanted a quick tasty bite with friends. Nothing quick or tasty about this place. The service was horrendous and extremely slow. The pizzas were bland and lacked any sort of flavor. Should have saved $120 and gone to sabarro"}
{"text":"We stayed at the hotel and decided to walk downstairs for dinner. We were seated right away outside by the performers which was nice. We started with fried cauliflower which was a recommendation from our server. We also ordered a margarita pizza, seafood linguine, grilled chicken with eggplant. This is the second time dining here and it did not disappoint us the second time. My wife loves the linguine."}
{"text":"I was just really unimpressed with this place. We had a big group so we had a pretty big selection of the appetizers which we all shared. I really enjoyed the brushetta and the olives, but most everything else was mediocre at best. Nothing on the entree menu seemed very appealing to me so I went with basic spaghetti and meatballs. For the outrageous price I expected a much bigger portion and the sauce on it was so incredibly salty. My friend ordered the pork shoulder which I tried a bite of and that was delicious. I also tried a little of someone else's sausage and peppers pizza which I thought was disgusting. The staff was very friendly, fast and attentive which is the only reason they get 2 stars. But I'd  highly recommend going elsewhere."}
{"text":"Once again, we came to Otto (Saturday 10/27/17 @ 8:30PM) and had an amazing experience; really, this is not just a meal, but a dining experience. We drive in, 2.5 hrs, just to dine here. I love the change of seasons at Otto--the ingredients reflect the Fall and I couldn't be more pleased with the unctuous nature of the menu. I do, still, miss the carmelized onion bruschetta, but other than that one point, everything is perfection.  Our Server, Chantasi, was the height of professionalism and knowledge. She suggested and we followed her lead and were certainly impressed. Chantasi's assistant was also super efficient and I am sorry that I did not get her name. We will be back soon because this is, for our family, the perfect combination of food-love and ambience in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Its more than a Pizzeria, the have a good selection of wine, and good fine dining options. The desserts here are heavenly, nice cheeses and appetizers."}
{"text":"The nectarine salad with pine nuts was very interesting, enjoyable. Arugala salad with freshly shaved parmesan was nice, too. I didn't care for the squash blossoms only because it had mint. But it seemed high quality so if you don't mind mint on your food, this is a unique appetizer. hmmmmm, the corn pizza is delicious. Very unique flavor. The quattro formaggio is very good, too. They were nice enough to substitute the ricotta with fontina. The margherita is tasty. Fresh basil. Perfectly balanced cheese and sauce. I'm not sure that I'd come back only because I like to try different pizzas. But this place serves nice, fresh, light pizza."}
{"text":"What a great find. If you love Mozza like we do, you will dig Otto. Mario just can't disappoint!"}
{"text":"Just wanted great pizza and figured this was the place - not so much. Thin crust - check, soggy bottom - check, margarita pizza with so much cheese it turned into crema - check!   But the Caesar salad was very good, yummy authentic dressing and crisp cold greens, nice slice of parmesan on top.   Mario should be ashamed of the pizza!"}
{"text":"Maybe the worst restaurant experience in my life.  I had to wait 20 minutes just for my initial drink order.  The waiter actually serve two other tables who came in after me before me.  Very shallow wine pour.  I guess that's how they make their margins.  Cheese was good but impossible to cut because he knives were so dull.  Never again."}
{"text":"In a word, disappointing.  In another word, overpriced.  The hostess asked us if we had reservations for lunch... with a total of 3 tables occupied in the entire restaurant, I don't see the point of such a perfunctory question.  After fumbling with the computer and menus at the host stand for several minutes, she led us to our table with about as much ennui as humanly possible.  Thanks for the warm greeting.  I was willing to overlook the retail-wrapped bread sticks, but unfortunately nothing redeeming followed.  The bread and olive oil, as another review mentions, were unfortunately the stars.  The linguini with mussels was so poorly presented that I almost thought it was a joke.  It looked like the pasta had just been scraped off a microwave dish onto the white plate.  No garnish, just a yellowy neutral-colored heap of food.  Really, Batali?   The pizza at our table looked fair, but CPK caliber.  It did little other than satiate an empty stomach."}
{"text":"One Mario Batali restaurant replaces another.  Formerly Enoteca San Marco, Otto Enoteca Pizzeria now holds court at the Venetian.  Ambiance: Sit \"outside\" and enjoy the scenery.  Diners at Otto can enjoy the beautiful hotel decor, as well as performing artists who entertain those sitting or walking nearby.    Service: Very friendly and helpful.  Food: I thought I knew what al dente was until I dined at Otto.  Now I question every al dente pasta I've ever had.  I ordered the Spaghettini with sauteed mushrooms, garlic, and thyme $19.  The pasta was cooked and seasoned perfectly, and the portion was just the right amount as well.  The ingredients were simple and fresh, which allowed each of them to really stand out.  The variety of mushrooms were especially flavorful and distinct.  For dessert, we ordered three flavors of gelati $9; Colorado River Coffee Roasters espresso, pistachio, and dark chocolate malt.  The gelato was soft, rich and flavorful, with the pistachio and dark chocolate malt my favorites.    Overall: A great dining experience if you are looking for a relaxing meal in a beautiful environment.  Otto serves quality food in an unpretentious atmosphere, which I can appreciate.  Next on my list to try at Otto is their pizza."}
{"text":"This place is my fav!! Best food, great service, amazing wine and all at an affordable price. Mario & Joe, you guys make my life delicious!"}
{"text":"Friday night in vegas during lent is not as adventurous as I hoped it to be since we couldn't eat meat and with a 38 degrees temperature & raining, you know I wasn't willing to partake in any outdoor/strip walking.   We ended up at this lovely place after walking around Venetian trying to decide where to eat for dinner and I have to say we made a great selection between the adjacent restaurant & Grand Lux Cafe.  Our host sat us in a private wine room where we ended up having the entire space to our self. It was very romantic. Our server was knowledgeable and was kind enough to assist us with deciding which wine to chose. We had the margherita pizza, clams linguine which was amazingly delicious then shared a pear & apple crisp topped with a vanilla gelato, the combination of both fruit was so good we cleaned out the bowl.   Definitely recommend this place for all ages :)"}
{"text":"Awesome meal! Enjoyed a margarita pizza and gemmelli with sausage and broccoli rabe. Perfect to split with my husband. Very attentive friendly staff. Also had entertainment in the square while we ate. Bonus show with dinner!"}
{"text":"Dear Mario,  My son and I visited your Otto Enoteca Pizzeria at The Venetian in Las Vegas. With all the choices in Las Vegas, and having experienced a nice variety of them during our stay, we were looking forward to a simple spaghetti and meatballs dinner with some Mario creativity to flavor.   Really cool spot, Mario. The atmosphere was nice and we enjoyed the piazza setting. Great lighting, nice \"show\", simple elegance- all worth a little extra, in my book. We've paid a lot more for a lot less ambiance in this town. Hostess seated us with a very big smile and I liked that. So thanks for all that, Mario.  I don't know how to tell you this, Mario, but there's some disconnect from there- so I'll try. We've experienced the best and worst of dining throughout Italy and we get the Fritti, Insalate, Piatti dining experience, and we do appreciate it. But, we're in Vegas where it's always not so transparent how authentic dining in Vegas can be. So, spaghetti and meatballs for $20 might need some clarification in this stippling of cultures. I sometimes defer to a quote I was once offered in another country when I asked directions of another US citizen- \"We're from America, we don't know s***.\" Most of those walking up to view your menu might not know s*** about requiring multiples of $20 dishes to be able to rub their substantial bellies on the way out.  Shame on us, we fell for the $20 pasta dish. Oh, it was authentic. That is, relatively minimal, delicious, perfectly cooked and lovely. I might add my disappointment with your arrogant and negligent server. He made it clear that his interests were elsewhere in the room. In addition, my son's request for Gnocchi with meat sauce was accepted with \"I don't know, but I'll ask\", and dismissed with \"We can't do that\"- what??? So he ordered spaghetti with your little Irish hamburger marbles that you call meatballs (of which we each ate one of the ten or so little impostors), and very soon after, we're completing our dishes. Also, nice job at the math blackboard during staff training. Two persons, two pieces of bread- four persons, four pieces of bread. (Reminder- America/Vegas).  Mario, if I were anywhere but the middle of a \"mall\" in Las Vegas, I might have added some consideration for the menu authenticity. Get your best marketing people and figure out a way to clarify to your walk-ups that the $20 pasta is a side dish or offer the Walmart Shopper option for a couple dollars more. And let the people have what they want if it's Gnocchi with meat sauce. Also, please try to update your online menu info, it isn't even close to real time.   Now that I know, I have a special little spot where I can get an authentically prepared snack between shopping and dinner for less than room service. Again, thanks for that.   Sincerely, Vegas visitor."}
{"text":"Three co-workers and I had lunch at Otto Enoteca Pizzeria during the HIMSS conference because it was one of three sit-down restaurants at the Venetian's Grand Canal shops just a short walk away from the Sands Expo Convention Center. We waited 20 minutes to be seated and at least 20 more to place our order. Fortunately, the food came out in less time than it took to order it. I ordered the veal and ricotta meatballs over polenta, which was good, but not mind-blowing for $26. It has the feel of an upscale restaurant, but I didn't feel the service and food were worth the inflated price."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I dined at Otto on Christmas Eve.  The staff was polite and professional but I have mixed reviews about the food.  Our server suggested the caprese salad with the prosciutto and copa.  Both good but very over priced.  We also ordered the eggplant and ricotta pasta which was not very good.  The pasta was too salty and too under-cooked.  I understand Italians cook pasta al-dente but our pasta was on the raw side.  This was probably my first and last time there.  I'd much rather eat across at Postrio."}
{"text":"Pork Shoulder was one of the best I've ever had. Thought the focaccia bread was excellent and everything we tried was good.  The service was a little slow - but when we ate, it was pretty packed.  Definitely will come back again next time we're in town!"}
{"text":"Make sure to sit at the bar to get the happy hour antipasti and peroni deal. Service leaves a bit to be desired. A lot of servers milling around chatting with one another or checking their phones instead of waiting on customers.   The antipasti were tasty: roasted tomato bruschetta, gnocchi fritti, and the pane e mozzarella. Peroni were cold and crisp, as they should be.  It'd be a four star spot based on food alone, but the service brings it down."}
{"text":"Reliably great food and wine Introduced our friends from Paris France who surprisingly know little of the Italian wines. Our server at the bar ( we love the bar as we can better interact with the working folks here) rightly recommended the wines based on our foods. A few glasses of Promis and a bottle of 2010 Brunello di Montalcino which made the meat balls and the rigatoni in meat sauce dance in our tummies.  For desert the lemon ricotta crepe was out of this world!  Thank you  Mario and Joe for your consistency in serving such quality healthy  fantastic food and service. I hardly come to 'Vegas without dropping in at the Otto"}
{"text":"We had the most fantastic experience here.  We spent our 5th wedding anniversary dinner here and had an incredible time.  Edith was amazingly sweet and helpful as our waitress. Michael was a wonderful manager and made our anniversary special.  The food was great. I recommend the black spaghetti pasta. The arugula and prosciutto pizza was very delicious as well.  Honestly the service between Edith and Michael made it well worth the trip. We would love to come back."}
{"text":"I had high hopes since this is opened by Mario Batali, but I was kind of disappointed with my pizza - more like a flatbread with sauce.  My friend's pasta was very tasty, though, and the appetizers (arancini and squash blossoms) were good, as was the homemade ricotta on the bruschetta we ordered."}
{"text":"Atmosphere nice, service attentive then food just ok. Pizza expectations not met....weak crust & sauce. Decent atmosphere for biz meal but 10 of us left not that happy."}
{"text":"I think this is the first time I've ever given a 1 star review. It's not that I want to give Otto a 1 star, but I am compelled to. Let me start out with some of our mistakes or variables that you have to account for when eating out: - we came a little after 11am on a Saturday morning (aka right when they open) - we expected a lot from this place since it has a \"Mario Batali\" on its sign Our server was quite nice, tried very hard to sell us the appetizers, but we only wanted to grab a quick bite before gambling - plus, we had to leave at 2pm to catch our flight, so we are basically in a rush. The bread was okay - my friend said it was grainy. Their breadsticks came in a package - they were alright. When the food came...that's when the nightmare started. We had a long night of partying, were running on 4hours of sleep and planned to go to the Wynn Buffet but decided there was not enough time, so Otto it is. Back to the food. I thought Italian food is supposed to be all about olive oil, tomatoes, basil and al dente pasta. What we got was SALT SALT SALT. We got: - overly salty lasagna - overly salty other pastas (I forgot the names) They were horribly salty. My friend ended up telling the server his pasta was too salty (and the pastas were nowhere near al dente - some were over and under cooked). He then ended up getting an arugula salad with parmesan cheese - that wasn't great either because it was overly oily. Overall, the food didn't look as pretty as the Venetian atmosphere surrounding us and I probably won't be going back again.   Lesson of the day: take into consideration the variables I mentioned above and hopefully you'll have a better experience here like most of the other yelpers."}
{"text":"Lunch at Otto was amazing. We ordered the arancines, squash bloosom, buffalo mozzarella, sausage and peppers pizza, and Quattro formaggi which was \"the best one in my opinion\". The sausage pizza was good not the best but good. The arancines was ok, but, I don't really like rice. The Quattro has four cheeses but it's like in all departments on one pizza skin and it lets you taste each cheese separately which is genius!! I'm copying that at home. Overall, I'm very satisfied with the experience."}
{"text":"Honestly, we were just so unhappy with out experience here and it really came down to the waitstaff.  We arrived just a few minutes before happy hour. We tell the hostess we wanna do HH and she tells us to sit at the bar and we can order in 8 minutes when it's HH--great. Now listen, me and my 2 friends are friendly 20-somethings from NYC. Generally, in this type of situation, bartenders, waiters, etc would offer to just take the order and do HH pricing. They didn't, and that's fine, I didn't deduct stars for that. What I did deduct is how long it took them to then take our drink orders, and then how long it took to get drinks. We ordered small plates and we were HANGRY to say the least. Those small plates were taking forever, and we wanted to ask about it, and eventually it becomes clear our waiter forgot to put our order in. So he brought us a free plate of something else, which was a great gesture and would have redeemed this a bit, if it also wasn't a huge struggle just to ask for the check. My friends and I were not even talking to each other for about 20 minutes, just spending all of our energy trying to get any workers attention--and failing. It just felt so rude and as if we were an afterthought. I expect so much better from Mario Battali restaurants. I get that maybe because we were there for HH they thought we were cheap or something? Their loss."}
{"text":"Our waiter William was amazing. We asked him to create a cheese plate and it was perfect. He knew the perfect pairings. The cocktail, a cosmopolitan, was delicious. Food was perfectly portioned. He also knew the wine list and picked something that was perfectly ideal. 10/10 from ambiance, to service, to food and presentation."}
{"text":"PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME OR MONEY... YOU OTTO NOT GO !!  We should have known something was wrong when we approached this restaurant...it was virtually empty, while Wolfgang Puck's restaurant just across the way was bustling with patrons.  My wife and I were celebrating our 35th anniversary and had our son with us...after being seated, a small amount of foccacia bread was served with no butter or olive oil and balsamic for dipping?...the party next to us hailed down their waiter and asked for olive oil and balsamic to be brought immediately...it was too late for us, as we had already eaten the small portion we were served...oh, BTW, that party had already gottten in the face of the waitress we were blessed with, and they got a different waiter..they had complained of sitting too long without being attended to their dining needs...  We both ordered the hanger steak which was accompanied by an arrugala and fig salad...I ordered my steak medium rare and received it raw/rare...my wife ordered hers medium and it turned out to be medium rare...the best part of this dish was the salad..both steaks were not cooked to our order and lacked seasoning...the steak itself was boring....$28 a plate!  My son had a pasta dish (Cartierra).....also looked boring on the plate...just pasta...no other accompaniment.....waiter never grated any cheese over the pasta, as was being done on other pasta dishes being served....$17  In celebration of our wedding anniversary, I ordered my usual Bombay Saphire Gin and tonic...when I got my bill and found out I was charged $14 for this cocktail, I should have called the manager over and made a scene...I've NEVER in my life been charged such an exhorbitant amount for a Bombay Gin and tonic, nor would I ever expect to again in my lifetime...c'mon Mario, are you kidding me!  Now for the dessert fiasco...we ordered Dolce Giorno...which was three different gellato selections, served in cream puffs...what we first got was the three different scoops of gellato served in a bowl all squished together to liken one large scoop?...when we said we had not ordered the dessert that was served, you would have thought all hell was going to break loose...the waitress's jaw dropped, like it wasn't her fault...and then the manager wanted to know why she was bringing the dessert back for a replacement?...price tag...$12  All told, it was a mediocre meal...a $111 tab plus tip...I agree with the other one star commenter...these TV star restauranteurs could care less if they ever see you again, as the constant turnover of travelers to Las Vegas provides a huge pool of sitting ducks just waiting to be plucked.  And by the way Mario, if you would like to try a good hanger steak, please visit the nearest Cheesecake Factory..they sell theirs as \"Hibachi\" steak for slightly more than half your price.  Lastly, I would like to recommend a wonderful Las Vegas restaurant we dined at called Table 34..great food, wonderful service, and my gin and tonic...$8"}
{"text":"Took my wife to Otto's for our anniversary prior to seeing Rock of Ages.   Started with a 3 cheese sample, olives, and 2 carnes.  The cheeses came with dipping sauces - like honey and black truffle oil.  The cheeses, olives, and carne were great.  For dinner my wife had the quatro fomagi pizza and I had the lamb meatballs.  The pizza was wood fired and the crust was thin and crispy. Very favorable sauce and cheeses.  The meatballs were great - tender and full of flavor.    Otto's has an extensive wine list and the waiter was glad to help pair up wine with our appetizers and dinner. Service was great and attentive the whole dinner.  Otto's is expensive, portions are not large, but the quality and flavor surpass both of  those issues. I would have given Otto's 5 stars but our only complaint was a few minutes after getting our cheese and carne our dinner came. I would have been great to sit and enjoy our appetizer with our rushing it."}
{"text":"Had a fun and relaxing meal here. Our party of 6, which included 2 12 year olds, loved the Gnocho  Fritto, caponata, assorted cheeses, and the salads. Half of us ordered pasta and half ordered pizza. The pizza was outstanding. We sat outside by the grand canal. The people watching is an A+ and if you are going to do Vegas, you might as well fully embrace the illusion and enjoy the spectacle from this vantage point. Great wine list - very pricey."}
{"text":"The girl at the desk wouldn't let us have the three to seven Antipasto and wine tasting menu. I took a photo TODAY of the website that shows the hours of the Antipasto menu. I am very displeased and DISAPPOINTED and can't say Otto Enoteca is a bad restaurant. Ive been here several times before. But I do have to REMOVE them from my Vegas rotation list."}
{"text":"We had the best service here. Our waiter was informed and helpful.  We ordered two pasta dishes both amazing. Especially the black linguine and  the fried dough with sliced prosciutto. Pizza also looked good., which is a less expensive way to eat here. Definitely a better choice than Carnivino, which is another of these same chefs restaurants. Not because of price point but because the food is so much better."}
{"text":"Terrible experience!!!  I went there for my wife's birthday lunch. I assumed that a place at such a nice location will care a bit about their customers.  After placing our lunch order...I spoke to the waitress and told her that it was a special occasion and wanted a slice of cake delivered to my table.she immediately shot back saying I will be charged. I laughed and said...ofcourse.please add it to my bill.i was going to pay her ...but just the way she shot back was very discourteous. It's not like we went there for a free slice of cake.we had already ordered food and drinks for over a hundred bucks by then.  After our meal..I kept waiting for the surprise to arrive and it never came.the same waitress...that I had spoken to not more than 20 mins ago gave me my bill and said thank you and walked away. I thought to my self that she was playing along so my wife is surprised.i waited for some more time and nothing came. I had to go back to her and remind her and she carelessly looked at me and said...oh yeah...I forgot.it was just the sheer carelessness that amazed me.  And then she brought an overtly sweet ice cream with a candle to my table. For a birthday surprise!!!ice cream in a glass!!! How the heck is my wife supposed to cut that!!!  The meal was horrendous too. A proper Italian restaurant and I ask for a fettuccini Alfredo.she looks at me like I m stupid and says...our chef doesn't make any Alfredo sauce. Wtf!!!"}
{"text":"I expected to give a Mario restaurant an easy 5.  This was a fine dining experience \"outside\" in Mark's Square (simulates outside but is inside).  Enjoyed a lovely glass of wine.  Our party got 3 different pasta dishes.  I thought my pasta alla Norma (eggplant, ricotta) was the most flavorful.  The spaghetti and meatballs had lots of tiny very spicy meatballs.  Another got the short ribs ravioli and a side of broccoli rabe.(which was tough and stringy to chew).   Everything tasted fine.  Portions were small for the price.  Could not tell the pasta was homemade.  Our service was good.  I guess I wanted to be swept off my feet.  I enjoyed the experience but will now appreciate our cheaper local Italian food so much more!"}
{"text":"Decent, but should be much better for a Mario Batali & the prices.  I went with a group of 5 on a Sunday evening.  The bread was good & fresh. Had to ask for olive oil. Service was good & attentive although the waiter butchers Italian names & words mercilessly. I had an octopus salad that was very nice. Highlight of my dinner. The seafood stew was barely mediocre. The sauce was sort of ketchupy - embarrassing. My desert was a berry crisp which tasted like granola with warm not fresh berries. Two friends had the seared tuna and enjoyed it. Another had the pork shoulder & liked it. The smashed potatoes were satisfying - salty w lots of rosemary. Good wine list, but pricey for what you get. 2.5 stars for food. 4 for atmosphere."}
{"text":"Are you looking for the best Italian food is Vegas? You've just found it. Fresh pastas, a stunning wine list and great ambiance make this a really special spot. It's hard to imagine anything with Mario Batali's name on it being anything less than perfect, and this restaurant is worth of having his name on it.  I try something different every time I go and have never been disappointed.  My favorites are the corn pizza, the meatballs, and the desert with the salted caramel and chocolate gelato.  Service is always quick and pleasant. I've never had trouble getting a reservation or getting in when I don't have a reservation. It's very close to the self-parking and looks out on Saint Mark's Square, where, if the time is right, you could see a lovely opera performance, masked clowns on stilts, or even a string quartet."}
{"text":"I had the lasagne and a glass of recommended red wine. The lasagna was as good as expected, the wine was better. She had some moscato and pizza... both were better than average. It was busy, they looked a little short staffed. We both kind of felt a little forgotten about in the beginning and rushed towards the end. Definitely a good time!!"}
{"text":"First, I personally would not go to a place with a price tag like this to eat pizza. The pizza itself looked like... pizza. Not bad, not good, not mindblowing. Just pizza, and I'm even eating pizza while writing this. (It's really delicious, by the way.)  I HIGHLY suggest getting the octopus salad. I detest celery, but how on earth do you blend octopus, potato, and celery to make the best salad ever? I would go back to eat this. The small portion is plenty for two people.  I got the calamari pasta with squid ink pasta and a pesto. It was super salty and heavy-handed as can be with the garlic. You couldn't really taste anything besides the garlic. In theory it sounded delicious on the menu, but I wouldn't recommend it. It was really oily, and the pasta was more raw than al dente.  Service is hit-or-miss. When the crowd was thinner, service was spot on and great. When things got busy, I ended up waiting on my check way after the folks at the table next to us cleared out, even though they got there after me. Very few times do I find myself getting irate with how long I have to wait for my check, but this was one of those instances.  Not sure if I would recommend going back again. If you have kids though, this is probably a quick, affordable down-and-dirty that could fill everyone's belly, but expectation management is important."}
{"text":"We were wandering around the Venetian, and decided to stop here for a late lunch. We didn't want to have a heavy lunch, so we decided to order light. We had:  Ricotta fritte - absolutely amazing. You must get this appetizer if you come here!!!!!! Arancine fritte - these were ok Quattro formaggio pizza - this was ok. The only thing different was that each slice of pizza had a different cheese rather than a blend of cheeses all over the whole thing. Balsamic onion pizza - this was their special of the day. It was sooooo good. I've never had a pizza like this. The contrast of the balsamic onions with the ricotta cheese was an awesome combo.   If you feel like having a little snack, stop by here for the ricotta fritte. My mouth is watering just thinking of them, lol :)"}
{"text":"Food and wine selection are very good.  Found the service good, but under staffed.  Otto was full, but needed at least 2-3 additional servers.  Great for shared dinners with small and large groups.  Love that they have Peroni on tap."}
{"text":"Great. Loved the pasta w lamb and great service. Didn't like the cauliflower so they exchanged for beets. Very nice wait staff."}
{"text":"First off I don't usually go to a 3 star restaurant but because of Mario's reputation we will give it a chance.  Asked the manager why he thought three stars were average here.  His answer was everyone is a food critic.  Four of us in the party so we were seated.  We did get prompt service.   The pizza was a 3.5 star.  The veal and beef meatballs good.  Both pasta dishes were served with way undercooked noodles which were actually crunchy. Who they have cooking I have no idea but nobody is testing.  Food was way to salty.  This restaurant wouldn't survive in most big cities.  Mario U should look a little closer at what's happening here.  I will only return if U call me Mario or E-mail."}
{"text":"Delicious steak, arugula, and parmesan salad.  The pasta was solid.   On a side note, I love Batalli's sauces in the grocery stores!  Had a super friendly and nice bartender/waitress.    Had a friendly waiter who mentioned that LA, Chicago, and Vegas had better food than SF.  He's confused and probably should expand his culinary adventures :P  SF and NYC probably tie for the best food and variety of food."}
{"text":"I had the prosciutto arugula pizza which had a great sauce and flavor.  Service was excellent, but my wife mentioned that her linguine was OK.  The seafood appetizer special was average."}
{"text":"Great service. However food is Soso."}
{"text":"I didnt expect italian food this good in Vegas but here we are. This has a great atmosphere alongside some very helpful and kind waiters and waitresses. My family shared pasta and pizza and nobody was disappointed. I did go at lunch time when they weren't too busy so they took their time with the food, which came out spectacularly. Highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Had dinner here last night with 5 business associates.  Place looked appealing, comfortable and worked for a business dinner.  We had a good round table for 6, noise level was low and conversation seemed to work fine.  I had the Seafood Diavolo.  This was a mixture of clams, mussels, squid and possibly swordfish in a spicy tomato sauce.  It was ok, hit the spot; however, nothing I would ever order again.  For $30 there are better entrees to be had in The Venetian Hotel (simply put).    Had some kind of lemon merengue desert which needed help.  Tasted more like a lemon mousse to me.  Had a really good bottle of wine, a Barolo that ran $90 a bottle.  Technically the wine was the high point of our meal.  Service was okay, nothing special.  Would I eat here again?  Maybe.  I am not a pizza aficionado and most of the entrée choices did not appeal to me.  So the answer is no.  The atmosphere was okay and it was a decent place for a business dinner.  That I can attest."}
{"text":"My husband and I made a dinner reservation, but we didn't need it since it was empty when we arrived.  The plastic wrapped bread sticks kind of turned off me at first. I got the eggplant pizza and it was amazing! My husband and I shared the gelato afterwards and got the olive oil, vanilla bean, and pistachio flavors. The olive oil was amazing! Never had anything like that before and was honestly a little wary of trying it, but I'm so glad we did!"}
{"text":"I'm gonna just put it out there... pizza is awesome anytime. It's even more amazing when you're drunk. THERE, I said it. So when we left Tao Beach, tipsy and needing some nosh, Otto Enoteca was there to save us from making another Dal Toro mistake.  Service was outstanding for sure. The hostess was sweet and didn't even seem to care that we looked like little drowned rats (and we were too hungry to care). The server and his assistant were very personable and even gave hugs when requested (albeit very tentatively... probably not something they are asked for on the reg). Waters were always filled and our request for extra napkins was fulfilled quickly.  The pizza... ohhhhhh that pizza. The four of us shared a Margherita 'D.O.C.' and the Pesto, which was perfect between all of us. I love pesto anything, so I was in pesto heaven (if you can't guess which pizza I'm talking about, we can't be friends... in fact, stop reading right meow). The Margherita was bomby as well, but come on.... PESTO. Best of all, it didn't break the bank whatsoever. Obviously, the bill would have been larger had we been imbibing, but for food and good times people watching (on the \"patio\"), I would definitely return... and I plan to.    PESTO!"}
{"text":"It's overpriced but what do you expect from the Venetian.  This is probably one of the only 3 stars I frequent a few times a year because I'll bring guests here.    What I like is that you can get more authentic unique Italian dishes such as the Bucatini all' Amatriciana.  All of the pastas are served really al dente and salted because it is cooked in the pasta salt water.   The taste is real rich becuase it is cooked in bacon...yummm  The rigatoni is also really delicious which is small spiral shaped pasta served in a cauliflower ragu with garlic and chili flakes...very tasty.  The pastas were delicious but they are around $15-20 and come in small portions.  I think this place is a good spot for lunch, but as many other reviewers have mentioned, the service is attrociious.  I stiffed someone for the first time in years and for someone who's worked in F&B in my past life, it takes alot to do this.  Nevertheless, the food is good."}
{"text":"2nd time coming here and yet again the service is the worst. The host seated us immediately but then nobody came by for 20 minutes!!! So we left.    I'll never go back to Otto again!!"}
{"text":"Went to Las Vegas this past weekend and wanted to try a bunch of different style restaurants. My sister and I always wanted to try a Mario Batali restaurant when I lived in New York, but we never ended up doing it, so when we went to Vegas for the weekend we decided to give Otto a try.   We had read that they had bad reviews on service, but we had excellent and beyond attentive service. All of the wait staff were extremely kind and helpful in making recommendations and taking care of any of our needs. Carlos our waiter was awesome and we even mentioned at the end of the meal how he was so smiley and attentive and it added to our meal. I only gave this place an 3-star rating because I wasn't particularly fond of my meal.   I had the pasta carbonara and I think I had high expectations that just weren't met. I think I learned my lesson and shouldn't order items off the specials. My sister had the lasagna (and I had a few taste tests) and it was excellent. The sauce was so delicious.   We ended the meal with some housemade daily gelato. Olive oil, Vanilla Bean and Salted Caramel. I forgot to mention that we started the meal with a cheese plate. It was three different kind of cheeses - mozarella, fontina and parmesan. They serve it with bread and then small sides of honey, apricots and cherries. It was delicious but who doesn't like a good cheese.  I thought the portion sizes were more perfectly fine. I guess with some starters and dessert I felt more than fed, even despite not eating a good portion of my pasta."}
{"text":"I cannot even begin to tell you about my love affair with this place! It all began a year ago when I had my wedding reception/dinner here. Rave reviews from my party of 27. No one missed a beat, food was amazing and the staff bent over backwards. Tonight I went back for dinner and it once again was completely on point. Delicious wines, amazing apps, pizza to die for and my dinner (Branzino) blew me away! Run, don't walk to Otto on your next trip to Vegas! PS they sell the pint glasses!!!"}
{"text":"The food was quite good but a creepy man set up a mini tripod & camera on the table next to ours surreptitiously taking photos of teenage girls. With two teenage girls at our table, including my daughter, it was a highly uncomfortable experience. I spoke to the maitre d who also seemed concerned but did nothing about it. I am amazed that such a nice restaurant would allow this kind of thing."}
{"text":"Sat at the bar... Scott, our bartender, was great. All his recommendations were on point. His wine knowledge and hospitality was outstanding. The food was amazing. Will be back for sure and will highly recommend this place to everyone coming to Vegas looking for great Italian food. How can you go wrong with Mario Batali he's one of the best chefs in the world!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure why this restaurant does not have higher ratings. We had ZERO complaints, and that's unusual.   We gave the wine guy a price range for a wine and a general idea of what we like, and he picked out a wonderful Zin. We loved it. Our waiter was awesome. I wish we got his name--Asian guy. He explained the menu to us in detail and gave us great recommendations. What I like about this place is that you can get cheeses and appetizers that are relatively inexpensive and will fill you up.  We started with: -Ricotta fritters: 6 balls of cheese, rolled in bread crumbs and fried in peanut oil. TO DIE FOR -Lentils \"alla Toscana\": really tasty if you're a lentils fan -Panteleo cheese: A goat cheese--delicious -Taleggio cheese: A cow's milk cheese--also delicious  Like I said, these were all really reasonably priced and we were pretty full with them. Not full enough to skip an entree, of course. Who do you think we are?!  We decided to split the eggplant pizza. The dough was perfect--soft, but crisp. I worry about eggplant (and other veggies) making the dough soggy, but this didn't have that issue at all.  For dessert, we got the Otto Sundae. If you don't splurge on this, at least get the gelato by itself. It's housemade and SO GOOD."}
{"text":"Terrible service.  Expensive - especially for terrible service. Food was okay, but seemed overpriced.  Waiter was not good.  Slow, chatting with his fellow servers in the back bar area.  Lacked passion or interest in what he was doing (maybe he thought his white apron and ponytail were all he needed?!)    Waiter brought our salad right away, but where were the drinks we ordered? 10 minutes later, I had to go find him and ask him about our drinks!  No olive oil/balsamic dip at our table and a few paltry pieces of bread...next table had a huge pile of bread and dipping oil.  Gee, thanks guy.  Food was okay, but we ordered very basic...kinda hard to ruin a salad with shaved cheese and a basic pizza.  Waited with empty glasses...no check back.  We ate largely ignored...terrible service.    I paid the check, then nicely advised the restaurant manager that the service was terrible.  Too many other good places to eat in Las Vegas - skip it!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a poor excuse for Italian food. Two Italian chefs could seriously offer a somewhat flavorful offering. Every dish was unseasoned and bland almost as if they were pre-frozen warmed then served. For example the short rib filling in the ravioli was similar to minced meat mush. The pizza dough was definitely mass produced pre-frozen with no flavor.  Is this really the same restaurant family as Carnevino?"}
{"text":"Absolutely fantastic. Olives, squash blossoms, carbonara, squash ravioli. Service was impeccable. We were here a year ago and normally try new places but just couldn't. Amazing, highly recommend. Squash blossoms are only available in the summer but what ever they replace it with will probably be great. Go!"}
{"text":"The bad news is that Mario Batali no longer owns the restaurant.  The service and the food has gone from best to bad.  Skip it"}
{"text":"While it doesn't quite have the charm of the original Otto in NYC, it's still pretty great. I love that you can \"sit outside\" and pretend to be on a Venetian street corner while eating delicious Italian food. The service is great too. I went on a very crowded day and still had a waitress who was attentive and helpful. I got my typical margarita pizza. I like to get the simple pizza and get some sides, like the eggplant capponata or the lentils. The bread sticks are also amazing!"}
{"text":"This place has the sickest charcuterie plates. Pizza kicks ass. The hot tip, and I hear what Mario does when in Vegas, is go to Otto for appetizers,  wine cheese and meat plate, and then head down stairs and get your meat at Carnevino.  This is the gangster life boys and girls. Do it and post up , LMK how you liked living like a baller!!"}
{"text":"The food was good - the bruschetta was good. The pasta could have been cooked better, it was undercooked. The flavors in the pasta were good."}
{"text":"Wonderful service and world class atmosphere (inside one of the Venetian hotel's courtyards). Delicious and flavorful wines and a terrific list of salads."}
{"text":"I love Mario but omg I am so disappointed about the foods especially the pizza which came out cold for $20.  I eaten at  Mozza which is his other restaurant and I was hooked on the pizza .  I also ordered spaghetti with meatballs which was Not good , the sauce was too sour and tasted like someone squeeze a lemon in there.  Small portion and high prices which I don't mind if the foods is good .  I will not come back here."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance in \"St. Mark's Square.\"    Food is just OK - had the margarita pizza (cheese tasted a bit odd).  Also, had the blood orange juice - FRESHLY SQUEEZED!"}
{"text":"Amazing spot for a quick but really high quality lunch.  Their fresh bread and oil are amazing.  Every past dish my friends tried was delicious.  The squid ink pasta was particularly good.  I tried the octopus salad...cannot say enough good things!"}
{"text":"Service here was great but after we left the restaurant we noticed we were charged for 4 vodka tonics but only had 3.  Not sure if it was a mistake or intentional padding."}
{"text":"Pork shoulder was amazing.  My wife loved the chicken and eggplant.  Serivice was great.  The squash blossoms were amazing and very unique.  This is my favorite of the three Batali and Bastianich places at this particular casino."}
{"text":"I have mixed feelings about this place. After being completely blown away by the service and food at the other Batali restaurants we have patron-ed I was looking forward to a great lunch date on my recent spur of the moment Vegas trip. Although I was happy overall with my meal, I was not like BLOWN away with it nor was I extremely impressed with the service. I cannot put my finger on it exactly but our server, although pleasant was the not caliber of server I expect for this price point. A fifty dollar lunch is a fifty dollar lunch and my server should not have tacky black and white stars chipping nail polish, a wrinkled shirt, and not be extremely knowledgeable about the menu. The food came out at a good pace, we have the fried saffron rice balls, which were nice, the meats plate with some salami, and then split a pizza. The best thing about this place was the pizza crust. So thin and crisp I think it was a deciding factor in us picking up a new pizza stone at Williams and Sonoma on the drive home.  In closing, a perfectly adequate meal but for the price I was expecting to be wow'd a little more and definitely to have a more professional waitstaff."}
{"text":"Well, sorry to hear about the mediocre experiences here... our 5-person lunch was lovely.  We've been making the rounds to all the finest dining restaurants in Vegas - and this competes with the 300-700 dollar dinners we've had."}
{"text":"I had high expectations for Otto being a Los Angeles foodie but was really disappointed after having dinner here.  The service was beyond terrible for our party of 9 and we were ignored for the first 20 minutes we were at the table.  We flagged down a waitor and he took our drink order and when asked about his recommendations for the \"fritti\" on the menu, he said \"i don't like any of them, don't order them.\"  Wow, so an entire section of the menu is terrible at Mario Batali's restaurant- that is hard to believe!  I wonder what Mario would think about this waitor having said that!  Service continued to be very slow all night long for us.  We were then passed off to another waitor who was much friendlier and we finally received excellent recommendations to our group!  The Ricotta Fritters were by far the best out of the 3 we tried on the fritti menu and I would not order the Frittelle di Prosciutto again as they were much too salty and the Arancine were OK.  Margherita 'D.O.C. and Prosciutto Arugula pizzas were delicious but did not blow me away!  We ordered several pastas that were all okay too.  In the end, I would have to say that I would not be dying to return here as it was mediocre at best.  These days, terrible customer service can only get you so far and it can really ruin your experience at a restaurant!"}
{"text":"We ordered three different pasta dishes and one pizza. Unfortunately it appeared that all of the pasta, despite being different shapes, was cooked for the same amount of time; therefore my gemelli had a bit of a crunch. Brussel sprouts tasted like they were cooked with lighter fluid. Smashed potatoes were the only dish that hit it out of the park. Service was terrible... water glasses never refilled, wine list that took 15 minutes to get to the table, large gaps of time before the server would re-appear (otherwise we would have told her about the issues with the food). Will not return"}
{"text":"I wish I could give 2.5 stars.    Jim G. and I frequented this place when it was Enoteca San Marco.  Even when we previously enjoyed this place, we recognized that this was a snacks, wine, dessert kind of place.  We were never blown away by the dinner plates.  Now, with the change, things seem to have gotten worse.  We started with a salad we had loved before, the Buratta Pesto Caprese.  The cheese is excellent, as are the pine nuts.  The pesto was lacking and the tomatoes were stewed instead of fresh! What?!?! Weird.  We also shared some Verdure: Olives (plentiful dish of olives), Lentils Alla Toscana (always solid), and Eggplant Caponata (decent).  Our server had to use a rolodex looking device to explain the Caponata to us. She better have been new; she was slow, inattentive, and not too bright.  We shared a pasta and a pizza.  Both bleh! We had the Rigatoni with Pork Belly and Swiss Chard, and cheese.  How is it possible that this dish has no flavor whatsoever?!?!  One of the most boring dishes ever. What a waste!  We also shared the Sausage and Peppers pizza.  Terrible.  It says Pizzeria in the name!  Sausage was bland, pizza was apparently salt free, and the sauce was flavorless.  Waste of time.  I did not expect fine dining here, but damn, this was disappointing.  Usually Batali places offer a minimum of quality.  Otto is sad. Too pricey for such mediocre food and service."}
{"text":"Buyer beware. I chose this place in a hurry glancing at their 4star overall review. Entrees were mediocre. Salads were good. Sides were hit or miss. Extensive wine list with a pretentious sommalier.Hot food was room temp.Overall, disappointing. Would never return to the vegas location."}
{"text":"Food is amazing! Everything we ordered was  excellent. The waiters are nice and highly professional. A tip for Europeans: best selection of Italian wines I've ever found in US."}
{"text":"Y-E-S. Now..although this restaurant felt a teensy bit like a chain restaurant (must have been the look and feel of the menus and the paper-wrapped breadstick appetizers), I still enjoyed it immensely. Just make sure you can find it on your own accord since not one staff member we asked at the Venetian knew where it was. Strange.  We started the night off with the squash fritti, which was basically a french fry in squash form. I am a fan of anything fried, so you can't really go wrong here. The fritti were perfectly crispy--also a plus in my book.  I ordered the braised pork shoulder, which I was told by two servers was the best thing on the menu. It was melt in your mouth delicious! This is a no nonsense dish for those who like meat. Very few frills...just some vegetables sprinkled on top and some balsamic around the plate. Both complimented this dish very well. That's really all an avid meat-lover like me can ask for!  My friend who dined with me is admittedly not adventurous when it comes to food, so she stuck with the spaghetti and meatballs. I got one bite of a meatball, which I could barely pry away from her on account of her loving it so much. Hard for me to tell much about it in one bite, but it seemed like a very standard meatball.  We finished off the meal with a dark chocolate cake, dark chocolate gelato, graham cracker gelato and meringue all tucked into a martini shaped glass. Very yummy, and also a recommendation from our fabulous server from Turin (so sorry I failed to get his name!).   Service was fabulous, and all servers within a 10 table radius were attentive and helpful, regardless of whether you were their responsibility or not. Last but not least, I have to mention the music selection. Since Mario had been dinged for his music choice at Babbo before, I must commend his Black Crowes song flowing from the speakers inside. A little \"Sister Luck\" never hurt anyone before."}
{"text":"Otto Enoteca Pizzeria is located in St. Marks Square at the Venetian making it an ideal spot for people watching and the entertainment provided by musicians, stilt walkers and mime.  Our lunch choice was the sausage and peppers pizza. The pie consists of 6 large slices making it  more than sufficient for two people. The thin crust was nice and crusty. The sausage is a course grind with a balanced amount of fennel. The roasted peppers provided a great burst of flavor. Many dolops of silky mozzarella cheese covered the entire pie.  Service was attentive with our server Kealoha checking with us throughout to ensure all was well.  This is another great restaurant by Mario Batali and Joe Bastianch."}
{"text":"So, I was actually walking to reservations at a different restaurant with a friend when he saw the sin for this place, stopped and said; \"we need to eat here instead!\" He had heard great things about the place, so I canceled my open table reservation at the other location and headed inside.  We sat on the patio, so I can't say much for how the inside of the restaurant looks, since I never went inside. For appetizers, we ordered the fried formaggio cheese and an app that I can't remember the name of that was basically fried pizza dough wrapped with prosciutto and topped with cheese. Both were just ok at best.  For entrees, I ordered the linguine with mussels which was fantastic. The noodles had been cooked with saffron and they were really excellent. My friend has the baked ziti that was on special and it was phenomenal as well.   For dessert, we split the gelato sampler where you get to choose five flavors of gelato. We got chocolate, vanilla bean, pistachio, graham cracker and salted caramel. These were not very good at all. They weren't creamy and almost had the texture of ice milk, which was really disappointing. The flavors were pretty spot on but not all of them worked well as gelato flavors (I'm looking at you, graham cracker).   The service was decent, which is what I would expect at a place of this caliber."}
{"text":"I cannot say enough good things about this place.  When my Dad and Sister came back to town, we ended up going back there, because they loved it the first time we went there.  And once again, it not only didn't disappoint, it was better than the first time.  Carnevino used to be my favorite of Batali and Bastianich, but I am leaning toward this place now.  The food was incredible once again, but the service is WAY over the top!  It starts with the Manager Matthew, who was incredibly hospitable.  Then there was our server Ginger, who was wonderful.  However Danielle, the Sommelier was beyond great.  She brought us some free after dinner drinks to try after our meal and with dessert.  When someone asks where to go in Las Vegas, this is definitely a place that I will recommend over and over again.  Well done!"}
{"text":"If you ever need to try veal meatballs once in your life, then you must try them at Otto. Need I say more?! And the prosciutto paired with the soooo homemade mozzarella and cherry tomatoes in a smoothe pesto sauce is phenom. You may think you've done this latter menu item...however, if you've not tried it here, then you really have yet to experience just how close to Italy you can really be. All seating is outside in the grand canal shoppes area and the extensive wine inventory looks to take up much space aside from kitchen inside. Loved!"}
{"text":"This is the perfect spot for casual fine dining! I had been looking forward to coming to Otto because I have eaten at many other Batali restaurants. My one experience turned into multiple meals during my stay. I kept returning because the quality of service, food, and ambiance was worth the price and experience. I was in Las Vegas for 5 days on a work conference and I didn't come to Otto because it was convenient to my work. Rather, it was consistently a place that I felt comfortable and the food and wine selection were amazing.   All the servers provided the same quality of service and detailed knowledge of the men; this was critical to getting the exact dish I wanted. I felt taken care of and never rushed nor avoided. From the pasta, to the pizza, to the salads, all the flavors were divine and well-balanced. Plus, the daily specials helped add new and exciting items to the variety of options. This restaurant was one of the best memories of my entire trip."}
{"text":"Extremely over price for the quality of food. Pasta was dry and my guest and I were very disappointed.  I do not recommend this place. I wish they had s better food selection."}
{"text":"A trip to Vegas, to me, is never complete without the wine and cheese experience at the bar at Otto. Tucked away in the Venetian resort, Otto is a Mario Batali / Joe Bastianich venture. I cannot write a sentence about the food or pizza because my visits there are all about one treat...  The wine and cheese. They offer a really nice five dollar antipasto platter that features charcuterie, olives and some cheeses. The menu also offers cheese options that can be ordered singly or in tastings of 2-5 different types. The water buffalo mozzarella continues to be a can't miss item but the Fontina and others are great too.Nice homemade bread accompanies all orders  ....Ahh the wine ... This time we started with a wonderful Proseca and followed it with a nice glass of Sauvignon Blanc. We  topped the adventure off with a beautiful Pinot Noir that dripped fruitiness and depth. I guess i should really try eating here some day but the star for us is the wine and cheese. Love it and i think you will as well."}
{"text":"We had a terrific lunch.  I had the pizza.  Everyone else had different dishes.  We all loved everything.  Melissa was a good server as well.  Very personable and attentive."}
{"text":"Otto was very disappointing:  The place is cute but the food and the service are below average.  The caprese salad is the only thing that was worth it. The pasta and the pizza were cold when they brought them, the bread was ridiculously hard to eat and the desserts had the worst presentation.  They offered as a wine that wasn't on the menu and not even close to what we had told them we wanted. We had 5 different waiters and being the last customers in the place, it took them forever to serve us.  Try the place across the Piazza instead."}
{"text":"During my latest trip to Vegas, I visited Otto for lunch. Let me start with the service. It was very patchy. We asked if they make any changes to the menu and the waitress told a rude no. We understand that, but could have been said politely. We asked for bread three times before we got it. Then had to ask for dip/butter.   As for the food, it was very mediocrity. Not what I expected from something carrying Mario Batalli's name. Wolfgang puck is a lot better (see separate review from an earlier vacation)."}
{"text":"We had an amazing experience at Otto recently for lunch. Everything was amazing: our server was amazing, the menu was amazing, our food was amazing, and our table on the patio was amazing (in the shadow of the intriguing leaning tower of salumi).   I had to chuckle when the waitress took our pasta orders and mentioned that the pasta was prepared al dente but she could have it cooked more if we wanted, so it would be soft. It was a sweet offer. Perhaps she mistook us for people from the Midwest or something, but I laughed out loud (which was not polite, but it was a gut reaction) when my 8 year old said he liked his pasta cooked properly -- al dente. She understood the message precisely and what we received was perfectly cooked pasta with extremely flavorful sauces. So flavorful, in fact, that we acted like we were from the Midwest and sopped up the sauce from the empty plates with our bread. :)   We didn't really want to leave so we looked at the dessert menu. I almost choked on my tongue when my teenager said he wanted the \"three flavors of gelato for $12\". WHAT, I thought. (Not really.  \"What?\" is what I said; WTF is what I thought.)  But then both kids wanted that, and after reading the flavors we all wanted that. So we picked our three flavors, all four of us, and -- I CAN'T BELIEVE IT -- spent almost $50 on essentially four scoops of ice cream. But what ice cream it was. Awesome textures and flavors. The Olive Oil gelato was the most interesting ice cream I've ever eaten.  An experience we are glad we didn't miss.   We'll certainly return on a future visit to Las Vegas, or New York, or Los Angeles, or"}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service. One issue was the fact when asked to put additional mozzarella on my rigatoni an option for it on the side was made clear. This resulted in additional charges which were not mentioned. Overall excellent service and quality."}
{"text":"I have never eaten a quite pizza like this. It tastes unleavened, like matzoh.  The sauce is sweet.  The bread is crispy and simple.  It's missing chew.  It's missing char.  It's missing salt.  It's missing grease.  I'm giving it 5 stars because of its goodness and simplicity.  It drew me in because it tastes nice.  This pie lacks interesting, but is friendly and yummy.  If I was thinner, I would eat this every day while in Vegas."}
{"text":"This place was fine. The service was slow, the food was delicious enough, but certainly not sublime and the hostesses were super awful! There were 2 or 3 women, neither could be bothered to greet us properly and we sat very near to their little podium, so we got to hear their copious complaints about how busy it was. Ladies, busy is good. busy means you have a job! Yay for busy. Also, no patron wants to hear you complain. It ruins my ability to pretend I'm at a sidewalk cafe in Venice.   Here's the 5 star thing- The perserved tuna bruschetta. That was a work of art.   If you're hungry and nearby and they aren't too busy, eat here. Don't seek this place out, though."}
{"text":"Very good, beautiful view, attentive service, outstanding wine list. Caperberry pizza was yummy, the spaghetti carbonara was so good I wanted to roll around in it, and the only problem with the olive oil gelato us that there wasn't enough  of it!  Desserts are pricy, pass on the arancine."}
{"text":"Very inconsistent food and poor service.  Sauteed Broccolli Rabe had burned garlic in it that destroyed the taste. Fried califlower that was supposed to the spicy and salty was anything but -- just mush. one pasta dish was \"al dentist\" (so undercooked you could bust a tooth on it!)  Gave up before dessert.  They did take the Broccoli Rabe (the only dish we actively complained about) but not without a lecture on \"you don't understand how it's supposed to taste\" (and honestly, not wanting to get into a debate about the poor food, we didn't even mention the other issues.  We're here to have a nice time, not an argument)."}
{"text":"Hands down the best customer service we have ever experienced. Every single person was knowledgable and if they didn't have the answer they found it immediately. Michael, Andrew,  and Cesar were awesome. Plus the food was amazing."}
{"text":"The pizza here is really bad.   Someone needs to do something about it.  Watery, bland, soggy.   The location is so great. It's a shame"}
{"text":"In my opinion, this is the best restaurant in the Venetian/Palazzo complex.  I've tried a few restaurants within the Venetian, but Otto is really the only one I would go back to. The pizza was so good - if nothing else, try the pizza. I got the prosciutto, and enjoyed the crispy crust and tasty mozzarella that went along with it. The black spaghetti was an adventure I'm glad I took. If you are a fan of squid/calamari, the spaghetti is for you. If not, then try something else.   Most of the restaurants on the Vegas strip are overpriced for mediocre food. I did NOT find this to be the case with Otto. The prices are similar to other places on the strip, but the food was FAR superior."}
{"text":"Decided to drop by & grab a pie (pizza). I love Joe Bastianich, but haven't tried his restaurants so when in vegas why not? This is a restaurant partnership w/ him & Mario Batali so I thought the food would be great, but was disappointed. We got the Proscuitto Arugula pizza as recommended by the waitress. I LOVE proscuitto and the ingredients for the pizza sounded simple yet delicious especially w/ fresh mozarella.  Took about 20 mins for the pizza. I liked the crust, it was thin and crispy. The ratio of ingredients to sauce was on spot. However, I felt the pizza was way too oily. Proscuitto was drenched in oil and very salty. The arugula was good and didn't have that bitterness to it. There also weren't too much mozzarella :( Overall I don't think I'd come here again to pay $20 for the exact same pizza I could get at pieology. Well you can't get proscuitto at pieology, but the crust and everything else tasted the same."}
{"text":"I would be surprised if Mario Batali has tasted the food in this outlet lately.  If he has, I'm surprised he allows his name to be used here.  Everything was pretty mediocre.  Don't bother."}
{"text":"This is a very simple review: start your Vegas trip here for lunch! Great spot to people watch and oww and ahh at the sights. We order the prosciutto pizza which was exceptional and the tomato and burrata app which was uber fresh. The service was a little spotty but that can be expected at a lot of Vegas establishments for some reason. Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I am giving 2 stars just because of the price/quality ratio, but nothing more than a 3. Overall food may  The location is very cool, at the St Marc place inside the Venetian. It offers both outside and inside with a large and nice wine list. We were not in a mood for a big feast but just wanted some fresh and delicate italian food. My friend ordered the pizza and it was very disappointed. Ingredients aren't very fresh and the recipes aren't very exciting. I ordered the pasta with lamb ragu and my other friends got the meat balls. Both dishes were recommended by our waiter. To start with, the portions are extremely small. I am european so I do not except to have a huge plate of pasta but unless you have a massive lunch, you will be hungry after this. This goes against the italian food spirit... The ragu was ok. The lamb was great but it was lacking a lot of flavor. The sauce was very basic tomato sauce which I suspect they use in every dish. My friend got the same sauce in the meat balls. Unfortunately, the meat balls were so small that you couldn't get full flavor of the meat which I think is key.  Anyway, I do not think i will go back there. Too expensive for what it is just because the owner is famous and doesn't deliver on high quality food. I don't mind paying big $$$$ at all when it comes to food but it just has to be top. This was not the case...."}
{"text":"What an unbelievable disappointment. The highlight of the meal was getting out of the terribly uncomfortable chairs as we left.  We had reservations through the hotel concierge but still had to wait for our table. When we were seated, we made the apparently unforgivable decision not to order alcohol and were promptly ignored by the waitstaff. It's been a long time since I've had such a grumpy waiter.    Imagine my surprise when the waiter dropped off a plastic package of \"cracker-like\" breadsticks. At the time I was surprised, but more was to come. We ordered a set of appetizers, a pizza, and a salad for the two of us, earning an impressive sigh and eye roll from the waiter who returned with a small plate of actual bread (from costco I think) with some oil and vinegar.  Now, most Italian places take pride in their olive oil and vinegar, and with the chef Mario connection my expectations were high. But this oil might as well have been canola, and the vinegar was merely caramel colored and bland.  After my water glass had been dry for about ten minutes someone showed up and dropped our appetizers on the table. The mozzarella was burned and the squash blossom was a grease bomb going off in my mouth. Both lacked any real flavor.  The caprese salad was a decent preparation, but the tomatoes were not very flavorful and the pesto had an unfortunate amount of mint.  The pizza arrived after another ten minutes. And was the wrong pizza. The girl who brought it offered to let us keep it, but was going to add it to our bill if we did. We really wanted the pizza we ordered, and when we said so she took the other pizza away in a huff.  20 minutes later, our ordered truffle pizza arrived. It looked pretty good, smelled good, and we were excited that this might be turning around finally. Alas, I could barely get down one bite. My wife managed two. The pizza was bitter, the truffles were burned and flavorless, and the whole thing was drenched in the same flavorless oil that they served with the bread.   The high point of the meal turned out to be the prepackaged cracker sticks that arrived first. If course, the waiter wouldn't do anything about our 9/10ths uneaten meal, so for $70 we got to come back to our hotel room and snack from the minibar. Yuck."}
{"text":"We had a pre wedding party for 40 here Friday night. Amazing service and care to detail. The food was amazing as with the wine. Everyone had a blast highly recommend this place"}
{"text":"Really???  Otto Enoteca may just be a name unrelated to food as far as I'm concerned.  Mario Batali may have his name all over this restaurant but if he only knew the crappy service provided by their staff I don't think he would be too happy.  I am an honest diner with a world trained palate and this place, in my views, is just average.  Pizza isn't really worth trying.  New York's Lombardi's and Grimaldi's step all over this place, even a little known place called Adrienne's located in New York's Stone Street can beat their so called \"prosciutto and arugula\" pizza the waiter spoke so highly of.  How is it that a simple task of taking orders becomes such a complicated matter?  Waiter is assigned a table that has a number on the dining floor layout for ease of service.  Waiter comes to table, waiter enumerates diners, waiter writes orders in chronological order, runner delivers orders in the same order within reasonable waiting time.  Basic right?  Not at Otto's.  The runner is going around four or five tables asking if someone ordered the cauliflower fritters.  He even delivered the first batch to the wrong table, who had just placed the same order literally 45 seconds prior to delivery by runner.  They must think the service there is so excellent because their order only took 45 seconds.  We had to wait 25 minutes for our fritters.  A waiter nor runner should ask who ordered a specific dish at a table with multiple diners.  Flavor wise this place has a lot to ask for.  I can only salvage the Gemelli with home made sausage and broccoli rabe.  It may just be the only thing they got right at this place.  Prices are outrageously high for this type of food.  All in all the place can be a lot better. And for their prices you should expect that much high standard of service and attention.  Not the concept here.  The concept is: Otto's is a celebrity chef's restaurant therefore prices should be high without regards for service and ambiance.  Dining should be a memorable experience with food you can't cook at home.  Not at Otto's."}
{"text":"Waited 20 mins at 3:20 pm at bar with water and menus.  Empty restaurant.  No service completely ignored us.  Mario, please get control of this restaurant.  We talked to a wonderful relative of one of your employees at another place and she was mortified.  Not her experience at Otto.  She swore it's a first rate place.     You have a management issue.  They let us walk off without caring at all.  We weren't rude at all.  Not at all.  I want to rate higher because I am conflicted here.  I'm so sorry.  We are big time foodies.  Not dressed well at time of our visit.  Your manager failed and it put us in a sad mood.  Our first experience with you was ruined.  I don't want to go back.  Ended up at Buddy V and service was immediate.  Atmosphere better.  Chill music.  Food seems good but I had no food at Otto.  Not by my choice.  Soup and bread at BV in three minutes.  Any of Buddy V Asian girls run circles around every employee at Ottos.  We watched for two hours.  You can tell when there is love in food and service.  This place is killing it on all fronts."}
{"text":"Holy Panzanella salad, batman!! Everything is made fresh, pizzas and pastas are light and delicious. And of course, the Panzanella rocks- a must try! I have eaten here three times and it's been fantastic every time- service, food, everything. I would definitely come back!"}
{"text":"This was one of the best meals I've had in a long time. We were in town on vacation and ended up in the Venitian. We saw Otto's menu and decided to give it a try. We pretty much allowed our server \"Ginger\" to pick out our meal and she picked nailed it!! We liked it so much we went back again the next night to try some other items. It is reasonably priced, has terrific service and outstanding atmosphere."}
{"text":"Of all the restaurants I have tried, this is the most memorable culinary experience! Second time I came back for what i had had before but the seasonal menu had changed and I was tempted by the special, a citrus and grilled brussel sprouts gourmet pizza ! I don't even like brussel sprouts very much, but the way the chef blended these flavors was divine..... And because my order was mixed up,  they offered a free unique dessert, which was....heavenly!"}
{"text":"Got takeout pizza from here and it was ok. The flavors were not that impressive and they made the crust too wide. I usually have trouble not gorging myself when eating pizza, but I had no problem limiting myself with this one."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! I love Otto! I have been here twice and I had an amazing experience! They have excellent service, food and ambience! It's really nice because it feels like you're in Italy because you're at The Venetian with the blue sky and Italian architecture and when I was there they always play the violin across from the restaurant. It is not too busy but it is such a calming, relaxing experience and Otto is a great place to unwind. I always have a warm reception and they have delicious options and the waiters and waitresses always give you excellent service and help recommend dishes. I like how they actually know what they are talking about and describe in great detail and enthusiasm which is so helpful and greatly appreciated. Go for a full meal with dessert because it is so good! Their wine is really good! I can't wait to come back to Otto!! :)"}
{"text":"Coming from a girl who's first word was \"pizza\" let me tell you this place left me speechless.   We ordered the \"Gnocco Fritto\" with the \"Prosciutto di Parma\" to start. The dough was fried perfectly and the fresh grated parmesan was the freshest I have ever tasted. Then ordered the \"Margherita D.O.C\" which was topped with an amazing tomato sauce that was seasoned just right, bufala mozzarella and basil. That pizza alone was breathtaking, but the real winner here was the \"Pesto\" pizza. Thin wood fired crust topped with ricotta, olive oil, and green pesto. When it arrived I admit it looked like the pesto was going to be overpowering and bitter, but boy was I wrong. I have never tasted such a balance of flavors in one bite. The medley of cheese and pesto was perfect. Was disappointed that I didn't get a chance to try the pasta because I'm sure it is amazing as well.  If you like REAL Italian food, I suggest you try this place."}
{"text":"Wonderful taste of Italy Fast and friendly service combined with delicious food is a winning ticket. May be it was the day we ate there or the food that was delivered to them, but the tomatoes in the caprese salad were so tough and the skin was unchewable. Like the rest of Vegas this is an expensive restaurant but worth it."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a 'snack' before a show.  Let them know we were in a hurry and they were more than accommodating.  The waitress was prompt and the food was fantastic.  The pizza was unbelievable.  It was around $15 or so for a personal size (we shared, it was a snack) and was perfect.  This restaurant is perfect where it counts, execution and quality of ingredients.  The ambience is nice, inside the venetian canal shops.  Highly recommend and will be back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Service was decent but wouldn't go back here because we didn't enjoy our dinner. Ordered the Penne Alla Norma and the four cheese pizza but was not happy with the food.. flavors were there but the pasta was undercooked! Overpriced for below average food."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch. I had the fried ricotta balls and the pizettes. Pizette has a strong basil flavor which was delicious. Service is lacking, my waiter just asked me how my food is for the first time now that I have one bite left. I had to ask to hostess for a side of marinara since he was no where to be found. I'd return for the food. I wouldn't return for the service.  Update: I decided to complain to manager. She just said sorry and asked if there was anything else she could do. I said no. I'm surprised my bill was not reduced. Then I proceeded to wait to pay for my bill. Bizarre experience."}
{"text":"We had the cauliflower fritter and margarita pizza. The fritters were amazing!!!! But the pizza was a huge disappointment. I would only come back for the fritter"}
{"text":"I like the original in NYC a little better, but a B&B dining experience rarely fails to deliver.   Our server was super nice, attentive and understanding that our group of 4 guys was on the 1st night of our 48 hour trip to Vegas ... party time.   I did really like sitting \"outside\" on their \"terrace,\" it was a very cool and different experience.  Plus there was so much other noise and activity out there it didn't really matter how loud our group was."}
{"text":"Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich don't disappoint :)  Stopped by for a quick early dinner after the show at Sands Convention Center and enjoyed the food, didn't have too much time to take in the experience. Wish we did... the appetizers and the wine list were so tempting! served on the wooden board... there is also a giant almost \"monument to ham\" in the middle of the bar - a display with their cured meats that they thinly slice, beautifully arrange on wooden boards, add a little bit of nuts, cheeses... did I really have to make it to my plane?    Well, wasn't my first time at the spot (and won't be last either, I guess) but this time either I was paying more attention, or the food was much better.  We each had a salad, one of the vegetables and a pizza to share. Grilled Radicchio with smoked mozzarella was super flavorful and absolutely delicious - dressed with good aged balsamic.  The arugula salad with parmesan cheese was also pretty good. And, of course, the classic - Margherita 'D.O.C.'.   Now, may be I am being picky, but... wish there was always water in my glass and bread on the table... just sayin', good service would be nice, especially since they weren't too busy yet :)"}
{"text":"It really pains me to give this place just a 3 star rating.  The food is definitely 4 star all around.  The pizza a 5.  Why the 3 stars you ask?    The Service!  The service was not great, heck it wasn't even good.  Let's get the bad part of the review out of the way.  We were seated towards the side near the back, and behind us were 2 other tables that the waitstaff had to keep squeezing by us to get back there.  Annoying.  Our drinks were not kept filled, in fact, I think the waitress only asked once if we needed anything.  Other than that, she would walk by us very quickly and just say Enjoy.  At once point another table was madly and frantically waving their arms to get her attention, so she went over there to help them, and promptly disappeared before taking our dessert order.  She was gone quite awhile.  When she did come back, she took our order, but didn't write it down.  Time goes by, she comes back and double checks my order, and said, Oh, I got it wrong then, I'll have to put it in again.  The restaurant was not that busy, and this type of service was inexcusable in my book.  Especially at the prices you are paying.  I know its Vegas, everything is overpriced, but for a casual restaurant some prices were high for what you got (mostly talking about dessert). Plus we were not told about any specials, then a few minutes later we hear our waitress reciting specials to the table next to us!  We ordered an appetizer of fried eggplant.  The order was much bigger than I expected.  The waitress asked if I wanted dipping sauce with it, so I said yes.  Turns out that dipping sauce was an extra $2.  Thats fine, but I hate when restaurants do that, I feel like I'm getting the wool pulled over my eyes.  Eggplant and sauce were delicious.  We got a margherita pizza which was FABULOUS!  Crust, sauce and cheese were perfect!  the 2 salads were good, and decently sized (we got 2 smalls instead of sharing a large one)  Dessert, we each got a trio of gelato.  One combo was chocolate malt, espresso and graham cracker.  Second set was huckleberry sorbet, concord grape sorbet and vanilla gelato.  Each item tasted great, but the portions were skimpy for the accompanying price tag of $12 each set.  I know they are using local ingredients etc.  But when 2 desserts tally $24 they better be mind blowing and they werent.  Would I go back? Yes, especially for the pizza."}
{"text":"We were seated immediately and without reservations ... weirdly, this should have been a sign. The busser was a delight ( he was warm, smiling, and even chatted with my brother about the football game) ... the server was cold and repeatedly failed to explain the menu. When we stated that we would not be having wine with our dinner that night, he seemed aggravated (it's not always an option for those who must drive later). When shown the cheese selection on the back of the menu, I inquired if these were options for a cheese course. I was told no ...  with no further explanation. (And there was zero explanation on the menu other than that it is so many dollars for one, so many for two, so many for three ... for what? A wedge? A serving? I still have no idea. The same applies to the appetizers and when I asked the server, his answer was inscrutable. We opted to skip both the cheeses and the appetizers. Obviously.)  Our tables was presented with a small portion of bread ... with no oil (and no butter). Once the sampling was nearly depleted, the server asked if we wanted butter \"or something.\" Erg.  The entrees were lovely. I had the Pasta Norma ... the eggplant was delicate and well prepared (I am not usually a fan of eggplant, but this was the only vegetarian option ... and I ended up getting lucky here). However, but my boyfriend and brother ordered the steak which was covered in a mountain of Parmesan and arugula ... both moved the majority of this to the side. Kind of a waste.  We would have loved to sink into dessert, but we all agreed that viewing another menu at this eatery was not an option. And, certainly, we would receive no help from our server. We would have easily invested double the amount into this meal ... but we literally could not.   The service was so stressful and the menu so cryptic, we literally could not enjoy the experience. (And, the din was virtually unbearable. Be prepared for one LOUD experience.) Such a pity ..."}

Food Ordered: Linguine with mussels, and a margherita pizza  Food Quality: Small portion of a decent linguine with sparse, overcooked, tiny mussels.  The margherita pizza was unremarkable.

{"text":"This is one of my family's favorite restaurants in Vegas!  I don't each much pasta, but I love the homestyle pastas and handmade thin pizzas here. The food is always satisfying without being too trendy or showy. I may be in the minority, but I'd eat at Otto over Bouchon any day.   Otto is pretty packed all the time and the servers area always running around, but they are knowledgeable of the menu, what ingredients are in the dishes and if you ask, they will recommend wines to pair with entrees. I like that they don't try to upsell you on items.  Some stand out dishes are the seafood diavola, osso bucco and the margherita pizza. A nice touch is the special pastas and bruchettas they serve daily and those are listed on the back of the main menu.   On Sunday, they had a ricotta bruchetta with pesto and almonds.  I had never had the combination before and it was a wonderful starter.  The pesto was super garlicky which I love and with the housemade ricotta the flavors were strong and balanced.  Desserts here are amazing. Try them all!  I liked the strawberry shortcake best.  Though a year ago, they had a fig or date shake that no one liked but me. LOL.    It is also nice that there is tons of people watching to be done from the outdoor area.  Great food and entertainment, too. Win-win!"}
{"text":"WOW I am definitely surprised by the number of stars this place has been rated by people. This was probably THE MOST disappointing meal of my life. I ordered a pasta, described as with pecorino and pepper , and this was exactly what I got.  It was disgustingly plain looking,  as it was just narrow, long pasta noodles with pepper, cream,  EXTREME amounts of salt, and the cheese (pecorino) was melted and mixed in.  It was NOT even garnished with any parsley or any greens, it was just plain pasta--no veggies at all.  Presentation was horrible. It was just piled on a very plain plate, not even on an attractive plate.  It tasted like I just threw a box of spaghetti noodles in, mixed some cheese in and threw some pepper on. This place is in a PRIME location at Venetian, so I was definitely surprised at the quality of the food. Mario Batali, your name has forever been tarnished in my mind because your name is on this restaurant. My meal was the most dissatisfying meal I have ever had, and to top it off, I PAID someone to make me this horrible dish, I didn't even make myself the worst meal of my life!!!  It was $17, which I thought to myself (based on the location/looks/chef Mario Batali's name on the restaurant) seemed like a bargain, but I was let down almost instantaneously with one bite. The best part of this visit was probably the packaged breadsticks they give you in the beginning of the meal-- yes, individually packaged breadsticks, which were not even good.   I went in a group of about 7 people, and I tried everyone's dish-- it all tasted the same--but theirs just looked better. I thought maybe I had just picked the bad menu item, but they were all bad!! I think though the worst dish was the \"salad\"--and we were all confused because the \"salad\" included radicchio + mozzarella. It sounded good on the menu--although I am not a fan of radicchio because of the strong bitter taste, I decided to try it. To my surprise there existed a dish even WORSE than my own! It was not a bed of fresh, raw veggies + fresh mozzarella-- it was in fact cooked radicchio mixed with melted mozzarella. It was an epic mess.   So disappointed by Mario Batali's cuisine. I will NEVER be returning here NOR will I be going to any of his restaurants because clearly this restaurant is ruining his image, and nothing is being done about it.   I will NEVER be returning to this restaurant,"}
{"text":"Otto whether in NYC or Vegas is a great go to. You will always have a good meal here. The pizzas, salads, pastas, and specials are fantastic. It is a great place to go with a group so you can order several things to split so everyone gets a bite of everything."}
{"text":"I love Mario and was so looking forward to this meal  but left  sadly dissatisfied.  On the positive side our service was very good and the server was very helpful with his personal suggestions and honest opinions. The food came out quick and was very hot.  On the down side the food is pricey for what you get. I had the special shrimp pizza for $20 and while good it was not \"that\" good. The special melon salad with prosciutto was a major disappointment. The melon was very unripe and was hard. There was way too much mint on the salad which overpowered the bland melon also the tiny sliver of prosciutto  did not justify the $14 price tag. The assortment of fritti we tried were a  mixed bag with the cauliflower being excellent but the squash blossoms squirted out their hot filling right onto my wife making quite a mess. The server said that happens some times.... Maybe a warning would be appropriate. We did like the gelato sundae dessert as it was rich and creamy and not over sweet.  I wanted to love this place but the $100 price tag was just not justified. I will continue to wear my orange Mario crocs with pride"}
{"text":"We have eaten here several times over the past 10 years.  Our most recent visit was terrible.  The drinks were mixed terribly. Service was indifferent. Our pasta was served using the wrong pasta noodle. We agreed to eat it anyway and could barely chew it.  The manager agreed to comp the drinks.  That was our last visit."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Mario Batali's restaurant. Our server Marissa was AMAZING. Best I've ever had. The food was incredible. We selected three cheeses as an appetizer and they were fresh and made in house. The main courses were great as well. The caprese salad was different than the usual we are used to here in the States but definitely impressive."}
{"text":"I will say that Otto has this going for it: It's a great spot for picky eaters. There are several standard dishes, and a few that elevate the usual suspects to a new level. For appetizers we ordered the eggplant caponata, which had a nice tart-sweet flavor but seemed like too small a portion for four people, as well as the fried cauliflower, which I really enjoyed. I loved how dark and crispy the breading was, and it didn't feel too greasy, either. The corn & crab ravioli was my entree choice and I think it was the right one---it felt light but also filling, and the swiss chard on top was a nice addition. The lasagna was good but nothing to write home about; the pizza was a little too salty and the tomato sauce tasted like it could be from a jar. And unfortunately the pasta alla norma was a big disappointment: the eggplant pieces were so tiny, there wasn't enough cheese, and the sauce tasted like a standard vodka sauce. None of the desserts sounded very appetizing so we didn't try any of them, but it was nice of our server to give my parents a free glass of champagne each for their anniversary. The ambiance in the Venetian hotel was cool, especially when we first arrived and there was live entertainment."}
{"text":"I really like this place for its simple dishes yet fresh, flavorful ingredients.    We ordered a variety of things, including their cheese platter (served with truffle honey, cherries and fresh orange marmalade- the best condiments a cheese could ever have), a sampler of various cold tapas (7 small dishes in all which were all pretty good), a margherita pizza, a few pasta dishes, and their osso bucco which was flavorful but not as tender as I would have liked it (it also didn't have the bone marrow which I normally love in osso bucco)."}
{"text":"Below average for Vegas food. The pizza wasn't bad but wasn't good either, it definitely let a lot to be desired. It is in a nice location and service was friendly but other than convenience I wouldn't come back."}
{"text":"On my last 2 trips to Vegas, I had wanted to try this place.  Especially since it is backed by Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich.  Finally, on this trip I got to try it.  It most definitely did not disappoint.    Service:  Fantastic.  As a solo dinner, they didn't offer to seat me at the bar or give me the pity look.  And since this was the \"getting over the guy\" trip, this was super helpful.    Food:  I ordered the Caprese, the Bucatini with cured pork and onions, and for dessert, the Dark Chocolate.  All three dishes were absolutely delicious.  It's been a few days and I want that meal again, like right now.    Since its in that square area of the Venetian, the atmosphere was really cool.  Needless to say, I was extremely impressed.  I walked out with a full belly and a smile!  Thank you, OTTO!"}
{"text":"Order the cocktail called 'the viale', it is one of the best bourbon drinks I've ever had."}
{"text":"I'm old and still occasionally do things \"old school.\"  In this case, I asked somebody at the Venetian to recommend a place to eat.  They said the pizza at Otto was great.  They were wrong.  So, in a nutshell, the service was bad, the food was bad, and on the flip side, it was expensive.  By bad food I mean tasteless and overcooked.  My sausage and pepper pizza was a thin, tired looking, dark red sheet of cardboard.  The best part were the crushed red peppers the waiter eventually brought because they had both a nice kick and a nice flavor to them.    You don't have the excuse I did.  You have already shown you are smart by using Yelp and if you still got to this place and are disappointed, you'll have nobody to blame but yourself."}
{"text":"We sat at the bar; great people watching spot. We shared the pizza of the day, which was meatball, and a small argula salad.  Pizza was thin crust with a little red sauce, very similar style to pizza I had with my Italian relatives near Venice. You don't need to spent a lot to enjoy this meal."}
{"text":"This Otto is just like the original in NYC, only more expensive.   We came here for a light snack after an afternoon of drinking as it was one of the closer restaurants in sight. Because I have visited the NYC Otto on several occasions and knew that most prepared foods are not their strong suit, we ordered just a few of the verdure vegetable plates to share. Just as I had expected, the cold vegetables were all pretty good and affordable as 5 sizable portions cost just under $30. Ask for a couple of refills of their complimentary focaccia and your party can have a pretty filling snack for cheap even in the Venetian."}
{"text":"Worst food ever. I felt really sorry to my friends to bring here. Margherita and spaghetti was really bad. Domino pizza is so much better then this place. Dont waste your money and value time."}
{"text":"Took the kiddies here for lunch since its a pizzeria mainly but also as part of a self guided food tour. The food was really good.   We ordered the arancini and squash blossoms appetizers. I loved the arancini which were creamy on the inside with pretty intense flavor but still very crunchy on the outside. I like the squash blossoms which had an interesting flavor of mint and ricotta and anchovy. My family weren't fans of the squash blossoms. We also tasted the bufala mozzarella taster with truffle honey (so delicious!), apricot mustarda, and some kind of flavored cherries. All of those accompaniments were awesome and really gave the creamy cheese what it needed with the cheese being like a blank canvass.   Next we moved onto the pizza which was pretty good. The sausage and peppers was good. I expected the sausage to be spicier, it wasn't, but it was flavorful. We also got the Quattro Formaggio pizza which had four cheeses all in their own places on the pizza, not blended, totally separated on the pizza so you can taste each cheese by itself. The pizza crust was also really thin and delicious. I LOVE thin crust pizza. Very delicious."}
{"text":"My wife and I stopped by for a glass of wine before a concert because we had walked by it twice while staying at the Venetian and it looked interesting.  Plus, since it was a Mario Batali restaurant, we wanted to see how it compared to Carnevino and B&B Ristorante.    The bartender who served us at the bar was knowledgeable and attentive.  He was also very friendly.  My wife chose one of his cheese selections to add to her Prosciutto Di Parma plate and she was pleased with it.  We thought it was a bit ridiculous that they ask you if you want a side of Pomodoro sauce and then ding you $7 for it but it's Vegas and even an extra napkin will probably cost $1.  We are used to it.  The wine he suggested was not her favorite but she wanted to try a Pinot Grigio that was a bit different.  I ordered one of my favorite white wines:  Bastianich Vespa Bianco so I was very pleased since it is not easy to find.  Mario Batali restaurants seem to carry it in Las Vegas however because I last had it at his B&B Ristorante.  The atmosphere and the experience would most likely be enough for us to return in the future."}
{"text":"Very good experience here and I would go back. The staff was very nice and our server was very helpful with the menu.  My old lady likes to ask questions about the menu - not in a quizzing kind of way but she just likes to hear more about certain dishes to help her make a choice.  Our server was really helpful and offered other suggestions as she saw my old lady leaning towards certain things. I went with a goat cheese pizza and she had I think it was osso buco.  we split the vinegar maker's salad as well.  I enjoyed my pizza and she enjoyed her entree as well.  Yeah - the pizza was expensive but it still felt like a filling dinner at a very nice place for $20 so I have no complaints.  The salad was awesome.  I had never had proper balsamic vinegar before - I have just had the grocery store stuff.  The real stuff is really great and I can see why it is so expensive.   The atmosphere is fantastic.  We sat out on an 'indoor patio' where you still had the feel of people walking around and hearing the music, etc. - all while being in climate controlled comfort. Honestly - we went to Vegas to try some restaurants but did not want to break the bank either.  This place was spot on IMO.  It was what we would consider a splurge type of place in terms of quality, with only a 'moderate splurge' pricetag."}
{"text":"We love Venetian and the St. Mark square.  It was first time trying this restaurant. It has a great ambiance, food was great and prices are reasonable too. We ate here for lunch. We ordered the mozzarella, tomatoes pesto w/ prosciutto as an appetizer, rigatonni w/ pork and veal pasta as an entree. My husband ordered the goat cheese and pancetta pizza. The crust was so crunchy and pizza tasted yummy. We loved our appetizer and would highly recommend it.  Our waiter was great and friendly. He suggested the appetizer. They had a show at the square which we got to watch while eating. We had a 2 yr old who also enjoyed the food . We will  definitely come back."}
{"text":"We randomly tried this restaurant while walking around the Venetian.  What a wonderful random choice.  I got the linguine and mussels.  Wow!  I didn't know I liked saffron.  Really amazing flavor!  My husband had the short rib which was also delicious.  The dessert was on the sweet side for me personally but everything else was spot on."}
{"text":"Both the service and dinner were impeccable! I was like a giddy school girl eating at Joe Bastianich's restaurant.  Our waiter was amazingly helpful and put together an amazing charcuterie board for us.  We were also on time to see a great \"street\" performance. This is a must visit when coming to Vegas."}
{"text":"Walking through the shops at the Venetian, we passed by this restaurant.  It has a large patio seating and the menu boasted some Italian items that sounded delish, so we stopped by for lunch.  Here's what we ordered:  Salad, $8 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/otto-enoteca-pizzeria-las-vegas?select=MGVFJp-IduwmkVwnGYlWEA#MGVFJp-IduwmkVwnGYlWEA http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/otto-enoteca-pizzeria-las-vegas?select=0as7DhbONBS1Vu7XT1jc7g#0as7DhbONBS1Vu7XT1jc7g  Quattro Formaggi Pizza (Taleggio, Cacio, Ricotta, Mozzarella), $19 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/otto-enoteca-pizzeria-las-vegas?select=_fF0e-Rl3eMzZB5ksynqtw#_fF0e-Rl3eMzZB5ksynqtw  Ravioli, $23 http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/otto-enoteca-pizzeria-las-vegas?select=miaVR9NiHw9BcsMa3-DrwA#miaVR9NiHw9BcsMa3-DrwA  The Salad was good.  It came with a Balsamic Vinaigrette Dressing and was topped with thin slices of Proscuitto.  The Pizza was *meh*.....it lacked flavor.  It was a \"4 Cheese\" Pizza and each of the 4 sections of the Pizza had the different Cheeses...they weren't blended.  Each section was bland.  I was really disappointed.  The Ravioli was good, but not great.  Overall, it was a very average lunch....and for the price, it should've been outstanding.  Return Factor - 30%"}
{"text":"We enjoyed our meal at Otto! The food was good, our waitress was engaging and friendly, and the ambiance was fun - you felt like you were outdoors without actually being cold! We made a reservation ahead of time and there was no wait.  We ordered a plate of Gorgonzola, the fried cauliflower and fried ricotta balls as an appetizer, then two types of pizza and the veal and ricotta meatballs, and a very nice and reasonably priced bottle of Chianti and cannoli.   The Gorgonzola was tasty and was served with honey, cherries and apricots, which was nice. The fried cauliflower was GREAT - unique texture and delicious flavor. The ricotta balls were like a fancy jalapeno popper and were tasty too.   I really loved our pizza margarita - I love buffalo mozzarella and the sauce was flavorful enough to balance it - and my friend's four cheese pizza was good (except there was way too much ricotta on the ricotta slices). We shared an order of the meatballs, and were so happy that we did. The meatballs were moist and flavorful. I wish the polenta had been less \"grit\" style, and that there had been more of it - there was MAYBE a couple tablespoons and we were expecting a little more, but it was good.  And the canolli was delicious - three small canolli with creamy filling that wasn't overly sweet. It was just sweet enough that you weren't overwhelmed, but not saccharine-y.  The reason they don't get more stars - I wish some of the portions were larger - I get that Vegas is super expensive AND this is the restaurant of a famous chef, but other places in Vegas have a better cost/portion ratio.   Also, the pizza was delicious but the crust was just a TINY bit overcooked for my taste. I like a pizza that has a firm but slightly chewy crust, and the crust here was too crispy all the way through. And the bread they give you was kind of flavorless and dry - good for the cheese my friend put on it but otherwise kind of bland.   I'd like to go back and try out some other menu items but it'll have to be the next time I'm ready to splurge!"}
{"text":"Great pizza, great location with ample people watching in the 'courtyard'. Extensive, if expensive, wine list and full bar.  Recommend the Romano pizza, all are thin crust brick oven style. Delicious!"}
{"text":"This place was really nice. We were seated in a room with wine bottles everywhere, kinda cool. We got an appetizer of meat and cheese and that was nice. Wish they told us to double up on the order though it wasn't enough for 5 people. I had a few of their signature cocktails and they were very tasty!! The service was exceptional, we even had the chef come out and deliver our food. They were very attentive and fast! Okay so the not so great part is all the past dishes we order we sooooo beyond salty I have to eat a piece a bread with every bite to take away some of the salt. My grandma is a salt lover and she started salting her pasta when the chef stopped her and even mentioned that the pasta is cooked in extremely salty water. Also my pasta came with pork cheek which is a salty meat so I got salt on salt. It was difficult to eat. It's sucks to cause I could tell if the salt was taken down it would of been such an amazing dish! I still cleaned my plate because I was honestly starving and it was a nice meal. I would come her again and maybe try some other things on the menu."}
{"text":"When in Vegas I always sit here at Otto bar and eat. As others have mentioned service is always half assed but I still come and do enjoy the ambience of the Venetian St Mark Plaza. But  tonight was the worst.  I dine alone since it's work related and asked the hostess if i could sit at the almost empty bar. She said yes and pointed around toward back.  Even though all front sests were open I said OK and walked the circle to the back. She gave me a menu and there I sat for 20 minutes. Not a bartender or waiter in sight.  Finally I picked up my briefcase and walked over to Mercato where I had a great experience.  Something is off and not quite right service wise at Otto. Hopefully they read Yelp and might try to improve on their shortfalls."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money.  This was one of the worst restaurants I have ever been in, no excuses for it being Las Vegas.   1. The waitress was a snob and used hard sell tactics.  She made outragious claims about the food.  She told us \"everything\" was organic.  Not likely.  She went on to say how the quality of everything was so special that none of us would have every had anything that good.  I have been in the food business for years and was insulted by her implication that we were country bumpkins. When we didn't order the dessert she told us not to get any from the adjascent vendor, cause it had artificial colors and flavors.  WTF.  When she couldn't sell us \"everything\" she abruptly left and pretty much ignored us for most of the time we were there.  2, There were 6 of us.  (2) couples EACH shared a salad and one entree. The other couple each had a entree, no salad.  No one had dessert and only one person had a drink (a coke).  The bill was 180.00  I could stop here but.........  3. When my husband and I asked for the dressing for the octopus salad to be on the side, she pretty much rebuked us and said it was the best lemon vinaigrette we had ever tasted and we must have it on the salad.  Ok, we did.  Never even tasted it.  The salad was $14.00 and had a couple of pieces of octopus and a couple of pieces of potato.  It was ordinary.  4. My husband and I ordered the Grimalini.  It was so undercooked that I could not eat it.  The waitress overheard me say this and after commenting that I didn't understand what al dente was took it back.  When it finally came back, it was almost the same as it had been.  There was about (3) tablespoons of overcooked dried out sausage and some rapini (not bad).  I did not eat it at all. The bread was aweful and my husband had to ask for oil.   5. My husband's uncle ordered the meat balls and spaghetti.  It was the smallest portion I have ever seen for an entree.  There was a handful of marble sized meat balls???? I can only imagine what they tasted like.  6.  The others didn't complain about their meals.  7. While waiting to go to the ladies room I could see into the kitchen.  There was a large tub of chicken sitting out unrefrigerated.  It was there when we came in and it was there when we left.  Someone call the health department.  Mario Batteli YOU GOT TO BE KIDDING.  Take a look at your restaurant.  If this is the best you can do................"}
{"text":"What a bust.   As we were deciding on the pizza, the sommelier came around to suggest a wine for us, which I really appreciated because I couldn't decide which to try, they serve only Italian wine, which was a plus. You do have the option of by the glass, and the ounces vary from 4-8 oz. We let our server pick our pizza for us, he suggested the Sweet Onion, (proscuitto cotto, bel paese) the crust was pleasant, like a typical version of thin, crisp Neapolitan-style, but the way the prosciutto was placed really threw me off, it was literally slices like what you would put on a sandwich, placed all over the pizza. The pizza was really lacking in flavor as well. We also split an arugula salad, which was also a miss. I don't see myself visiting this restaurant again, as there are way better pizza places in town, and many more Italian options."}
{"text":"Typical celebrity chef restaurant... \"okay\" service and good food. You definitely go there for the experience, not necessarily for the service. Wine list is outrageous - a little disappointing for those who don't want to spend $60 a bottle. I had the Gemelli, which was really good - great flavor with fabulous homemade pasta and crisp broccoli rabe. My husband had the spaghetti and meatballs - nothing too crazy - well prepared meatballs with homemade pasta and savory tomato sauce. Overall, a good experience, but not a MUST have for the strip."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I dined here, but for ages I've been remembering it as being pretty amazing.  I thought it was one of the most authentic Italian pizza experience I've had in Las Vegas, and the sliced meats were fantastic as well.  I may to drop some scrilla on this place again soon and see if it still holds up."}
{"text":"Came here with hubby on our first night in Vegas! I was so excited to find out it was one of Mario Batali's restaurants.   Hubby loved that they had maudite beer to drink, but he didn't love his spaghetti and meatballs all that much.   I LOVED my pizza! I believe I had arugula, potatoes and truffle oil on a white pizza. It was so delicious, so saltly, so truffly! I almost ate the whole thing but couldn't finish it.   The atmosphere is incredible. This restaurant is inside of the Venetian hotel. It's located in a food court by the grand canal shoppes and it's set up to look like you are strolling through a square in Venice.   Definitely a great place to eat on the strip, slightly pricey but worth it IMO!"}
{"text":"This is one of our favorite spots for a bite to eat and a excellent glass of wine in all of Vegas. I have been at least 20 times and have never had a item that was not perfect... till this last time.   My husband wanted to go get a late lunch and a glass of good wine and we knew just the place for a quick but satisfying bite. Our order was places for a bunch of small bites, eggplant, caprisa, prosciutto, beautiful olives and that glass of $35 wine. Well the wine came very cold... it probably would have been great if we had the time to let it warm up, open up a little more but it just would have taken more time than we had. The waiter noticed right away we were not drinking it and came out with a brand new glass of a upgraded wine that was recommended.. it was one of the best glasses of my life. The attetion to customers and the details was so beyond what was called for and appreciated so much.   I then came back on Saturday when my husband was in a poker tournament downstairs and came for dinner at sat by myself at the bar. I wish i knew the bartenders name because he was so kind, caring and had great ideas. (he had a new baby names luke if you know who that is) I sat with his parents who even offered me bites of the dinner they had to try it as well. I felt like i was part of a family dinner. I had, on the bartenders recommendation the pasta of the day, Saturday and it was the veal lasagna. It quite possibly could have been one of the best dishes of my life. Very thin noodles and the sauce was out of this world. It is worth it to go every Saturday we are out visiting.   The waitstaff is great, hostess are caring and attentive and the manager jumped right in back to help make drinks and to insure everything was smooth.   It is a wonderful open place to dine in Vegas. You wont be disappointed at all."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here and always order the Prosciutto Pizza and also the Argula salad.   Pizza's crust is thin and ingredients are fresh.  From the cheese menu, I really enjoy Burrata, Parm, and Mozzarella.  See you soon."}
{"text":"It's my tradition to come and dine here whenever I visit Vegas.  The food is always prepared well and the ingredients fresh and simple.  Good selection of wine and the location is just a huge plus.  I enjoy having lunch here while watching the Venetian performance at the court yard.  The staffs are always warm and friendly.  Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"A very nice OpenTable reservation for 7 for lunch. I had a combination of business associates and customers attending and while the wait time was a bit long for those who didn't have reservations, the staff was kind to allow all members of our party to arrive before seating us. We were seated in the \"outside area\" of the restaurant.  Every hour there's an opera in the main atrium area which is entertaining, but also very loud when having a business discussion.  I believe this was a Mario Batali restaurant which specializes in Italian cuisine and pizza. I had the shrimp pizza and still can't believe I almost ate the whole thing. It was delicious. We started with calamari fritti and ricotta fritta (fried cheese). Each appetizer is enough for about 2 hungry people. Very nice variety of gourmet pizza. My advice is to be adventurous. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and beautiful place, very little food for the prices although it was very tasty.  If you are looking for a great value with decent portions this is not the place.  The service was just okay on top of that."}
{"text":"My favorite place on the strip. From the minute a customer walks in they are treated as royalty. The eggplant pizza will change your life"}
{"text":"Excellent, authentic Italian food. Reasonable cost comparatively. Excellent service. Great wine list. What else do you want? We've eaten at a lot of Italian restaurants in Vegas. Based on our experience, this is our first choice and one we will return for sure.   We started with some meats and cheeses. All were excellent. Had the carbonara which was good. My wife had the lamb osso bucco and it was perfect. Service was attentive but not pushy. The sommelier gave us good guidance selecting a bottle of \"baby\" Brunello since I didn't feel like popping full ride that evening and it was a hit. I took the cork to find at home.  I read some reviews before writing this and seems most people gripe about the cost. Duh, its Vegas; double duh, its the Venetian. I'm sure there is an Olive Garden nearby that might meet your budget. As for the atmosphere, it makes the most of the location - on par with all the other indoor patio places in the casinos and better than some. Last time we were in Vegas we ate at the competitor directly across from Otto. Not only were we totally dissatisfied with higher priced, mediocre food with downright bad service, we were constantly looking at the dishes being delivered at Otto and vowed to try it. We're glad we did."}
{"text":"Absolutely love Mario Batali and his restaurants are delicious.  This one is no exception.  We weren't super hungry so we the cheese flight with three cheeses and prosciutto.  It was delicious. Not to mention you are sitting in St. Marks Square Venice. The Venetian in Vegas is beautiful. Great service, great food what more could you ask for...."}
{"text":"This was a disappointing restaurant.   While the service was very good, the food left something to be desired.   For all the acclaim Mario Batali racks up I was surprised by how mediocre the food and drinks were.  We ordered a wide variety of appetizers and pizzas to share -- nothing stood out.  I walked away from Otto unimpressed."}
{"text":"I'm a big fan of Mr. Batali's establishments, but was underwhelmed at Otto in the Venetian.  I may have brought my pre-disposition for Babbo in NYC and Boston to Las Vegas.  I had dinner here with 2 co-workers.  We started with wine by the glass $14-$19 was a bit pricy for the wines we had.  Starter was the formaggi plate with 5 cheeses ($23), I would estimate that there was ~8 oz of cheese total split up between the ricotta, robiola, gorgonzola dolce, fontina, and one other I don't recall.  Good, but spendy.  we each picked a pizza and shared.  Good not stellar.  The staff was very attentive and willing to talk about the menu and wines without being overbearing.  A+ for them."}
{"text":"Mario Batali, you definitely know how to cook!  I went here for my niece's bachelorette party this past weekend and it was delicious food.  We all loved the cauliflower pasta the best (Rigatoni).  The Margherita pizza is also a must have.  But the best part of the meal was.....   dessert!!  We ordered 5 desserts to share among 10 girls and each dessert was amazing!  One of my favorites was the dark chocolate.  The service was a bit slow but having 10 gals to chat with, made up for it!  Would love to try the New York Otto someday."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. I dined alone here on October 9th for lunch.  I was seated in the \"bar\" which was more of a prep area.  The waiter came and brought me my iced tea quickly.  He recommended the spaghetti and meatballs to me, which I ordered. Even though the restaurant was not busy, it did take quite a while for the food to arrive, however it was probably the best spaghetti and meatballs I've ever had.  The sauce was on the spicy side, which I like and the meatballs were pretty much bite size.    I did not order desert and since this was lunch, I cannot speak to the wine menu but would recommend it for lunch if you have the time."}
{"text":"Not impressed.  I only came here because I was sold on the \"best carbonara ever\" but it was not Sunday, so there was no carbonara.  + convenience of making reservations on Opentable on my phone - being seated in the second to worst place in the restaurant (back corner by a wall) + great service +/- focaccia - appetizer of fried stuff (if I had just gotten the fried risotto balls and paid $9 for 4 balls, I would not have been a happy camper) the butternut squash fries were okay + tri tip was the best dish - mussel/saffron fettuccine was super al dente and really not good (but \"cheap\" in Vegas pricing) +/- lamb osso buco was okay the lamb sauce was pretty good but the pasta was also al dente, but not undercooked like the mussel pasta dish  I'll only come back from the carbonara, that's it."}
{"text":"Mario the food was awesome and so was your staff. From the eggplant and olives to the prosciutto and mussels everything was great."}
{"text":"To be honest, I expected a little more out of the menu. I found the whole cheese section confusing and I understand food. To someone who does not, they would be lost. Another major issue for me was the menu updates... What's on line doesn't match the menu and there were not even disclaimers, i.e. Seasonal item only! I made my decision to eat there based on two factors. First, j was going to get squash blossoms! Which I know are seasonal. However, their online menu said they had them. Second was the zucchini fritti or simply... fried zucchini! They didn't have that either! The service was just OK. Nothing to jump up and down about. Our waiter brought. Age of breadsticks, asked if we wanted sparkling or flat water then disappeared... I even told him when we mentioned water that we wanted some drinks. Even that was lackluster... no question on what vodka I wanted, no suggestions of wine to anyone else @ the table... nothing. So for service and ease of menu, I have to say, a fail! However... and there is a however!!! The food was great! Pizza was spot on, nice taste, great chew, crispy crust! Just the way it should be. We also had the arancinj and the brussels which I would highly recommend!  Unfortunately, there is good food all over the place. So with a lack of emphasis on the service and lack of attention to details, I can say, I will not be  returning! Still a fan of Mario, but unfortunately there are better places for me to go."}
{"text":"Excellent! After feeling like I was coming up short searching for a reasonably priced, delicious restaurant in Vegas, we decided to just give something a shot. Me and my husband split the bruschetta of the day, large pear salad, and short rib ravioli. All were very flavorful. We weren't stuffed, but that's probably better for us anyway. The flavor combinations were awesome and the view was great as well! No complaints other than the still slightly overpriced menu due to being on the strip. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Exploring the Canal Shops I decided to stop here for a glass of wine. This restaurant was the least crowded here and I wanted some quiet time that I could finish my book.   I sat at the bar and it seems I am the only one in attendance at the bar. Such perfection since I have one chapter left. I ordered a glass of white wine and dove back into the pages.  The server was very friendly and let me try the wine to make sure it was something I liked. He even put the fancy bread and oil out with a glass of water too. He continues to check on me asking if all is well. I politely nod and he goes onto his other guests.  The restaurant area is pretty steady with customers. This seems like a true Italian experience, since my server even says thank you and the other pleasantries in the Italian language.    Now finished with my book it does seem time for a little snack. I decided to have on the servers advisement the Abruzzo and Charred Asparagus. The Abruzzo is a thinly sliced pork that is cured and has a little kick of spice. It tasted wonderful. The Charred Asparagus is served chilled with wonderful bits of chopped hazelnuts. The romesco gives the Asparagus sauce a brilliant red color and a zing in every bite.  After finding out this fine establishment is closing its doors in July I am so glad to have dined here while I still can.   The surroundings that are happening out in the plaza of the Grand Canal Shops are so fun and unique. The live performances of jesters and ladies singing is sweet music too all. It's all done in Italian, so beautiful. Here at the bar as a guest you can sit and enjoy the entertainment with a great glass of wine."}
{"text":"Yummy!!  We ate family style, ordering several kinds of meats, cheeses, olives, sausage and pepper pizza, and house made gelattos.  It was all really great.  The wine list is terrific, staff was super informed and helpful. The front patio is fun to people watch and to see the street performers, and listen to the singers. We really enjoyed it and will definitely come back."}
{"text":"I sat right down at the bar. Had a half salad that was perfect size and the corn pizza. The pizza sounds strange but was so great. I would order it again.   If you want something a little quieter, ask to be seated inside. While I was there, there was a show that went on in the plaza that was fun and loud."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere seated in St. Marks square at the Venetian. They just turned down the lights! Beautiful place to have dinner. My husband and I enjoyed the beets as a starter. We both ordered the veal and ricotta meatballs and roasted carrots. Delicious! We would have given a 5, but they did not have the Tuna which my husband was very interested in having."}
{"text":"Three and a half! Damn Yelp!  This faux outdoor sidewalk café looks swanky and classy from a distance but if you look closer you'll see that the waiters are wearing jeans. Which is cool.  The menu contains all of the usual overpriced, hard-to-pronounce staples of a typical North American Italian restaurant that tries too hard. They have something like two hundred different kinds of wine to choose from, so if you're a wine connoisseur or pretend to be one, you'll be in heaven here.  I ordered the spaghetti & meatballs because it was the only item on the menu that I could articulate with absolute certainty. Despite being the smallest meatballs I've ever seen, the meal was good. I had an overpriced Bloody Cosmopolitan to wash it down and I think I enjoyed that too. (I couldn't pronounce most of the drinks either) It was powdery, but maybe it's supposed to be. I was worried that maybe I ordered a chick drink. My wife didn't say anything though.  The waiter and assistant waiter were both very cool, laidback, and casual as was the lady that showed us to our quiet table at the back.  My only hang-up about this place is their prices. They don't accurately reflect the kind of restaurant that this place actually is. It is a casual atmosphere with casual food (even though the names of the food are a little convoluted) but they charge as if they are some high-class, renowned establishment."}
{"text":"Visited:  On a Thursday at 12:00 PM for a lunch meeting.  Service: 4.0/5 - The waiter was friendly and attentive to our orders and kept our drinks fresh.  Food: 4.5/5 - Started off with the Arancine.  Saffron infused risotto, bolgonese, and the bufala mozzarella made this cheese lover happy.  I went with the Pappardelle at the suggestion of an Italian friend with much knowledge of the food.  I LOVED the thicker pasta and the overall dish was tasty.  The portion of the Papardelle received was significantly less than the dishes my friends had.  The strawberry martini was tasty but also a little light in portion.  Value: 3.0/5 - It can get pricey quickly if you actively order from the great appetizer and dessert selections.  However, I was extremely happy with the ones I sampled this time around.  Ambiance: - Great place to eat, and people watch at St. Mark's square in the Venetian.  Loud enough so others can't hear your conversation, yet quiet enough so you don't have to raise your voice.  Summary - Think of it as a higher end Maggiano's with about the same pricing, with a much better selection of good at a much better quality.  The location of being in St. Marks Square in the Venetian enhances the overall experience in my opinion.  Enjoy..!"}
{"text":"We made dinner reservations for a group of us gals on a Friday evening. When we arrived, we had a table ready, but unfortunately it was tucked away in a very tight back corner. We asked for another table, and mentioned we'd be happy to wait for one. The hostesses were really helpful and got us seated about 10 min later.   What I loved about this place, was the location. You felt like you were outdoors in Italy, soaking up the \"sunshine/daylight\" and listening to live music on the \"streets\". Very charming touch and part of all the magic in Vegas!   The food though, fell really short of everything I was expecting for Mario Batali. I'm a huge Food Network junkie..and the dishes I've seen him make, looks freaking incredible....just not here. I was torn on trying out the crab ravioli or the pappardelle...they both sounded amazing on the menu...as did the truffle pizza!  After making one of my toughest decisions of the night - Pappardelle it is. First off, it was dark meat chicken. I hate to discriminate here guys, but I'm more of a white meat chicken type of gal here. I looked past it, knowing I was in great hands with Mario's food...but nope. The dish was bland, the chicken was beyond disappointing. One of my girl friends ordered the crab ravioli...I tried a bite and felt like I was eating old seafood. The crab was really dry and had a significant and overpowering fishy taste to it. Definitely not for my palette. So playing with my food, I decided to carb up on my pasta...There was one final pizza slice of truffle pizza at the table of girls, and you can certainly bet I snatched it! That was probably the best dish there for the night. In hindsight, I should have probably ordered the pizza and passed on the pasta dishes. It was perfectly crisp and the truffle flavor was so so sooo good!   Also, note that they will not make substitutions or alterations to items on the menu. I tried that and got rejected real quick. Bummer.   Service was nice, but sort of became hit and miss throughout the night. I felt like there were some moments where our waiter was totally on top of everything and other moments where I wondered if he had flown off to Italy..."}
{"text":"Service was...not good!  Very slow, had to keep asking for things and took forever to get them. The salads were very good, but everybody's pasta was not cooked all the way and nobody enjoyed their meals. Bummer"}
{"text":"I loved my dinner at Otto! My friend and I were enjoying a girl's weekend in Vegas and stopped into Otto for dinner. We had a great table facing the entertainment in the \"square.\" Our waiter was really friendly and walked us through his recommendations for the menu. We decided to start with the fried ricotta and then share a prosciutto pizza and carbonara pasta.  The fried ricotta was delish - it's basically little cheese balls with a little bit of spice. Yum. The pizza was really good - tons of fresh prosciutto and the crust was done just right. The carbonara pasta was pretty heavy and had an odd but good taste if that makes sense. I think a really stinky cheese was used. I don't know if I would have liked it as just a single entrée because it was so rich but it was a great combo with the pizza. Our waiter recommended a white wine that also complimented the flavors perfectly so overall it was a well put together meal.  I love how Mario Batali's restaurants are casual and yet the food is top notch. I would definitely go back next time I'm in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great food!  Great atmosphere!  Had the pancetta and goat cheese pizza, meatball pizza, and cauliflower appetizer.  Simply delicious!!!"}
{"text":"Just say \"no\"! I am so disappointed in the restaurant and the chef especially. I have life threatening nut and dairy allergies. I simply asked the waiter to sub out a cow milk based cheese for a goat milk based cheese as I am allergic to cows milk. Waiter said he needed to ask the chef. Ummm if I am paying $14 for just tiny plate of argula with a tiny bit of parm cheese, what is the issue. Plus, I also have an allergy to said cheese. Waiter comes back and says \" the chef will NOT do it as it compromises the texture of the salad.\" Wait what?? Seriously are you kidding me? Someone has an ego. It is a plate of greens with cheese, bottom line.  So we order a \"caprise\" salad. Again, advised of nut and dairy allergy..Guess what it comes out with on it, yes that is correct, nuts. I have been dealing with food allergies for a LONG time and hands down, not only is this establishment down right dangerous for those of us who do have a life threatening allergy, the chef's ego clearly trumps customer safety. So sad."}
{"text":"Every time we stay at the Palazzo we make sure to include Otto. Being perfectly honest the service has  always been somewhat sloppy but the food selection is great - taking specifically about the cheese board and small plates which are always delicious and interesting  We headed there last night and brought friends along with us but were rather embarrassed by the entire experience!  More than 20 minutes after being seated our friend finally got up to find our waiter. We had no food and no drinks only bread as at least that server was attentive - when you bring company and they have to search for service; it's not a great experience   Then the waiter finally shows up to ask what we want to eat - so we just added on drink orders or he would have never taken them. The kids ordered their meal but we ended up having to order again later when it never showed ( and on that note - they may be kids but that does not mean it's okay to compromise the quality - the pizza was over cooked and way too firm; it was rushed like an afterthought and bad )  The cheese board was delicious as always and the squash blossoms were amazing but that is where it ended. The cauliflower was burnt and had we found the waiter we should have probably just sent it back; it was salty , deep brown to black and was mostly left behind! There was also a notable absence of some of their previous lighter dishes like tuna or farro - with a large emphasis on fried and heavier fare - so for me the appeal is gone    I always loved their food and put up with the service - but when both were bad I see no reason to return . There are plenty of other places with good cheese boards and better wine and the service was the worst I have received in Vegas"}
{"text":"its basically in the mall's food court. i mean call it like it is... fancy or not. so its inside the grande canal shoppes which is inside the venetian which is one the same huge property as the palazzo and the sands expo center. there is occasionally live opera singers and some little acts that perform in the arena area and there is a mote inside that is more like a little Italian river under a roof. the food court is done really nicely and always looks like its day time due to the painted ceiling. its really not your average mall food court. its way nicer. but apples will always be apples.   dont tell them youre in a hurry. they get that from everyone and they are working as fast as they can. if youre really in that much of a hurry you should have packed a sack lunch."}
{"text":"Food was OK. NOT WORTH THE PRICE. service was good though. Ended with my espresso gelato. Tasted okay."}
{"text":"Definitely not the best Italian I've had, far from it actually. I ordered the sweet potato ravioli with sage sauce and it was decent but it was $24 for 6 small pieces. Outrageous prices. The prices were horrible and the service was even worse. They gave us bread but brought out the olive oil when our dinner was coming out. They said they had no mushrooms or asparagus to put in our pasta which I saw plenty of people that did...not to mention I find it very hard to believe that an Italian restaurant has no vegetables period (as our waiter informed us). It was number 2 on our friend's list of places to eat but I think that list needs to be reevaluated. The location in the Venetian is nice but that is pretty much the best part of the restaurant. The others in our group did like their pizza and I thought it was decent so I threw in an extra star for that."}
{"text":"The location is great but the pizza is horrific. We ordered the Quattro formaggi pizza and it was thin, limp, and thoroughly disgusting. I'd have rather had a frozen Red Baron pizza than this place. And to top it off the service was spotty."}
{"text":"Fan of both celebrities who run this joint.  The problem I had was nothing fully met the expectations of the names.  Went with a group and had a large sampling of the menu.  Some of the pasta was undercooked, sauces were just OK.  Meat and cheese dishes were good, but nothing you couldn't easily surpass at your local Italian market (if you live near one).  And the biggest let down was the pizza.  I've had a lot of similar pizzas: brick oven, flat bread, thin crust, etc.. and this ranks below par.  And for the price it is ridiculous.  It was mediocre at best with a premium price tag."}
{"text":"Ran in for a quick lunch had a break from a show I was attending. Friend wanted pizza so this worked out well. I w looking more for a salad but nothing suited me. Asked the waiter and he rec'd the chicken. They broiled it for me and placed it over a nice piece of grilled eggplant and Roma tomatoes topped off with a ricotta mix. One of the best plates I've had in a while, lunch or dinner. Flavors were an incredible match and finished the plate. Buddies pizza was good as well as also finished every bite. Might have to go back and try their dinner if time permits."}
{"text":"Came here on my first trip to Vegas. Black spaghettini was delicious! Perfectly cooked without huge portions overshadowing taste. The cheese and cured meat selection also made my boyfriend very happy :)."}
{"text":"We only ordered one thing which is why I'd normally not review a place unless I try more, but the idea of shelling out more money to risk this quality and quantity of food again is much too painful, and I do feel the need to share our experience. We ordered the Prosciutto Arugula pizza. Had it been decent, we would have ordered the Margherita too. This came with 6 very thin small slices. I like thin crust and the dough was not bad, but it was burned on the bottom. The pizza itself only had 3 toppings: almost no cheese, prosciutto, almost no arugula (literally 3 tiny pieces on the whole pizza) and super tangy tomato sauce. The problem wasn't the lack of variety of toppings. Some of the best tasting pizza I've ever had had few toppings. But there needs to be enough of those very toppings. Anyway, the tomato sauce tasted like it came from a can, but if it was made there which I assume it was, that shows theirs taste even worse than Prego or Ragu, yuck. The little cheese that was there (not even certain there was cheese amongst the strong sour tomato sauce) & meat slid off the entire pizza along with the tomato sauce. I was constantly putting the meat back on. For this dinky little awful tasting \"pizza\" we paid $20, was it even 12 inches? The bartender was really pushing us to get a 2nd one being it's small. After that experience, no thank you.  The 2nd star is only because the atmosphere there is so nice, it's in the Venitian after all. Violinists were playing behind us, of course little of the good part of the setting had anything to do with the restaurant itself, but rather the lovely Italian inspired hotel. If that pizza is a representation of the quality of their entire menu, then I don't think they deserve that amazing space."}
{"text":"Thursday special, probably the best pasta dish I've ever eaten with seafood.  Perfectly cooked tuna with perfectly cooked pasta! Also had the radish bruschetta special.  Server was Paula, she highly recommended the pasta special dish.  Paula was awesome, very attentive, outstanding service.  WELL DONE, I'll be a customer each visit to Vegas."}
{"text":"Ok,so we stopped in for happy hour. We considered dinner as the menu looked great!  They asked if we wanted water. Never got it! Ordered a drink and got it 20 minutes later. Service was awful! The staff was hanging around 5 fold!  So many choices in Vegas! This was unacceptable. We settled for a weak appetizer at best and abandoned dinner to avoid future neglect!"}
{"text":"We love this place. Order the cheese plate, the cherries you get are excellent. Cannot beat the pizza. Made perfect.  Service is spotty so I'm holding off a star"}
{"text":"I am not a total foodie I will admit.  But I do enjoy a nice meal.  I appreciate exotic flavors that make my taste buds sing with zesty compositions.  I expected something close to this from Otto, particularly since it is endorsed by a famous chef.  What I got was the worst meal I've eaten in recent memory.  Seriously, there were 4 of us and we all agreed the food was terrible in both presentation and taste.  Here's how bad this was: if they had offered me $100 to finish the food I would have said no.  Well, maybe for $150.  Mario I love ya, but you really need to tweak the food at this place.  DO NOT go here until they address issues with their menu.  Don't believe me- see their barely 3 star reviews on Yelp"}
{"text":"Wife was hungry and waitress immediately brought our salad. Made my day! Literally. Schrimp Scampi was good the pizza with meatballs was average"}
{"text":"Honestly I had pretty high expectations for this place seeing as I've been to multiple Mario Batali restaurants in NYC. This place was such a disappointment. The waitress was pretty snippy and unhelpful during the meal. The pasta we ordered was all way too salty. I'm a huge pasta fan and I was so sad I couldn't enjoy it. I would not recommend coming here. There are so many other Italian options in the hotel that I imagine are much much better. The only things I enjoyed were the wine, croquettes, prosciutto, gnoccho and some of the salad. While that seems like a lot, I left with a disappointed heart and a stomach half empty."}
{"text":"I loved the outdoor-like square with shows and music. The food and service was excellent!"}
{"text":"Staff was very friendly and helpful, great customer service!  I had the truffle pizza with shaved potato on it, and it was delicious!  My husband ordered a different pizza which I remember he loved and it had parsley on it, sorry but that's all I remember.  Otto Enoteca is in the Grand Canal Shoppes in the Venetian Hotel, so the atmosphere is really great for an indoor restaurant."}
{"text":"I love St. Mark's square. I had been to Otto many years ago and remembered they had great cheese so we decided to try it again.  We ordered our wine by the glass. Their sommelier was so nice. I feel bad I forgot his name.  We ordered a 3 cheese board (fontina, gorgonzola and camembert) and the prosciutto to start our meal. Yes they still have very good cheese! It was so fresh and delicious. Prosciutto was sliced so thin you could see through! Yum!  Then I had the pork shoulder plate with a side of their smashed fried potatoes. The other guest had the pappardelle.  Pork shoulder: the meat was super tender and flavorful! I loved it so much and wish the portion was slightly bigger. It came with vegetables in a ginger sauce but I thought the ginger was a bit overwhelming.  Smashed fried potatoes: amazing! Like upgraded french fries. Not greasy at all and very addicting.  Pappardelle: served with chicken ragu and tomato sauce. Very good! Chicken was super tasty, tomato sauce on point and the pasta nicely cooked."}
{"text":"Had dinner at Otto last night because some relatives were in town.  We were 5 adults and 1 child.  Service was very slow and our server was not attentive at all.  My daughter's pizza was brought out within 10 minutes of ordering, which I thought was a good idea to keep her occupied.  However, she completed her whole pizza and our food was still not out (40 mins later) so she had to sit through our whole meal with nothing in front of her. I had the gemelli pasta.  Pasta was way undercooked.  I know what al dente is.  This was undercooked.  The pasta had a horrible, dry texture and the sauce was practically flavorless.  The broccoli rabe was also undercooked in my opinion.  The sausage was nothing special and the whole dish did not come together at all. The bill for the table came to $177 for pasta and pizza.  One pizza came out cold and the pasta's...........well you could get the same at Olive Garden.  Another strike for Vegas strip restaurants.  As a local, I far prefer eating off the strip for better quality at a lower price. #touristtrap"}
{"text":"Not worth a trip!  This restaurant definitely caters to tourists that would rather sit in a fake St. Marks square than eat a good pizza. The service was good but the food wasn't worth the price. I had a $25 truffle pizza with only a slight hint of truffle (probably from an oil). It just wasn't worth it!  I expected more from Mario (Eately was much better)."}
{"text":"The food was pretty strong. I had a small salad with prosciutto and the sausage and peppers pizza. Food alone would be 4 stars. I get that I am basically eating at a fancy food court; but the service was weak. Lot's of staff running around but, just not getting much done. Slow and lots of apologizing. The hostess spent most of her time taking laps of the restaurant (recon mission) to find out how many seats she had available."}
{"text":"This place was great! My husband was attending a conference at the Sands and we met up here for lunch. We had a unique take on a caprese salad, pasta, and a margarita pizza. Everything was well portioned for lunch to satisfy you, but not have anyone need a nap afterwards. It was all beautifully presented, perfectly cooked, and just plain delicious! We were both very happy with our meal choices and the service was stellar! And to boot, even though the food is top notch, there is no need to dress up! :)  The only reason I'm giving it a 4 vs. a 5 is that is is a bit pricey, but I suppose that's to be expected in Vegas in general. Def recommend it though!"}
{"text":"I was working inside the Venetian and went here for dinner with work associates after a long day. They offer gluten free pasta. It was good and convenient. Nothing totally amazing. They have a good and extensive wine list. I also had a bloody mary here a different day and it was delicious (we had a hard time finding bloodys in Vegas)."}
{"text":"We were looking for a not-too-expensive-yet-nice place to eat dinner in Las Vegas.  A friend recommended Otto.  It's in the shopping area of the Venetian Hotel.  We split an arrugula and parmesan salad (large, fresh, tasty) and a pancetta and goat cheese pizza (fantastic).  The pizza crust is thin, yet chewy and not brittle.  The bill was about $40, which is a bit more than we would spend at home for salad and gourmet pizza, but was worth the price."}
{"text":"I was impressed with this place. The wait was not very long even though it looked like every table was completely packed.  We decided to hit the bar for a few beers. I forgot what i was drinking but it was a nice big Italian beer for $8...not bad prices for Las Vegas. Just as we took our first sip of beer our table was ready.  Sometimes I think restaurants want you to order a drink at the bar even though your table might be ready...it is a smart business move but as a consumer I find it tacky...oh well!  We were given a great table in the fake outside. These restaurants crack me up with all of the fake elements. I feel like I'm eating on the set of a movie every minute. When are they going to make fake birds come over and try to eat my real bread? At least I hope it's real...the bread I mean!  I made a special request from the waiter. I wanted my pasta cooked in a fresh pot of water with no salt. He said no problem. Some girl in our party...I don't even know who she was but she started giving me a hard time. Telling me the rest of the table was going to have to wait for there food because of me. She also started saying other things but I tuned her out. I didn't know she worked for the restaurant. Oh wait she doesn't! Just completely annoying! I'm still wondering who invited her? I would give her 1 star if I could review her!  Here is the funny part. All of our pasta hit the table and someone at the table said, \"can we get grated cheese?\". The food runner then said, \"I would recommend you try the pasta first because our water we cook the pasta in is really salty and people always complain it is too salty!\" I looked right at this girl and said,\"Wow that's ironic the food runner would say that!!!\". I then looked at the food runner and said,\"Load me up on the cheese because I had my pasta cooked in unsalted water!\". I then shot a dirty look at this girl sitting at our table. She knew I directed it at her but she had no come back at me! I've never met someone who would attack someone at there own table for a special request!!! I hope she liked her salty pasta dish!  I had the pasta with the shrimp and it was really good. Guess what? It wasn't salty at all. In fact, others at the table commented at how smart I was for requesting fresh unsalted water!  Sometimes it is good to ask and I was so happy with this restaurant honoring my special request.  A slammed restaurant that still cares about making there customer happy.  I love it!!!  We also started with a pizza too and it was really good! I was really surprised at how tasty everything we ordered. I would come back here for dinner and drinks but I will not be dinning with that mean girl ever again. I am so glad I have no idea who she is and hopefully I'll never see her again. You gotta love Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars. It was good pasta. All my friends really enjoyed their pasta/pizza. The server was really nice but all entrees are over 20 for not a lot of pasta. It's enough to sort of fill you but I'm used to getting more for take home especially when paying that much. Over all for small portions of semi expensive pasta that was just good not great, I don't think it's worth it"}
{"text":"Pizzeria located in the food court of the Venezia Casino.  If you are looking for a quick bite this is a great place to stop. You can buy pizza by the slice and it won't break the bank.  I tried the pepperoni and it was very good. The slice size is generous."}
{"text":"Homemade cured meats, imported cheeses, excellent service. Expected nothing less.   Came in for a latte and ended up letting the waiter choose some items for us. My photos will show:  truffle honey, candied apricots and Marciano cherries as sides with Buffalo mozz, fontina and smoked Gouda. With Prosciutto and salami.   Typing fast because I want to go back for more. Tip here: Let your extremely educated waiter choose for your items for you. Guide them a little but be adventurous. Enjoy this great little escape during gambling or shopping.   Back to the Vegas grind. See you all soon."}
{"text":"We have been enjoying Mario Batali's Carnevino  on our last few visits to Las Vegas, but now we will work his Otto into our regular rotation.  The pepperoni pizza was truly special and the fried gnocchi with prosciutto (not on the menu, but our bartender Reagan recommended it) was one of the best things I have ever eaten.  Didn't even mind sitting in the very busy -and loud - Canal Shoppes.   Can't wait to return!!!"}
{"text":"I will fully acknowledge that being from California (born in So Cal, now living in Nor Cal), I am a food critic without a doubt.  I also understand that Vegas restaurants that are play offs of their main establishments are meant to cater to a broader variety of people that often come at the sacrifice of quality and variety.  In any case, however, what I'm trying to get at is, it'll be good, but there aren't too many places that I seem think are great.  Such is the case with Otto Enoteca.  Greg and I stopped off here after wandering around the Venetian and trying to find a place that was moderately priced for a Linner (Lunch + Dinner).  Greg had just visited Mario Batali's place in LA, so naturally he thought to try here just out of curiosity.  We both decided against pizza since that usually gets taken care of past midnight in Vegas, so we went with two pasta dishes: Bucatini all'Amatriciana and Gemelli.  Leading up to this, we ordered two drinks, a Bellini and a beer while waiting for our food.  Our waitress was nice and very courteous, but what I didn't understand was the table bread situation.  After we requested the bread, it came out in a basket...and that was it.  No butter, no olive oil, no salt and pepper on the table, just bread.  Um, ok?  We were starved, but they certainly didn't put much effort into presentation.  The bread itself was delicious, but it probably would have been better with something else.  Anyway, the mains came out, and the waitress had warned us that they serve the pasta al dente.  No kidding, as it would seem.  I typically don't like al dente but was willing to try it.  My dish, the Bucatini, had great flavor to it with a spicy tomato sauce, onions, and some cured  pork.  My only issue was, much like the bread, it was literally just pasta on a plate.  No additional decorations, no detail to presentation, just pasta on a plate.  The plate itself wasn't that big, but I wasn't going to complain about the portion.  Anyway, Greg's plate was also good, and he was convinced that his plate was better than mine.  I had one bite (the maximum bites I was allocated) and it was tasty.  Anyway, after the meal was over, we sat around and people watched which I would say is valuable since there's a million things going on in that little plaza.  Ultimately, I'd say this place is a little pricey considering the fact that a) it was just pasta, b) absolutely nothing special done for the dishes, and c) I think like most places in Vegas, the restaurant can hike the prices up since people like myself will pay for it.  I might come back here next time if I feel like pasta, but for $35/person, I'll see if I can go somewhere else."}
{"text":"We sat down in this restaurant because of the nice view to the Venetian plaza. The food is really mediocre, though. The service was okay. There are way better options if you're looking for Italian food in Vegas."}
{"text":"Otto is my favorite place for pizza in Vegas.  Served traditional style,  the Margherita is highly recommended for a healthy choice.  Nice relaxed ambience at the classy Venetian mall,  you may be lucky and catch a live puppet show during dinner in the courtyard seating area."}
{"text":"Quality meal this week. Sampled several items from the menu. The star was the melon salad. Great atmosphere and people watching from the restaurant."}
{"text":"My experience here was only ok.  I was really looking forward to this being an amazing restaurant, but sadly it wasn't.  Our waiter was nice, but forgot all of the specials that I heard being described to other tables around us.    I was really excited about the pasta I ordered, but was really disappointed by how tiny the portions were.  My pasta was literally less than 10 bites of food, which was sad, especially for $25.  My friends ordered pizza, which was much larger and more filling, so I regretted not ordering that.  We shared 2 scoops of gelato for dessert, and that was the highlight of the meal for sure.  Salted caramel + chocolate malt was a great combination.  Overall I'd say it was ok, but if I go back to Vegas I'll likely go elsewhere for Italian food."}
{"text":"Loved this place! The food was light and fresh, and the service was quick. I've been here a few times, and I've enjoyed the pizza, the salad, and the pasta. This is a great place for a reasonably priced and delicious meal in Vegas.   Go for the Margherita D.O.C. Pizza and  the Rigatoni with Ragu Napolitana!  The location is fun, too, with tons of people watching, and quasi-al-fresco dining with no threat of rain or cold. Service has always been friendly and efficient. Definitely a low-stress go-to option in the Venetian."}
{"text":"During a recent trip to vegas, my mother and I ate at this restaurant.  It was good, but nothing spectacular.  The highlight of the meal were the two salads.  I had the octopus salad, while my mother had the panzanella.  The octopus was tender and the potatoes and celery made the perfect, crisp foil against the fish.  My mother's panzanella was light and refreshing, although a touch too sweet for my tastes.  For an entree, I had the braised pork shoulder, which the waiter said was a house specialty.  The meat was a little dry and stringy and the sauce was cloyingly sweet.  My mother had the pasta ala norma.  The sauce was good, but the pasta was very undercooked and I am not talking about al dente.  It was almost crunchy."}
{"text":"Nice Italian fare at high prices...Its an Ok place and has a decent wine list but it is a pricy spot for what you get, but it is location etc.  Salads were great and the appetizer selection was a shared pizza.  Entrees were the pastas and we shared but there was really nothing memorable.  A nice spot and I would go back but nothing out of the ordinary.  Great service"}
{"text":"Ate here recently for lunch. There are daily specials for bruschetta, pizza, and pasta on the menu which are worth looking at. We had the Monday special pizza which was a caramelized balsamic onion and ricotta -- it was so good! I will say that the prices were a little high, although that is probably to be expected given the location in St Marks Square on the Grand Canal. We came out at about $60 for three people with no drinks, dessert, etc."}
{"text":"Came in for dinner and has some delicious pasta.  Ordered linguine and spaghetti and both were delicious. Ingredients were fresh and sauces were simple but full of flavor.   Also tried the salad with pear and walnut. That was good but not anything special. Felt the same about the bread.  The service was very good, though they do pack you in very tight. It was very uncomfortable seating. I had to keep my chair in one spot exactly to not bump into the person behind me."}
{"text":"We enjoyed a lovely meal watching the tourists wander through the Canal Shops.  We started with a cheese plate left to the server's discretion and weren't disappointed.  Our server brought a selection of 7 cheeses plus apricots, honey, and cherries on the side.  Although we missed having some bread or crackers to use with the softer cheeses, it was a great experience to try some new flavors.  We both enjoyed pizzas that were very tasty (the tomato sauce was incredibly creamy), followed by delicious double cappuccinos.    Although the environment was a bit noisy from the crowds, the people-watching was incredible, the service was spot-on, and the food was a great choice for lunch."}
{"text":"My experience was amazing loved my Peroni beer , loved my Baby lettuce salad ,fried ricotta and had the procuitto pizza added chilies wow ! Will come back for sure for steak I heard it's the best NY strip on the Strip."}
{"text":"I must admit my Bf and I were very hesitant to come to this place after reading a few yelp reviews. However, my Bf had a change of heart last minute and we wanted to try it out for ourselves and I am sure glad we did. We ordered their Insalata di Mare which was divine. I cannot express myself enough if you are a seafood lover how tasty this salad is and is a must try. Being a cheese fanatic since birth I ordered their Quattro Formaggi Pizza. I really must rave about this pizza for cheese lovers. The presentation of this pizza was very clever and it was delicious. I don't want to ruin the surprise for first timers but you won't be disappointed.   We arrived during happy hour so we took advantage of their beer and drink specials. Their house made Gelato is also a must try. If you are looking for a yummy spot for Pizza, Drinks and a wonderful ambiance at the Venetian. Look no further. Come to Otto."}
{"text":"We dined here a few days ago before heading out for the night, and I was impressed with many of the offerings.   We began with a bellini and selections from the cheese and salami options. The Camembert, Gorgonzola, and prosciutto were divine, and the one of the accompaniments - honey with truffle shavings - was the perfect pairing. I also enjoyed dipping the bread they provided in the olive oil and balsamic vinegar, however, the bread was nothing special; neither were the other cheese accompaniments.   My dining companion had the salami pizza, which was nicely crisp and generously topped with good salami, but it did not \"wow\" me. I had the ravioli, which was filled with delicate and succulent bits of short rib - delicious!  We were going to have dessert, however, our server took too long. In fact, that was one of my only gripes with Otto: while our server was very knowledgeable, I believe the place was understaffed, as he was running around to other tables in different sections and even working behind the bar area; therefore at times he would disappear for long periods of time or seemed rushed when answering questions or taking our orders."}
{"text":"Another Mario Batali restaurant in the Venetian.  I believe he has four restaurants here.  We came here during lunch and ordered two pizzas.  It's a little pricey compared to Grimaldi's ($42 for two personal size pizza's compared to $22 for a large pie at Grimaldi's) but I was surprised how much I liked it.  The crust was nice and crispy.  I liked the prosciutto arugula pizza.  The Margherita pizza was good but at $21 they could of added more buffalo mozzarella cheese.    There are a lot of pizza places at the Venetian, so pick the one that has the best value for you.  You can go casual or upscale like Otto."}
{"text":"Fav lunch place! love the ambience & the pizza! ordered thin crust vegetarian pizza with tomatoes, mushrooms, olives 3 days in a row."}
{"text":"don't get me wrong, i liked this place just fine. i would give 3.5 stars if possible.  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND THE CAPRESE. it's a different take than other caprese salads i've had in the past; this one is mini heirloom tomatoes (cherry tomato size) with pesto on top and THE BEST MOZARELLA I'VE HAD IN MY LIFE. it was so creamy, so light and fluffy with a texture that i've never encountered before. sort of...bouncy and squishy like mochi almost. it was so good!  other things we ordered: anchovy pizza and sausage pizza: both yum. if you like the thin pizza style, you'll like these. very hearty!  carbonara pasta: ? was this really a carbonara? it wasn't very creamy and the black pepper killed any other subtle tastes there may have been. i'm used to japanese style carbonara so maybe it's different? but i didn't taste that creamy, egg-y flavor that is absolutely necessary in a carbonara.  minus one star for being overpriced, and minus another half for just so-so pizza and pasta. minus another half for their bread selection not being so exciting. i love italian places with delicious, soft warm breads to eat before your meal.  dat mozarella doe."}
{"text":"My wife and I, traveling looking for one place to eat decided to eat here as she remembered reading about it somewhere before our trip. The service was very good and we were seated quickly with prompt service However, I would attribute that to perhaps that we were eating dinner early for Vegas standards and was not very full.  Although I have never been to Italy, my wife has and assured me the food was very authentic. She had the pancetta and goat cheese pizza and I had the Napoliante or pasta with veal in sauce. Both were excellent. I also recognized that Mario Batteli is one of the owners, which is not a reason to rate a food both very interesting."}
{"text":"Pasta was terrible, pizza was horrible. This is a place that uses tourists ignorance and charges an arm and leg.  Stay away."}
{"text":"I came here for happy hour with a couple girl friends and we all got the little happy hour selections but one of my friends and I both received olives even though we had ordered something else. Also the fried zucchini had NO seasoning on it and no sauce, so it wasn't very good. I came for lunch and I have to say the lack of seasoning really ruined a nice light lunch (caprese salad). Where's the salt?"}
{"text":"The goat cheese and pancetta pizza was a perfect pair.   I wish I could eat it once a week for the rest of my life. The deep fried prosciutto was a unique appetizer with great texture."}
{"text":"Nice casual spot.    Carbonara pizza was good, margherita was forgettable.    Pastas were not bad, not amazing.  The pork shoulder was a real winner.  Crispy on the outside, juicy on the inside.  That dish is highly recommended.    Prices are reasonable, especially for Vegas."}
{"text":"This is like having lunch outside in Italy.  Probably because you are in the Venetian and they have various minstrels roaming about.  The hottie made reservations for thus place because she wanted to try the appetizers.  We started with the frittes and it did not disappoint.  My favorite was the arancini.  Kind of a cheesy saffron rice ball fried up.  The hottie loved the cauliflower fritters.  There was also a wild mushroom bruschetta that was excellent.  For entree I got together pork shoulder.  Kinda like pulled pork but not yet pulled apart.  The hottie got the veal and ricotta meatballs.  Good but be warned this is meatball only with no pasta.  The waiters disappeared too often but all the food was good.  A perfect lunch spot."}
{"text":"Decent place, staff innate native beautiful views outside food middle of the road price ok..honestly nothing I'd seek out or be averted to."}
{"text":"Mario Batali and Joe Bastianich have their mitts all over the Venetian and Palazzo with a handful of restaurants. This one is at the mid-level price range so if you want to scratch that Italian food itch, this is a solid moderately priced option.   Rather than being set in a dark restaurant the 'outdoor seating' vibe makes you feel like you're in an outdoor Italian sidewalk cafe. That makes it casual and relaxed, including occasional performances on the town square under the faux Venetian 'sky'.  The menu offers a decent range of unpretentious simple Italian dishes and a robust wine list. The prices are pretty reasonable for the most part for the quality of food. I say relatively because much of Vegas fine dining is overpriced, including Mario Batali's restaurants. It's not the food prices that are the problem, it's the drinks and wine that are jacked up to the top end of the scale.   Overall, you can count on a delicious meal here with decent service featuring all the things we love about true Italian fare.   That's why we come every time in Vegas. It usually works out to $50-$70 a person all-in.   Cheers!"}
{"text":"The food was good. Authentic; I'll give it that. The service was okay. Overly attentive at times followed by no attention at all for 15 to 20 minutes at a time. Prices were good considering that you're in the Venetian at a celebrity chef's venue. Legitimate wine selection. In short, your stomach will likely be satisfied and your wallet will likely not be empty.   However, I cannot overlook a very racist remark Mario Batali made not long ago. It will not stand I'm sure folks will chime in with contrary opinions. Feel free but just like Mr. Chik-Fil-A who chose to use his position and power to spew messages of hate, Mr. Batali has to face the consequences of revealing private opinion in a public setting. In this case that consequence is not terribly significant; I will simply never be a patron. Had I not been invited by my boss I would never have stepped foot in any of his establishments."}
{"text":"Mario is my favorite chef. Period.  This location, however, does not meet the standards of any of his NYC restaurants. The service is ok, but really lacks the polish and finesse you'd expect at a B&B restaurant. Pizzas are great, as always. Cheeses are great too. I go here any time I'm at the Palazzo for a glass of wine and cheese. Save your \"meals\" for elsewhere. Carnevino, for example."}
{"text":"I like the one in NYC a little better, but this one is also very good! I love the simple Italian food that they do and the ambiance is so different from the one in NYC.   The restaurant has an \"outside\" sitting area which feels like a balcony or terrace and gives you the feeling that you are sitting outside in a piazza somewhere in Rome. The area is lively and filled with activity with people performing in the area just right outside the restaurant. Absolutely loved the atmosphere here!  The food is delicious with the pastas being my favorite as they are simple yet full of flavor. My mom had the truffle pizza and she loved the thin crispy crust! Service was wonderful with our waiter attentive and ready to get us whatever we needed.  All in all a great experience, if you're looking for a nice lively lunch spot or just want a nice relaxing meal from the hectic pace of Vegas then come to Otto :) (and don't forget to check the one out in NYC)"}
{"text":"This place kicks so much ass. Probably my best meal in Vegas and I'm not even that into Italian food. I tend to avoid Italian places when outside of the northeast due to them not usually being as good as the food in places like Federal Hill in Providence and usually being twice the price. Otto proved me wrong.  I started with a selection of two cheeses, taleggio and fontina. My girlfriend ordered the roasted tomato and cucumber panzanella.  I think about that cheese like fourteen year old girls think about Justin Beiber. It was one of the best things I have ever had. I enjoyed it with the table bread and it was served with some type of blueberry, another type of preserved apricots and some incredibly good, fancy honey which appeared to have truffle in it. I'm not 100% sure what was in the accompaniments but it was all fantastic. Creamy cheese with the honey on crusty bread mmmmmhhmmm. I knew right when I was eating it that I would miss that plate until the next time I visit. Cant stress enough how much I liked this.  My girlfriend said the same about the panzanella. I took a bite and agreed. It wasnt something either of us would normally order but it all came together so perfectly. I'm not one to take a bite of plain tomato but I would eat mountains of this.   My entree was the Rigatoni with Ragu Napolitana. Big perfectly al dente rigatoni noodles with a veal ragu that was pretty much just stunning. It got better with every bite. At first I wasnt that impressed. Then I kept tasting it and noticed how perfectly and simply flavored everything was. Just another incredible dish..  My girlfriend had the Bucatini. I'll just say she thought everything of her pasta that I did mine.   The service was fine. Attentive but not overbearing. nothing incredible but certainly passable. No complaints.  I never really liked Batali much on tv but after eating his food I feel a little differently."}
{"text":"after a week in Vegas, this is the rare place where amazing European Italian food is served. felt close to home and finally like I was eating normal food again.  for starter, try the persutto and cheese. for main dish, the persutto pizza or.the steak tagliata. The steak.tagliata salad had to much Parmesano cheese,  my only complaint. amazing place to eat which is a must try while in vegas. staff is super nice and fast. FYI for my European people this place offer REAL ILLY Coffee, only place in vegas."}
{"text":"This restaurant is in the strip of the hotel shopping area. It was indoors but I felt like I was outside. The food was great. The pizza was the best I have had in recent memory. And the pasta was amazing! The price was not very expensive! I want to try all the pizzas!"}
{"text":"I had been here before the name change.   I like it better now.   We had a great waitress (Susan).  She was attentive, helpful, and had great insight into Vegas history and sights.    We split the verdure grande platter.  Everything on it was excellent, except the beets.  (They were probably fine, but I don't care for them.)  I loved the garbanzos with tuna, the farro, the lentils and the squash.  The broccoli with chile was fine, as was the eggplant caponata.  I wish I had asked for the marinated olives.    Jeff and I split a pizza that had goat cheese, prosciutto and a light tomato sauce.  The dough was thin and crisp.  The saltiness of the prosciutto was ameliorated by the sliced green onions and the cheese.  A bit salty, but a delicious bite.    We were lucky that the olive oil gelato was available.  Each bite was excellent.  There were buttery, flowery notes, but not the gross mouth feel nor overly sweet aftertaste of some ice creams.  We had it with the pear and chocolate gelatos.    Excellent service.  Excellent food.  Nice location.  (A little pricey.)"}
{"text":"A little expensive.  $42.00 for a 10\" with two sodas.  The ingredients were high end delicious.  Awesome pizza.  The service was impressive."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good but the server was so bad it ruined our experience.  Everything you could imagine a server could do wrong happened...Better service would have bumped this review to a 3.5 or 4 star spot."}
{"text":"I had the Caprese  salad and it was delicious. It's unique being that it's not your typical Caprese. I also had it in November and the bartender told me that they use a different tomato style in the summer."}
{"text":"Been here multiple times... I'm a big Fan of Batali restaurants .. Luv them all! From Babbo in New York to Osteria Mozza in LA, B&B in Vegas .....Enjoyable always! And worth the money!"}
{"text":"After the enthusiastic recommendation of some foodie friends, we decided to try Otto Enoteca for lunch on a Sunday afternoon.  Although the restaurant seemed full, we were promptly seated at a table that afforded a view of the square (i.e. I watched a \"statue\" throughout our entire meal).  Our waiter was enthusiastic and I must note, pronounced the Italian perfectly (although he clearly wasn't Italian).  He guided us through the menu and since we weren't that hungry (and had dinner reservations for Bouchon), we decided on an appetizer and a pasta dish to share.  We got the gnocco frito, and per the waiter's suggestion, had prosciutto wrapped around it.  HEAVENLY!  I've never had anything like it:  it was almost like a savory funnel cake with salty prosciutto and finely grated fresh parmesan.  Omg, yum yum yum.  The portion was huge too - definitely a share-able appetizer!  We then got the spaghetti and meatballs, which is my favorite dish and I'm always on the search for the best meatball ever.  Were these it?  No, but I loved the spicy-ness of the dish and the freshness of the basil really paired well with the pasta.  One of my favorite things about Otto Enoteca was the wine.  Otto has an enomatic wine dispenser, which permits you to get small to large glasses of wine, based on what you like.  This means that your gamble on wine is actually quite diminished; something interesting for Vegas where gambling is so prevalent!  I took advantage of and got a small glass of the Brunello.  The bottle retailed for $220, but my small glass was just $17.50.  A coup, if you ask me, to sample a super rare vintage of one of my favorite wines.  Yay.  Hubby went the amari route and the manager gave us a very personalized walk through of the numerous selections, pointing out the specific ones beloved by Mario.  So special!  The manager seriously spent about 20 minutes just with us walking through all the various types, before we settled on 4 different ones to taste and savor.  And yes, artichoke liquer is actually tasty!  All in all, impeccable service, unique italian eats, and a great people-watching spot make this one a fun afternoon spot.  I would definitely go again and try the pizza, which looked amazing!    But note:  Is it the best Italian you will ever have?  Nah, so I'm not sure I'd recommend this as a prime time dinner spot (especially with the price tag), but I did really enjoy it!  One weird thing worth noting:  we ordered soda water, but it wasn't until the end of the meal that I realized it was being poured from a fancy bottle instead of simply served from behind the bar.  And then the bill came:  $7/bottle.  Oooooooops."}
{"text":"Otto is one of my favourites in Vegas, and the prices cant be beat. In typical Las Vegas fashion, you can spend as much as you want here. But if you are tight on money, 2 can eat here for under $25 very easily.  Booked through Open Table, and was seated right away in a small room in the back. Was the first time i was back here, usually sat on the plaza. I love sitting out there, especially when the opera singers and violinists are performing. The Venetian is so pretty, I love walking through it along the canals with gondolas.   I have been to both locations of Otto, Las Vegas, and New York City. The menus are pretty similar, but i find the wine list is better in NYC. I am a fan of this really obscure Italian wine, and the NYC location has it, LV doesn't. But don't let my snobbery cloud a really good wine list in LV.  You can order 2 different sizes of salads, which i like. Had the arugula and parmesan which was very tasty!  The pizza's here are fantastic. Had the house-made sausage and peppers pizza which was cooked perfectly. The sausage has a bit of heat to it, and the thin crust is awesomely cooked.  Otto is a great way in Vegas (and NYC) for great food and great prices!"}
{"text":"Good spot for Italian dining.  I feel the menu is a bit limited in terms of pasta dishes.   I was looking for shrimp scampi for the longest time and settled for the linguine.  The dish was absolutely amazing!   I could have definitely has a whole other serving of it as it was that good.  The pasta itself was the best part as it was cooked perfectly and had this amazing consistency to it.  The sauce was absolutely divine and made me want to fill a thermos with it and drink it.   I definitely recommend this spot.   While the dishes seem basic they are very well made.  It really makes you appreciate the quality in a simple well-made dish.     Fancy decor.  If you eat in the venue it is a nicely decorated spot with dozens of wine bottles adorning the walls.   \"Outside\" seating has you in a fenced Ibarra of the Grand Canale Shoppes under the artificial sky ceiling that adds the perfect touch to the meal"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Had this when I came back in September to Vegas and had the pepperoni pizza and it was so amazing that I wanted to get it again but unfortunately they were out of pepperoni. The waiter suggested the prosciutto and arugula pizza and it was okay, but was definitely looking forward to the pepperoni.  We also ordered the margarita pizza (which we had before as well) and it was good as always. We also tried the snap peas which were very good and they allowed us to customize the spice level which was nice. Always have great food while coming, just wished I couldve had the pepperoni pizza."}
{"text":"Mario Batali is everywhere. Thankfully I'm a fan.  This is my second visit here, and an updated review is in order. I now give it a solid four stars.  The location and atmosphere are festive. Even though this is \"make believe\", you could drink yourself into believing you are among the great cathedrals in Venice.  Our party really enjoyed the spaghetti and meatballs, shrimp linguini, and steak tagliata. The meatballs are made using beef brisket. The meat is seasoned well, and had a unique dense texture. The spaghetti and linguini pastas were outstanding. The pasta was cooked just right, and I would go back just for the pasta, The steak tagliata was another highlight. The steak was seasoned and tender, and I would recommend."}
{"text":"Ate here for lunch during a conference, the food was great.  I wish I could have tried more from the menu."}
{"text":"Had the meatball pizza which was just okay.  Not anything special.  Service was decent.  Not a place I would go out of my way for but as it's just not special."}
{"text":"Pizzas comme en Italie, buonissime ! Pâte à pizzas fine, anchois frais, cadre à l'italienne dans un des plus beaux hôtels de vegas. Service rapide et prix raisonnables, une bonne adresse à vegas!"}
{"text":"Horrible service!! We just walked out after waiting 20 minutes for someone to come by to order drinks. Either they are short staffed or the manager needs to get fired here."}
{"text":"The food was decent, but the service is probably the worst I've ever came across! Our waiter MIGUEL was so rude and far from attentive. He never checked up on us, not even to get our check, he walked by so many times to check the tables around us, but neglected ours. If you are looking for a good dining experience stay far away from this place."}
{"text":"The Otto at the Venetian hotel in Vegas. Every dish here was amazing! The pizza from the kids menu with black olives (the crust was crunchy and the sauce so good). The kale salad and the Branzino dishes were full of flavor. The chocolate gelato, yummy. Only the tiramisu was so so"}
{"text":"This was a good experience. The pasta was good.  Meatballs were a little hard.  Pizza was crispy and yummy, just the way I like it.   Service was very good as well. Sat on outside patio area and enjoyed the ambiance of the palazzo.  Very nice evening."}
{"text":"I don't understand Las Vegas.... Food horrible and so many big name just for tv.... Otto is one of them! Mozzarella caprese Fritta???? Tasted and looked like little pieces of crap! Nice location... Probably the best.... The name on the back.... Batali... Is he really a chef??? Horrible Horrible shame on you!"}
{"text":"I had Margarita Pizza which was delicious....the Tiramisu was awesome!....they make everything from scratch.....good service! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"While the ambiance was nice, the food was only mediocre and very overpriced. We had the margarita pizza and arugula salad, and while the salad was very good, the pizza was bland and unappealing. Definitely not worth $21 for a 10 inch pizza. Stick with Dominos."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing. Waiter was the worst I have had in a long time. Appetizers were missing ingredients. Pizza was okay but did not meet expectations. Seriously, Sbarro's would have been a better choice. Not worth the $100 meal."}
{"text":"Neapolitan pizza is amazing here.  Perfect amount of toppings with fresh sauce and fresh mozzarella.  The bottom crust was crunchy with a wonderfully chewy end crust.    We also tried some of the appetizers:   Cauliflower Frittelle  and  Frittelle di Prosciutto.   Frittelle di Prosciutto was good but very salty.   Cauliflower Frittelle  was also very good, but the portion size was large and we had to stop ourselves from over eating.  Service was a little slow, especially for being lunchtime on a weekday.  However, we would go back because the pizza was just that good!"}
{"text":"Not very impressed.  As far as Vegas hotel fare goes it was ok.  I had the braised pork ravioli and a nice Barbera.  The ravioli was thin with way too much sauce.  The Barbera was wonderful, but when  got to the bottom of the glass I drank in a large wad of sediment.  My glass had been the last poured from the bottle and they weren't paying attention.  I then had the tiramisu and some coffee.  The tiramisu tasted nice, but the mascarpone mixture was the consistency of peanut butter.  It was so thick it was sticking in my mouth.  We didn't see much of our waitress, but the busboy was incredible.  He was very attentive and even helped us with more coffee when our waitress had disappeared.  Not the worst italian food, but for their prices it was very disappointing."}
{"text":"Let down.  I really wanted to like this Mario Batali joint.  It is obvious that it survives as a result of the celebrity name, and its beautiful location.  Had the salami as an appetizer - terrible - grainy, and devoid of flavor Capponata - Took chunky and sweet Margarita(sp?) Pizza - $24 bucks for a personal sized pizza with barely crusty crust?  I have had NY Pizza, tons of brick oven pizza, and this doen't rate close in quality to most of it.    An overpriced(typical of Vegas) celebrity restaurant that is worthy of a pass"}
{"text":"Their prosciutto bruchetta is amazing order it! They also have a great selection of meats and cheeses. Wine menu by the glass starts at $11. Good service."}
{"text":"Loved the casual atmosphere and beautiful surroundings. The drinks and meat and cheese selections are wonderful. Great service"}
{"text":"This place was really cute and busy. My mother and I ate lunch here and everything was really good. She had the meatballs and I did a pizza. The only gripe I have, is the pizza was a little over cooked. Our server was so friendly and very attentive."}
{"text":"I was disappointed with the other Batali/Bastianich joint, so I was a bit hesitant on coming here.  Unfortunately that wasn't the case.  I sat down with friends and ordered a corkscrew pasta dish with pulled lamb, mint, and tomatoes.  I was hoping that the sheer simplicity would work.  Luckily, it did, and it was delicious.  The pairing with the house red also helped quite a bit as well.  Our server was pretty cool and helped to curb any suggestions that our group had throughout the evening.  My only gripe were the stupid pigeons who decided to camp on the fake balcony, which was right over my entree.  I had to move the dish out the way several times in hopes that I wouldn't have a poop surprise on my plate.  Fortunately, it wasn't the case.  Overall, I enjoyed this more than the other B/B place, and would definitely come back ... as long as the pigeons were somewhere else."}
{"text":"This restaurant has become a family favorite! Always a wonderful experience. We celebrated my husband's birthday last night. Service was excellent, staff was friendly and the food, as always was superb!  Lasagna, pasta a la Norma, salmon and a beautiful assortment of cheeses and cured meats. High quality in a wonderful setting! Italian perfection!! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"We had a leisurely late afternoon lunch here after a day of shopping and it was just perfect.  Fun location in the fake St. Mark's Square at the Venetian.  The food is really yummy -- we had the black spaghettini with calamari, charcuterie & cheese pates, and these awesome vegetable sides that were perfectly cooked (parsnips, eggplant, and beets).  Service is friendly, helpful, and attentive. Mario Batali does not disappoint!"}
{"text":"The short rib ravioli has no cheese. Only stuffed with meat and topped with sauce. It's okay. But the penne is better. Nothing spectacular for what it's worth."}
{"text":"Greeting- yes Vibe- Italian  Service- good to slow Prices - expensive Food Pizza is ok and expensive over $20 for an individual pie Black spaghetti and meatballs was interesting  WIGB? No"}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times but never disappoints. Although you can never take from dining in Italia, this gets close. Love when. they offer the guanciale. Have an order of prosciutto and buratta and you are transported. Finish with an amaro and homemade gelato and enjoy."}
{"text":"Above average for a casino restaurant.  We were fortunate to snag a table for dinner right along the rail in the \"courtyard\" meaning that we enjoyed the string quartet that was playing as well as the incomparable people watching that Vegas casinos offer. If you were with a significant other, it would be pretty romantic - all the atmosphere of St Mark's Square in Venice without the worry of being shit on by hordes of pigeons. As it was, I was here for work and had to confine myself to enjoying the fashion choices of the tourist hordes.  Wine - well, an enoteca generally means \"wine bar\" where the choices are many and the price is reasonable. This is Vegas - the choices are many, but the prices are mighty. That said, I did have the best prosecco I can recall (bone dry) for a relatively reasonable $12/glass.  Food - I had a hard time choosing between pizza and meatballs. But at the end of the day, who doesn't want to sample Mario Batali's balls, amirite? All ball jokes aside, my meal was really good - if meatballs could ever be described as \"light\", these were. I liked that they were served with polenta rather than pasta. And the serving was generous - 3 large meatballs. Personally, I can only handle two balls at a time. (sorry, couldn't resist)  Side - Cold peas with prosciutto & mint - absolutely delightful.  Service - slightly above average. We didn't see her a lot but no real issues either.  Two further questions:  Does \"Otto\" mean something in Italian? Otherwise, it kind of seems odd to name a restaurant after the bus driver on the Simpsons.  This place is located across the piazza from a Wolfgang Puck joint. Do the servers here fight it out after hours a la the Sharks and the Jets? Because that would be pretty awesome."}
{"text":"I brought my honey back here last week, mainly because I wanted him to try some of the amazing cheeses on the cheese plate.  I also wanted to try something different.  We arrived a bit earlier than our 5 o'clock reservation and I didn't see my awesome waiter from last time, Jeffrey, so I didn't bother to ask to be in his section.  That sadly was an error.  He did show up right around 5 but it was too late by then.  The waiter I got assigned wasn't nearly so attentive (he actually disappeared partway through our meal) and to be honest, much as I hate to say it, I could barely understand his accent so I didn't ask as many questions about the menu as the first time.  We ordered five cheeses - the three I had last time plus gorgonzola and parmesano reggiano.  I love blue cheeses but the gorgonzola was actually a bit too strong for me, which I found really surprising.  My favorites this time were the aged goat cheese and the parmesan.  I still love the cherries that come with that dish.  For entrees my honey ordered the lasagna and I ordered the sausage and peppers pizza.  I had a bite of his lasagna and thought it was very good.  The pizza alas was just mediocre.  The sausage didn't have much flavor and it was sparse on cheese, though the cheese was good quality, and to be frank I didn't find the sauce very flavorful.  I preferred the goat cheese pancetta pizza from last time, which was different enough from a 'normal' pizza that I wouldn't compare the two directly.  For dessert we tried the cherry shortcake which was pretty good.  The cherries were sadly not the same ones as on the cheese plate which is what we were hoping for, but were more like queen anne cherries.  It was still a decent dessert but didn't hold a candle to the amazing pear sorbetto from last time which alas was not offered on this visit.  I still like the restaurant overall but I'm feeling like it's very hit or miss, with some potential for greatness that isn't always realized."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. Bad service, our waiter went MIA several times during our 2 hour dinner on Friday night.  Our food was cold, the past was way undercooked.  The pizza  was also cold, very skimpy on toppings, no sauce. Tasted like a dry cracker.  Nobody in our party of 6 liked this place."}
{"text":"The food was pretty good, service was poor. My sausage and peppers pizza was tasty, and my friends' meals (braised short rib ravioli and veal ricotta meatballs) were fantastic. Our server was very nice when he was around but was not attentive. Took three of us almost two hours to complete a meal, and in the end our credit cards were not even split correctly with the amounts we had written down on the check. Overall not bad, but I don't think I'll be going back."}
{"text":"I was very disappointed by this restaurant. The service was good, but the food was not very tasty and the wine list, while very good, was more expensive than the dinner! It felt like an over-priced tourist restaurant."}
{"text":"Delicioso, buen ambiente, excelente servicio y buen precio. Uno de mis must do en Las Vegas."}
{"text":"some of the best pizza ever, beef brisket meatballs on a well thought out base consisting of high end parm slices and chili oil. great tuna salad too! big fan of both chefs, this was a treat."}
{"text":"Mario Batali - please read and fix this in your restaurant.  Otto's has an eviable location and whilst staying at the Venetian hotel with my 70 year old mother-in-law and twin 7 year old boys, convenience and an easily acquired view (of the Venetian square) counted for a lot.  Unfortunately, our dining experience was ruined by the staff's refusal to provide a side of pasta with marinara sauce to my mother-in-law!  She's from back east, so she's used to family style Italian places where one gets a side of pasta with a main course. They had the audacity to suggest we purchase another entree of spaghetti and meatballs for $23!  I went escalated to the manager and received the same response. I was told at one point that because the food is prepared in a kitchen that's not actually on the immediate premises, custom orders are not possible. It surprises me that an Italian restaurant with these price tags wouldn't be able to produce a plate of \"pasta with marinara\" by request. Given the sponsor chefs (Mario Batali, Joe Bastianich) are of such notoriety, I was surprised and disappointed.  Maybe they treated us poorly because we had our 7 year old twin boys with us or we didn't look sufficiently sophisticated.  (You try looking good after chasing 7 year olds all day and dealing with your M.I.L). Very disappointing."}
{"text":"We couldn't decide where to have a nice Italian dinner in the Venetian and after reviewing the menu, we decided to try this restaurant.  The hostesses were friendly and one showed us to a table in the 'outdoor' seating area that was located towards the end and away from all the noise.  Our assistant waiter came with bread and water quite promptly.  Our waiter was friendly and casual.  I ordered a bellini which was not a slushy drink but still good.  The bread was good and I like how it came with the dipping oil and vinegar.  They brought out 3 pieces for 2 people which I didn't quite understand why they didn't have even number of pieces.  But I guess that was all that would fit on the late.    The menu contains more wine choices that food so if you want to try a different wine, this would be a great place to go.  I had the rigatoni ragu with veal and pork shredded in tomato sauce with the pasta.  The portion wasn't too big but just right and saved enough room for dessert.  I liked the meat as it was different from meatballs but filling.  During the meal, we asked for more bread and the assistant waiter was very quick to respond to our request and told us to let him know if we wanted more.  For dessert we had the tiramisu.  It's not the usual tiramisu that I've had but it was good and I liked the espresso gelato.  It's definitely pricey at $14 though.   It wasn't a cheap meal, $21 for pasta, $12 for drink, and then dessert  but it was a great atmosphere and meal."}
{"text":"Wellllll, I'm underwhelmed!   I ordered the Penna alla Norma and it should be renamed penna alla boring!  Not too tastebud tantalizing!  My husband ordered the veal and ricotta meatballs with polenta.  He claimed it was \"good, just not exceptional.\"  We then ordered gelato which was soupy!  Not a thick rich consistency that clings to your tongue and the roof of your mouth!  Flavors were thin!  Lastly, the stools at the bar were uncomfortable!!!  I won't be back!"}
{"text":"The food was good but not outstanding.  We had the beef tagliatelle.  It was flavorful but I thought the meat was a little tough. I love arugula but there was so much filling the plate that it became boring.   The salad and spaghetti and meatballs were fine. The wine was a bit overpriced but tasty and a pretty good pour. The atmosphere was lively but not exactly comfortable.   I guess I have been comparing all restaurants to my favorite in london...good food a little pricey but I always leave wanting to lick the plate and the atmosphere there is just the right mix of comfy and cool that I am almost more happy to go by myself...I want that experience all the time!!!... The service at otto was  good just a tiny bit off from excellent. Thank you rocco!"}
{"text":"Located inside the shopping area inside the Venetian, this Batali restaurant was awesome.  Most people that dine here are able to sit on the patio so that they can people watch while they enjoy some delicious food.  We didn't make reservations and were seated inside the wine room.  Only complaint was that it was pretty stuffy inside which I thought was weird considering the amount of wine they had nearby on the shelves.  As we were browsing the menu, a server brought over the water along with some bread http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/otto-enoteca-pizzeria-las-vegas#BybPUIq7bTLkopItCcsTXA.    We opted to share a few appetizers which included the sweet potato croccheta and the spiedini http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/otto-enoteca-pizzeria-las-vegas#64U553oYf5iPiEJNBYzcSw.  Both were fried to a dark golden brown and were tasty.  Highly recommend the spiedini as it came out hot and was like eating a gooey cheese melt.  Next appetizer we shared was an assorted vegetable antipasti which comprised of the following marinated olives, eggplant caponata, roasted parsnips, roasted cauliflower, and the otto pickles.  All were tasty but be warned that the pickles have a very very strong vinegar taste to them which people may/may not like.  We then shared the prosciutto and arugula pizza http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/otto-enoteca-pizzeria-las-vegas#vreDtfVTfDNJCRA3SZqRGQ.  I cannot tell you how good this pizza was!!  The crust was crispy throughout and combination of prosciutto, mozarella cheese and their sauce was amazing!  This is where the vast majority of pizzerias that serve thin crust pizzas fail as it's soggy in the middle of the pizza.  Next up was the gemelli pasta which consisted of their homemade sausage with broccoli rabe bits http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/otto-enoteca-pizzeria-las-vegas#6Q7NoNkvAMfRK_jyyFYILA.  The sausage once again did not disaapoint and was simply awesome.  The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente and the broccoli rabe and sausage combination was to die for.  Batali did not disappoint once again and I wouldn't hesitate to dine here again when in Vegas."}
{"text":"With the name change (formerly Enoteca San Marco) came a blow to the quality of this comfortable eatery.  The menu is the same.  You get to select the number of items you want to try or share from a well chosen list of cheeses, cured meats, salads, fried items and if you like, add pastas or pizzas to your starter.  Fun.  Wines by the glass are still 250ml pours making them a great deal.  The slip in quality is found in the service and quality of the prepared items.  I am a regular and several managers and servers know me so I have never had any problem with service however, another guest sitting at the bar next to me was told that she had to pay $5 if she wanted an extra marinated cherry with her cheese course.  Another asked for additional olive oil for his bread, his server told him that they give you enough for your bread and wanted to be sure that he would not waste the additional oil.  As for my food the fried cauliflower was heavily coated in uncooked batter and the pasta was extremely salty.  I sent the pasta  back but thanks to a language barrier (the busser did not speak good English), my dish returned with NO salt.  Oh well.  They took it off the check and comped my wine so I was satisfied.  This is still a good place for a quick bite, especially if you want to enjoy the show that is the Venetian."}
{"text":"A harrowing experience that I have never forgotten   On December the 27th, 2010, my family and I decided to eat at this establishment, a quaint and attractive corral of tables inside the Venitian. Thinking that pizza was universal enough and since I love cheese, I ordered the pizza quatro fromaggi. It should be called the \"pizza quatro dimone.\"   While my fellow diners were privileged to partake in good and tasteful victuals, my experience was horrifically different. The \"pizza\" arrived, a thin yet textureless crust more bland than a saltine cracker. Oh, what I would have given for the remainder of that meal to have been so bland!   The sauce was somehow simultaneously as bitter as orange juice served in an aluminum cup and as sweet as frosting, smothered atop the pizza in a bloody masacre-like fashion. The surface of the pizza would have been only sauce, but for one horrific, greasy, formless globule of cheese in the center of each piece. I'll never know if it was the Tallegio or the Cacio that fell me.    And here, I start to go blank. The memories, the horror...  The taste of bile and frosting mixed with locker-room sweat and sourness, mixed with the at once rosey yet musky dirty-water \"Esscence of the Venitian\" scent wafting through the air ducts. I could taste nothing but that for days. Every food I ate for the rest of the day tasted of IT.   Now I sit here, more than two years later, still remembering every once in a while that terrible taste, that permiating aroma. I can still smell it on-call, just by remembering.   Shame on you, Mario Batalli. In all of your culinary genious, you have hidden ONE fateful dish on your menu, making for a cruel game of russian roulette.   Although you may partake of its benignant friends, BEWARE of this pizza and the evil it portends!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at a number of Mario Batalli restaurants and like the others both the food and service was exceptional. I had the linguini with mussels and saffron."}
{"text":"They have gluten free pasta and it's delicious! I left satisfied for under $15 and in my option that is a great deal for gluten free and being in Las Vegas. We even got to see/hear the musicians play while we ate."}
{"text":"This is our first visit, they had a strong start with a poor finish. The only reason that I rated it a 3 star is that the food was on point.   Believe it or not, I have more grace for a miss on food than a miss on service. After placing our appetizer, dinner and wine order, service was scarce. I had to pour the wine myself for my wife and I, which should not happen. Our wine glasses were empty for a while. What's worse is that the server was aware we were celebrating our anniversary, and we were neglected most of the evening.  If you want good food and mediocre, at best, service, this is your place."}
{"text":"Ok food, and Ok service.  Mario Batali should not associate his name with a restaurant at this mid level."}
{"text":"I can't give half stars...but if I could...I would give this place a 2.5. I would have to say the service was very good. Our server was very knowledgable about the menu and suggested some good appetizers and entrees, well at least he made it seem like they were good. There were 9 in our party. We ordered a cheese platter with some nice condiments like apricot marmalade, cherries and honey that went amazingly well with the ricotta cheese. I don't remember what other cheeses we ordered, I think there were like 8 different kinds on there. They were cheeses that you could buy at Trader Joe's or Whole Foods or even possibly at an Italian Deli, which I'm sure would be way better. That platter alone was about $30 and we ordered 2 different pizzas....might I say I had better. I would prefer a Pizza from Pizzamania in Long Beach, Ca. over the pizza from Otto.  My boyfriend and I had a Grilled Pork Chop for our entree, the server suggested for the pork to be cooked medium rare...but when we got it it was well done and dry. I'm just glad there were juices from the pork that I could dip my meat in. I didn't want to send it back because we've waited long enough for our food. All the other pastas that everyone else in our party ordered looked like below avg pastas. I've had waaaay better pasta cooked by yours truly. Like any other restaurant in Las Vegas, everything was over priced for the way it tasted. It wasn't anything special. It's not a place that I would recommend to others. I never like Mario Batali that Orange Croc wearing chef...he seems to be way to over arrogant for the menu at Otto. I don't think I would go there again. Just Sayin!!!"}
{"text":"We went to Otto for lunch a few weeks back. We'd eaten there a few times before and had really enjoyed it. I'm a fan of Joe and Mario and mama Lydia. Does Lydia know that you put Boquerones on the Pizza Romana? I just can't imagine that anyone thought that a Spanish White Anchovy in vinegar was appropriate for a Pizza with big gobs of undercooked Mozzarella. That Pizza was undercooked, gooey, and had vinegary fish on it! Yuck! Our other dish, the grilled Radicchio with smoked mozzarella on the other hand was completely overcooked. The Radicchio charred and ashy, the cheese crispy and sweaty. Big Disappointment. Service was very good. I did say something to manager about Boquerones being a strange item with undercooked cheese and she said that it has always been that way. hmmm. Anyway, very expensive and very unremarkable."}
{"text":"Tried this play a while back, and it was really amazing! I love the locAtion of this restaurant and the food. I remember having an eggplant dish and it was cooked to perfection. I really want to try this place again"}
{"text":"This was my top pick when planning our visit to Vegas, and it didn't let me down! I had the braised pork shoulder which was unbelievable- I'm still dreaming about it. My husband got a pizza, which was large enough to bring about half of it back to the hotel for a late night snack.   The service was as great as the food, and we were \"outside\" so we got to watch a performance on the stage in the square as we ate our lunch, which only added to the experience.   We had such a great time and a great meal. So thankful for the experience."}
{"text":"Salami Cotto. Formaggi. Arugula and Shaved Parmigiano. I cannot remember which other salad. Sausage & Peppers Pizza. Lasagna. Gelato. :(  Still deliciouso!  :)"}
{"text":"Good service, good location and good Italian food with nice large glasses of Wine! Try any of the Yummy Pasta's or the perfectly cooked to order Pizza's .  It was my 10th year running to this place when I'm in Vegas. I enjoy coming to Otto because they try to seat you as soon as possible. Unlike other restaurants here at the~Venetian which gets me so frustrated at times."}
{"text":"Good food and service.  However, expect to walk away hungry in an hour.  1. Grilled Radicchio with Smoked Mozzarella - If you're expecting something light, pass on this one.  It looked like lasagna.  Basically, burnt leaf smothered in melted cheese.  2. Prosciutto Arugula - Light and hit the spot.  Chewy crust, crispy middle. 3. Sausage & Peppers - Taste exactly like it sounds. 4. Spaghettini - Amazing!  Tons of mushrooms, light flavors.  5.  Lasagna (special) - Must try!"}
{"text":"Here for our 4th or 5th group dinner with a party of 10-15. Previously we have always had a lovely time however tonight was truly awful. The only way a wine or water glass was filled was if someone got up from the table to find a staff member. The main courses took over two hours to arrive and were not fully correct when they did. This used to be a 'must go' and has become a 'never again'."}
{"text":"Very very disappointing. I've been here a few times but this was the worst experience I've had in Vegas. I eat at the Otto in ny often. First we ordered a cheese plate ...the condiments the gave us made me think they must be rationing food. It was not enough for the plate we ordered. So we asked for more to which they stated they needed to charge us.....I couldn't even respond i was totally appalled ... We ordered an additional cheese tray and the food runner gave us extra honey. He should be a waiter... Then I decide to defer from the dish i get here and try something different...bad idea. I order linguine and mussles.... I get a dish that has about 7 mussles of which 3 are closed shut...really?  Sent it back and ate after everyone else was done. Definitely off the list we were to aggravated to even get an espresso."}
{"text":"Yup, same great quality as NYC.  The salads are fantastic!"}
{"text":"This is a decent spot for some casual dining in the Grand Canl Shoppes in the Venetian. A few years ago this place used to be called Enoteca San Marco and I could honestly say that it boasted the best pizza I've ever had. Unfortunately ownership has since changed and although the menu looks almost identical to its earlier version, the quality has dropped a great deal. As things stand now, Enoteca has 2 things going for it: a good location in the middle of the replica of St. Mark's square which means that you will get a chance to see a performance of the \"Phantom\" soundtrack and some Italian opera pieces during dinner and that you won't pay an arm and a leg for a meal. The pizzas are about $18-21 each and are sufficient to keep you satiated and  one can easily feed 2 diners if you add an appetizer or 2. I would say the Prosciutto and Goat Cheese pizza is the best, although the last time I ordered it the pizza came out burnt and overloaded with cheese. Do yourself a favor and don't order the Pesto Pizza; it is supremely disappointing. Finally the wine list is (as expected) dominated by Italian vintages but the staff does not offer much in the way of suggestions if you're having trouble deciding. Their pours of wine are also stingy and the waiter made the mistake of using a wide rimmed glass for champagne. If you're not in the mood for pizza, the restaurant offers a limited selection of meats and pasta which are rather standard Italian fare and which you can get for approximately the same price and superior preparation in the nearby Canaletto and Postrio."}
{"text":"I had dinner here a few nights ago, the food was amazing. Cauliflower appetizer was perfectly cooked and the truffle pizza was to die for. The atmosphere was romantic with the lighting and open space, we got sat upon arrival and we're greeted a few minutes later. The rating isn't great because our server was having an off day. I think her name was Sabrina or Serena?  She was nice enough but slow and sort of killed the experience for us. My friends and I are locals and will be back for the food but we will definitely not sit in her section, we all work hospitality and she was too busy to offer recommendations or engage with us, an order taker to the T. But the food was great, drinks were delicious!"}
{"text":"It's been awhile since I've given ONE PENNY for tip...but Otto Enoteca Pizzeria did it!  Three stars for the food and one star for the service.  Arrive at the restaurant at 11AM and the entire place was EMPTY so we thought the hostess would be glad to see some customers.  Boy, was I wrong!  She barely cracked a smile as she directed us to the seats.  After we placed our order with the waitress, the breadman came by with a plate of cold bread...didn't even bother to offer some olive oil or cracked black pepper (all the other tables that came after us had those offered tableside).  The waitress was literally one foot away from my wife when she tried to ask her for some olive oil...totally ignored my wife.  She didn't even come by to refill our water.  The last time we saw the waitress was when she shoved the dessert menu right in front of my wife's face...pretty rude.  C'mon, Mario Batali...if you are going to charge $20 for pizza at lunch, you should hire some more pleasant people.    As for the food...mediocre.  Friday's special was the carbonara pizza.  It was a fair dish...the egg was slightly over-cooked.  DO NOT get the artichoke pizza.  The prosciutto they used was completely flavorless and the scariest part is...that more than half of each slice was pure fat!  So, as you bite into the slightly sour (from artichoke...tasted like they are from a can) and spicy (from chilli) pizza slice, you get a mouth full of white, greasy flavorless fat.  Disappointed...prosciutto should be full of flavor!!!    We ate at Le Cirque the night before for Thanksgiving and the service & food were impeccable.  Mr. Batali has too many restaurants in Vegas and the quality is suffering.  Rather than caring about money and hiring rude but cheap servers and using less-than-quality ingredients, maybe he should care more about his customers."}
{"text":"The Service was bad. Our waiter was Condon sending and treated us like this was the first time we had meat and cheese platter. The pizza was burnt around the edges and  the crust was overcooked. Kids Pasta was way overpriced and they forgot the cheese on the cheese and butter topping. This was the worst food we had in Vegas the entire time we stayed.  I feel like I need to go get something to eat after having dinner at Otto's."}
{"text":"Food was eh. Spaghetti with meatballs had tiny little meatballs and was completely overpowered by the taste of basil upon basil upon basil. Portions were small."}
{"text":"this is mario batali's restaurant.  we actually didn't see it before we made the reservations... and i really didn't like the location / atmosphere.  there wasn't any inside seating... all seats were on the cobblestone and outside near the public.    the service was great.  very attentive staff.  the best thing we ate was the veal and ricotta meatballs.$24. it was served with a very light and simple tomato sauce.  the meatballs were tender and delicous and so light.  they were fantastic!  but does not come with any pasta or sides."}
{"text":"So disappointed to see such poor reviews of Otto.  We loved it here.  It was by far the best meal I had in Vegas on this trip.  From the service, to the food, to the ambiance (minus the tables with kids), it was all perfection.    Firstly, we loved our server.  He was so patient and offered us a reasonably priced wine after we described they type of wine we like.  He offered wonderful suggestions and didn't push us to order too much, or too little.    We stared with several appetizers:  ricotta fritters, which were incredible, lentils, way better than I expected them to be...(I wish they sold those at Trader Joe's), and two cheeses which were accompanied by jam and honey to compliment them.  We had a goat cheese and a cow's milk cheese.    By the time we had gotten through the appetizers we were too full to each get a main course.  We were in the mood for pizza and split the eggplant pizza.  The eggplant was shaved thin.  The pizza had red sauce, which I love and the crust was perfectly thin but not so thin that the slice drooped onto your hand.  It was a fantastic pizza.  Finally, for dessert, we had the Otto Sundae.  Real good and made with gelato."}
{"text":"I like to judge Italian restaurants on their margherita pizzas and spaghetti with tomato sauce.  Both of these dishes are very simple, but if done right, can be amazing.  Based upon the server mentioning how small the dishes are, we ordered both, along with a sausage and peppers pizza, and a cheese plate.  The portions were not as small as the waiter said or what other reviewers have mentioned, and we are not exactly lightweights.    We started with a cheese plate of bufala mozzarella, taleggio, and Cypress Grove goat cheese.  The plate was served with bread, cherries, apricot, and most importantly, honey with black truffle.  All three cheeses were great, and I loved the honey with black truffles.  The margherita pizza was very good.  What really made it stand out was how crispy the crust was.  Many pizzas tend to get soggy over time, as the sauce seeps into the crust, but this remained crispy until the end.  The sauce had a nice fresh tomato flavor.  The cheese was good, though I wish it had more of it.  It was not the best margherita I have had, but I would definitely order it again.  The spaghetti and meatballs were good but over salted.  The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente.  The sauce would have been better with about 1/3 less salt.  The meatballs had nice flavor and added a little kick to the dish.  I was hoping the dish would be in the same class as spaghetti at Scarpetta, but it most certainly was not.  The service was great.  Overall, I would eat there again, though I am not particularly anxious to do so."}
{"text":"Why didn't I refer to Yelp, I could have saved myself grief and money?  The location is beautiful and of course I was drawn by the name of the chef who established this restaurant but the experience was disappointing.  My husband and I ordered a salad to split along with a pizza to share, including drinks.  First, I notice others were getting bread with dipping oil while there food was being prepared.  We did not.  What we received was our pizza? No salad, no bread and no water refills. When I asked the server if we'd get our salad he seemed puzzled. A few minutes later the salad and bread appeared, still no water.  So we were sitting in front of all our food at one time.  Not sure about you, but i like to enjoy my salad and then have my entree nice and hot.  By the time we were ready for our entree of course it was cool.  Our server offered to reheat it and we accepted.  A while later the pizza was brought back to our table BURNT.  I'm not exaggerating, it was three quarts of the crust was burnt, yes black crust. Did no one notice it was burnt?  Why would you serve a burnt pizza? Now we had to ask for a new one.   It would have been so wonderful if our server would have come out and said, the pizza was not to their standards and they will be making us a fresh pizza.  If that would have happened I'd give them a 4 stars!  But it did not and we were put in the awkward position of asking for a new one. We waited and waited and finally received our mediocre pizza. Ugh, such a waste with so many other wonderful Italian restaurants in the local vicinity.   Finally they brought us our pricey check.  I'm okay with pricey when the meal matches, but it did not.  No, offer of compensation for all the mishaps.   If it's a good Italian celebrity meal you're looking for, try Buddy V's Restorante.  We ate there the day prior and it was all around fantastic!"}
{"text":"If you crave for a good Italian food and dont want to leave the Vegas strip & also dont want to hurt your pockets, this is the place for you. I like open spaces but the atmosphere here can be a little dense. From the menu, you can not go wrong with classic Italian dishes."}
{"text":"I \"Otto\" have never gone here. Joe Bastianich is full of shit if he's a Master Chef judge and allows the kind of crap to be served at his restaurant.  I had a pizza which was cold by the time I got it. It wasn't that busy and it didn't take long for our food to arrive so I have to wonder why it was cold.  Quite frankly it tasted like a frozen pizza. Let me rephrase that as it was an insult to frozen pizza - those are usually warm. The crust tasted like cardboard and it looked like they had trouble cutting the slices as it wasn't even cut all the way through.  Cold indifferent service and cold food. Never go back."}
{"text":"I went back and forth on whether to give this place 5 stars or 4.  Not because I don't think it deserves 5, but because I don't want people to think I give top ratings to everywhere I eat.  The truth is, I generally only rate a place if it is really good or really bad.....and I mean reallllly bad.  I don't like being negative or nitpicking unless they have truly offended me or made me feel they have stolen my money.  That being said, I've had nothing but great experiences here and so I can't help but give it the 5 Star treatment.  The cavatappi with lamb ragu dish is mind-blowing. I will admit, I'm a sucker for lamb and this dish is one of the reasons why. I must have had it for the first time 4-5 years ago and it's what keeps me coming back every time I am in Vegas.  The meat and cheese platters are delicious, but a little on the pricey side.  Not that it isn't worth it for the quality you get, but it can really make the bill add up if you go crazy (which I tend to do).  Funny enough, I'd say the one thing you shouldn't get here is the pizzas.  I've had some friends that loved them and some that didn't. I haven't really tried them to be honest.  I just know that if I am going to spend the money to go out in Vegas, I wanna get something I can't normally get everyday. So I'd say if you venture out, try the unique dishes or the charcuterie, you'll love it.  If you just wanna eat some pizza, go find a local pizza spot and you'll walk away with some extra dough.....see what I did there....okay, I'll stop now."}
{"text":"We have eaten here 4-5 times for lunch, and it almost never disappoints. This time we also did the wine flights and would rate those at 3 stars - some hits and misses. But the food is why you are there, it's unpretentious and always good. A great place for a snack or lunch!"}
{"text":"BEST THIN CRUST MARGHERITA PIZZA EVER! All thin crust fans must eat here at least once. I was not impressed with Mozza (another Batali pizza place in CA), so my expectations were low. The cheese was insane! It was sooo fresh and creamy and light, it wasn't leathery at all! The dough stayed crisp at the bottom, which I have never seen before. Usually when u first get a thin crust pizza at your table, the first slice is nice and crisp, but the following slices get soggy and buckle when you pick them up. This one held it's shape like a crisp little cracker, but it had that unmistakeable chew of a pizza.  My GF was obsessed and she said it deserves 5 stars. I did wish the sauce had a little sweetness (it's more salty than sweet) and maybe a pinch of oregano. My other favorite Pizza place is Tirovino in LA.   I was really disappointed with the gelato. I ordered the Graham Cracker, Almond Ice Milk, and Dark Chocolate Malt. They were packed in layers in a little metal cup, which irritated me, I wanted to taste each flavor, not have them all mashed together! Wtf?  I tried to separate them as best I could but the flavors were kind of boring and not as interesting as I thought they would be. The ice milk was the best but it wasn't a smooth creamy gelato, more like an icy sorbet. I couldn't taste the malt in the chocolate one at all, Too bad, because I love malt! The graham cracker texture was nice, but this needed a pinch of sea salt or something. I got a cone on the side and it looked fine, but tasted burnt. Anyway, it definitely wasn't worth $13. There are much better desserts to be had in Vegas, like the berry nutella crepes at Paris and Bellagio ;)"}
{"text":"Delicious food. I had my kids and it worked out perfectly with the entertainment right there."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointing service.  The 2 girls who are the hostesses had very poor customer service skills and  they wer both ugly to boot - Friday, Sept 2nd.  Had a reservation and wanted a table by the rails and they ship us to timbuktu and when I asked for a closer table so that we can see more of hte \"square\" they acted as though this was the greatest incovenience.  And to punish us, took 20 minutes to set this up and all others were booked.  then the bus boy was stupid and we did not get our bread until 10 minutes into the meal when our salad was being served.  The food was great and reasonable but the by the glass wine selections were very poor and over priced.  But these 2 ugly girls should be fired for their very poor service - not a great first impression for this restaurant - one star is even over-rated - should have zero stars."}
{"text":"Came to Otto after dinner for drinks. I took a brief look at the cocktail menu and quickly decided that I wanted to try a few of their signature cocktails. I ended up trying quite a few. I started off with the iWhiskey and my friend got a Otto New York. Both were amazing. Decided to try to Montenegro which is apparently an Italian traditional drink that you're supposed to have after a large meal. I'm glad I tried it but I wasn't super fond of it. Since it was an Italian restaurant, I HAD to try the limoncello and I was pleasantly surprised. It was delicious! The service was excellent. The bartender Rico was super easy to talk to & well versed in his drinks. Fhaye was such a great host as well, taking the time to explain the drinks and the history behind them. I'm definitely going to come back soon to try the food!!"}
{"text":"Big fan of Mario.  Went to his NYC restaurant before he was famous. Otto has a nice, lively outdoor area but we opted for indoors for a more intimate evening.  The decor was nice but a little too formal for a bistro.  The Margherita pizza was evcellent, better than what we had in Rome.  The gemelli pasta with brocolli rabe and housemade sausage was really flavorful but the pasta itself was too al dente for us.  We thought they should have offered to shave some fresh parmesan on the pasta dish but they didn't.  The appetizer fritti arancine (fried rissoto) was excellent; the fritti di Prosciutto was not as good.  Pistachio and dark chocolate malt gelato was as good as it gets; really smooth, rich and flavorful.  We found the wine by the glass and by the ounce way too pricey; a 4 ounce glass of their middle of the road white and red cost as much as our entres."}
{"text":"The food was okay but the service was so bad I took away a star. Every time I looked for our waiter, he was talking to the hostess or looking at his phone. Also, he talked us in to ordering two pizzas instead of the one we had planned on bc he said that they weren't big enough to feed two. Unless you're starving, they're plenty big for two.... especially if you order a bruschetta. Overall I feel like it was a wasted $60. Pretty disappointing to me."}
{"text":"It had been a dream of mine to dine at Mario Batali & Bastianch's fabulous Italian restaurant Otto Enoteca Pizzeria in  St. Mark's Square at the spectacular Venetian 5 star resort since I saw photos of it on Foursquare,  Yelp and on their Web site.   I took my friend there last night as an early birthday present to myself and everything from the Caprese Ensalata appetizer with creamy homemade mozzarella to my main course of Ravioli Brassata, to the wonderful French bread dipped in the highest quality balsamic vinegar I have ever tasted with  extra Virgin olive oil, was fabulous.  Our 2 waiters were knowledgeable and knew how each dish was prepared, which added to my appreciation of each dish as well. The atmosphere was truly breathtaking as well and hearing the opera singers, who were very talented, was a total extraordinary sensory experience!

{"text":"Over the years, Otto Pizzeria at the Venetian Piazza San Marco has been one of my favorite lunch places to hit while in Vegas.  It's in a big wide open area with high ceilings painted to look like the sky so it really gives you a feeling of being at the real Piazza San Marco - actually better since its AC, not in the direct sun, no mega crowds and clean :)  That being said I really used to love the bruschetta there.  The standard bruschetta, not the daily \"special of the day\" bruschetta they serve now.  That and maybe either the bread changed or I'm a little pickier about the bread or dough.    The pic is attached but the garlic, honey, prosciutto looks and tastes like ham on a big jelly baguette.  Not what I was expecting and disappointing.   So I usually have some kind of pizza and really felt like a meat lovers so requested a salami and prosciutto combo.  I was warned (and should have listened) that the salami is aged and has a strong, gamey taste to it.  Wasn't a good choice but my bad.  The second thing that was disappointing was that the pizza wasn't hot or fresh.  Tasted almost like it was reheated - and not reheated enough.  Really disappointing as you can totally tell when you're eating old leftover pizza...  That was two disappointments for the food.  I still love the atmosphere and the service - the busser, waiter and host were all tremendous with excellent service.  They just don't reheat or cook the food.  Overall, if you're at the Venetian, you've gotta eat is the Piazza San Marco... But you might want to try someplace else."}
{"text":"There were 6 of us on our way to see BAZ for the 2nd time at the Venetian and the big question is always where do we go to eat for dinner? We had all intentions of going to Trattoria Reggiano, however a friend of our mentioned Otto, and a friend she was indeed! We started with a large antipasto plate, filled with salami's olives, mortadella, different cheeses, porchetta and prosciutto. The bread was fabulous and thy brought some a couple of jams all just wonderful. The best dish of the night was probably the pork porterhouse, the taste was so delicious and the presentation looked like labyrinth. Others had the Veal and Pork Meatballs, Rigatoni alla Napolitana and the Eggplant Lasagnette all very good. The ambience is fun and our Server Robert was excellent"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try a Mario Batali restaurant since I am such a big fan. It was a little disappointing, it wasn't horrible but it wasn't amazing either.   Bread sticks were brought to our table along with some actual bread and some olive oil and balsamic vinegar. We started off with some Cauliflower Frittelle  which was delicious! I got the Linguine with Prawns and my hunnie got one of the Pizzas. Both these dishes were okay nothing to rave about really. My prawns were nice and big but the whole dish itself was a little bland. The Pizza was okay I have had way better. I got the Lemon Meringue Pie for dessert which was way too sour, it was like a punch in the mouth.   Overall Otto's was rather underwhelming and expensive for what you get, not to sure we will be back."}
{"text":"Stayed recently for a few days in vegas at the venetian and tried this place one night. Not really impressed the best thing we had was appetizer of the bruschetta with the wild mushrooms.  Myself and a friend ordered the spicy clam linguinie past taste like it was not even done and the clams did not taste very fresh at all. There were not too many clams in my dish and many of them did not open which usually means they are bad.  The other friend we were with ordered the pork chop which came out drenched in balsamic vinegar my friend was not very impressed with this as most of the dish tasted like the vinegar.  If I go back to vegas will definitely not be back here. Do yourself a favor and visit another restaurant this place is not cheap and the food is not worth even mcdonalds prices."}
{"text":"came here for my bday dinner pt 3 i liked the dim lightning inside the venetian & the sky wallpaper view & we had a snug lil table in the corner in the exterior of the restaurant - apps had the fried bread thing w/ marinara w/ cheese was yumm entree had the clam angel hair in white wine tried the spaghetti & meatballs & the goat cheese pizza xtra thin crust which i like! =] yay mario batali!"}
{"text":"Food here is a blast. Ambience is spectacular. All the staff including manager are very friendly. I am gonna come here again and again."}
{"text":"The ambiance for Otto is great but I cant say the same for the food.  My friends and I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, ravioli,  lasagna,  margherita pizza and was truly disappointed with the presentation and flavors.   Everything we ate was too salty and needed several rounds of water to wash down the taste.  For quality of food that is being served,  the price is outrageous.   Scarpetta at The Cosmopolitan is  a better choice if you are looking for good italian food."}
{"text":"I had a early dinner with friends and family on Friday March 4th 2016, my friend order a pizza which was ok, the calamari were so salty we couldn't eat them, we told the waiter and nothing was done. Meatballs so so and the short ribs ravioli were also salty, we quess the cook was not in a cooking mood.. The only good food 2 of my friends had was the special shrimp scampi. We ask if they had a house wine, our waiter brought wine that was good but not a 21 dollars a glass, he never told us the  price! We are in no way cheap but 21 dollars for a small glass is crazy, we could have just brought the bottle! Won't ever eat there again! New York has better Italian restaurants!!! The waiter didn't even apologize for the salty food!"}
{"text":"We wanted a lighter dinner after a heavy lunch earlier that afternoon. First, bread was served with olive oil on request. My parents and I shared a caprese, butternut squash ravioli and a pepper and sausage pizza. Comparing the dinner to my experience in actual Italy, Otto unfortunately falls short. What made Otto stand out however was the freshness of the individual ingredients. The cheese and tomatoes on the caprese was great. The squash stood out in the ravioli, and the dough and the peppers on the pizza was just as tasty. I can not say that it quite reached the levels of Authentic Italian flair (judging by the price, that was their goal), but for what it serves it does so quite competently."}
{"text":"Otto Enoteco Pizzeria's was delicious. We went here for a friend's birthday party, and it was great, we had the back room to ourselves, which was nice. In addition, the thin crusted pizza came out perfectly. We had a veggie one and a pepperoni one, both were delicious. Our friend's also ordered the cheese platter, which could easily be shared with 3-4 people easily. It wasn't that great, so you could easily get another appetizer instead. But the atmosphere and pizza are great here."}
{"text":"Service was very good. Knowledgeable waiters, attentive servers. For the service 5 stars. The margaritas pizza was very good, but caprese salad not made with the the expected fresh tomatoes. They were marinated.  Lemonade with rosemary and sparking water tasty drink. Waiter made us boiled plain pasta for baby and it was delicious pasta on its own plain. Made in Italy. Goat cheese pizza too rich tasting. 3.75 stars."}
{"text":"This is a mall pizzeria with a fancy name behind it. The pizza was ok, but I hoped for better. The wild mushroom bruschetta was one of the worst things I've been served in Las Vegas; the bread was charred, the mushrooms were cold and slimy (it was disgusting).     The service was pretty mediocre too; the server asked if we liked the bruschetta and we told him no. He was in complete disbelief and sort of put us on the defensive when he said \"i mean... I can see what I can do about it\". We told him we weren't going to worry about it, but we explained that we weren't going to lie about finding it disgusting and we thought they should know. It was pretty much the last time we saw him until the bill was dropped (and no; he didn't do anything about the bruschetta)."}
{"text":"The best thing about this restaurant is the wine list.  The pizza comes in second. The rest of my party agreed that the pasta was deficient."}
{"text":"We had the pizza for lunch here and i even struggled to give this place two stars. I have not been to a Mario Bartoli restaurant that I have really liked ever.  The pizza was below average, way too much sauce and not enough cheese, but more importantly it just did not taste very good."}
{"text":"Love Batali's food in general ... So I'm a bit biased. Would have given this 4 stars for food, but the Venetian ambiance made it better."}
{"text":"OVERVIEW Good view of the St Marks Square statue performances but pasta too salty to enjoy.   Just realized that this was a pizzeria, so my review is one star higher considering we ordered pasta.   FOOD Had the Spaghetti alla Chitarra, Penne all Norma, and Broccoli.   The only thing going for the spaghetti allá chitarra is that it had a bit of a kick. Each bite was a mouthful of sand, I don't think they even rinsed the clams. I think I may have chipped a tooth (jk). This was extremely salty, even more salty than my review.  Had we not been famished from exploring the strip all day, we would not have eaten it.  Penne allá Norma was decent, but not particularly memorable. Ingredients tasted fairly fresh.   SERVICE Friendly, attentive staff is the primary reason for the stars given.  ATMOSPHERE Good place to catch the performances throughout the day, but Mercato della Pescheria next door has a better, unobstructed view AND a happy hour menu."}
{"text":"Service was great and the food was incredible. Authenticity at its best. The sommelier gave spot on recommendations for wine pairings for our meal. Management was friendly. From beginning to end, great meal."}
{"text":"Food was alright, nothing too special. Service was horrid. No one bothered to check up on us, everyone was rude (even to our toddlers). Would not go again."}
{"text":"Well, I love Otto in LA...unfortunately, this one is not even close to the one in LA...the pizza here was just.....disappointing :(    I did love having a bottle of red wine, a variety of cheeses, meats and olives, while people watching all the crazy people in Las Vegas.  I would definitely come back for just that....but....they aren't actually making any of those ingredients....LOL"}
{"text":"We have a table in the food court at Otto's that we have dubbed \"our table.\" Every trip to Vegas has us enjoying wine and pizza for lunch. It is a favorite! We were a little disappointed this time because they were out of pepperoni pizza that they make there so \"settled\" for the four cheese pizza. The four cheese pizza at Otto's has each cheese separated so none overpowers the others and was very good - heck, we may even order it on purpose next time! I see some of the other reviews not loving the pizza here and maybe we do in some part for the romance of it, but what I really feel is that America's fast food pizzas are thick and greasy and overly saucy, so that a crisp, clean pizza like the ones at Otto's doesn't measure down (not up!) to them. Give it a try, savor the individual flavors and savor the moment, ask for advice on the wine if you need it (the staff is great about that), and enjoy the surrounding architecture."}
{"text":"The service was okay. But the food was extremely bland. Even the zucchini. How do you mess up vegetables? Sauces were $3 extra for tomato. No biggie but again bland. We had to ask for 2 whole bowls of hot peppers to make the pizza edible."}
{"text":"My lady and I dined here on 06/21/17 , approximately around 4-5 pm for their happy hour.   Firstly, the hostess was the rudest, coldest person and the management should be mocked for hiring such a person. During check in, when she asked for my name, she had the audacity to answer a phone call without saying anything to us. Also, when my girlfriend asked where the restroom was located, she was cold and left a bad taste in our mouths.  Second, our waitress was fair but the assistant server was great, kind, and attentive.  Last but not least, after our food was finished we sat for almost 30 minutes without anyone checking on us. I actually had to raise my arm to receive our check.  The food: we ordered the grilled radicchio salad which was different, and some antipasti specials for happy hour. Food was fair but then we did not order a pasta, pizza, or an entree so i can't say with surety.   I'm a firm believer that good food comes with a pleasant environment and warm service. This restaurant had neither.  The bathrooms also had no paper towels which is kind of a disgrace for a decent/fine dining restaurant such as here."}
{"text":"What a disappointment from start to finish. Not only was the service pretty slow but the food was all dry and flavorless. We ordered the grilled radicchio, squash blossoms, pickles, truffle pizza, and the gemelli pasta. Squash blossoms were over fried and had barely any ricotta in them. The pasta was descent but it didn't really have the cheese flavor (or much of any flavor at that). I was so sad! Guess we will just have to stick to B and B only."}
{"text":"My go to place for lunch while in Vegas. I have been numerous times and I find it very consistent, consistently good. This is pretty authentic Italian food. Not the basic American version with heavy sauces and a ladle of sauce on a mound of spaghetti.  While I have not tried the entire menu, I have had the privilege of having several items.  I always start with the Ricotta Fritters. These are crunchy yet creamy deep fried balls of ricotta cheese. I dare you to try and eat just one. I usually follow that up with the Rigatoni with Ragu Napolitana. It is served a bit al dente, so if you prefer softer pasta, ask them to cook it a little longer. The ragu is light with a flavorful blend of shredded veal and pork.  I have also had two different pizzas. The Margherita and the Sausage and Peppers. Both were wood fired with a light crisp crust. I preferred the Margherita. It was so light and fresh. The perfect amount of sauce as to not over power it. It's making my mouth water thinking about it. In the past I have also tried the Ravioli (Butternut Squash with Browned Butter and Sage drizzled on top) and the Gemelli (with Sausage and Broccoli Rabe). Again both were very good. The portions are a bit on the small size, however, they are deceivingly filling.  I have read several reviews that mention they think that the price is a bit high, even for Vegas. I would agree with them. But you must consider the location, ambiance and the Operatic singers and minstrels that are playing and singing in the square.  If you are looking for quiet, you may want to sit inside. If not, the patio is great!  Buon Appetito!"}
{"text":"Went on MLK day. No crowds. I have been here on weekends - crazy waiting. I like the food because it is tasty and does not leave you feeling awfully full. Service is good. Ask for the sommelier if you need help pairing a wine with your food. Lamb chops are awesome. I had them medium."}
{"text":"The B & B Boys rock the Las Vegas Strip with their new trio of restaurants.  However, I do have a soft spot in my heart for this little gem in the Venetian Grand Canal Shoppes.  I had the potato, garlic pizza and much to my surprise loved it.  When you visit Otto everyone is Italian.  The pasta, cured meats, pork shoulder, and other small plaates are the way to go here.  The black ink spaghetti with calamari was a masterpiece.  I also had a refreshing lemon meringue desert.  If you want a top notch meal, and have Italian wannabee blood Otto is the place to be seen!  The B&B Boys!!! Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I always eat here when ever we visit Vegas! Great environment with some classical music! Waiters are very nice and the food comes right away."}
{"text":"I read the reviews and expected ok italian food, but this turned out to be a gem.  its conviniently located in the large open plaza by the gondolas, nice ambience.  The appetizer was delicious, service was good and the entrees didnt dissapoint.  I will return, and I recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"My number one restaurant to visit in Las Vegas  Daily Bruschetta is always worth to try Pasta and cheese selections are great. Evens though this is pizzaria I wouldn't go for pizza they are just normal without any special flavour"}
{"text":"Great pizza and appetizers.  The service was amazing, and the ambiance second to none.  We've been in Vegas three days and have been at Otto's twice already.  Awesome wine selection as well!!"}
{"text":"A big thanks to Joe Bastianich and Mario Batali for making my last Vegas meal a memorable one!  From the Moscato to the olives to the arugla salad and my pasta all the way to the coffee and tiramisu, it was divine.  I can't eat for days I'm so full and content!  Everything was seasoned and prepared perfectly.  I felt like the chefs were in the kitchen waiting for my next order.  The tiramisu and coffee are a must.  The staff were very prompt and professional.  You will not run out of refreshments, nor will a finished dish sit ungathered for long.  Bravo!"}
{"text":"I have been here before and had a much better experience previously.  While the service was fantastic the food was sub standard.  First the Arancini appetizer was extremely salty.  It could have used much less salt.  Second the Bucatini was also salty.  They refilled my water four times because the food was so salty.  The experience could have been so much better if they just reduced the amount of salt."}
{"text":"I love this place. It definitely feels like you are in an outdoor piazza. The food never disappoints and the staff is extremely knowledgeable about the food, ingredients and wine."}
{"text":"Great food. I had a pizza with truffles that was extraordinary and my companions had various spaghetti items that I would enumerate except for all this wine I drank. We also had a couple wonderful appetizers including a preserved tuna and white beans thing that was amazing, great wine list and there were all these post-dinner \"digestives\" - nasty Italian liqueurs that helped you digest if they didn't kill you first. The service was great and it wasn't outrageously expensive. I'm docking it a star because it is in a mall. A high-falutin mall, but still, all the passers-by do detract from the ambiance. Despite that I'd come back in a hot second. Go Mario!"}
{"text":"Ok, I came to this place expecting nothing less than GREAT, I was disappointed, the restaurant was beautiful, the service was fine but the food was so salty that we only took two bites, I never complaint to the wait staff and I didn't do it this time either, but when they came to clear our plates and saw that we barely touch our food they didn't ask if anything was wrong, just assume we weren't hungry? I'm really disappointed... :-("}
{"text":"Went here for lunch, loved the pizza's but was underwhelmed by appetizers.  Service was definitely a bit slow, had to constantly ask for the waiter.  The truffle pizza was delicious!  The artichokes were super bland, there were onions, olive oil and cheese but they needed flavor, literally you could buy a jar at a supermarket and it would have tasted better.  I love artichokes but these were sad.  The pork was on point though.    Also had a bloody mary which was so-so, the one at the Public House was phenominal and it was hard to compare.  Overall, stick to simple dishes and don't expect much from things other than pizza."}
{"text":"Got a Peroni draft beer at the bar  , somehow this  draft is the best I've ever tried ,  I tried another Peroni draft elsewhere, but somehow this seems the best, something is different about it here in Vegas, try it yourself at the Otto bar and you might agree with me , they have a happy hour peroni 2-1 but I'm not sure , I just saw a sign outside Otto , I a small order cheese  platter for $10, there are many choices to pick ,  you ll see it on the food menu, they throw in some fresh bread , it goes will with the beer."}
{"text":"The cheese platter was great,  but the spaghetti and meatballs was awful! The sauce tastes like it came from a jar,  and the meatballs were tiny with no flavor.  Definitely not worth the price.  I should've just ordered more cheese."}
{"text":"Fresh. Flavorful. Simple. Delicious. The food is made from some of the highest quality ingredients anywhere in America. This is a restaurant for foodies. The cured meats, the pasta, the pizzas, the pork shoulder, the Osso Buco, were all just fantastic. Talk to the staff, nearly all of them are food geeks. If you like really good hand made food from only the highest quality ingredients, go. Also, the manage Ralph Treszi is one of the most accommodating and professional people I have met in the food and beverage industry. I have been nearly ten times (I found it through the Molto Vegas Farmer's Market) and will continue as long as the quality and service stay they same."}
{"text":"Over rated. I've had far better pizza in Provincetown , MA (spiritus pizza) and in Hudson, NY ( Baba Louie's). Otto's pizza was boring at best.  We also had a BAD experience with the bill. The bill came, we paid the bill and gave a generous tip. We lingered, chatting and the head waiter came over and announced that they had forgotten a bottle of wine and that part of our table owed an extra 80 dollars. The couple that had wine disputed the bill. I had beer , so I left.  If you go, study your bill closely, pay it and GO. Do not linger!  Seriously, the pizza is over rated. You are paying for a name.  (I loved China Poblano at the Cosmopolitan. Mex/Chinese  fusion at reasonable prices!)"}
{"text":"This rating is for the bar only, as we only had drinks. But they were the best cocktails we've had in a long time - truly wonderful flavor blends, without being \"over the top\". Oh, and the service was outstanding. Ask for Edith - she is terrific!"}
{"text":"Excellent food and service.  We sat out on the square, and it was a great atmosphere.  I had the Gemelli with sausage and broccoli rabe, it was excellent.  The Gnocco appetizer was super tasty as well.  Our server was knowledgeable about the menu and offered wine pairings as well.  We really enjoyed our meal here."}
{"text":"Mario, you need to get back there and fix it. Unacceptable! Portion sizes are meager for the price, the table settings are bland and boring, not even a placemat? Come on! The broccoli rabe was inedible. I had to send it back, and I rarely send back food. Anyone who knows how to cook this vegetable knows that this time of year is the end of the season and the stems are tougher and need to be sliced or chopped and cooked separately to soften them up before adding the leaves.  None of my party of 5 had anything positive to say about the food. The meatballs in my colleagues meatballs were literally the size of meatballs you put on as a pizza topping. He couldn't stop talking about how small they were. Laughable if it wasn't for the price we paid.  I'm normally more cordial and constructive in my comments but this meal was offensive. I'd give it one star but the hostesses, servers and manager were both nice and professional.  Your empire is only as good as its foundation, which is the quality of your food, the value of the experience and the customers willing to pay for it. Forget that at your peril."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple of times.  They serve pretty good pizza here, the crust was fairly thin but had a good layer of cheese on it.    I've also had several of the verdure (vegetable) sides and think they are done very well (except kind of oily).  You can get three verdure as a dish, which is a good option for vegetarians and is reasonably priced and filling.  Love the \"outdoor\" seating area."}
{"text":"It's Vegas and service may not be as in a fine dining establishment. Randall was great but he wasn't our waiter, he was attentive, cleaned the table etc. The food is our major problem. We frequent mozza and we expected something similar. But Mario you have to come to Vegas and redo this restaurant. The pizza dough is terrible, if it can't be like mozza because of nancy silverton then maybe make it more like ny dough. The ingredients were good but the dough was awful,heavy,dense and awful taste. The main course was nothing great probably better at Olive Garden. We love Mario and we're very disappointed in our visit to Otto in Las Vegas"}
{"text":"We were wandering around for a casual dinner, and this restaurant seem to offer the most enticing description on the menu, so we decided to give a go.    The lamb ragu, not too spicy made with homemade pasta and their lasagna was delicious down to the last bite.  The service was spot on and I'm so glad we settled here, because it would have been a crying shame to have bad Italian food.  They kept us busy with packaged bread sticks shipped from Italy and that was a fun conversational food item, while reminiscing about Rome.    It was $50 for two main courses and I'm glad they still serve after 10p.m. because I needed a nice hearty meal.  The portions are not massive, but they are filling."}
{"text":"Respect goes out to Mario for this joint.   I then proceed with my review. Hubby and I got dressed up in our wedding gear. After the gondola rides near by. We were hungry for some lunch. We stumbled onto this place prices seemed right.   Everyone was staring at us because I'm in my wedding dress. My Hubby was suited up. We sat at a table. Service got started immediately. We looked at the menus placed our order.   The manager was there saw us. And give us free liquor on the house because of the occasion. This was very classy of them to do this.  Hubby ordered pizza and I ordered ravioli's. I have to say it was the bomb. The portions were right for lunch time. Hubby couldn't finish his pizza lol. So he had to take the leftovers back to the resort we stayed at.    Pizza and raviolis yes please"}
{"text":"To be honest, this was our last choice for food, but it ended up being a pretty solid choice. Our bachelor party of 12 dudes needed a casual spot to get food without spending too much (in the realm of Strip restaurants), and without traveling too far. Otto Enoteca fulfilled all of those needs quite well. Located by the shops in the Venetian, the space is surprisingly small for how big it looks from the outside, but we were able to get seated right away without a reservation, and drinks/water were distributed very quickly.  We all split some arancini (fried rice balls), which were quite excellent, so much so, that we ended up getting more orders of it to start off. As for my entree, I got the carbonara pizza, which had egg, scallion and guanciale on top, and was quite excellent. I assumed that the egg would just be a runny yolk on top, but it was actually scrambled on top, which turned out really well. The scallion had just enough bite to cut through the richness of the pizza, and I finished the pizza off quite quickly, almost wanting some more.   Service was pretty helpful and attentive, as much as can be in the late afternoon for a group of 12 hungry dudes. Prices were pretty much on par for a casual sit-down for the Strip, with pizzas around $20, and cocktails/wine were about $11-12.  Given the names behind this place (Batali and Bastianich), it's a pretty decent place for Italian if you're staying in the Venetian, but perhaps nothing to go out of your way for. Yet, if you need flexibility and have a large party for lunch or a casual dinner, Otto Enoteca will do quite nicely."}
{"text":"During peak meal times, there can be a wait for a table. Go for the bar instead and enjoy fast service. Order a cheese platter and wine for a shopping break and people watching."}
{"text":"The idea of eating inside the mall doesn't appeal to me but the food at Otto is always so satisfying that I go back again and again.  The pizzas are thin and crispy. They're good to have one for the table and share along with the pastas. The pasta portions are smaller than an average restaurant but great with the pizza. Mario Battali's bucatini all'Amatriciana is a must try."}
{"text":"We tried this place a year ago and loved it so much that it was the only place we knew we HAD to go to again when we were in Vegas just before Thanksgiving. This lovely little spot in the Venetian is wonderful. We got at table \"outside\" (which is really inside the Venetian) and Marissa, our waitperson, couldn't have been more engaging and knowledgeable and Daniel was very attentive. We ordered a small selection of cheeses to start off. The cheeses (parmesan, ricotta and taleggio) were a wonderful way to start along with the bread and oil/balsamic they bring out. The five of us all ordered pasta - a different selection  for each person but we passed around bites so we all got to try everything. One plate came out later than the others so the manager brought out a small dish to try until the entree came out (without asking or prompting - this is what a top quality restaurant does). It was made of pumpkin and farro with a smoked cheese - it was quite good. For my entree, I had the short-rib ravioli that was flavorful and simply done - exactly what I wanted. My daughter got the penne alla Norma which was my second choice as I love both eggplant and good ricotta. This was delicious too. Not one speck of food remained on any plate at the end of the meal and we even split a decadent dessert five ways - a honey semifreddo with poached pears. This is my favorite place to eat in Vegas. The service is top notch and the food is amazing."}
{"text":"Food was great and service!  But we were celebrating a birthday and instead of just bringing a desert and say happy birthday they asked us what dessert we would like as if it was more important to charge us which didn't matter but common sense just bring it and charge after!"}
{"text":"The Pizza and Cannoli were outstanding! Both were so fresh and delicious! I only have two recommendations, one is for them to start serving mochas and second is to change the music. They were playing loud rock music at noon. It didn't match up with the ambiance of the restaurant at all. We had a hard time hearing one other and it would have been nice to hear something more appropriate for such a delicious noon time lunch."}
{"text":"Mediocre Italian Food. The wife and I were looking for somewhere to eat and stumbled upon this place. We thought that because it was one of Mario Batali's restaurants that the food must be excellent. My wife ordered the meatballs and I ordered the sausage and peppers pizza. We both found the food underwhelming and quite frankly not worth what they are charging. If only we had known there was a Carmine's across the street, we would have gone there instead. 4/10 would not recommend."}
{"text":"I was pretty skeptical about the menu at first, since all the item descriptions were pretty plain. Everything turned out to be really flavorful and delicious, though!  The truffle pizza is really potato-y with just the right amount of truffle that didn't overpower all the flavor. We also had the braised pork shoulder which was really tender and well-seasoned. The cucumber on top was a really nice contrast in texture and gave it a refreshing bite.   Being serenaded by the live music on the canal was nice, despite the loud gaggles of Asian tourists snapping photos with their iPads.   This was almost a 4-star review, but I am docking a star for the following reason:  The bill came out while my boyfriend was in the bathroom, so I put my card in and paid. When the check came back out for us to sign, the manager / host (he was checking people in but was also checking on the tables, so I assume he was some kind of manager) handed it to my boyfriend and said, \"Thank you, Stephen.\" It may have been an innocent mistake, but it definitely came off as misogyny. It's the 21st century - women are allowed to pick up the tab once in a while. Poor form!"}
{"text":"We had Arancini and the octopus salad. The Arancini - waaay too cheesy, but still lacked salt! The octopus salad was good.  I ordered the Pasta Norma, it was just ok. Really did not like the texture of the ricotta used in this dish.  Hubby ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, he enjoyed it.  Overall - too expensive for what you get. There are way too many restaurants to try for me to ever give this another chance."}
{"text":"I had dinner here and enjoyed some of their simple but scrumptious menu.   Started off with the mushroom bruschetta- the mushrooms were tasty even if the bread was slightly on the too crunchy side. It was topped by a light cheese (I'm sorry I don't know exactly what kind cheese it was but it tasted like provolone) and some chives to cut the richness of the dish.   For my main, I ordered the chicken paillard. The dish had many layers, starting with a slice of fried eggplant for crunch and bitterness. On it, they spread ricotta to add a creamy texture to the dish. They then added a layer of tomatoes followed by two layers of grilled chicken. The charred edges of the chicken added the perfect amount of smokiness to offset the ricotta. For a little bite and a little acid, they placed arugula that was dressed in a vinaigrette.  A little olive oil finished the dish.  It's a beautiful dish and worth a try.   For dessert, I had a pumpkin cheesecake. It's an interesting dish, composed of both crispy pumpkin chips (tastes similar to sweet potato chips) and thicker slices either boiled or grilled. Underneath was mascarpone (the cheese in the \"cheesecake\") nuts and graham cracker to mimic the flavours of a cheesecake. It was an interesting dessert but definitely not a sweet finish. If you want something sweet, then go for something else, like the gelato that they make in-house.   The only not so nice thing is the lighting - it's a bit too dark for my taste.   Tip: Daily specials are great - check the back of the menu.  Tip: If you're the designated driver of the night, ask about their sodas; they also make them fresh in-house."}
