{"text":"I am not sure if this has replaced George's Bar & Grill, as I did not pay any attention, but regardless it is in the same plaza. Perhaps it has changed? Perhaps it has not.   Since I work in the area, I like to try new places, as opposed to going to the same restaurants/cafes/fast food nearby, and I was in the mood for some Greek/Mediterranean food. Initially I had wanted to try out George's Bar & Grill, but instead I saw a sign saying Stella's Lunch and Grill on the lawn, and saw the restaurant itself when I was pulling into around the corner.   The entrance (photo yet to be posted upon receiving permission from the owners) is welcoming, and the sign is clear. Upon walking into the restaurant, it was pretty spacious, clean/well kept and had a nice and friendly atmosphere, which was very welcoming. I went around noon, and it was not packed inside, as there were only few customers. Some were dining, and some ordered takeout such as myself. When placing the order, you have to go to the very back, as that's where they have the menu displayed, and you then pay at the cash register, which is closer to the entrance. I could overhear that if you are dining in, you can pay later.   I looked at the menu, and from my recollection, they had souvlakis, burgers/sandwiches, salads and some fish dishes. I ordered the chicken souvlaki dinner for $11.25 which consisted of the actual meat, fries/rice, salad, two slices of garlic toast/bread, and a pop/water. The owners were very friendly, and I believe they are husband and wife. I told them what I wanted, and the husband I believe started cooking the chicken. He asked how I'd like the meat to be done, and cooked it accordingly to it. For the salad, they added the dressing, and also provided tzatziki in a small cup that you would normally pour ketchup onto.   Coming back to work, I decided it was time to devour the aromatic lunch that I was about to have. I really can't comment much on the salad, as salad is salad. However, the salad was fresh. So that's always a plus point. The fries were well done, golden and crispy, and it had very little grease to it, which I find its a plus point. Now to the main part, the actual meat or rather chicken itself. I cut the chicken slices in half, and inspected it to ensure that it was cooked properly. So far so good, now onto actually taking a bite. After taking a bite of the first piece and chewing it thoroughly, it had the right amount of flavour and taste. It was not rubbery at all, rather I should say it was not dry at all. This is my first time having chicken souvlaki, and I must say I enjoyed it thoroughly. The portions were great, the taste was great, and so far so good, my stomach is not hurting, which is always a good sign.   I look forward to going to this restaurant again, and hopefully I can take some colleagues with me. PS I forgot to add, they also have breakfast items too."}

{"text":"Breakfast all day.  Local place serving the offices in the area.  Simple and what you need.  Nothing fancy.  It's hard to mess it up eggs.  They overcooked my poached eggs and didn't give that much home fries.  I'm not running back."}
