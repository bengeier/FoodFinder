{"text":"Outstanding presentation the fresh roll and chicken satay very good! Highly recommend the beef salad and chicken basil!"}
{"text":"Good food, beautiful presentation, nice decoration.  I like their lunch special, good value.  Will visit again and again."}
{"text":"Great place hidden in a commercial lot. Food excellent. Service excellent. Recommend to everyone. Try this place out. Definitely order the coconut soup with chicken!!!"}
{"text":"The best Thai food that I have ever had, & that's saying a lot considering that Lotus is their neighbor, & loyal Le Thai customer. I own a local venue in the neighborhood & I take all of my clients & headliners here when they come into town. I can't recommend this place enough."}
{"text":"What a delightful place.  I have yet to find good Asian food on the Vegas strip so I did some research and found this place.  Located a short drive from the strip I tried this place for lunch.  I tried the curry and short ribs.  Both were good, but the curry was excellent.  Only thing I would change is to order it thai-hot since I love spicey food.  Even though the lunch came with a very good dessert, I couldn't resist also ordering the creme brulet and banana Thai pancakes.  Omg, the creme brulet has a beautiful caramel lattice protecting it and the Thai pancakes tasted amazing.  Not too sweet, just right.  Check this place out next time you're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best Thai Food in Las Vegas and can be compared to the high end Thai Restaurants in Los Angeles's Thai Town. All the meats and seafood are high quality and vegetables very fresh. The Bistro atmosphere is nice but the parking lot is on the seedy side so walk fast into the restaurant. Desert menu looks insane but I'm always too full to try there handmade desserts. Service is great. We are so glad to find high quality Thai food in Las Vegas away from the strip and strip prices."}
{"text":"An outstanding off the strip eatery with fantastic food, conmfortable atmosphere, and DELICIOUS foods.  We can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best Thai food I have tasted in USA. The best in Las Vegas, having tried the top 3. Relatively reasonable price considering the quality, serving and ambience. Will definitely visit again if I drop by in LAS. Simply incredible. Don't miss this if you are a fan of real authentic Thai food. Particularly the Tom Yam!"}
{"text":"I like the dessert from Arawan. i had banna puff, was one of the new desserts . Good combinations of fresh strawberries, banana, homemade banana ice cream,  soft wipping cream and nuts. Food was delightful. The service was very awesome. I had tanya as the service. She was one of the best. Will come back to Aranwan more often :)"}
{"text":"Amazing Thai food. Super fresh ingredients and great flavor. Awesome service. Desert s are to die for. Very reasonable prices."}
{"text":"I love this place! All the foods were really great with the great service! I will be back for sure! Love Ribeye Crispy Basil and Catfish is awesome!!! Come check this place out!"}
{"text":"Beautiful decor, jazz sound track, friendly service, and great food!!  My second time here and there will be a third"}
{"text":"I rarely write reviews but this time I had to.   The food is very good and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"Great food, great service, great atmosphere. Definitely go here for a fulfilling meal. Go Now, what are you waiting for? Why are you not going now? Get off your butt and get over here right now for an awesome meal!"}
{"text":"Very delicious meal! I recommend the soft shell crab in green curry and the drunken noodles. Overall some of the best Thai food I've had! 
Also, try there deserts!"}
{"text":"My new favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. My expectations were high based on the Yelp reviews, but after visiting I don't know how other reviewers could dip down to 4 stars. Everything about it was 5 stars! I've tried nearby Lotus of Siam and Komol and they're good...but Arawan is great! The curry short rib was amazing; can't wait to return and try other dishes. The flavors brought back memories of visiting Thailand. Beyond the food, the tranquil atmosphere, cool design and outstanding service were highlights. The staff go above and beyond to ensure an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Arawan is a gourmet Thai restaurant fit for royalties! Thank God their prices r fit for commoners. I went there during lunchtime n order the lunch special! It comes with a soup, main course n a mini brownie like cake for dessert. Evrythin I ate at Arawan r of perfection in taste, texture, n portion size. They even do refill on your order drinks like Thai ice tea or sodas.
I feel so lucky to live so close to such a great restaurant in a sea of greatness from sin city. Oh! Also the wait staffs here r so friendly n courteous. They make u feel welcome n at ease in enjoyin your meal!"}
{"text":"One of the best Tom Yom soups I've ever had. The calamari was amazing. The ambience is nice and clean, just wish it was not located in the ghetto. The Pad Thai was really good too and they have an amazing list of desserts. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This has easily become my definite go-to Thai restaurant around the Strip. I've found this hidden gem only recently and I wish I could have known it sooner. Arawan has everything I love as much as Thai restaurant can get: Great authentic Thai food? checked. Top quality service? checked. Plenty of free parking? checked. Fantastic desserts? double-checked!! If you haven't done so already, do yourself a favor and tryout their desserts like the Earthquake, Mango Island, and the Sweet Sensation Crème brûlée. You're welcome."}
{"text":"The food are excellent. The appearance of the restaurant from outside of the door doesn't do justice to the food served inside.  We had the lobster tail penang curry, clam pad prik pao, papaya salad, seabass with the thai chilli sauce.....and desserts......oh so yummy."}
{"text":"As locals, my husband and I love taking risks and going on tiny adventures trying to find exquisite flovors and exotic cuisines to satisfy our pallets! And this place (Arawan) did just that! We are fairly familiar with Thai cuisine, but \"Gourmet\" and a twist of decadent art... wow!! My husband had the grilled chicken which was simple, yet tasteful with the sauce. I went all out with the catfish!! And I must say, the BEST tasting fish I'd had since Guam!! I highly recommend this place for those looking for a night out, or even a simple \"date night\"."}
{"text":"First off i just want to thank the restaurant  team again for the consistent, fast, efficient and  friendly service provided during my visit.  The decor transported me to a calm and serene inner quiet vibe that only got better throughout the night.  I ordered the pork pork rib yellow curry, the crab fried rice, and the calamari. All three fantastic choices.  When I tell you I've never found hapiness in a bowl until i had the first spoon full of this curry!!!  I'm not exaggerating!  Not to mention the prices here are phenomenal!!!  I cant wait to come back.  This is a must have.  If you're  a food lover do yourself a favor and try this restaurant! This was an unforgettable  experience."}
{"text":"We live in the area but this has become one of our favorite restaurants for thai. Service is exceptional and decor is date night special. Small room off of main dining for small group. Close to strip. Do not miss!  We are so happy to have another fabulous thai restaurant so near."}
{"text":"Arawan is the best! I love this place. Great service, friendly staff and the most delicious food!"}
{"text":"Great service and amazing food.  Best orange chicken and crispy duck in town.  Kay was great server and helped us choose great dishes !!"}
{"text":"This is a gem. If you can find it, dont miss it. One of the best Thai restaurants I've  experienced. The soft shell crab was incresdible. For starters , we tried the beef jerky, which is actually crispy flank steak , was great. Wish it was in our hometown of Chicago."}
{"text":"Arawan Thai is serving up some excellent Thai food.  Really excellent, some of the best I've had anywhere.  The Tom Kha soup might be the best I've ever had, and I've had many, both here in the US and in Thailand.

The service was very friendly, attentive, and super polite.  Dishes were well-presented and all three that I ordered were delicious.  The restaurant is clean and presentable, the menu is just the right size, with a lot of variety but not overwhelming, and the dessert selection is outstanding for a Thai restaurant.

My only knocks on Arawan would be that the prices are just a little on the high side for a restaurant that doesn't really have a 5-star location or ambience.  The decor is nice, but a little cheap, and the location leaves something to be desired.  That being said, I wouldn't hesitate to come back or bring my friends here.

All in all, I was very torn between 4 or 5 stars, the food and service are 5 stars for sure, but the decor and location are closer to 3."}
{"text":"5 stars does not do this establishment justice. One of those instances where you wish there was an extra star reserved only for a select few establishments that truly deserve it.

Apart from their delicious food and world class deserts, they treat you like family here. There is a personal touch and genuine care behind everything they do. 

Arawan resides in the same strip mall as the venerable Lotus of Siam. Having dined at both establishments on several occasions I can confidently state that Arawan is better.

Do yourself a favor, just go here."}
{"text":"I actually don't care for thai food, but it was simply the best selection and taste I have ever had, in floida, new York, California, Canada and now Vegas, this was the best overall. Service, variety, and most importantly taste. The chicken wonton soup and the lemon grass chicken wings a must have. The main food order according to your taste. Listen to your server's advice if you are not sure. Easily the best Thai food I have ever had."}
{"text":"Food and Services are excellent !!! Tong the owner very friendly and professional. Highly recommended"}
{"text":"Found this place through Yelp. The restaurant itself is very nice and clean. The service was excellent. We had 10 people so we ordered a bunch of food: crab fried rice, chicken pad thai, shrimp tom yum soup, yellow chicken curry, duck pad see ew, beef pad see ew, stir fried green bean with shrimp. Pad see ew was ok but everything else was very good. We would definitely come back if we visit Vegas again."}
{"text":"These guys are fabulous.  I used to go when they were still 
at their stickerice location.  I am so glad they went upscale, 
and  survived.  I can't afford to eat there any more, but I 
am glad for them. They are so nice, and the food is out 
of this world."}
{"text":"Dined here yesterday, this is the best Thai food I have ever eaten in the US! It brought me back to my days in Bangkok, this is a MUST go!!!!!

Amazing Food, Amazing Staff!"}
{"text":"This was really delicious Thai food. We had the roasted duck red curry which was pretty amazing and the ribeye basil dish which was fantastic. The service was also top notch. Very friendly and helpful. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I'm not Thai but I know what authentic Thai food tastes like from living in Thailand and I have to say the food here at Arawan is hands down the closest to authentic tastes of Thailand.  I had the tom yum, tuna larb, drunken noodles and Penang curry.  Next time I'm in LV, Arawan is a required stop for lunch or dinner!"}
{"text":"Excellent! Best Thai resto in Vegas. Great ambience and service, and the food was amazing! Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Great food, excellent service and a warm ambience. Highly recommend Arawan Thai. We walked a good 30 mins to get to the restaurant and it was worth it!"}
{"text":"Great place to eat with a warm atmosphere. Not really a good place to go with a loud group. Food was nicely prepared and tasted great. I had the pad thai and it was delicious but lacked any difference from other Thai places other than how it was plated and the two big prawns that it is served with. Dessert was a different story. Their menu is short and sweet. Containing traditional items like cake and ice cream then having their own desserts that are unique. I tried the mango island, I would order it again next time around."}
{"text":"My husband and I just got off the plane from Sacramento and decided on Thai for lunch. With a little help from yelp, we started walking to the restaurant. Its located in a sketchy shopping center but is very clean and charming inside. We love to eat where the locals hang out.

By far, this is one of the best Thai restaurants we've eaten at. The complimentary soup was very flavorful. The chicken with yellow curry was sinful. My husband had the BBQ chicken dish and he loved it. They even give you a little dessert at the end. I highly recommended this place. The staff are very friendly and efficient. We will be back."}
{"text":"Unbelievably amazing food and amazing, friendly staff. I was in town for a business event, and I found this place by chance. This is a must try and don't be fooled by the location. I will definitely be coming back here on my next Vegas visit!! Thank you to the staff for the amazing service and food!!! :)"}
{"text":"What a great find! We came for lunch and for only $10 you get delicious soup, an entree with lots of rice and a little salad, and desert....sticky rice with coconut ice cream, way yum!!! 
On the outside it doesn't look like much but on the inside it is very elegant. We will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"I come to town every other month and I really appreciate the food and the fact that they will deliver to my place!  I have never actually never been to the restaurant, so can't comment on that."}
{"text":"Lotus Of Siam, who??? The gloves are really off now. They are no longer the best Thai restaurant in Vegas, Arawan most certainly is though. I like other diners was turned off by the wait time at Lotus, so wandered over to this restaurant instead. So glad we did, completely blown away by this place. The decor and ambience are perfect, not too snooty but relaxing. The staff are super attentive without being in your face all the time. We were easily seated and waited on within minutes. Now for the good stuff, I simply can not say enough about their food. From the appetizers down to the freshly hand made desserts, everything was perfect. The presentation is beautiful, what I would expect from a 5 star strip restaurant, but the price is very reasonable. We had a selection of appetizers, simply delicious. Followed by Panang beef, Squid ink drunken noodles and Shrimp spicy green beans. Finished up with the hands down best creme brulee I have ever had, plus Mango sticky rice. Well done Arawan, keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Oh My Gosh!  So good, so fresh, so delicious!  I love their lunch specials.  If you enjoy great food without worrying about the outside appearance, I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Amazing amazing thai food! Each dish we ordered was clearly prepared with much love and care. The chow mein noodles were fantastic and the Tom yum soup was a delight. We loved the experience so much that we're here again for lunch this time. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Amazing...Amazing....Amazing....One of the best thai places in vegas. Friendly staff beautifully executed dishes. I work in a Forbes four star rated restaurant.. this places dishes my rival my restaurant. Best presentation of pad thai ever. Bond is an amazing waiter and very accomodating. Check this place out."}
{"text":"Excellent food. We were going to lotus siam, but they had 2 hour wait. We stumbled upon this place after a quick yelp search, and we are glad lotus siam was full.

The host gave us complimentary appetizers, and the food came on time. My wife got beef Pat see ew, and I got beef red curry (very spicy). It was definitely a great choice. The taste was great, and the presentation was also good.

The restaurant was not crowded, and the table layout was very relaxed.

Overall, very good place to dine."}
{"text":"I tried this place because of the yelp review, and I was very pleased. The food was authentic and the place seemed clean. Prices were good and I really enjoyed the Thai beef salad."}
{"text":"What a great find. Coming from San Francisco we are well acquainted with great Thai food, but this place blew us away.

It's a little off the strip, so has the added benefit of more reasonable prices, but the food is world class Thai.

We had the squid-ink seafood drunken noodles, which were amazing and just the right level of spicy, and the Gai Yang chicken which was grilled to perfection.

They are also known for their deserts. We had the Chocolate Caramel Pecan Tart which was amazing. Highly recommend this restaurant if you are looking for great Thai in Vegas."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is a treat, best Thai deliver in my area (UNLV)! Real Thai specialties (Kao Kha Moo was amazing!), plus your standard ThaI fare Pad Thai, Curries, salads, all done with a bit more style and finesse that the usual place. Calamari was great , Pad Thai delicious and beautiful, and the DESSERTS, are bright and cool, so refreshing even in the heat! Everything has been amazing so far, and looking forward to more!"}
{"text":"Great food, amazing service, decent ambience (underpriced to be honest!)
Ordered drunken noodles, fried rice, panang curry and black pepper chicken, each dish was cooked to perfection"}
{"text":"This is a very unassuming restaurant from the outside. The strip mall where it is located looks deserted, but the inside of the restaurant is modern and clean. The food was delicious! We tried soup, pad thai, and dessert--all delicious."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food I've ever had.  Our amazing waiter, Drake, recommended the short ribs and sea bass.  Both dishes were amazing.  We also ordered the crab fried rice-- I highly recommend this as well.  I'm not a dessert person normally, but a gentleman on his way out of the restaurant told us we have to get the mango dessert.  I'm glad we did because it was the perfect ending to a fabulous meal.  Drake make the dining experience great-- he gave us top notch service.  We will be back the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"Ate here on Saturday night during the peak of dinner time rush in Vegas. Getting a great table in less than 10 mins and great drinks within a few mins. The blossom tea and thai iced tea were the best  I've had recently, and the food... was Amazing! from the appetizer, main course to dessert the dinner all around was the best we had all week! Thank you, for the awesome service and great dinner :)"}
{"text":"Excellent Thai food, beautifully presented.  Chef Gail was very welcoming and friendly.  Crème brûlée was also delicious."}
{"text":"Tired of burgers ??? Try this restaurant!!
Good decorating , Great taste , Nice staffs 
I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I came in for a friend's birthday and I would have to say that it is one of the best places in Vegas for thai food. The ambiance is excellent with dim lighting to make it nice and intimate. I would recommend their signature Pad Thai and their Lemongrass Chicken Wings. Their dessert is beautifully laid out on their plate and reflects the amazing taste that comes after. I highly recommend their Vanilla Creme Brulee for desert.

Overall I had a great experience and our server Tanya was a breath of fresh air. She provided excellent and speedy service for a large table 9. I would definitely come back here."}
{"text":"Was looking for some good Pad Thai and Pork Dumplings and was not disappointed. Food was delicious! 

Menu is extensive and prices were far less that I paid at another Thai restaurant on the strip recently.

Restaurant is clean and wait staff was very attentive (I always appreciate having my water glass refilled before I'm able to empty it)."}
{"text":"Oh man, Vegas is gross but Arawan is not! 

Very, very good! A bit tough to find, but well worth finding. Family owned and operated. Don't pass up the Tom Kha soup or the desserts! 

Will definitely be back if life circumstances ever drag me to Vegas again. I wish it was closer to home!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately I was here for a day but we decided to stop by before we had to catch our flight from our conference. The staff was great at accommodating us quickly. Waitresses are on top of cleaning and serving you quickly. Gail took the liberty to order for us and nailed it. The food was amazing! Not just the food but the desserts also! Coconut ice cream with sticky rice, wow. I am definitely coming back when I visit Vegas again."}
{"text":"I wish I can give 10 stars such a professional place with amazing food they were so kind to me I am a celebrity hairdresser and I visit quite often on my days off I like to wear shorts and snickers and a simple shirt any who my first choice was to go to the very famous lotus of Siam course I heard so much well I will never ever go there again that rude young hostess after she told me it was going to be an unrealistic wait she looks up and down on me like you are pore or something I know that face couse I work with people like that in the past... Any who so yes thank god she was rude to me couse I end up coming here and it wAs one of the best experience ever the owner the hostess the waiter everyone was absolutely amazing and the food OMG the best I never had in LA Thai like this good please go this place is amazing !!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Great service and beautiful presentations. 
Little to no wait and reasonably priced. 
I highly recommend this restaurant for dinner or just for desert."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, quiet music in the background, great for conversation.  Have the Lechee Black Tea hot and order it right away to allow it time to steep.  The red curry fish cakes and calamari with their respective sauces are really great, the Pad Woon Sen was marvelous as well as the squid ink drunken noodles.  Portions are enough for two, very well prepared and presented.  Staff is polite, helpful, courteous, and thoughtful.  Restaurant  is clean and has a great atmosphere.  We will be back again"}
{"text":"Lotus was full, so we tried out Arawan. Wow, great food & serve. No attitude, very nice people. We'll be back soon. Try the desserts, most excellent.


Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees."}
{"text":"Just came in here for a mango sticky rice and Thai tea. It's pretty tasty. Could use a more of the coconut milk sauce. The portion was kinda small to me, but I guess that's acceptable for a dessert. On the pricier side compared to others I've eaten, but still good. The Thai tea wasn't that great though."}
{"text":"This restaurant was an oasis on our drive from San Diego to Utah. We went out of our way to stop on our drive back! The service was great, and the place was super family friendly. The presentation was absolutely stunning - and the flavor backed it up. Arawan takes an extraordinary level of pride in their food. No Thai in San Diego even comes close. 

PS The dessert is not to be missed."}
{"text":"This place doesn't know how to manage the service staff or train them to handle a  influx of business. We waited an hour for a table as a walk in group of 3. We saw 3 tables that sat dirty for over 25 minutes  while several groups waited to be seated (ourselves included). Once the tables were cleared amd the grouos were seated, we saw several other tables get up and leave. Those newly vacated tables sat dirty for at least 15 minutes before being cleared. The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is because the food was quite tasty. I'm sure on a regular evening this olace would be great. But do not go to them when there is a large convention in town. You'll be sitting around a very long time."}
{"text":"We had the ribeye crispy basil and Arawan pad Thai. Both were extremely flavorful without being too salty and or overwhelming. The portions were a decent size and beautifully put together. 
The servers were very hospitable. The service was a bit slow, but there were only two of them working at the time so it's understandable. 
For dessert, we had the sweet sensation. It was good but very rich. 
This place is a bit pricier than others, but their food is definitely worth coming back for. We will be dining here again soon! :]"}
{"text":"Excellent food in a very pleasant atmosphere. Very fresh food with superb taste, prepared with great attention to detail. I love the clean, full taste of all their food. The Panang is excellent, the Pad Thai is excellent, fried rice is very flavorful and the Desserts are AMAZING. Highly recommend this restaurant. It is the best Thai food in the area."}
{"text":"Arawan is in a small unassuming strip mall off the Strip.  It takes a few minutes to get to and is a little difficult to spot even when you get to the parking lot.  Once you enter the restaurant, it has a very small waiting area and the staff is buzzing all about but came up to greet us immediately.  Our party of 6 was seated within just a couple minutes. 

The atmosphere immediately had a positive vibe that seemed infectious.  The staff seemed to be having fun as was the table next to us.  Water and the drink order were taken immediately and although the wine list was small, it did have a good variety and prices of up to $100/ bottle.  We had a bottle of Jordan and a bottle of Simi which we shared with the table next to us.  Orders were taken in a proper amount of time and the cook time was right on.  The Drunken Noodles and Pad Thai were the two items that I tried and not only was the presentation amazing but they were both very flavorful.

Towards the end of the dinner, the head chef came out to our table to present the desserts.  Apparently, she is the daughter of the owners and after becoming a pastry chef had come back to run the family business.  She brought us one absolutely beautiful creation on the house and it was so good we ordered 3 other items just to see how she would present them.

Arawan takes a little bit of effort to get to but it is so worth the trip.  Come in with a smile and a light heart and they will take care of the rest.  I plan on returning the next time that I am in Vegas.  Thank you for a great night...I wish you all great success."}
{"text":"I had the worst experience I've ever had at this restaurant. Me and my man going here to eat. At first the Ambiance is wonderful. It seem like it was going to be a great restaurant. I ordered what are appetizers appetizers came out. Then I ordered larb salad as my entree, my man ordered crab fried rice as his entrée. 
My entrée came up and I started to eat, his entrée never showed up at the table until I was finished with my mine. When his food did finally come it was time for us to leave so we asked for it to go, explained to the manager what happened and expected them to take the crab fried rice off the bill. Instead what they did was take our food that was already packed into go Packaging and took it to the back for about 3 minutes. Then the manager came back out and he adjusted the bill so at this point we both thought that was strange, and we just  paid for our portion of the meal and left the restaurant, and we left our to go food at the restaurant. My food was good but service was terrible."}
{"text":"A fortuitous surprise! We planned on eating at the Lotus Siam, and arrived before they were open. Craving Thai food, we decided to try Arawan, located nearby. For starters we had the Larb Ahi, which was perfect salad for the hot weather we are experiencing. Flavors were spot on Thai. Hubby ordered the chicken red curry, which he claimed was the best curry he had ever eaten! A multitude of flavors that were well balanced and tasty. I ordered the soft shell crab pad pong karee, which is crab meat scrambled with eggs in a seasoning, and the crab lightly battered and fried to a crispy, delectable dish. Portions were large, and we decided to box some of our meal for later enjoyment so we could have room to try one of their world renowned desserts. We were not disappointed with the mango island. Combination of coconut cracker, green tea sticky rice, mango sorbet and purée, and a decadent coconut milk sauce to drizzle on top. YUM! Unlike many desserts, this one tasted amazing and was beautifully crafted. Must stop by! Think we got lucky with an early dinner, so you may need to cal ahead for a reservation."}
{"text":"Finally found it! A true taste of Thai in a elegant yet comfortable ambiance. We were here for 2 weeks and found ourselves going back 3 times! This restaurant''s chef lovingly prepares each dish with the freshest ingredients. It is about an explosion of flavors in your mouth. Delectable. The Tuna Larb..beyond belief. The Pad Thai is not only the best we have ever tasted in Vegas but the presentation was beautiful. Every dish we tried was made to perfection. Don't forget the desserts. The chef is an award winning pastry and dessert chef. The mango island was a mouth watering delight of hand made sorbet, with all sorts of interesting flavors. Unique, delicious well prepared elegantly presented. The staff is attentive and very friendly, 
It's my new favorite spot in Vegas."}
{"text":"Three stars because the food (pad thai and duck red curry) was good and had a nice presentation. It would have been higher but the calamari we ordered as an appetizer was accidentally given to another table. When the waiter realized it, he took it from the other table who had already started eating it, took it back to the kitchen, and then brought it to our table. The dish was half eaten and cold. They just changed out the dipping sauce. 
I thought it was unprofessional that they didn't leave the dish at the first table to finish eating it and that they didn't make us a new order. Not to mention unsanitary."}
{"text":"Very homey. A good place to relax after a long drive. I ordered duck noodle soup, which is rare to see in other resturants. The soup is impressive. Oh it is opened on Christmas when other spots around are all closed."}
{"text":"I honestly can't understand why this restaurant has such high reviews. We made a reservation here for dinner on Valentine's Day because it had such great reviews and we left very disappointed. When we got to the restaurant we were told that despite us having a reservation they didn't have a table for us as they had over booked. We were assured that a table would be made available to us soon if we'd like to wait. Given that it was Valentines, 8:45pm and we didn't have an alternative option we decided to wait. We finally got seated at a table at 9:20pm and remained optimistic about the food. After some time the waitress eventually came to take our drink order, she bought over a beer we ordered almost instantly and then 15 minutes later the wine arrived at the table. Our starters were quite good, not amazing, but good. The mains were a massive disappointment, the food was mediocre at best and we left still hungry. After receiving our meals it was getting quite late and most of the restaurant had emptied, it was made very clear to us that the staff wanted to close and they tried to hurry us up so they could leave - asking to clear dishes from the table whilst we were still eating etc. I noticed some nice looking desserts coming out of the kitchen while we were waiting for our food, and we never even got offered a dessert menu. Terrible service, extremely average food. If you're thinking about going here don't waste your time, there are far better options."}
{"text":"I travel for work around the country and internationally and I consider myself a foodie. Thanks to Yelp I found Arawan and I am glad that I did. I had Crab fried rice and one of the best Ever Tom Yum soup. If you are a true Thai food aficionado and you are in Vegas then visit to Arawan is a must."}
{"text":"Amazing food, even better presentation! Chef Gail brings a unique and contemporary twist the class Thai dishes, all while being extremely pleasant and well organized! I'd give it a 10/5"}
{"text":"Really cute place with extremely flavorful food! So glad Lotus of Siam turned us away because they weren't taking anymore lunch customers....if not, we wouldn't have discovered this gem! Will def be back!!"}
{"text":"Recommended for people who's looking for Thai food with greatest test, cozy and warm welcome. Shouldn't miss the desert \"mango island\" was excellent!! Chef Gail is very nice and taking good care of me. See u next time =]"}
{"text":"Lotus of Siam has been dethroned! When we are in town, Lotus has always been a stop. When the wait was 90 minutes we quickly looked elsewhere. Thank goodness for that, otherwise we may not have discovered Arawan. The interior is lovely; both comfortable & modern. Our waitress was fantastic. They start with the traditional wontons, something I've never cared for. But these were awesome. They were enormous and actually fresh. We first ordered the Arawan fresh spring roll, a must. They are made with beautiful vegetables and the dipping sauce is amazing. Next came the Beef & Mint Salad-the best I've had. I only wish it came with the usual sticky rice to sop up the vinaigrette. It was my favorite dish of the night. Finally we ordered the Green Curry, also delicious. I wish we had the room & time for dessert. We will certainly be back! Thank you Arawan."}
{"text":"Delicious Thai food off the strip.  The restaurant was pleasant inside and our server was terrific!  The Ahi Tuna Larb was to die for!  The basil Fried Rice with chicken was also amazing."}
{"text":"We went this restaurant because the lotus Thai food has too long waiting line and other restaurants nearby were already closed. However, finally we found this restaurant is surprisingly good. Every dishes we tried were special. The crispy catfish was just amazing. The dessert we had(mango sweet rice, we don't know the exact name) was tasty. The service is good, too. I think this restaurant should get much more yelp reviews unless it just open recently. So I asked the waitress and she said they just open last week. Well, we think we were lucky to go into this restaurant and we are willing to share this good restaurant to people who visit Las Vegas."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, and the setting was very nice. We got a chicken and noodle salad and a red curry, both \"Thai spicy\", which means really really spicy. It was great!"}
{"text":"Wow, thought this place was better than Lotus of Siam, honestly. Great atmosphere! Definite must try..."}
{"text":"We went here on a Saturday for lunch hoping to go to Lotus of Siam, but it was closed!  Luckily, we Yelped, and found Arawan in the same plaza.  (Can anyone say competition!) 

We four shared the pad thai, fried rice, duck curry, fried ribs, and the larb.  Everything, and I mean everything was delicious.  We cleaned our plates and were completely, happily satiated.  If you've never tried larb, try it.  You'll be pleasantly surprised!  

Oh, and the ice coffee.  Order the ice coffee.  Heaven in a glass.  

Can't wait to go back one day!"}
{"text":"Best thai food in vegas. It was so good we ate there two nights in a row. We love the atmosphere. We love the desserts. And their tea selections. I can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"5 stars well earned here. My buddy from work recommended this place and my wife and I decided to give it a try. The restaurant is a bit hard to find since you can't see it from the street. You need to drive inside the huge parking lot around back and circle around until you see the black and white sign.

Our waiter was extremely helpful and made three great suggestions. The special pad thai with prawns was amazing. Not sure how they made it taste so good since the recipe is relatively simple. The next dish was the crispy ribeye. A good hint of basil combined with the perfectly cooked meat was outstanding. The third dish (which was our favorite) was the lemongrass catfish. I normally stay away from fish dishes since I don't tolerate fishy flavors at all, but this was totally surprising. The whole catfish (pretty big) was perfectly cut and fried with the best tasting combination of lemongrass, cashews, and other herbs I could have ever imagined. This is the one.

We finished the meal with a unique desert called thai pancakes. The sweet crepe-like concoction capped a perfect meal with excellent service. Next time in Vegas, this will be our first stop."}
{"text":"Was really looking forward to Lotus of Siam... But it was JAM PACKED! 

Noticed this spot as we were leaving, it's in the same shopping center! Quick look at Yelp, and immediately knew WE HAD TO TRY IT. 

Oh my food heaven! This place was OFF THE CHARTS!! An amazing atmosphere - clean, simple, comfy, elegant. 

The service... Well it was probably some of the best service I've ever had. Never did either of my drinks get below halfway (I was pounding the strawberry infused water haha), the timing of each dish coming out was spot on, and the constant suggestions and check-ins made for a very nice evening of letting them take care of you! This is a special shoutout to our wonderful waitress Tania (I'm hoping I spelled it right!!), who was just so kind and attentive to us, it really made for a relaxing, enjoyable dining experience. But I will give a HUGE THANK YOU to all of the staff, the way they worked together, and seemed to enjoy each other's company as well as the customers, was top notch, and genuine through and through!

The food, honestly I don't even know where to begin! YOU CANNOT GO WRONG WITH YOUR ORDER! Everything came out nice and hot, spiced and marinated absolutely phenomenally, and full of such immaculate flavors that we had to keep ordering more! 

This little spot will not only make you so happy you came, it'll blow your socks off, ESPECIALLY if you originally came to the area for Lotus, because Lotus is in trouble with this one year old GEM OF A THAI RESTAURANT!

Thank you so much all of you, we will see you on Tuesday!"}
{"text":"This's the best Thai food in Las Veagas. Great presentation. Great taste and also great SERVICE ;) Don't miss their dessert !!"}
{"text":"I just moved here in Vegas. I'm 31 weeks pregnant and craving for pad Thai. I've been so picky lately with food. Since I've been reading great reviews about this place , I said let me just go ahead and try. I was planning to order take out only, but the moment I open the door I felt a relaxing vibe, so I decided to stay and enjoy my meal. I am very impressed my pad Thai and sticky rice dessert taste fantastic! Everything is elevated version of all Thai Food. For sure, I'll bring my friends and family here! I'm happy to find this place, finally excellent food! Pricing is worth it!"}
{"text":"This restaurant had an effect on me. Here it is over a month after our meal and I am longingly looking at the photos on Yelp.

After our trip to the Grand Canyon we spent the night in Las Vegas before flying out the next day. We found out about Arawan through the other Yelp reviews and made our way over to the place with high expectations. We were not prepared for how divine our dining experience would be.

Everything.... and I mean, everything! was just perfect. The staff, the classy and understated decor, the cleanliness...... and... especially the food. The food almost made me cry. It was that special. The presentation, the exquisite blend of flavors and heat, the texture.... the aroma... everything. I was aware that this was one of the best meals of my life.

In my 60 years of eating... I have only been compelled to tip the chef a half dozen or so times. My usually exceptionally frugal wife was totally on board this time (volumes were just spoken).

I feel appreciation and respect for this chef. Maybe.... just maybe, the best dining experience of my life.... and if not, at least the best one in my memory. What a treat!"}
{"text":"This is an amazing restaurant. Very good Thai food. Don't be put off by the exterior. The inside of the restaurant is very fancy. Very nice staff."}
{"text":"Arawan was exquisite. My mother and I were passing by Las Vegas on our way home to Los Angeles and had a craving for some Thai food. We being from LA have definitely tasted some Tasty Thai. My mother if a vegetarian so they had great  options for her. As for me BBQ is my to go, although it is some of the freshest chicken I've had my mother's choice of yellow curry with tofu take the trophy. I envied her selection. But the service only complimented the restaurants food. I would definitely consider this a hipster joint."}
{"text":"Cozy  place with great service, great food, attention  to detail, clean and comfortable,  authentic  Thai food! What a great find, will be back."}
{"text":"Love this place! Excellent food & service + lovely atmosphere. They're also known for their unique desserts- soo good! (usually complimentary w/ lunch)"}
{"text":"Best Thai food ever!  Incredible, amazing, and delicious!  The food was flavorful and perfect blend spices.  The curry was bowl licking good.  The Tom Kai was right the right amount of spice and delicious.  Try to Thai local favorites which are special and unique to be added to our favorite dishes.  The ambulance was comfortable and elegant but casual.  We will take all our close friends here!"}
{"text":"1. Food: each bite pops with flavor, and that's good, because portions are tiny. Wild ginger shrimp: excellent flavor, well balanced, not too salty or sweet or overpowered with ginger. Chicken pad Thai: hint of spiciness, wrapped in egg lattice, quite yummy. Mango sensation: meh, definitely not worth the price of another entree - it was just a bunch of things thrown together, the sum of which wasn't greater than its parts.

2. Service: friendly and helpful with recommendations. 

3. Atmosphere: came for an early lunch, so it was rather quiet and calm."}
{"text":"So amazing. Best Thai food in vegas, verified by four very picky Thai eaters. This is actually our second visit here in two days we just had to come back. Amazing friendly service. Really nice ambience and great simple but effective decor. We had several dishes on both nights but the highlight was the orange chicken and the Panang curry which was superb. The desserts are true work of art that need to be seen to be appreciated. A true family restaurant with a really high regard for customer service. I promise you will not be dissapointed. Tanya was also a great server who kept us all smiling."}
{"text":"The staff was super observant and the food was very nice. Just make sure to leave room for dessert! Their floating island with sticky rice, mango and passiom fruit is only for sure worth it."}
{"text":"The best Thai restaurant in town. THE BEST. Period.
Fresh food, healthy (no MSG!!!), delicious and amazing service. Been there 30 times if not more. By far the best in town. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised about the ambiance and food at this restaurant.  I usually go to Komol or Lotus of Siam.  It's more upscale than Komol and just different from Lotus.  Their hot tea offerings are a must to try.  Their chicken larb is one of the best I've tasted.  My husband and I have been here twice in less than a month."}
{"text":"This is the absolute BEST Thai food!!! When family comes to visit, they always request a return to Arawan. Kannie is a darling person who greets us with a friendly smile. The service is impeccable. The food is outstanding. Don't forget dessert!!! We don't usually order dessert, but it's worth both the extra expense and the calories here! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Simply good place to visit. A nice spot for a low-key dinner without the lines, and quite as well. The decor is gorgeous, the staff is exceptional, and the food was amazing. Recommend it highly!"}
{"text":"Ok this is actually one of our favorite places to eat and this used to be a five star review but our experience tonight was awful. If this was our only time here it would be less stars. I don't know if they had a new chef or what but our basil ribeye was plated horribly and it is usually beautiful, our seafood in our drunken noodles dish was severely overcooked and way more fishy tasting than normal. We always order the large Tom Yum soup so we have it for lunch the next day, we had over half left and the waitress THREW IT AWAY!!! When I told her we wanted that to go she said sorry and stared at us she was borderline rude all night and was rushing us everytime she was at our table. They also discontinued our favorite dessert. This is the first time we have not had a manager stop by and ask use how it was...we have raved about everything every other time. We will give them one more try and see how it is. Fingers crossed."}
{"text":"Extremely high quality food.  Every element of each dish is perfectly prepared.  Clearly, they have an executive chef that takes their job seriously."}
{"text":"It's not very often that I give a restaurant 5 stars, but this place blew me away. I have to say, they really know what they are doing. The setting of the place is very modern and they create a mood like you're in a high-end restaurant. The chefs and managers are extremely friendly and well trained. They are attentive to their customers and it makes the customers feel welcomed. 

Their drinks, including water, are all special. The Thai Iced Coffee was perfectly portioned between the coffee and the creme and came in a nice glass. Ice waters never felt so refreshing like the way they serve it. It comes with strawberries and mint. They leave a pitcher of water on the table as well and they often refill my glass for me as it gets half empty. They will also bring out a plate of Wonton Chips w/ Sweet n' Sour Sauce. The menu is doesn't offer too many dishes however they do perfect every dish that is on it. I had the Short Rib Daikon Soup and it had a strong celery taste and I absolutely loved it because it's a different soup to have on a Thai menu. The Thai Beef Salad w/ Fresh Mint was so amazing. When it came out, I didn't expect it to taste as good as it did. The beef was cooked just right and was extremely soft, almost like it could melt in my mouth. I would of like for there to be more lettuce and greens in it though. Also, the salad dressing is spicy so if you can't eat spicy, I wouldn't recommend it. I also tried the Crispy Lemongrass Catfish and I have to say, I was very impress on how well made the dish was. There the catfish was fried just right and the herbs, spices, and toppings made it perfect. It is accompanied with a sauce and mango slices. On top of the dish, there is also a few Lotus Chips (I wish they would give a bowl of Lotus Chips in the beginning). My favorite dish by far is the Pad Thai. We are talking about authentic Pad Thai. I have been waiting for a thai restaurant in Vegas to make Pad Thai the right way and Arawan has done it! Super excited and I will be coming back just for the Pad Thai. It also has a few large shrimps on top which looked and tasted amazing. They do not give steam rice so you will have to ask, but other than that, the dinner was amazing. 

Now this restaurant also has their very own dessert chef who makes them right at the bar for you to see. Every dessert dish is made to order just like the dinner and that's what makes this place so special, they perfect everything from the drinks to entrées to the dessert. The Coconut Ice Cream was delicious however it was served with Young Coconut and Sticky Rice which I'm not too crazy about. Their Creme Brulee or Mango w/ Sticky Rice looked good too and I'll have to try them next time.

This place is well managed, the decor looks amazing, the dishes are perfectly made and I just hope that they will offer a larger menu in the future. I would like to see more rice dishes to eat family style, more vegetarian & vegan options, and more dishes that aren't spicy. They also have an area with unique seating in the back that is still being put together and it will make a nice seating area for parties. Great restaurant, I had an amazing dinning experience:D

On a funny note, my dad's only complaint for this place: \"why don't they have nicer napkins?\""}
{"text":"The atmosphere was nicer than it would seem from the outside. Service was a bit on the slow side. Food was great, portion sizes were perfect. If you like you're food spicy as I do you may want to specify that. We ordered the calamari appetizer and then I had the Arawan Pad Thai, ordered as extra spicy. The dipping sauce that came with the calamari was spicier than the pad thai. My wife had the Rib Eye with Crispy Thai Basil and the flavors were excellent, as was the pad thai.  My only complaints would be the level of spice and the fact that my pad thai came with head on prawns."}
{"text":"First class dining experience at Arawan Thai. 

My wife and I were looking for Thai food in Las Vegas and saw some positive reviews on Yelp about Arawan Thai.  The reviews were spot on, this little gem was the perfect date night meal for my wife and I who were in Vegas celebrating our anniversary.  We had a spring roll appetizer which was delicious and crispy, cut on an angle and served with a tangy but sweet dipping sauce.  For our entrees we got Panang Curry with beef and Arawan Pad Thai, both were amazing.  The panang curry was easily one of the best curries I have ever had and the Arawan pad thai was delicious as well.  The presentation of these entrees were amazing and the entire timing of the meal was perfect thanks to the attentive waitress that made sure we had everything we needed.  All that being said let me get to the pièce de résistance, the desserts at Arawan Thai are second to none.  Arawan employs two pastry chefs that roll out some of the best looking desserts I have ever seen.  My wife and I were quite full from our meals, however had to try at least one dessert.  The table behind us, ordered 5-6 desserts and licked each plate clean as if they had never eaten before.  Next time we return, my wife and I may start with a dessert, then work our way through our meal, and finish with another.  Amazing atmosphere, perfect timing of the meal, delicious food, attentive staff and dessert to die for.  We will be back, thank you Arawan Thai for a great anniversary meal."}
{"text":"The best meal we had during our visit to Las Vegas, hands down. Also one of the best Thai meals *ever*. We were so tired we ordered delivery to the hotel. The Tom Ka Gai soup was heaven - lively and bright, just like that first time that blew my mind. Fresh Spring Rolls were fresh and did not get gummy being delivered. The Pad Thai was nicely flavored and not too sweet, as some can be. Duck Red Curry was amazing with a really good amount and variety of vegetables I usually don't see in curries. the duck still retained a little crisp edge.  And. Then. The Mango Island. Almost speechless deconstruction / arrangement beyond 'mango sticky rice'. Beyond. 

If I were a billionairess, I would fly in monthly for Anawar."}
{"text":"We arrived at this fabulous new restaurant right as they were closing.  They graciously invited us in and welcomed us into this hip, well decorated dining establishment.  The food was superb.  Presentation outstanding. Service impeccable. A  fresh fine dining twist on the classic Thai dishes that we all love.  A+++"}
{"text":"The food was very good, excellent preparation,  presentation,  and flavors. Prices were reasonable,  and the staff was fruendly, attentive without being intrusive.  We will be returning"}
{"text":"Stopped by for some Thai after a weekend on the strip and glad I did! Even though the plaza looks abandoned, the interior decor or Arawak is clean.
Our group ordered the Arawan pad Thai, crab fried rice, soft shell crab green curry and the chicken wings. The waffled egg on top of the pad Thai was a creative touch. Overall, the food was surprisingly tasty and the portions were mid-sized. Thai iced tea was also delicious! 

Also, I had to order the creme brûlée because I saw the pictures on yelp... It was a picture-worthy dessert but the taste isn't anything extraordinary. When I'm back in Vegas on a weekend and looking for some Thai, I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"In the same strip mall and within sight of Lotus of Siam the most revered Thai restaurant in Las Vegas rests this hidden gem.  The photos of food plastered on the outside may be a turn off to some, but open the door and you'll see that this isn't a hole in the wall.

Inside you'll find an elegantly decorated space that exudes a quiet and refined vibe, a big contrast to the strip mall exterior.  The staff are helpful and professional, dropping off glass carafes of ice water with mint and strawberries floating inside and answering any questions you might have with ease.  

The food comes quickly, and mercifully, because the smells from the other diner's plates and the kitchen in the back will have woken your stomach from whatever slumber it might have been in and made your mouth water.  The arawan pad thai will change the way you think about what Pad Thai can be.  The noodles are held together in a net of eggs, and are light and coated just the right amount of tamarind sauce.  The mixed in chicken is tender and flavorful and the sprouts are crunchy and add the perfect texture.  

The tofu wild ginger seems to defy the laws of dishes with steamed tofu.  The tofu is firm, without being rubbery or squishy and is accented perfectly by the crispy vegetables.  The soy bean sauce is beautifully savory and salty without being heavy or overpowering.

The real treat of the evening though was mango sticky rice desert.  Without a doubt one of the most sublime and subtle and yet absolutely delicious deserts I've ever eaten, regardless of cuisine.  The mango was perfectly ripe and had the most wonderful subtle sweetness and fruity fragrance.  The sticky rice was also just subtly sweet, perhaps with condensed milk, and was perfumed a floral note.  When eaten separately both were a joy to savor, but together they combined into produce a flavor that is well beyond the sum of their parts.  

Arawan was never on my radar until I looked past the bright lights of Lotus of Siam's reputation, and I am so glad that I took the time to do so.  Next time I come to Vegas, I'm skipping the In-n-Out for my first meal and coming right here."}
{"text":"Really top notch food. Elegant authentic dishes made with elevated ingredients and high end presentation. Don't be scared by the parking lot. Certainly priced according to Vegas."}
{"text":"Perfect food every time and always great service. Couldn't ask for anything better from them."}
{"text":"Arawan is gourmet Thai food. It's located in a not good area but it's worth the try. A must is their desserts. My husband who is Thai was impressed."}
{"text":"Let's start by saying their lunch specials are delightful. I ordered the tom kha soup with yellow curry and my husband, the mint chicken. Initially, we were served ice water typed with astrawberry slice.  Pretty and different. 

The meal begins with their egg soup. To be honest, I'm not a fan of egg soup, but theirs was quite good. Second, we were served a spring medley with a tasty vinaigrette. The soup came after. It was delectable. Just had the right amount of lemongrass and chicken. Then came the meal. Let's just say I ate all of it. The curry chicken was perfect. Spicy 5. Just enough to make your nose run in this cold weather. The plate of mint ground chicken also disappeared. To finish the meal, we were served a small square walnut brownie. I wasnt too impressed but my 2 year old killed it. 

Needless to say, we'll be coming back."}
{"text":"We had a fabulous experience here.
 Our chairs were comfy and the food was great.
 Our tuna appetizer was too salty so we sent it back and with no questions asked were credited.
 Duck curry was amazing as was the pad Thai:
 We recommend this place."}
{"text":"Amazing place for dining with families and friends, providing awesome service and delicious food. The food at this place  looks nice and tastes fabulous !!!"}
{"text":"I wasn't pleased with the food from this place. First of all, the short rib was mainly fat and grizzle on a huge piece of bone. The meat was little and probably worth only two bites. That's definitely not worth the $22. The yellow curry that it was cooked in had good flavor, though. However, I'm very disappointed because I had high hopes for this place. I also got the Tom Kha Chicken soup and didn't care for that either. It had an overpowering vinegary taste. Maybe that's typical of Thai cuisine, but I'm not a big vinegar fan. Also, the restaurant decided not to take off my Yelp discount, which did show up on my order upon completion. Not cool! That's the main reason why I'm giving it one star. I don't like getting cheated like that. They need to honor these discounts if it's on my completed order. The guy was nice, but that was it. Too expensive and not good quality, so I won't be back."}
{"text":"This place is a cute spot that opened a little less than a year ago. I had the panang curry which was average but this dessert sets this place to be a 10! It has to be the best thai dessert I have ever had! It was mango sorbet over sticky rice and almonds with coconut milk! Friggin delish and a must try! Staff is very friendly and the head Chef Gail is super sweet."}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised when I walked into Arawan and how nice the atmosphere and ambience was. I had the lunch special chicken drunken noodles and my husband had the shirt rib yellow curry. With my noodles I also got a salad,soup and a dessert all for 9.95. We also has their calamari and egg rolls as appetizers. Service was excellent. I think this might be my new favorite Thai place. We will be back."}
{"text":"Presentation of the food (and the decor) is quite beautiful but the food is only
so-so. While the sauce on my meat dish was flavorful, the meat itself was tough. Also, the portion sizes are inadequate, given what they charge, particularly
the desserts. Service needs some work too. The hostess (and probably owner?) is proactive and responsive (she's the one who convinced us to come inside), but the rest of the staff is not adequately trained. One of the servers spilled some food on my husband, the waitress didn't seem to understand our requested spiciness level and multiple servers tried to take away dishes and utensils we were still using.  I really wanted to like the place but I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I literally come to eat every month, btw it's not close to our home at all. Nice and quiet place, excellent service. And it's feel like I'm dining at a fine French restaurant. I can tell kitchen put lots of effort on dishes and decorating for plate. Love it~"}
{"text":"My daughter loved the food, I was ok, service was awesome, Mom and pop restaurant , its all about small business. Will be back"}
{"text":"We stumbled on this restaurant after attempting to eat at Lotus of Siam. This place is nice, quiet and perfect for a date night. Much different from the hustle and bustle of LofS. We started with the Arawan Fresh Roll which was one roll sliced into pieces for $8. We then each had a cucumber salad for $4. Entrees were the Spicy Mint Plate ($12.00) and Pad See Ew ($12.00). All items were fresh and tasty, although we though the roll and Spicy Mint contained way too much basil as it was rather overpowering. Service was spotty as we had trouble getting the waitresses attention for drink refills. Bill total was $56 which is much too high for Thai food. Doubt we will be back as there are many other places with just as good food but at lower prices."}
{"text":"Wow! What a great experience. We were warmly greeted by the staff in the parking lot as we were having a hard time finding this diamond of Thai food in Las Vegas. We ended up having the shrimp pad see ew and the red curry chicken with a cucumber salad and satay as a opener. It was the best Thai food we have ever experienced. Couple that with \"Apple\" our server who was right on top of our every need made it a must return spot for us in Las Vegas. Go and enjoy Arawan for yourself!!"}
{"text":"Just found mah fav Thai restaurant in town. Their presentation is really nice. The food tastes decent. Price is also reasonable. The restaurant is so cute too, so it's pretty perfect for a date 
If you come with a family, you should order the fried cat fish. The portion is so huge so it should be good for table of 4-5 people."}
{"text":"Found this restaurant on line.  This is a great place.  Food exceptional.  Try the plum shrimp, fresh rolls unusually great sauce, chicken satay, mango ice cream desert exceptional.  Decor great.  A little hard to find - get good directions.  Price good."}
{"text":"My brother took me here claiming it's the best Thai food he'd ever eaten. I was skeptical initially but now I'm hooked and I'm a regular customer myself. Fantastic food, ambiance, service. A restaurant worth telling people about by word of mouth or here on the Internet."}
{"text":"The Panang curry was phenomenal! Excellent drunken noodles and the service was on point. Absolute must while in Vegas."}
{"text":"The dishes were delicious and the presentation was elegant. We had a large group and the service was attentive and efficient. This establishment will definitely get repeat business from us."}
{"text":"Service and indoor ambiance 4 stars. Location is in a shady area of town that made me question if I came to the right place. The food is expensive especially with so many Thai competitors in the area. I thought my duck noodle soup was just ok and was a little too sweet. Nothing against the staff or overall service, but I wasn't impressed with the food, especially when pairing it against the terrible location and how much I'm being charged for it. They do have a nice tea menu though and I wish I had time to try some of their lovely-looking desserts."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai places in town. Such great service and such great food. The drunken noodles are tasty and have a good proportion of meat and vegetables. Their Orange chicken is also delicious; the right amount of crispness and the citrus flavor is well balanced with the sweetness of the sauce (where many places seem to overdo the citrus). Finally, their desserts are amazing. The mango island is refreshing and light, absolutely amazing. A must try."}
{"text":"?????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"The Arawan Pad Thai was amazing and the service is top notch. We came in a big group and had everything including the Sea Bass, Red Duck Curry and Orange Chicken. The food was just wow I am so glad I found this spot. The parking lot is deceiving but when you walk in the decor and atmosphere is very high class."}
{"text":"I had lunch from this Arawan Thai recently on the way from Zion National Park to Las Vegas. We were a large group and we called them ahead to get seating for our group. By the time we reached they had everything set up. Although place look a bot shady from outside the interior was great and the food was great too."}
{"text":"Really good food! The Scallops and green curry were a stand out for sure. Mango island was delicious. We will come back the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"The location of Arawan is unusual- it is on the outer edges of a large parking lot. (parking is definitely not a problem here!) When we entered the restaurant, we were transported into a creative and tastefully decorated space. Our appetizer, the grilled chicken satay, was not up to par, but we are very picky because our ultimate standard for chicken satay is at an open air dining court in Singapore. However, the peanut sauce and sweet marinated chili cucumber slivers served with it were excellent. Our first main dish was a beautifully presented pad Thai. The flavorful rice noodles were wrapped by a thin egg net and and dramatically topped with fresh prawns. Next, we ordered the beef short rib yellow curry. We have never had short ribs in a dish like this. The meat was flavorful and fell off the bone. It was slightly too spicy for some of us but hit the spot for the heat lover among us, and the spice did not destroy the flavor. Finally, to top off a wonderful meal, we ordered the vanilla bean crème brûlée. The sweet latticed dome that topped the dish made it almost too good to eat- but of course we dug in. The custard was fresh and and complemented the perfectly crisp caramelized sugar crust. Wish we could have ordered more of the desserts, but we will just have to return another time whenever we come back to Vegas. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This little eatery is located in a strip mall in somewhat of a sketchy neighborhood. 

We started with the blossoming flower t a which we both enjoyed. The presentation of the food choices, attention to detail, exotic flavors and good service will make a longtime customer. Everyone was attentive without being intrusive. We will return."}
{"text":"My new favorite Thai restaurant. I am familiar with this business from a previous location, known as Stick-e-Rice. It was good then and the new place took it to a higher level, even better. The outside is unpretentious but inside is a very cozy, welcoming Thai feeling with a modern decor. We went for lunch. We had superb & friendly service accompanied by a chef quality meal with incredible flavor and the included dessert was provided by an on site Pastry chef,  which was awesome. Outperforms Lotus of Siam in same area. Highly recommend a visit. We will be back for another awesome Thai experience."}
{"text":"This is the BEST That food EVER! Had vegan Pangan curry, Veggie pad Thai, crab fried rice, and Thai pancakes with Thai tea ice cream for dessert. Also Lavender black tea was wonderful. The veggies are super fresh. I will fly to Vegas just for this food  Compliments to the Chef!"}
{"text":"We always come here regularly and it is never a disappointing experience. I usually get the parang curry but this time I tried the drunken noodles. Spicy level #5 it was great!! All the ingredients harmonized together so well!! My wife got the seafood pad thai wow it was extremely good!! I would say this place has the best pad thai in vegas. That's saying a lot with how many places I've tried. Their customer service is always great! Our glasses were never empty. The waiter was always on top of his service!! Come check this place out guys it's awesome!!"}
{"text":"A great Thai restaurant 
Good friendly service, fair prices and terrific food!
Very nice atmosphere.
Their meals are made with fresh ingredients and very flavorful. Having a very \"Thai style\" palette their hot needed a boost to make it hot, that said the flavors were superb.
Will be back on the next visit to Vegas!
Take a change from the overly inflated \"strip\" and visit one of the numerous great restaurants just off the 'strip'."}
{"text":"EXCELLENT Thai worth driving from The Strip!!!
We love Thai food and seek it when traveling. Arawan is one of, if not THE best Thai restaurants that we have found anywhere. We ate here twice in three days, savoring every dish that we tried: ago tuna larb (a first for us), curried fish cakes, short rib curry, chicken curry, pad Thai, drunken noodles (rich with vegetables!), egg drop soup, Thai iced tea, and Oreo cheesecake (delicately light). Loved every bite! Service was very efficient and pleasant. One of the servers, named Apple, recommended the drunken noodles as her favorite and it is possible that no other drunken noodle will ever live up to this standard. My husband is now determined to duplicate the yellow curry at home."}
{"text":"Great place for Thai food. Food is well prepared and delicious. Wait staff can learn a bit more about American service techniques but overall they tried. 

The owner was very nice and made it obvious that he cared about how we felt. 

The restaurant is very clean and decorated nicely. The seats were very comfortable. 

There is plenty of parking but a tad bit hard to find.  The complex is huge and it seems that every other store in there is out of business.  

If you are looking for a thai place near the end of the strip and you dont want to have to travel to China Town District where parking is insane during busy times, head here instead.  You wont regret it.  

The food is good."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai restaurant. The service always top notch. The food fresh and as spicy as you want it. I love the Pad Thai!!!!!"}
{"text":"I would highly recommend going to Lotus of Siam for Thai food instead of this place (it's in the same Parking lot) I would give this place a zero if possible. I came at lunch time and ordered the ribeye crispy basil and the soft shell crab (both are specials) I asked for the ribeye to be cooked medium rare (meaning just some pink in the middle) instead it came out seared so very rare and chewy. The softshell crab dish was way below average and expectations as well. The restaurant wasn't so busy during lunch and the waitress never came over to ask how everything was until the end of the meal. They were also having their own lunch and the whole staff including cooks was more interested in their own meal. I think the cooks rushed the ribeye in order to sit down and eat their own lunch. I said something to the waitress finally but they didn't do anything to fix it, just said sorry. I paid $71 for a meal that wasn't even eaten with horrible service. I would recommend going to Lotus of Siam! It's in the same parking lot area as this restaurant they have a bigger selection of specialty dishes that are actually appetizing."}
{"text":"Great service and great food. Good vegetarian choices. This was the second time we had dinner and like before the food was amazing."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite Thai restaurants in the valley. I've tried a few other Thai spots around town and have been disappointed. Other restaurants just don't make their food as good, or as spicy, or as reasonably priced as Arawan does. It has become one of the top Thai restaurants on my list in Vegas. It doesn't look nice on the outside, but once you get inside it is very nicely decorated it looks completely different once you're inside. I recommend getting their Arawan fresh rolls as an appetizer and ask for the peanut sauce instead of the sweet chili sauce. They will accommodate you. Their Thai style calamari is pretty good too. They also give as complimentary these crunchy chips with a sweet chili dipping sauce. I wish you could order a bigger portion of it to munch on cause they are actually pretty good. The food is amazing from their green curry, to their red curry, to the panang curry, to the pad Thai. My boyfriend loves getting the duck panang curry. I usually stick between these dishes mentioned but I don't doubt everything else is good too they are pretty spot on with the flavors. Their desserts are so creative and delicious like their mango island dessert served in a wine glass it is pictured on the dessert menu. The sweet sensation dessert is another I would recommend with Thai tea ice cream. And their Thai tea drink is delicious as well I get this every time I dine there. I come here quite often and like I said I have never been disappointed! I love this place!"}
{"text":"Great Thai food! Some of the best we have had in the states. Don't be turned off by the outside...it has some great ambience inside. We had the Green Curry and the Pad See ew. It was a good combo and the portion sizes were big. Medium spice was perfect for us."}
{"text":"This was amazing experience. I've never walked into a Thai restraurant with such an incredible greeting and warm smiles. The pad thai was amazing and the duck curry was fabulous. I wouldn't ever recommend another Thai place other than this."}
{"text":"Excellent duck curry. Very delicious. Good service and fancy inside."}
{"text":"This place was terrific, delicious food and good portions. Priced perfectly. The Pad Thai was delicious, also tried the yellow curry which was great! Definitely great quality food."}
{"text":"I am from New York and my husband is from Atlanta, and needless to say, this is the best Thai food we have ever eaten. The presentation of the food is magnificent and the Taste of the food left us so speechless that we just ate in silence and awe for the first 10mins. The deserts are amazing as well. I highly recommend this restaurant!!"}
{"text":"Loved the food here!  

The menu is composed of classic Thai favorites, but everything is elevated far beyond the typical Thai neighborhood joint in terms of flavor, ingredients and presentation. 
Had the Short-rib Curry and Pad Thai ... both were phenomenal...

The curry was full of flavor and had the perfect heat level.  The star of the dish was the short rib... succulent and falling off the bone. A perfect protein to complement the richness of the curry. 

This Pad Thai was excellent... presented beautifully with the freshest of flavors and ingredients.

Very artful and delicious expression of Thai cuisine... Save room for dessert!"}
{"text":"Looks ghetto outside but the inside along with the food is very fancy and high class. Oooooo yaaaaa"}
{"text":"This  restaurant is in the worst strip center but when you enter the decor is very tasteful, the food is fresh and flavorful. The drunken noodles were the best I have ever had. 
The best part of the meal were the desserts, we had the banana puff and raspberry lava cake. The waiter was also very courteous. We will be returning for sure."}
{"text":"This place is fabulous 
Such a great ambience and the food was great
Got have the banana desert"}
{"text":"First time there and I had pad Thai. My wife is half Thai and I enjoy the mother in laws thai cooking. This has to be the best pad Thai I have ever had, my kids always eat pad Thai and hands down for my palate this is the best I have ever had, they don't use a typical peanut sauce in a can, there's actually has seasoning and a little spice in it. A bowl of soup and a chocolate dessert with it for $10. You have a customer until you change your recipe, also the wife had the chicken and vegetables and she said it was really good also. So far so good :)"}
{"text":"Great food, everything is fresh and flavorful! Exceptional service and interior is decorated beautifully."}
{"text":"Arawan Thai has been making waves in Vegas for their classy Thai dishes and beautiful desserts. I've tried two of their lunch specials and am excited to be planning a dinner there soon. Dishes are well-executed and vibrant, desserts are as tasty as they are beautiful, and both sections of the menu offer creative dishes not found elsewhere.

GARLIC SHORT RIB: The actual meat portion is small, but that's short ribs for you. The flavor is spot-on, heavy on the garlic and brightened up with a tasty tamarind dipping sauce. The ribs are meaty with a small amount of fat for flavor. Side this with steamed veggies instead of the rice for less carbs. 
SPICY MINT CHICKEN: Careful with their spice scale, \"medium hot\" will hurt a little bit! This ground chicken dish is packed with peppers and topped with a fried egg, for a fun mix of flavors and textures. I'd specify over-medium in the future rather than straight-up fried to add some oozy, yolky goodness to the mix. 
DESSERT: Thai tea crème brulee was perfection! Delicate sugar crust, creamy custard, and the bright, spicy flavors of the tea made for a fun take on a classic dish! Similarly, their sticky rice and mango is infused with a punch of fragrant, fresh mint. 

Lunch specials come with soup, salad, and dessert, for a steal at $10- great opportunity to try some more cautious dishes before throwing yourself into their full menu, with dishes like short rib curry and rib eye crispy basil. Their execution of the lunch dishes has convinced me to return for dinner with a bigger appetite and budget. Glad to have a new Thai option in town that actually adds something different to the local scene!"}
{"text":"Amazing flavors in all of their dishes and desserts we've tried! I could smell the food on my plate, from the basil and peppercorn to the bitter fragrance of the espresso in my affogato desert! My family loved it! Prices are a little higher but the flavor makes it worth it to me. Nice service, pretty decor inside. We will be back again to try more"}
{"text":"Service and food are above excellent!!! While on vacation in Vegas wanted to explore a unique Thai spot and found Arawan a miile from our hotel. Best choice we ever made. Thank you for cooking us a perfect meal for our BIRTHDAY!!!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely delicious, I am a huge fan of Thai food and this is hands down one of the best, I read all the reviews about lotus of Siam and tried there before I tried here and this restaurant in my opinion is way better, the food was tasteful and spicy at the same time. The ambiance of the restaurant was very modern with a hint of Thai tradition, the service could've been a little better but the server was alone so I don't blame her for the delay it was completely understandable. I will definitely visit this place again when I return to Vegas. I only wish I had the opportunity to try the delicious looking deserts. It's a must try especially if you don't want to fall into the lotus of Siam hype. Great food!"}
{"text":"Really good food - very authentic, probably the best pad Thai I have tasted ever!! 

The seafood curry had squid in it and wwas cooked in in- totally delicious"}
{"text":"I was in the area and hankering for some thai food, noting that my old stand by Lotus of Siam is closed at that mall, i found this little gem in the same complex.  I ordered take out of some simple food, pad thai, tom yum soup, green beans and beef, and it was outstanding. I didnt have much of a sample but it was quite telling with large portions and reasonable prices ( a bit less than Siam). Id definitely return if in the area.  The mall its in is somewhat seedy, but its worth it."}
{"text":"Best pad thai ever. The egg nest over the noodles was beautiful"}
{"text":"Food:  This is one of the top 3 thai Places in Las Vegas, Excellent food with great presentation. The Quality of the food is top notch. The main entrees are excellent, with the desserts that are great in the eyes and excellent to the tongue. Definitely A MUST try if your travelling to Las Vegas, or live in LAS Vegas.

Ambiance: Although the location of the restaurant is in eastern part of Las Vegas, the restaurant more than make up for it with the decor in the restaurant, it's modern, hip, and vibrant.

Service: Service was very good. The staff was well trained  and very accommodating with our group, which was 20. They have a good grasp of their menu both the entrees and desserts.

Overall: THIS PLACE is a MUST TRY."}
{"text":"Excellent service, excellent food! By the style they put food on the plate, I can feel the chef is not only making food, but also like creating a piece of art. The lunch special really worthy its price. The papaya salad tastes just like what I had before in Thailand."}
{"text":"Great lunch specials for 10 includes entree, soup and dessert. Lots of charm for small place, fast a friendly service and great portions. Food was great."}
{"text":"The best Thai restaurant in Vegas.  The entree and desert is awesome.  You've got to try the Mango island dessert"}
{"text":"I will start with the food. We ordered fish cakes, salmon prik khao po, ribeye with crispy basil and glass noodles with tofu. And several rounds of singha beers. The food was delicious. Especially the rib eye. It was a very unusual item in a Thai restaurant but so Thai of that makes sense. The glass noodles were also yummy with large chunks of deep fried tofu and small pieces of egg. But the salmon?  Never arrived. Instead we got mixed seafood. Which sucks because a member of our party doesn't like calamari and it was a prominent ingredient in the dish. The flavor was good though. 

Now the service. It has been a long time since I have had such bad service. We got there at 7:30 and ordered almost right away. We didn't get our food until almost 9. You read that right. 1.5 hours later. Why didn't we leave?  I think we all thought the other would think it was rude. No one asked to get us more drinks. No one came to apologize about the ridiculous wait time. No one explained why people all around us were getting served and we weren't. And the irony in all of this?  We actually were the only one to arrive who made reservations. Ugh!  I won't be back unless I hear their service, or at least their service to me, is drastically better!"}
{"text":"Love the ambiance!!! Perfect quite place after street crowd  this place. Love the food presentation . They take good care of you!!!"}
{"text":"???????????q??????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Awesome service, scrumptious food! All entries are works of art, upstaged only by delightful dessert selections. Leave room"}
{"text":"When you a arrive in the restaurant the place looks amazing really make it fusion Thai. The food are all nicely plated and give a up scale environment. The serivce is very well and they are very attentive with you. The spicy level is okay for everyone if you want to have a nice little date this would be a nice place they are also well known for there dessert. The flavor of everything was wonderful and had lots of beautiful designs. It's very nice the desert is was amazing over 5 star"}
{"text":"All the food was amazing: whole crispy catfish, duck fried rice, ribeye basil, red curry fish cake, blooming tea. Charles was a great server: a very honest, straightforward, and upstanding citizen, but not in a bad way."}
{"text":"As the name says, this is a Thai Bistro and Dessert....  Come here to spend a little more on their signature dishes and be amazed with the taste, quality and presentation of the food.  

We started with a small Tom Kha soup which is enough to share for 2 people.  I then had the Thai-Spiced Sea Bass and the sea bass was done perfectly.  My wife had the Short Rib Yellow Curry which was also amazing.  I would definitely recommend both these dishes.  Our kids had Pad Thai with tofu and they really enjoyed it as well.

Most importantly, save room for dessert.  Everything looked good in the menu but we decided to go with the Coconut Treasure and the Mango Island.  Both were excellent.  If you have to pick one, I would recommend the Mango but if you have room, get both.  The pastry chef here is amazing!!!

I read about other Thai places just going on reputation and having long wait.  I would say forget that and make a reservation here.  One more thing...  Excellent service!  What else can you ask for?

This will be our Thai place every time we come to Vegas..."}
{"text":"Being vegan there aren't too many places that have a wide variety of foods to choose from. So I typically find myself eating a lot of Thai food when I go out. Out of all the Thai places I've been too this is one of, if not the best. They definitely have the best yellow curry I've ever had and their playing is gorgeous as well as the taste. An amazing place if you're reading this don't think twice go to Arawan right now!"}
{"text":"Food is Fantastic. Ask for Drake he is the best and you may feel like pricy but once you get the food into your mouth your gonna feel that's totally worth it. Awesome place totally recommend it...."}
{"text":"I lived in Chaing Mai,Thailand for a short while and was married to a Laotian. This is the best Thai I have had and they can also make your dish Lao style. Always great Service. My fave are the Papaya Salad and the Larb Gai the Blossom Tea is also delicious."}
{"text":"Dessert included with lunch special. What? Dessert? I'm there!  This what got my attention and probably one of the things that sets Arawan Thai Bistro and Dessert apart from the more popular and renowned Thai restaurants here in Commercial Center. 

For this first dining experience here I can only speak for the nine dollar lunch specials they run from 11-3. Well rounded selection of entrées to choose from. The section of the menu has beef, chicken and veggie options. So our main course we had Thai Bbq Beef and Yellow Curry Chicken, along with Egg Flower soup as our starter and side of salad greens. Everything was delicious.  The consistency of the curry was more liquidy than I've become accustomed to, but the spices and taste are spot on!  

The dessert presented for today was Cheesecake with Raspberry. The small cut of cheesecake turned out to be the perfect portion and didn't feel no guilt whatsoever having that decadent bite! Very obvious made from scratch ingredients and prepared that morning by their very own pastry chef.  Who by the way just made a beautiful wedding cake. Next visit I plan to make room for a full portion for sure! 

Definitely impressed once we stepped inside for early lunch. Contemporary and minimalistic decor and soft jazz tunes playing really set a more classy, yet casual tone here. The service was great. Table service type restaurant.  Nice touch with fruit infused water when you are seated. 

Note: So just hang a right turn instead of left coming into Commercial Center Dr. otherwise you'll end up at that green door place like my friend did. 

They have crispy duck on the main menu! (Arawan Duck) Looking forward to coming back here and trying it next!"}
{"text":"I found Arawan through Yelp when searching for a dinner and dessert restaurant. I have mixed feelings about the place.

First, I'll start off with the restaurant itself. From the outside, I personally get a food truck kind of feel from the place. They have pictures of their dishes plastered on the outside, which is nice because then you know exactly what you're getting. We were surprised upon entering the restaurant: it's beautiful! They have a modern chic style going on. The seats were comfortable and the decor was nice to look at. It's just a little deceiving from the outside because I wanted to have a cool dinner with my friends, but I felt like I was on a fancy date. 

Secondly, the service. I believe there is such thing as too much service, and I got too much service here and it wasn't good. I know I might have been taking awhile to look over the menu, but three different employees came up to my table within a 5-minute period to ask if everything was okay. At one point, it was very awkward and uncomfortable. I felt like I would be kicked out if I didn't make a decision on the spot.

Lastly, I'll talk about the food:
The menu is split into different categories and the portion sizes are all over the place. I ordered an orange chicken plate and my friend had the pad thai special. Both of our portions were fairly large, so there were no complaints from our end, but I just found it odd because I was expecting that my friend would have a bigger portion than mine since she was paying almost double for her selection. My husband ordered the red duck curry and he had a little portion which was made worse by the fact that it was served in a bowl with a large rim. It looked tiny. I wish I could have gotten a photo of the disappointment on his face. It's all about presentation, and the presentation of the curry was lacking. Aside from that, the flavors were not lacking. Everyone was satisfied with how the food tasted. We decided to try their dessert since that was one of the main reasons we came down there. Their dessert is amazing! We ordered the vanilla bean creme brulee and the earthquake. The presentation is beautiful and the desserts were not too sweet: they were the perfect ending to our meal.


I love Thai food, so I'm always up to trying new places. Although this restaurant is beautiful and the food tasted good, it just left me feeling very confused. I feel like the restaurant is trying too hard. I'll skip on it this place next time. There are better and cheaper thai places in the valley."}
{"text":"Authentic Thai food in a casual setting with warm attentive service.  

We were a bit put off by the location but that was quickly overcome by the excellent food and service.   We came from downtown hotel seeking exactly what we found. Certainly worth the trip. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Ate here Thursday evening and it was fantastic!!  We ordered the shrimp pad Thai and the drunken chicken noodle.  Both dishes were amazing, absolutely amazing.  Finished the evening with the creme brûlée which was just as good as the entrees.  Next time we are in Vegas, we will be back!!!"}
{"text":"Before Arawan was opened on Sahara, the owner had a smaller business on desert inn, my family and I have been coming to this Thai restaurant for years now and it never disappoints! The food is amazing, the service is amazing, and the atmosphere is amazing. Way better than any Thai place I have tried, way better than Lotus of Siam. The owner and his wife own this place along with their daughter who is the pastry chef. They are all so nice and friendly, they always greet my family and I since we have been loyal customers. We love this place!"}
{"text":"Wow, this was a fantastic meal from beginning to end.  The staff and service was top-rate all the way.  You have to really know about this place to find it.  We went early on a Friday and the got the last open table.  I was surprised how many people were eating there from other countries.  several cabs were dropping and picking people up from the place.  Arawan Thai Bistro sits it a shopping complex well off the main road.  There are a lot of other restaurants in the same area but this place appears to be the star.  This is not the type of place you just stumble upon.

We started off with a spring roll that was served with a chili pepper sauce that was amazing.  We heat had a great main meal and dessert.  The prices are amazing for the quality of the food and service provided.  They have a great lunch special that I want to try that includes an entree and dessert for $10.00.

The only slight negative thing is the red carpet in the back area going to the bathrooms is very dingy and needs replacing.  I would come back here anytime though and understand why they are rated so well."}
{"text":"Lunch special is really good. Great service. Huge portions. Super clean place with a nice chill ambiance."}
{"text":"A wonderful place! We were heading to another Thai place which turned out to be closed. Our Uber driver suggested this restaurant instead. That turned out to be a great choice! The food was great - spicy and flavourful, and we had a table facing the desert bar - watching amazing desserts to be assembled in front of us provided a show to our dinner experience..
The staff was nice and friendly."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with good company last night. I have been to many Thai restaurants (I love Thai food more than Japanese or Korean food) and this is the best Thai restaurant you'll find in town. 

We started off with their honeydew sencha tea then ordered chicken satay bites as our appetizer & crab fried rice , ribeye crispy basil , arawan pad thai , and duck red curry (all from their signature menu) for entrees. Food can be spicier but overall everything was amazing. Even my boyfriend said their Thai food is the best compared to the other Thai restaurants we've been to in Las Vegas. He really enjoyed the duck red curry and I loved the ribeye crispy basil. The sliced ribeye was perfect along with the crispy basil , mushrooms , bell peppers , garlic , and chili. I also loved how the arawan pad thai is wrapped in a egg netting - very different from standard pad thai. It's served w/ chicken inside and two prawns on top. I highly recommend getting any of their signature dishes when dining here. 

Don't skip out on their desserts too - we actually ordered more desserts than entrees. We got their vanilla bean creme brulee , mango island , raspberry chocolate lava cake , affogato and sweet sensation. All are made to order just like their dinner & you can watch the chef make it from their dessert bar. I'm not really a fan of fruity desserts but their mango island was my absolutely favorite here. They put their homemade mango gelato on top of sticky rice and it has crunchy almonds , crispy waffle , and mangoes inside a wine glass & you pour a creamy coconut sauce allover it. You can't go wrong with any of them (although I would recommend ordering more than one dessert because they're all so good) but their mango island is a must order. Again , I love how different it is from your standard mango with sticky rice dessert you can get from other Thai places.

I must also mention the presentation from their ambiance and decor to the food and desserts here are all really nice. Our server Kanni was very hospitable and accommodating. This place is not too far from the Strip and downtown area :)"}
{"text":"Food is really good but hot and humid and they rush you to finish food"}
{"text":"Although the starters didn't blow me away, the steaks are really well cooked and the sides are good. The selection of desserts are also good. Is it expensive, yes, but it's definitely worth the money if you want to splurge out on some really good steak."}
{"text":"This Thai Restaurant is a great choice for any occasion. Nice atmosphere. We had The Catfish and Fish soup.  It was fabulous! Price is reasonable and service personal are caring and friendly. We were both very satisfied and recommend it highly."}
{"text":"When I walked into the restaurant in the late afternoon, there was only one server and the restaurant was crowded. It took a while for us to be seated, order food, and get our food. Their lunch special was good. It came with a cup of soup and dessert and the portion was pretty filling. Their specialty menu was delicious too! Would like to try this place again when I'm back in Vegas!"}
{"text":"We finally found a great authentic THAI restaurant! Service was great and food amazing!!! Will be back soon to try more items."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely perfect and delicious.
I ordered to go from them , they are so nice all the food is fresh and you just can't stop eating because everything is so good. I will definitely will go back there. Absolutely love it"}
{"text":"We wanted Thai food but the place before was crowded and would have to wait for 2 hours. So we looked for a Thai restaurant close by. At first it was pretty sad the outside and then we went in and it was well furnished. The food was exquisite. We didn't have to wait very long and all the food was just cooked."}
{"text":"Came here for a father's day lunch and the experience was OK. The food was definitely tasty but for these prices I expected much more as most thai places that are half the price could product this quality. They have specialty dishes which you can't get at many thai restaurants. The establishment is pretty disorganized and dirty with a decor that is lacking. The service was kind of poor, initially the waiter was friendly but after taking our orders he was barely present and was not there when we needed him. As Vegas has many choices for thai food, I would pick some place else."}
{"text":"Their vegan pad Thai was really good! My friend ordered the duck... I want to throw up just thinking about it! Go 100% vegan!!!"}
{"text":"The best Thai food I have ever had. This place has great food, presentation and very attentive wait staff. The food was served quick. The meal portions are huge so bring an appetite. We ordered medium hot food and the spice level was perfect."}
{"text":"We were craving Thai after spending time in the culinary wasteland of southwest Utah. There are many Thai places with good reviews in Vegas, but we decided on this one. It was one of the best Thai meals I've ever had! The complimentary crispy wontons and sweet and spicy dipping sauce were a nice touch and judging by the yumminess of the sauce, I knew we were in for a good meal. Got the ahi tuna larb as an appetizer and it was very flavorful with good sour notes. For my entree I had drunken noodles with crispy pork. The pork was delicious, as were the noodles. Wonderful flavor! Sadly we didn't have room for dessert, but our server advised us that they are known for their dessert."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place. We ordered the pad prig pao plate w/chicken, pad Thai w/tofu and Drunken Noodle w/shrimp. Everything tasted great. I especially liked the egg net over the pad Thai. I would definitely come back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"We had the sea bass which came with a sweet chili sauce.  Dish was really nicely spiced.  The short rib with yellow curry melts in your mouth.  I could eat dirt with that curry sauce and it would taste good.

Service was very friendly and prompt."}
{"text":"Great service! Delicious food! Even better desserts! Highly recommend! Try the mango dessert one of the best desserts I ever had."}
{"text":"We had the signature Pad Thai and it was awesome. Two giant salted prawns atop the traditional pad Thai noodles. It was better than most and was enough to share around true table. The green curry chicken and curry short ribs were also quite tasty and equally filling.  Thankfully we left room for desert her CHEF Gail shines   Do not leave without sampling some of her desert creations. We had the chocolate mousse cake and fried banana with green tea ice cream and orange cookie. They looked so good we were reluctant to cut into them. Two deserts wee plenty for our party of three. The deserts capped a great dining experience. Food was excellent, service attentive without being annoying and good value for the money. Definitely worth checking out. One note: as of our visit they have not yet received their liquor license. They have applied and expect to be serving shortly."}
{"text":"This place is awesome . I loved the taste of food , all the dishes that I ordered . The food decoration and presentation is remarkable. Desserts menu is limited but it's not to be missed."}
{"text":"Party of four; bro, aunt, friend and myself. 

Among the fried fish, pad thai, som  tum, beef steak and two appetizers, I personally enjoyed the Pad Thai thee most. Although, my Thai aunt - who is somewhat old fashioned, would strongly disagree with me. Unlike my 62 yr old aunt, I am an ABT so our disagreement may be due to differing standards based on locality (But I like to think it's because of the wide generation gap) :) 

The pad thai was chewy (good). The jumbo prawns and the level of sweetness were the two main characteristics of this dish that made it stand out among your standard, everyday American Pad Thai that is served in 90% of the Thai restaurants in the States (i.e. ketchup instead of Tamarind sauce, regular shrimp instead of large prawns).

The restaurant's ambiance had a pleasant warmth to it. Also, the pastry chef was an artist with the desserts she created for our table - she provided good taste both in art and on my pallet.

With heavy competition just across the street (Lotus), I am really pulling for this restaurant 
to survive. But honestly my worries are unjustified. This place will do just fine."}
{"text":"I've passed this restaurant for a few times now and didn't want to risk wasting a thai food meal when Lotus of Siam and Komol are in the same plaza.  Since we didn't want to wait, we decided to give this restaurant a try. When entering, it has a quiet atmosphere(it was not half filled) with excellent modern decorations and very clean. 

As others have mentioned, the prices here are higher when compare to Komol. The presentations of the dishes are hands down beat both LotusOfSiam and Komol. I had a tom yum soup with shrimp and it was the best tasting tom yum soup I have had. Their spicy mint with ground pork was a bit on the sweet side and not spicy enough. This dish was just alright for me.  Their steam rice was a bit on the wet side. I would definitely come back to get the tom yum soup again and will try another entree. I would rate this place a 3.5 since i wasn't impressed with the spicy mint."}
{"text":"It took a little drive around the entire parking lot, but was sooooo worth the drive. First of all, it's clean. The first thing I look at in a restaurant are the vents... very impressive because the outside was not appealing at all. On to the food, exquisite. From flavor to presentation. AMAZING!!"}
{"text":"I will definitely come back to this restaurant if I go to Vegas again. It's very clean and nice. I love the roses and light music. Quiet place for couples. Very nice service. We loved the plain shrimp, especially the sauce! And the short rib yellow curry was also delicious! The meat was very tender."}
{"text":"I've put off this review for awhile anyhow the prices are considerably high compared to other local Thai restaurants BUT this place is all about quality and let me tell you then live up to the quality. We ordered 
-Chicken Panang 
-Thai fried rice
-Chicken satay 
-Lemongrass chicken wings
-mint chicken
-pad Thai 
Our favorites were the Pad Thai, the curry, and satay. They were super flavorful and the chicken quality is 10/10 it was so tender. They also use fresh lemongrass, basil. The leftovers were soooo good. 

All in all the food was amazing and the atmosphere is super nice this wouldn't be a place that I would go consistently just because it was expensive but definitely would come by on special occasions."}
{"text":"Great ambience. If you wanna escape the loud, and wild strip, come to this small and cozy restaurant. I love the relaxing music in the background, the excellent food presentation, the comfy patio chairs, and of course the food itself."}
{"text":"We ordered the signature shrimp noodle dish, pad see ew and tom kai soup.  I enjoyed the dishes and the flavors were really good.  The prices are a little higher than most.  Service was excellent.  Would come back."}
{"text":"What a fun place! Food is amazing and beautiful , I even love the strawberry mint water . The deserts are made by the owners daughter , truly a work of art! Located in the Commercial Center... a true hidden gem!"}
{"text":"I give this place one star for atmosphere and presentation of food. Very nice, relaxed, soft jazz in the background.  The plating, even the glass of water, was aesthetically pleasing. I give one star for Portion size and pricing. I got soup, an entrees and small side salad, and a small dessert on lunch for just ten dollars. I couldn't finish it all. I give one star for service, as the Staff were all very attentive and timely.  I also give one star for taste, as the food was all delightful.  The soup was light, my entrée was chicken pahd see ew, medium spice.  It was mild for spicy, making it easier to differentiate between the light flavors.  Lastly, the mango ice cream was just the right amount, a light melon baller size with a frozen mint leaf garnish.  I enjoyed my solo lunch very much!"}
{"text":"The food was excellent! I had an appetizer and a lunch special.  The food was well presented, fresh, and seasoned.  I arrived by bus 1/2 after opening and was seated promptly without a reservation. Yes, I'd frequent Arawan again upon my return to Vegas."}
{"text":"This restaurant is amazing. After coming here I completely understand why this place has a 5-star rating. We had the duck curry, rib eye basil, pad thai, and soft shell crab and let me tell you everything was delicious. Couple that with the warm, professional customer service and it becomes a once in a lifetime experience. 

Lastly, you MUST get dessert here! I can't believe their dessert chef is so young. Truly talented. Staff, decor, food is are total rock stars. Definitely will be my regular stop in each time I'm here in Vegas."}
{"text":"The Mango Island dessert is amazing!!!  the regular food is great too. It's a little pricy but I really like this place!!"}
{"text":"Good thai food and decent service. But nothing outstanding in my opinion. I liked the food but i was hoping something that would stand out.

I got the duck basil. Cooked well. 

Appetizers were very small in proportion. We got the calamari and the ribs. It was ok. Both appetizers Barely had enough for three people (7 of us total).

I may come here for lunch for prices i saw. But there were cheaper similarly rated places."}
{"text":"I was thoroughly impressed with this place! Not located in the best area, the plaza and overall area is old and seemed empty, so this place was a nice little find. The inside of the restaurant is modernly decorated, nice and clean, definitely not a typical casual Thai restaurant. This would be a nice place for a date, something fancier than just normal dinner. Service was good, we were quickly greeted and seated, our waitress came and took our drink order right away, plates were picked up, table was wiped clean before dessert. Service was very good. 

They have a nice list of wine, hot teas, and sodas and Thai tea. Their blossoming tea was delicious, we ordered the Honeydew Sencha, very big pot, absolutely big enough to share. That tea was also very good, not too creamy or too sweet. 

For appetizers we ordered: Tuna Larb, Thai Calamari, and Egg Papaya Salad. The tuna larb was delicious! Has tuna, onions, advocado, mango served with lettuce and fried wontons. The egg papaya salad was also really good, different than all others I have tried. It came with salted duck egg, cha lua (Vietnamese meat), and chicharron! I like that it is so different from other papaya salad at other Thai restaurants. The calamari was not the best, very small pieces, lightly fried but not crispy, the squid was too chewy. 

Main courses: Spicy Eggplant, Duck Drunken Noodles, Soft Shell Crab Curry, Short Rib Yellow Curry, Thai Spiced Sea bass, and Tenderloin Black Pepper. The stand out dishes are definitely the short rib yellow curry and the tenderloin black pepper. The curry was so creamy but not to the point where you can sick of it quickly, the short ribs melt in your mouth, simply delicious. The tenderloin was so tender (heehee :), perfectly seasoned. The rest of the dishes are very good also, did not regret ordering any of them. 

For dessert we shared: Sweet Sensation, Mango Island, and Coconut Treasure. The desserts here are similar to those at Sweet Raku in terms of the concept and the presentation. Coconut Treasure was my absolute favorite, has sweet sticky rice on the bottom, with pieces of fresh coconut, with a scoop of coconut ice cream on top, with crushed peanuts and a thin piece of cookie. All three desserts were beautiful and really good, but I absolutely recommend the Coconut Treasure. 

The presentation of every dish here is awesome. They take a lot of time and care with plating their dishes, everything came out beautiful but also delicious. Would definitely recommend this place when you want to celebrate an occasion, or for dates, or even just casual dinner. Just come try this place!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Thai food I have had in a long time. Very flavourful and super fresh. Great service and value for money. Must visit for Thai food in Vegas. Will go back every time we visit."}
{"text":"I'm a fan but the prices are high. $22 pad thai?  Must be good. Location was very inconspicuous within a strip mall.  Looks like a dive restaurant from the exterior yet the interior was quite inviting. 

We had the whole fried catfish with Thai style salsa and spicy dip/sauce.  Whoa, dee-lish-us.  Never thought a catfish could taste so good.  Also, had two orders of thai chicken with basil and one order of duck curry.   Cost for all was holy sheesh...$150?!!!  OK, we were accustomed to paying high prices at Hell's Kitchen and Mon Ami Gabi but the bill took me by surprise.

I'd definitely try it again the next time we're in Las Vegas but I would leave out the catfish.  OK, maybe leave it in and cut out something else."}
{"text":"This is my new Thai spot downtown.  It is always easy to get seated immediately upon arrival.  Their lunch specials are very reasonable, but we've been for both dinner and lunch.  The decor is very warm, lovely, and unique.  The manager and the servers are very quiet, yet attentive and responsive at the same time.

In the few times we have visited, we have had the Panang Curry with Tofu, the Ginger Mint Tofu, the Fish Cakes, and the Spicy Eggplant.  Everything tasted amazing and on point.  It is Thai food with a Chinese flair to it.  It is really lovely how they present their iced water with a refreshing hint of strawberry."}
{"text":"The area was a little dicey for me when we first arrived. The restaurant was very nice inside and the wait staff and owners were very friendly. The food was great, big portions, my husband and I shared an entree. The desert was to die for."}
{"text":"Have gone to Arawan five times since they open. Definitely one of the better Thai places in vegas.  It deserves its 5 star rating.   Great service!!! Food taste great. Haven't had a bad meal yet.  Make sure you make room for dessert- great presentation.  Only drawback of the place is the location- a little sketchy area of vegas but Lotus of Siam's  two location are too.   Love that you can make reservations via open table."}
{"text":"The place is off the strip in a shopping area, but the food is excellent.  You always hear holes in the wall are top notch and this one is true!
Ordered the fresh rolls, Tom Kha soup with seafood (huge seafood), lemon grass chicken wings and Pad Thai.  My buddy got the Chief special that was Pad Thai with huge prawns."}
{"text":"The most amazing food. The chicken wings and the shrimp spring rolls were my favorite. The chef is super nice and their desserts are gorgeous. Must eat here!"}
{"text":"This review is for lunch. Apparently the dinner is even more amazing so I'll have to return for that.
They have $9.95 lunch specials which include a small soup, your choice of entree from a list, and a dessert. The quality and taste are exceptional. And for that price, you really can't beat it. There was no wait at all during lunch. Service was excellent as well. This is a more upscale place than next-door Lotus of Siam."}
{"text":"Love this place. Been multiple times and a must hit whenever we are driving through Vegas. Hidden oasis with a wonderful interior supported with delicious food. Highly recommend their Pad Thai. Great place to escape the chaos of the Strip and grab a nice meal."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai food I've had since....well, Thailand. The food was executed perfectly, not too salty, fresh ingredients, everything had their own character. Presentation was wonderful and the desserts are out of this world. They even have great a tea leaf selection and fresh coconut water. I definitely recommend any of the curry dishes, basil ribeye, crème brûlée, and the fresh rolls.

Service is impeccable, place is cozy clean and comfortable. Don't let the shopping center scare you this place may not be in the best part of town but even my \"location snob\" husband is willing to make the schlep out to eat here. 

Everyone I've taken to this restaurant has since introduced other people to this restaurant which is a testament to how great this new little place is. Forget about Lotus of Siam, that place is a has been. THIS is the good stuff for food snobs."}
{"text":"We happened upon this place while on our way to lotus of Siam. (Which was closed). While doing a U turn in the plaza, we spotted Arawan. This place is amazing! Not as much of a selection as Lotus of Siam, but the dishes we had were so much better! The ambience is nice. The decor is elegant. And the staff is very attentive. We had the stuffed wings and I would highly recommend those! The beef salad was awesome too! You can tell they use very high quality ingredients. I want to try everything on the menu! Can't wait to come back during our annual trip!"}
{"text":"This place was okay, I've been to better. Spent my birthday weekend in Vegas and wanted to hit up different restaurants. It was expensive for the few entrees we ordered. Ordered larb, curry and stir fry duck. If I knew before hand, I would've turned around and went elsewhere."}
{"text":"Everybody goes to Vegas for that garlic shrimp at Lotus of Siam, well foodies do anyways :P I'm an idiot and didn't get reservations on a Sunday night, soooo it was a 90 minute wait at 6pm. I found Arawan from Yelp and it's located in the same plaza. All the reviews say it's comparable... it's not.

It is totally smaller and accommodates maybe 50 people at max. Outside the restaurant there are delicious pictures of desserts, so I was happy we lucked out. False, they give you a basic dessert menu which does not include any of their featured pictures. When I walked up to the dessert bar, they had some fried banana dessert, but the waitress said they are only serving the menu items... THEN WHY EVEN PUT IT OUT :insert mad face:

Breakdown: 
Lemongrass Wings - overcooked and barely any meat; bad
Yellow Curry with Short Rib - curry delicious, short rib too fatty; okay
Pad Thai Special - $22 for 2 prawns and tasteless noodles; super bad
Thai Tea - large portion; good 

If you're going here for Thai food, it's alright. If you're going here because Lotus is full, you will definitely be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is the best Thai restaurant I have been to. I love Thai food and I go once a week. My girlfriends and I were celebrating my birthday in Las Vegas and so happened to discover this little gem. Everything was excellent! The quality of the food was so good. My favorite was the papaya salad with salty eggs. I know...eggs! Yummy! Their desserts are to die for! Don't leave without ordering the desserts! Sticky rice with mango (not on menu, but they created for us), coconut ice cream, on and on! Everything was so good! We wanted to come back the next day, but time didn't allow us to. Please try this place! You won't regret it! Oh, did I mention the superb customer service! Yes! A must go! I'm coming back here when I return to Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"The desserts here are better than the food. The desserts are very high quality, beautifully plated, and taste delicious. If was rating just the desserts, it'd easily be a 5+.

The food is, for the most part, your basic Thai food. I would say that the pad thai tasted better than others I've had elsewhere (and I've had quite a bit of pad thai over the years!), but the eggplant was pretty average (and was not digging the copious amount of onions included in the dish, which usually doesn't come with spicy eggplant). I would also note that the portions are smaller than what I'm used to. So if you're coming really hungry, maybe order extra and take home the leftovers.

I really liked the decor. I thought the dark wood and bright red accents were really nice. It was a lovely dinner date spot, and I'll definitely come again when I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Service is good, the ambiance is okay  and the food is strictly average; had the egg roll for appetizer and the sea bass for main course."}
{"text":"This was some of the best food I've ever had, anywhere. The service was impeccable and friendly. Got to talk with the owner and learned this is a labor of love for their family. We will definitely come here every time we're in Vegas. It was everything I hope for in a restaurant."}
{"text":"Decor : 3.5 stars
Service : 2 stars
Food : 3.2 stars

Located in a big plaza in Sahara Ave with lots of parking spots.
We originally wanted to eat at different Thai restaurant but we stumbled upon this place since they are known for their desserts.

Our group consist with 4 adults and 2 kids.( 6 yr old and 2 yr old)

We quickly ordered our food since the kids were hungry and anyone knows kids can't wait for food so most of servers know to order kids food fast before adults food.( common sense)

All adults food came first and we kept waiting for the kids food and it end up arrived twenty minutes after our food came.

The food taste okay, nothing special. I wished I could try the dessert but I had no more room for sweets. 

The bill was really surprised us since the server ' Luis' added tips on the bill even when our group were only four adults with two small kids.

Coming from NYC with a lot of restaurant experience, the tips usually added on party of 6 ( adults) and more. ( common sense that kids are not tipping)
The tip is gratuity based on service, so why on earth we got charged 18% for bad service?

I was a bit embarrassed since I was the one suggested this place for dinner.

If you do try this place, check your bill when you get it and make sure you get good service before they charge tip on your bill."}
{"text":"Great dinner experience, excellent food choices and easy to read menu. Very friendly staff.  Enjoyed the Checkin Curry and all the appetizers, not so much for the Pad Thai, little bitter. Definitely coming back for deserts."}
{"text":"Wow! I am still dreaming about the desserts. All the dishes were delicious and each of their presentations were on point. The customer service was great also, seeing we had a large party, mainly kids. They accommodated our needs. I will definitely return when we hit Vegas again."}
{"text":"The house pad Thai and the soft shell crab salad were delicious, as were the fresh spring rolls. A sophisticated menu in a very pleasant ambiance, (except the thumping base from the karaoke restaurant next door). Desserts are the bomb too. Try the mango island if you like really sweet and the coconut dessert if you like less sweet."}
{"text":"Arawan moved to the commercial center and is better than ever. 
We started going when it was sticky Rice and loved it. 
This new spot is great and the food as good. 
Lots of parking available, lovely staff and cool ambiance. 
Shrimp pad thai and curry are my fav"}
{"text":"This is some of the best food I've ever eaten. One word to describe this place: flavor. We got an appetizer, two entrees and dessert, and every bite was incredible! Definitely try this out (don't let the appearance from the outside of this restaurant deter you). It's truly incredible! Service was excellent as well, and prices were reasonable."}
{"text":"Unbelievable food! The cream brûlée was the best I've ever had! Top notch service and amazing ambiance. Try the short rib, you will not regret it!"}
{"text":"A M A Z I N G. 

If I need to describe it further then you really don't care what I have to say. If you wait, when you finally come here you will kick yourself for having waited. Don't be a fool. 

A M A Z I N G."}
{"text":"5 stars for the food and presentation.
5 stars for the service

Why am I just now learning about this place?!?  It's a hidden gem on East Sahara in the ghetto (Commercial Plaza). Even with the sketchy location.....on the inside, you feel like you are in a high end restaurant the way its decorated. The food was amazing! I enjoyed every dish we ordered. The prices for everything are reasonable as well. The service was top notch and they take care of your table. Since we ordered lots of food, our table kept getting full. The servers would clear out our empty plates or even transfer to a smaller dish so that it all could fit on our table. I felt fancy because even our water was garnished with a strawberry in it. For sure I'll be back. Food soo good that I don't mind traveling far for it."}
{"text":"The restaurant was  next  door to lotus of siam. Place was slow. Hostess  was pleasant. Tried egg rolls these were greasy. Chicken wings were  tangy and spicy. Pad Thai was good . Crab fried rice was very good.  Barbeque. Chicken  was cooked.   Did like the pork belly and brochilli . Service  was good.  Price was a little high . ."}
{"text":"We were in Vegas for 8 days, and this was my favorite. It's small and lovely. The menu was good and I had to decide among several entrees. Our server was very helpful, in addition to being friendly and efficient.   I ordered the Pad Thai. It was the best I ever had, and presentation was very impressive.  The three of us shared a dessert that consisted of sticky rice, coconut ice cream and mango. Delicious!  We found our server also does the pastries.  i wish they had a restaurant where I live."}
{"text":"Arawan is a hidden gem for tourists and locals alike. Only those adventurous to go beyond the aesthetic glamour of its frontage appearance will experience the flavors and its cozy yet elegant elements. Don't let the area fool you...this restaurant caters to the thai taste with a mix of fusion touch. A little more pricey than typical Thai fast food/restaurants...it still sports an affordable meal for those special occasions or weekend date nights. Still you get what you pay for...the servers were all attentive and took their time to recommend favorites...and made sure our party were topped off with beverage and our meal was of no concern. Overall, we enjoyed our experience and delicious Instagram worthy dishes! I definitely would recommend this place for those special occasions and at least to try once. It might not be a place to frequent for those on a budget...but definitely worth the try!"}
{"text":"Went to the other popular Thai restaurant in the plaza but was packed and too long of a wait time.  Decided to check out Arawan and we were not disappointed. Their short rib yellow curry is by far the best curry ever had. Trust me, I'm super picky.  Nice atmosphere great customer service.  This place a must visit."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai restaurant! Delicious food, well presented and clean. A little hard to find, but worth the trip! A must go for us!!"}
{"text":"So after having lunch with few foodie/yelpers up the road at Flock & Fowl. We decided get some dessert. Thankfully I was just playing follow the leader. I would never think about Arawan Thai Bistro and Desserts. Thai restaurant just for DESSERTS!!! Really??? Not that never had my share of Thai restaurants in life. But am usually full by time get to desserts and the only that thing comes to mind is mango sticky rice. I know so lame. Anyway Arawan Thai Bistro and Desserts can totally understand why there the whole \"and Desserts\" in the name. Dam. Just the presentations on every desserts was really fine dining and desserts see in high end restaurants on the strip. The details and really each dessert was artwork. Most of the dishes had height, different textures, and not just one, two or three things but multiple ingredients going on in each dessert. At the same time all the ingredients worked together. I loved the fact they even got these chocolate square pieces with the restaurant logo on most of the desserts. 

Five of us so talk about taking down dessert menu. I believe we only missed two. We ordered the Coconut Treasure, Mango Island, Chocolate Lava Cake, Thai Ice Cream with crepe something, and Chocolate with Raspberry sauce that made for one epic presentation at the table. The Mango Island was the one that stood out for me. It probably had the most stuff going on out of all the dishes. The rice at the bottom of the glass. Not sure the type but it was green in color. I never seen that color sticky rice before. Always been fan of fresh mango with sticky rice. This green stuff was amazing. The Chocolate once pour the hot raspberry sauce on top. I swear felt like watching Aliens and the suspense what hidden treasure is inside. Inside fresh raspberry with more sauce and other stuff. It super sweet. Thai Ice cream. I could have big scoop of that by itself be in heaven. The crepe was solid but that Thai Ice Cream really stood out. Not bad dessert tasted. The best thing is talk about reasonable price. All the desserts was under $15. I swear once see the time they put into making each one (dessert open kitchen can watch them if want) and when get it thinking not cheap dessert. I very impressed. This was my first time coming to Arawan Thai Bistro and Dessert.

Another thing where else can you go for sit down desserts but not just run of the mill ordinary ones but fancy ones middle of the day. Now I know and am sure will be back cause if the menu anything like the desserts. Oh yay!!!!"}
{"text":"Just make sure you walk Thru the door and don't freak out because the center is sketchy.  Totally blew me away with the atmosphere and food.  Everything is a little on the spicy side but a good and flavorful spicy. We had all the appetizers and several of the top dishes.  Amazing."}
{"text":"Very nice cute spot. The service here definitely beats their neighbor \"lotus of Siam\" . You can definitely tell they pay attention to presentation the dishes here are very uniquely put together. The couple I was here with didn't eat spice so everything we ordered was not spicy at all and still good flavor. Mango dessert was amazing I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"Ended up here because Lotus of Siam was closed but I'm really glad I did! The restaurant is very nicely decorated and the ambience is relaxing and welcoming. The servers are very friendly and funny. The food was served almost immediately and it was very delicious. I had the pineapple fried rice with chicken and shrimp and I asked them to make it spicy and they added the perfect amount of heat to it. They serve tea in this fancy glass tea pot with double walled glass tea cups (for you everyone at the table). Do yourself a favor and leave room for dessert because you don't want to pass on the scrumptious selections. I had lychee sorbet inside a chocolate sphere served with candied tropical fruit and warm raspberry sauce. It was a dream. So good!"}
{"text":"The ambiance is cozy, the service is friendly, and the food is amazing! I can't stop thinking about the food here since I visited, especially the pad see ew.  I've been recommending this place to my friends and family, and they consistently agree on how magnificent it is."}
{"text":"You have to try Chef Gail Chocalate Cake. It's The best chocalate cake. Call and order in advance. We have to take it home because we are too full. Thank you Chef Gail."}
{"text":"So glad we ended up eating here than at Lotus Siam which is across the parking lot! Our first intention was to go to Lotus Siam but the wait was 45 mins and it was close to closing time. We waited but got impatient so we left. Good thing cus there were two other Thai Restaurants nearby (walking distance). The first one we came across is Komol and the second was Arawan. These two were literally right next to eachother. We chose one and that was Arawan which means Elephant in Thai. The place was small but very nicely decorated and you could see their chefs making desserts! Glad we came here because the food was on point! Had the pad Thai and I'm a pretty picky person when it comes to my noodle dishes, it was just as I imagined it to be. The Seabass was ok, if you like very sweet flavors. The seafood curry was good as well as the short rib yellow curry. Both full of flavors and spice! The rib eye numtok was the right amount of spice and so fresh! Of course, our spice levels were pretty high so the food tasted even better spicier! Had the egg rolls and I would have to say, I would not order them again. The stuffing was soggy and was basically just cabbage and carrots. We also had the fresh rolls and they were delicious and so refreshing! To end the night, we had their awesome and well-presented desserts! The earthquake was the chocolate ball where you would pour warm raspberry sauce on top to melt the ball to reach the lychee slushee filling and we also tried the Raspberry Lava cake which was so rich and moist with a side of strawberry ice cream! Yummm! This place made up for our wait and poor service at Lotus Siam. Next time you're thinking about Lotus Siam (if it's not too busy) I say... come to Arawan - Less wait and better service!!"}
{"text":"Food is good but service is the worst! Make sure your not hungry cause you'll be waiting 50 minutes for your food to be serve. Kitchen is not is not as clean as it seems."}
{"text":"Arawan Bistro in Las Vegas has the best tom yum soup I've ever tasted (been here last year and wanted to taste it again).  this time, I had the squid ink drunken noodle entree and creme brulee for desert.

the food was excellent as it was the last time I was here.  but I am seriously disappointed with the service I received.  and this is what this review is about.

although I was not dressed well (t-shirt and walking shorts), I did not think 'casual' dress wouldn't be factor in a restaurant discriminating against someone anywhere in Las Vegas.

firstly, the last time I was at Arawan, I was seated at a table with padded chairs on the opposite side of the restaurant.  this time, I was seated a table with wooden chairs with no padding adjacent the entrance to the toilets.  nextly, the service provided by the staff seemed very aloof and sub-standard.  I would venture to say it was somewhat disrespectful.

if this is the kind of service I can expect from Arawan Bistro because I was dressed in a t-shirt (that I purchased on a day-trip to Los Angeles and the Farmer's Market on Third and Fairfax).  they can expect that I will author very negative comments on social media and conversations with anyone who I talk to about restaurants in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Where do I start? The decor? Gorgeous. Not crazy omg I'm in Vegas. Just so very unexpected for a Thai restaurant in the Commercial Center. Understated. Modern. Great for a date. Not stuffy while still impressive. The customer service? Perfect blend of being on top of things without interruptions. And a very good looking staff, if I may say so.

The food? I can't believe the presentation of the Pad Thai. Long story short, it's wrapped in a cage made of egg. Topped by a perfect pair of incredible prawns. They might be shrimp, but that just doesn't seem good enough to describe these massive and succulent beasts. The noodles are perfectly cooked and seasoned. Sometimes Pad Thai can be too sweet or taste like Vinegar. Not here. Perfectly presented and cooked, this is the new standard in Vegas Pad Thai. 

We also had Spicy Mint beef. Terrible. If terrible means freaking amazing! It was not spicy hot but full of spices and flavor. Our last main course was chicken curry. Again, the layers of flavor were insanely complex while not assaulting the palate. Lol, I seriously just used palate in a sentence. Slow down James Beard. 

For dessert it was suggested we try the special. It was valentine's day. My best friend and I are not remotely a couple. But the lady obviously assumed we were and suggested we share the chocolate cake with strawberry ice cream. We giggled but I was truly impressed that if we had been a couple of guys on a date, we wouldn't have been made to feel uncomfortable. As two gay guys we were treated just like everyone else and actually encouraged to just be ourselves. That's huge. That chocolate cake? It took 10 m minutes. Why? It was freshly made to order and filled with hot strawberry filling. Topped by a heart shaped macaroon that was most definitely not from a box and homemade strawberry ice cream you know from the first bite to the point where you'd lick the plate if you were at home, this dessert indicates a true pastry chef is in the kitchen. In fact, no matter where you decide to eat in the Commercial Center, or Downtown, save some room and eat your dessert here. You won't be disappointed. 

I've been eating Thai food for over thirty years and I'm not a huge fan of Lotus with Komol fairing a little better. This place reminds me of the best places in Little Thailand in Los Angeles. Please eat here. We need this place to thrive!"}
{"text":"This place is perfect if u like authentic Thai food. 
Food is comparable to lotus of Siam if not better and there service is also awesome"}
{"text":"We just ordered from here for the first time today and had it delivered to work. Delivery came faster than promised and the food was packaged so nicely with great presentation. To top it off the food tasted amazing. All 5 of us loved our food and definitely will be ordering again. I had the spicy green beans with shrimp. Yum."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to come here after browsing through yelp looking for a nice resto to eat dinner. We chose this place bc we haven't eaten at a Thai resto in a while and we saw some good reviews on it. This resto is located in the same plaza as Lotus of Siam (see previous review). First off, the interior caught me by surprise. From the outside, it looks like your typical asian resto but inside the setting is very clean and has that \"romantic\" feel with white tablecloths and wine glasses as part of the setting. They also have a dessert bar in the corner where I could visually see the pastry chef making/plating the desserts. I thought that was very original and quite exciting to see as a dessert maker myself. We had the following: 

Fried Tofu $6

Baby Back Ribs Special $19

Thai Spiced Sea Bass $28

Spicy Mint Eggplant $10

Mango Island $12

The Baby Back ribs dish was a special that night. The ribs were slow cooked for 3 hours, grilled, and came with like a hybrid curry-adobo sauce, salad, and fried rice. It was probably one of the best rib dishes I've ever tasted. The sea bass was pretty good. Good portion size fish served on a bed of asparagus with a thai spicy sauce and a side bowl of rice. The eggplant surprisingly tasted good as I thought mint and eggplant would taste weird but it didn't. The mango Island dessert was pretty cool. We got to see Chef Gail prepare it and it was served in a wine glass. It was like a hybrid suman-creme de fruta (filipino reference alert!) with sticky rice, graham crackers, mango ice cream, and passionfruit creme, almonds, and a coconut milk sauce. The only negative I would say about the food was the fried tofu. It was store bought fried tofu so I gave it a pass since it was $6 only. Overall, we were very satisfied and kudos to Chef Jui, Chef Gail, and their staff for their great service and tasty food.  

So how does this resto compare to Lotus of Siam? Lotus of Siam is better for family style dining whereas this place is a good \"date\" resto."}
{"text":"This place is located at the old Commercial Plaza on Sahara. It's surrounded by weird looking businesses around (especially night time) but there are also some great cuisines such as Lotus Siam. 

We went here to lunch. Great lunch special menu. $10 comes with soup, entree and desert. The place had a beautiful and elegant ambiance. It was clean and great service. To start, we got a smal bowl vegetable soup eith a clear broth. Then here come a toothsome Pad See Ew, the main entree. The noodle was perfectly cooked. Unlike some places where they over cooked the noodle or put too much sauce, this one was right on spot. The best part was desert. The lunch came with a yogurt panna cotta. Delicious. Second course of desert, of course we had to try the vanilla bean creme brulee! It was homemade from scratch and you can watch the whole process. Pretty neat and it was so tasty. 

Overall, great lunch spot. This is also a perfect spot for vegetarians, great variety of vegetarians options. For dinner, they have variety of unique seafood and fish dishes. Definitely will come back and try them next time."}
{"text":"Chicken wings to start really good just little over fried, however the flavor of the marinad was worth it. Yellow curry chicken really good. The dessert made the meal. Thin pancake with really good caramelized banana inside. OMG!"}
{"text":"The service, food, and environment is great! I definitely enjoyed my time. I definitely recommend this restaurant to other Thai food lovers. Our server, beer ( I think that's how you spell it ) was uber sweet and helpful!"}
{"text":"This place is off the charts! Came for dinner xmas eve 2016 and the food is phenomenal. From the service to presentation and taste!!!! My god! Superb. Don't change anything! Maybe an bigger venue but everything else is perfection. The meat is juicy, the pad Thai and basil rice"}
{"text":"The staff is very attentive and friendly.  The egg roll was nice and crispy with a sweet sauce.  My husband had the Pad Thai that came wrapped in a cross hatch of fried egg.  It was very pretty.  I had the Pad See Ew.  It needed more sauce and flavor. 
We had the Fried Banana dessert. ..now that was the bomb.  Bananas wrapped in fried eggroll wrappers with green tea ice cream,  Nutella and delicate vibrant flowers.   I would come back again."}
{"text":"We stopped by this afternoon craving authentic Thai food and man did they deliver. We were fans of Lotus of Siam but this place has won us over. Not only was the food outstanding but the service was on point. Out of the two of us I am the spice eater my other half not so much but we've both spent time in Thailand and appreciate real Thai food not the Americanized stuff. We started with a bowl of their Tom Kha and it wasn't overly sweet the chicken was tender and the lemongrass was thinly sliced so you could eat it. I ordered the ribeye spicy basil extra spicy and the broth had so much flavor so did the steak it was flavor then intense heat loved it. He had the curry branzino which was perfectly deboned and very flavorful. We will be coming here over lotus of Siam btw they have really great dessert."}
{"text":"Wow, what a wonderful find this restaurant was, now I need to come back to Vegas just for this place! On a drive through LV from Los Angeles to Jackson Hole we were on the hunt for a good restaurant that was off the strip.  After seeing that Jonathan Gold had reviewed it as one of the best Thai restaurants in the US we had to try it! The meal was everything we expected and more.  The waitress recommended the Arawan Pad Thai, Short Rib Yellow Curry, and creme brûlée which were beautifully presented and even tastier than they looked.  I would without a doubt come back and recommend this place to anyone coming to sin city."}
{"text":"This is great Thai food in a city full of it. I ate there the first night and again my last night in town. We rushed in there at closing the last night, at first they said no but I think they saw how bad I needed my pad Thai fix. The first night was 4 of us, we all ordered different things, all delicious!

{"text":"Very nice Thai food restaurant in Vegas!

Environment: the neighborhood looks not so friendly, walking inside of the Arawan feels like walking into different world. The inner design is a bit luxurious, the staff are friendly. The dessert making table is located on the front of the house, you can watch them make dessert while you eating.

Starter:
Chicken satay: the chicken was tender and the sauces on the side taste amazing. Sweet and sour.

Lunch special:
I really recommend this place for lunch if you are not in hurry. For only $9.99 you can have lots of options and it comes with soup and dessert, you can't beat that.

Drunken Noodles: I love drunken noodle so much so I ordered it here. The drunken noodles in arawan doesn't have dark color, I thought i might need to add some soy sauce, I didn't add it after first bite, because they seasoned it so well.

Dessert:
Cream brûlée: the presentation was so nice. The bowl shape cover was sugar. The Arawan plate was made of chocolate. The cream brûlée tasted creamy and sweet, very satisfying.

Cons:
There was one thing I'm not really satisfying was that they took about 30 minutes to get my food ready. For lunch special, you might need to consider the people who are coming out for lunch hour and need to go back to work.

Overall: I would come back here for Thai food again. I know that they takes so long for my food, but the taste food and friendly staff totally make up for that part."}

Brother of the sun, Arawan!

4.5 Stars...I'm rounding this one up because they take care of niceties better than any Thai Restaurant in Vegas. The best gourmet Thai Food in Las Vegas!

Arawan Thai Bistro and Dessert is in the same center as two of the better Thai Restaurants in Las Vegas (Lotus of Siam & Komol). I wondered if they were good enough to be in the same center as these restaurants or just foolish enough...turns out that they are indeed \"good enough\" and in many ways better. 

Arawan distinguishes itself from the rest of the pack. They are refined and composed in a way that few other Thai Restaurants are while still maintaining integrity for the flavors. Take their Arawan Pad Thai as an example. This is one of the absolute tastiest Pad Thai dishes in town; but at the same time, this dish is taken out of the ordinary with a couple lovely variations. The noodles are encased in a netting of egg and the dish is finished with the placement of two giant grilled prawns on top. You don't have to take my word for it. Arawan has some of the best pictures of Thai food on Yelp...even the cellphone pics taken with horrible lighting manage to look alright. 

We enjoyed all of the following:
Arawan Pad Thai
Ribeye Crispy Basil
Panang Curry Chicken
Silver Noodle Salad
Squid-Ink Drunken Noodles
Soft Shell Crab Pad Pong Karee
Chicken Chow Mein 
Pad See Ew
Fresh Spring Rolls

Hardcore fans of Pad Kee Mao (A.K.A. Drunken Noodles) may not love the Squid-Ink Drunken Noodles. This is a very good dish in its own right, but one of the few that fails to shine through with some of the more traditional flavors of its predecessor. 

In general spice levels are low. If you're a fan of spicy food ask them to crank it up...hot here is a medium at many Thai places and you'll need to ask for Thai Spicy if want more heat than that.

I haven't had the opportunity to try either of their whole fried fish entrees, but they look amazing--firmly established on my list for future visits.  I'd also love to make it in for lunch as their lunch specials look like a great deal, but my schedule does not allow for it.

Desserts! I could have started with this section. If you call yourself \"Arawan Thai Bistro and Dessert\" then you better come through in the dessert section! Chef Gail does. We enjoyed their desserts so much that we came back just to have desserts and a beautiful flower blossom tea. My favorite is the Mango Paradise. I like mango sticky rice in general, and Arawan succeeds in elevating this classic dish while incorporating an incredible traditional technique of incorporating dried butterfly pea into the rice.
Mango Paradise
Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee
Sweet Sensation
Chocolate Pecan Tart

A couple comparisons:
Arawan rightfully bills themselves as gourmet Thai Food, a category reserved in Vegas for Chada Thai & Wine...maybe Nittaya's Secret Kitchen and some Asian fusion spots if you want to stretch things. While Chada has the edge in ambiance and a spectacular wine program, Arawan's dishes are more polished, more collected and plated better than both Chada and Nittaya's.

Please understand that this is not the same food you would find in a hole in the wall restaurant in Thailand. If you are looking for what some would call authentic (what does that even mean anymore?) Thai food then go next door to Komol...or make the drive to Pan Asia or Thai Food To Go. But if you're simply looking for incredible food then make your way to Arawan."}
{"text":"I decided to stop here for a bite to eat before heading off to the Green Door which is conveniently located in the same plaza. The interior does not match the surrounding sketchy neighborhood. It's actually inviting & cozy. This place would make a perfect date night spot with soft elevator music playing in the background. I thought it was super quiet here so don't bring your loud friends here. 

They give you complimentary wonton crisps with a sweet and sour dipping sauce. The spice levels are mild, medium, or spicy. We went with the medium. My friends and I ordered the lemongrass chicken wings in Tom Yum and the egg papaya salad for appetizers. The flavors were subtle with the wings. I would have liked the lemongrass and the Tom Yum to stand out more. The papaya salad was alright. I usually don't order papaya salad though.

I ordered the short rib yellow curry with rice. I really enjoyed my entree. It was mouthwatering, delicious! The tender pieces of the short rib fell off the bone and the curry was seasoned well. My friend ordered the lemongrass fried catfish. Catfish is one of my least favorite fishes but I liked their version of it. My other friend ordered the squid ink drunken noodles with seafood. I thought it was OK. The portion sizes are just right but truth be told, I could have had another piece of that delectable short rib!

For desserts, we ordered the vanilla bean creme brulee which came with gold flakes, a sugar dome, strawberries, blueberries, and chocolate & the Sweet Sensation which is sweet Thai banana pancakes with Thai tea ice cream, strawberries, Oreo crumbles, condensed milk, and chocolate. Wow, talk about a fancy presentation! Gotta love desserts that look pretty and tastes delicious!

The service was professional and attentive. They give you a carafe of strawberry mint infused water. They do not have alcohol. I rarely drink with Thai food so I didn't even notice until my friend had mentioned it. The spice levels are not your typical Thai spicy levels. Our medium spicy was more of a mild spicy so it's safe to bring your white friends here.

They have a second room with Zashiki style seating (where you take off your shoes and sit on a mat and a low table). I'm guessing this used to be a Japanese restaurant. I'm not sure if they will use it or not. Maybe when it gets more popular, they will. 

Oh BTW, I was kidding about heading off to the Green Door. I just mentioned it so locals and you pervs will know how to find this place. :)"}
{"text":"This place is definitely a place I will come back to when I'm in Vegas again. 
It's such a clean and inviting atmosphere. They have great lunch specials that include dessert. 
The food is on point and the service is excellent."}
{"text":"Quality Thai food with an awesome presentation. Great place to come with either friends or family. Absolutely love the sauce that comes with the whole fried fish."}
{"text":"Really good service and food too! Clean and new decor so it's a great off the strip place to go to if you have some out of town guests."}
{"text":"Our new favorite Thai Food Bistro. Outstanding food; prompted and personal service and unbelievable desserts. Tanya and Gail made us feel like family and went out of their way to ensure we had the perfect meal and a wonderful time."}
{"text":"What can I say, this place was awesome. From the Tea (best Jasmine Pearl Tea I've ever had) to the Beef Panang to their amazing deserts, I very much enjoyed this place. Totally unexpected.

We got here kinda by accident, we where trying to go to another thai restaurant but the wait was too long, we pulled Yelp out and took a Lyft over. As we approached I was a little worried because of the location, a sketchy looking strip mall. BUT do not let the location deter you. This place is amazing. When in Vegas and hankering for some Thai, this is the place to go.

Thanks for the awesome food."}
{"text":"It's Father's Day, we happen to be in Las Vegas. I'm dad so I get to pick my cuisine, Thai, of course. But where to go? After an Internet search, I  Arawan Thai Bistro & Dessert. After finding the place in what might have been a strip mall (not to be confused with a LV stripper), I was a little bit apprehensive given the very unassuming store front. We entered anyway and found a most excellent ambiance inside, and a very friendly waitstaff. We had some typical appetizers, chicken satay and spring rolls. The chicken satay was chicken satay. I think it is difficult to mess up chicken satay. It is like ordering a fried egg for breakfast. But the spring roll, called an Arawan fresh roll was just about the best I have had. The greens were so fresh, they were crisp; a most excellent start to what continued to build. 
   For dinner we had beef pad see ew, squid-ink drunken noodles, Thai-spiced sea bass and duck red curry, all excellent. And the presentation was so excellent my wife did not want to disturb it with her fork.
   But then dessert!? Who would have thought such exquisite dessert could be found in a place like this? We ended with a Mango Island, a Coconut Treasure, a Sweet Sensation and the Father's Day Special. Once again, the presentation was superb, even artistic.
   A most excellent find!"}
{"text":"We really love this place. Maybe The music is playing softly and feel comfortable to dining. 

Excellent Service. The waiters and waitresses were so attentive. They went to ask us how is the food going. They seemed like knowing what we want by take a look our actions while dining, when they brought the foods after they put the dishes down. They would ask you, would you like chopsticks, hot sauce or anything else. 

Then the food comes, we ordered Kho Kha Moo and Kuai Jub. It's a little bit confuse right ? I will explain them, Kho Kha Moo is the Thai Original food. It is stew pig leg until soften comes with side steamed Chinese Broccoli and Boiled Egg. Next is Kuai Jub , it kinds of noodle soup with the Thai spices marinated entrails of pig, Fried Tofu, Crispy pork, and Boiled Egg. 

So that was a perfect dining experience for us. We have never been place like this before. By the way it was under 25$ of the whole bill. Thank you for reading our review. \"Strongly recommend this place\"."}
{"text":"I come here every time I visit Vegas, their service is phenomenal and food is delicious. 

I was going to visit Lotus of Siam, but it was packed and they weren't very friendly when busy. After reading reviews on Arawan I decided to give it a try and has to stop by ever since. 

I've ordered the curry short rib, squid ink noodle, green curry scallop and calamari. Dessert I ordered the creme brûlée and the vanilla ice cream with espresso shot(forgot the name). 

They gave us complementary chips and dip. It was sweet, tangy and mild spicy. Calamari was soft and lightly battered with a kick of spice. 

Short ribs were very tender and flavorful, sauce was a perfect consistently, not too runny or thick. 

Squid ink noodles had a nice chew to the noodles, good amount of seafood and not too salty. 

Green curry scallops were perfectly cooked, and I really like the strong Thai spices. I had a glass of sauvignon blanc (forgot the name) and it worked really well with the scallops. 

Creme brûlée was very pretty, the sugar net shell was a little hard to eat, but the rest was very rich and a perfect portion. 

Vanilla bean ice cream with espresso shot could of made the cut of the ice cream was creamier, it tasted like it sat in the fridge for a period of time... biscotti was just ok. Taste overall was 4/5

I have to really talk about the service. They are so humble, and I made a call to reserve a table and they were really kind and asked if it was for a special occasion like birthday or anniversary. They thanked me for coming back every time and the smile and the way they serve is above and beyond. I will be coming back AGAIN! AND they have more desserts now because they have a new person creating new dessert. When receiving the desserts he/she would explain what's in front of you. Arawan haven't disappointed me."}
{"text":"We are aficionados of Lotus across the street, as in, we go every time we are in Vegas, sometimes more than once. I gave Lotus a 5 star as well. Arawan has been open about 8 months. Since Lotus was closed yesterday at 4, we came here. It's fantastic!  We had the Tom Kha, which frankly, was better than at Lotus, with the inclusion of cabbage and just had a lovely broth.

My other half had Pad Thai with the giant shrimp with the legs on them still and their little bodies intact, which isn't my thing, but he assured me it was tasty. The rest of the dish was great.  I had the yellow curry.  It was good. I wouldn't call it spectacular, but I was already full from everything else.   

Service excellent.   The only recommendation I would give to the restaurant owner is.... the lighting is TERRIBLE!  Overhead lights are the worst lights you can possibly have. Everyone looks bad, with shadows on their face. Even my other half agreed and he would rarely even notice. The ceiling can lights are very high up, and basically your dining partner looks like they are being interrogated at a crime lab. \"where were you on the night of January 10th?\" sort of thing.  Turn off those terrible lights and put candles on the table. That's all you need. Ambiance!

I would highly recommend this for great Thai food."}
{"text":"The outside of this restaurant does absolutely no justice to how amazing the food is.  They have done a great job decorating and making the inside inviting and comfortable.  We tried several different dishes and they were all very good.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  Try and it for lunch."}
{"text":"I frequently pick up takeout from this place and I'm usually happy with the food and service. Last night (01/04/17) at 7:20 I arrived to get my food order, 2 entrees and 2 desserts totaling ~$75. The young waitress who took care of me was sweet over the phone and when I arrived to pick up my food. There was an older Asian waitress (maybe in her 40s, slightly bigger woman) there who took care of my check. I was here for about 20 mins, and I'm not sure why but I had to interact with this woman more than the waitress who greeted us and took my order over phone. The older woman was rude when I needed to enter my pin for payment, which by the way, I have never been asked to do before at a restaurant so I had to walk to the busy back area to do it instead of signing the little slip. Then, I still for some reason had to sign the little slip. When she handed me my receipt to sign she didn't look at me but shoved the tray at me as if she wanted me out of her face..wtf?? For as much as I pay here, good customer service and courtesy should be expected. Idk if it's because I'm young/brown/whatever, but I have family members who are/were servers and I tip well because of it. I probably won't come here in the future as there are other good Thai places in town where I won't be treated as a second rate customer. BTW, the actual food was good, although not great."}
{"text":"What a great surprise in an area that at face value offers very little in regards to great Thai cuisine.  I recently discovered this venue through a co-worker during our monthly get together for lunch.  I was pleasingly surprised by their ambience.  More overs, their lunch menu though small offers soup AND dessert as part of the meal.  Also, the meal itself (in my case their chicken patai) was both generous and delicious.  Service was very personable and quick.  I look forward to monthly get together in a few days to enjoy another serving."}
{"text":"Great food & excellent service! I own a tattoo shop around the corner & I ordered take out the other day. While I waited for my order to be prepared Art brought me a ice cold glass of strawberry water in a stemless wine glass. A small gesture but that showed me that they knew how to treat customers. Highly recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"To open a Thai restaurant in the same parking lot in what many consider to be the best Thai restaurant in the US (L o S) - you better be good. Arawan is great!

Gourmet Thai food is a fitting description. Not at all typical Thai take-out or dine in.  Beautifully presented and full of flavor. The beef short rib in yellow curry is delicious. The fried lemongrass catfish is crazy good (and big).  Deserts are sensibly sized and great. Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"What an amazing spot! Delicious food, clean cozy atmosphere and superb service. Best Thai restaurant in the area - highly recommend!"}
{"text":"The food here is sooooooooooooo amazing!!  My favorite is the short ribs with yellow curry, DELICIOUS!!!"}
{"text":"The location is not attractive. But they have very good food and yummy desserts. The price is much lower than the strip area."}
{"text":"This restaurant reminded me very much of my fine dining experience in Chiang Mai, Thailand. The decor, the music, and the food were comparable. The only thing that was lacking considerably was the service and attentiveness of the servers or lack thereof. 

I had a reservation booked and when I walked in, I waited 7 minutes to be seated. There were plenty of open tables however the servers were busy serving tables. One server acknowledged that she saw me, but didn't care too much to seat me as she grabbed the water jug to refill water cups instead. Considering how upscale this Thai restaurant is compared to other Thai restaurants in Vegas, one would assume there would be a hostess available. Nope, because all three times I've visited, I spent at least 5-10 minutes waiting by the door as the available tables were screaming for me.

Aside from the subpar service, the food was amazing! The Pad Thai was exquisite and tasty. The noodles were sweet and the chef was very generous with the chicken. The Pad Thai was plated beautifully in a cross cross egg pouch and garnished with what looked like sweet potato chips. The dish itself was rather pricey at $18, but that didn't keep me away from coming back again for the Pad Thai. It is also offered as a lunch special entree. The lunch special costs $9.99 and comes with soup and dessert. Take out lunch specials do not come with soup.

The Tom Yum soup with shrimp was another favorite of mine. It had the perfect amount of sweet and sour flavors. My favorite part of the coup was actually the mushrooms. I'm usually not a huge fan of mushrooms, but I was definitely one with this dish. Definitely coming back for this again!

The Thai iced tea was nothing special. I would skip this next time. It tasted like creamer and didn't have too much tea flavor. The person who made the Thai iced tea was a little heavy handed with the ice--my cup was more than 3/4 full!

The restaurant is more upscale than other Thai restaurants you would normally find in Vegas so be prepared for higher prices! This spot would also be perfect for a date with that special someone!"}
{"text":"I always go there after a really bad experience on lotus of Siam I found this place and I do not regret it! The food is way way better then lotus of Siam and way better pretty environment!! Stuff is super helpful with the menu and very welcoming !! Food is delicious and now everyone I know goes there !!"}
{"text":"We really needed a relaxing early dinner after a long day and Arawan filled the bill.
We ordered the fresh spring rolls... the sauce was amazing!
For entrees we had the short rib yellow curry, the rib eye and the pad thai.
We only ordered the pad thai because fellow yelpers recommended it. However, that is the one dish that we could have passed on. It has a beautiful presentation, but at the end of the day, it's just ordinary, gummy pad thai.
The short rib and the rib eye was so amazing, however, that we're still craving more!
My dining companion ordered the mango island for dessert and loved it.
We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I get it, I really do.  A lot of people really like Thai food that isn't very spicy, or isn't overly herbed, or, well, isn't Thai food.  If that describes your Western palate, then this new Thai restaurant is definitely worth a visit.  The inside decor is beautiful and makes you feel like you're eating at a fine dining restaurant (and indeed you are), with light jazz music and fancy seating.  It's small, intimate, the wait staff is professional, and a great place for a date night.  

I should have known where this restaurant's style was going to go when I noticed the lack of Thai spice racks throughout the small space, and the overly simplified, one-page menu.  Ah yes, it's one of \"those\" Thai restaurants!  

I ordered the Tom Kha Kai, small bowl at $6, and the beef short rib yellow curry at $15.  The beef short rib curry was a cheaper item on the menu, and seemed like a safe and popular dish to try.  As per heat warnings in at least one review, I ordered everything at a \"medium\".  Ha!

The Tom Kha was fairly well done, but in the end rather bland.  Very light coconut and lime, with little in the way of spices.  Cherry tomatoes were a nice touch.  The chunks of chicken breast were nice and tender.  My curry came out before I got even half way through it though, and I didn't feel inclined to finish it.  Just a bit boring for my taste.

The curry was along the same lines.  I always find it funny when Thai servers put the main course in front of you, an empty plate behind that, and a small bowl of rice off to the side somewhere.  I call it, \"I give up, you figure it out, white guy.\"  Service always gets a little more attentive when I rearrange everything, put the rice on my plate, scoop the main course onto the rice, and ask for a spoon.  \"Oh, this white guy knows how to eat Thai food!\" becomes the server's new mantra.

The curry was pretty decent.  It had a sort of Indian or perhaps Malaysian style to it as far as the herbs.  Definitely different than authentic Thai curry (Bangcock or otherwise), unless maybe it's a Lao style.  In any case, it wasn't spicy hot at all (\"medium\" = \"I am curious, but please don't hurt me!\").  The flavor, other than those \"Indian\" herbs, was a little bit bland.  The beef short rib was the saving grace of the entire meal though.  It was nothing short of delightful.  It was served with a big chunk of flesh upon a bone with yet more flesh to be scraped, chewed, clawed, etc.  Lots of fat, tender and juicy.  This was worth the price point for sure.  I just wished the curry itself was a little better to go with it.  

I understand the fuss and great reviews.  This is a nice, comfortable, upscale-feeling restaurant with a great, friendly staff.  The food is upscale for sure.  Don't make any mistake though, this isn't close to being authentic even in an Americanized Thai restaurant kind of way.  The flavors aren't going to challenge your palate, but if you are used to real Thai food they aren't going to interest you either.  This one is making my \"Overrated\" and \"Gringos\" Thai lists."}
{"text":"Love the food but it's all about the desert. Plenty of parking and close to uber and lyft pickup spot"}
{"text":"Impressive from the beginning. We were a huge party of 14 and we called twice to change our reservation time and they were very accommodating. Even though it's in a run down complex and looks not-so-great from the outside, once you enter, it's a completely different experience. Very nicely decorated, the ambience is almost romantic and way better than even Lotus of Siam, whose food we loved! :) Our table was ready when we arrived. While we ordered we were served complimentary fried wantons with the sweet and spicy sauce, which was good. A few of us had to take a flight back soon, and they were very accommodating in getting their food orders in and out first. We ordered a lot of items (Chicken Satay, Panang Curry Chicken, Red Curry Chicken, Veg and Chicken Pad Thais) and all of them were very good. The only items that I will not order again are the Green Curry Scallops. They were definitely not fresh and smelled fishy and chewy, though the gravy was very yummy.  I would also critique the amount of white rice (paid) served which is very less. The desserts are a must-have. We tried the Mango Sticky Rice, The Banana Puffs and the Affogato. All were really really good. All-in-all, a great experience!"}
{"text":"This is new best Thai place in town... almost  perfect  in every sense. Family run business ... great atention has been paid to  menu, choosing the right cutlery and dishes. Very impressive. Nice decor too...
The food was excellent. We ordered the beef panang and chicken yellow curry. Excellent.  Meat was soft, cooked very well and curry flavor to die for. The rice was  extremely  moist which is what I liked the best.

If you get a chance say Hi to their pastry chef Gail. The coconut icecream is the best one I have had so far. 

I am definitely  going back to try their other dishes. A new jewel in the crown!"}
{"text":"Great experience. The decor is nice and contemporary with comfortable seating. We ordered Thai calamari, seabass, pad Thai and seafood tom yum soup. Everything was delicious. The dishes have nice presentation as well. They have a great dessert menu but we were too full to order anything. Service was also very good, tentative and friendly. Will come back for more!"}
{"text":"This restaurant deserves 7stars for its food,  cleanliness,  excellent customer service,  and presentation.   The owner greets you upon entering,  and ensures that you are comfortable.   Lotus of Siam was closed,  so we saw this place in the same strip center.   I recommend the fresh spring rolls!"}
{"text":"OMGosh. Fabulous food. Probably the. Best Thai food I have eaten. 
Desserts look fabulous. Tried chocolate mousse cake. Fabulous."}
{"text":"This place LOOKS the part but lacks in taste

We ordered the Scallop Curry, the Steak Salad, and a cup of Tomka Soup.

The scallops were rubbery and tough.

The \"salad\" was hardly a salad with half a head of ICEBERG lettuce. I could not believe it was $18 for this salad.

The soup was not bad but not good.

The service was inattentive. The food took forever and there was no follow up with how our food was tasting.

We came here because Lotus of Siam had a long wait. This place obviously rides off the leftover business from there.

My recommendation is just stay there and wait for good food. 

One star for just flat out ripping people off and not providing any quality food whatsoever"}
{"text":"Decided to come and try this place for the first. Place is clean and the service is great! Very prompted!

dishes ordered
Tofu pad thai
Chicken green curry
Lemongrass catfish

All dishes were delicious!  The catfish was really tasty, its deep fried and topped off with cashews and ginger and also a dipping sauce as well! The fish was very fresh!!

Would definitely come back and try other dishes they have as well!"}
{"text":"I am always trying to get my husband to eat thai food, and as my last stop in Vegas- this was the perfect choice. Intimate and tucked away in a shopping center, the food is none the less beautifully put together, with extreme thought and care not only to the taste, but also to the plating. 

My cucumber salad was tangy and fresh, my yellow curry warm and savory. I had a coconut dessert that hit just the right mark. My husband was so so in love he told me \"If they ever decide to open a branch in austin, I will invest in it!\"

Thanks for the wonderful dining experience Arawan!"}
{"text":"So I've been here several times this week and a couple times last week. I know I know... That's alot right? But seriously this is my FAVORITE Thai restaurant. I LOVE their Arawan signature pad thai, it's super delicious and I order it all the time. Their service is great and their food is phenominal. The pricing is a bit above average, but you're paying for the quality of your food. 

I highly recommend this place to everyone! It doesn't look like much outside, but inside is really nice.  I'm not one to order alot of dessert either but theirs is really good, especially the presentation. Go on guys, try this place out! I'm planning on hosting a small get together for my birthday here too :)"}
{"text":"I aboslutely love this place! My new favorite to go to place!!
The atmosphere is something different from what we expect. Super modern and chic restaurant. I want to come here for my birthday and special occasions from now on!

We had the duck pad thai and pagdan curry. Which both were to die for!! 

For dessert, please try the Mango Paradise. It's a modern twist to thw traditional mango sticky rice!"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant in a sketchy(?) area. The server's super nice and once you go inside the restaurant is very nice looking. The food was meh imo, but my bf liked it (he's the pickier one in terms of food tho). They seemed to have lunch special for $10 which gives soup, entree and dessert which is a really good deal."}
{"text":"Wow!! I was searching for a good Thai Restaurant and decided to give this place a a shot, the food was amazing the service was extremely good are waiter was awesome best service I got at a restaurant in a long time. I would recommend getting the pad Thai and yellow curry. If you want a great meal and outstanding service you must come here. I will definitely tell all my family and friends that come to Vegas to come here."}
{"text":"Dined here about a week ago and was amazed. Such a great little spot in that area. Great service and wonderful atmosphere. We had the short rib curry and the sea bass. 

The short rib curry was nothing short of amazing. The meat almost melted in my mouth and was very well seasoned. The Sea bass was just as good, nice and light. Definitely coming back here to try some of the other menu items 

PS. You have to save room for dessert. Trust me"}
{"text":"Best Thai I have ever eaten.  Huge selection of loose tea that was sensational. Great ambience"}
{"text":"Definitely an extra special experience.... great food, great service, wonderful food presentation. You truly are a gem in Vegas that needs to be in the spotlight. We'll be visiting every time we're in LV."}
{"text":"Great Thai restaurant off the strip.  The locals go to this place because of the great prices and the freshness of the food.

The dessert are the best as well!  Fresh mango and sherbet flavors.

If you are on a hotel on the trip definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"You will forget about Lotus Of Siam !! They have the best desserts and the best and well prepared food. The staff is great and super friendly.  The prime rib in yellow curry is awesome.  I had the Best Dessert of my life.  Its called the Mango passion Island and it is Aaaamazing. This dessert tops my list and Words can't describe or do justice to this particular dessert."}
{"text":"AHHH-MAZING! From the ambience and decor to the food and the staff. Everything was literally perfect. I've been trying to find the best Thai food in Las Vegas for quite a while and I think I might have just found it. 
My friend requested this place because she said it was sooo good. I was down for something new so we went. Honestly, when I first entered the plaza, I was skeptical because it was located in a dark and sketchy place. I didn't want to get robbed! I also noticed it was the same plaza as the famous Lotus of Siam. Anyways, we requested a reservation for a party of four like 15 minutes before we arrived and they accommodated for it. When we entered I was already freezing my butt off from the cold and they quickly changed our table farther away from the entrance. So considerate.  
It is a very small restaurant that probably seats up to 40ish people. The decor was modern, simple and delicate. They even had soothing ambient music playing. The staff was seriously so incredibly nice and caring. Overall it has an amazing ambience. 
We ordered calamari and chicken satay bites for our appetizers. Ugh so good. I want some more. The calamari was so crispy and it was seasoned with hot peppers and salt like your traditional salt and pepper wings from a legit Chinese restaurant. It brought back some good memories. And the chicken satay bites were cooked perfectly and the sauce was delicious. 
For our entrees we ordered the Arawan pad thai, pork pad see ew and orange chicken. I seriously fell in love with the pad Thai. It was so perfect and my spice level was on point.  not too spicy but just a kick. The presentation was so cool. They cover the pad Thai in an fried egg lattice. How cool is that!  I didn't try any of the other entrees but everyone said they loved their dish. We all finished our plates and it definitely filled up up. 
Even though I was stuffed I had to order dessert. Duh. There's always room for that. We ordered the creme brûlée and the mango island. The presentation again wowed us. It was almost too beautiful to eat. The creme brûlée was also covered in a lattice but in sugar form. The dish was so delicate and delightful. As for the mango island it was a twist on the traditional mango and sticky rice. It was so good. It had mangos made into a few ways, it's purest form, gelato, and a sauce.   It was arranged so that you can get a little bite of everything. It was heaven!  
I definitely recommend this place and I already want to go back. Try everything. Literally I could die right now from how good it is. 
Oh! And \"go to the bathroom\" as you walk to the bathroom they have a private little dining area that resembles a Japanese tea house! So cool!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Very clean. We had Tom yum soup,scallops, sea bass, spring rolls. 
Sea bass was just fair out of the rest. We saw a table order catfish which
Looked like a better choice. This place defiantly competes with lotus which is in the same complex."}
{"text":"I went with a friend and we tried 4 dishes (planning to take leftovers) during their lunch special. We got a lot included in our meal including our main dish with a soup starter, and 2 desserts. Everything tasted great! Well seasoned, great flavor. The curry was velvety and had perfectly cooked vegetables. I really liked the portion sizes I got. Staff was attentive. Good experience overall."}
{"text":"This place is a diamond in a rough. We were visiting Las Vegas and were looking for a good Thai food. From Yelp review, we went there but were a bit scared about the location. The food and desserts were well worth it! We highly recommend Grilled rib-eye steak salad with rice powder, fish cake, mango with sticky rice, and crispy pancake with Thai ice tea cream. **My descriptions aren't the actual names of the food at this place.** You cannot skip desserts!!"}
{"text":"We went here on a recommendation and we weren't disappointed. Food was amazing. The desserts were delicious. The atmosphere was nice, contemporary, and relaxed. They don't split checks, which can be a bit of a hassle when you are on business travel and need to expense your meals. It is off the strip, but well worth the trip."}
{"text":"Was suggested to try Lotus of Siam by a friend but it was way too crowded and I came with a party of 8. We were really craving Thai so we decided to give this place a try. The portions were a bit on the small side, but the food presentation was beautiful and the taste was delicious! We ordered the Thai BBQ chicken, pad Thai, chicken satay, panang curry, and mixed vegetables. Despite the serving size, we were all satisfied. The dessert we tried was also all delicious (creme brulee, chocolate mousse cake, and coconut treasure). Service was on point and we even had a friendly chat with the owner. Will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Amazing food.  The soups were delicious.  The service was exceptional. Great prices and super accommodating for kids!"}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've ever had, and I'm familiar with fine Thai dining. Also best food we've had in Vegas, and we even went to the legendary Caesar's buffet. This place is better. Every dish was fabulous, the platings were beyond beautiful. And, unlike most Vegas restaurants, it was worth every reasonable penny. Also our family eats gluten free and we were able to enjoy several items. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I was actually trying to go to the other Thai restaurant in the same area, but unfortunately there was an hour wait for it. My date and I reviewed Yelp and came across arawan, which was right across from the restaurant. We stepped inside and everything looked so clean and had very nice lighting. As we were seated, the waitress served us a glass of ice water with a slice of strawberry inside. Very refreshing. Overall, the food is amazing and the environment was perfect!"}
{"text":"This place has some of the best, if not THE BEST Thai food in Las Vegas. It also has some great lunch specials. Currently, you can get typical Thai entrees for lunch such as Drunken Noodle and Pad Thai for $9.95 which makes this place an ideal lunch spot that is really good but wont break the bank. Their food has great presentation, is very flavorful and the staff is also very friendly. You can also taste the quality of their meats. A beef drunken noodle comes with a plethora of thick slices of beef that are very tender and the portion of noodles will make you very full! I highly recommend this place! 

For all of you asking yourself how this place compares with the epic and well-known Lotus of Siam, I would say that Lotus is just a bit better in terms of food flavor and presentation, but Lotus is also a little pricier than this place. To put it frankly, I go to Lotus of Siam maybe once or twice every 3 or 4 months. I've been to Arawan 3 times this month! Happy eating!"}
{"text":"Okay I didn't think any other place could compare to Lotus of Siam but Arawan Thai Bistro is up there. For one, there was no huge line, you can make reservations and the waiters and waitresses are always available. Now on to the food. 

To start our foodie night we ordered the Arawan fresh rolls which were just like any fresh rolls from any Thai restaurant but their homemade chili sauce was on point. Also they gave us complementary chicken wings. YAY for us! 

Next we ordered the short rib yellow curry, Arawan pad Thai and crispy pork with veggies. 

Short Rib Yellow Curry- this dish was amazing.!! The short rib was soo tender and juicy. It fell right off the bone and the yellow curry paired perfectly for an amazing dish. I compare it to Lotus of Siams duck curry. 

Arawan Pad Thai- this dish came with two huge prawns on top the mound of pad thai noodles. You can also choose the spiciness of this dish and we opt for mild. The noodles were perfectly cooked and the prawns were juicy. 

Crispy Pork with veggies- I'm not sure if this is the correct name of the dish but I always order this dish at all Thai restaurants. It's such a simple dish but whats different for me is the sauce they use. There sauce was great! The crispy pork wasn't over done and too crispy, it was just right. The sauce went well on top the white rice. 

In conclusion I believe this place will eventually have a long line just like Lotus once more people come here. This is a must try Thai place."}
{"text":"Ordered take out, their food is bomb. The best pad see ew ever per bf and their curry are bomb too. They also used fried tofu for the tofu entrees
It also look like a good spot for a date night"}
{"text":"Yup. Still amazing. I'm so happy stick e rice reopened. Tell all your friends! The decor is beautiful, the food still amazing, do not let this gem close again. The pad see ew is on point. Yum."}
{"text":"What a hidden gem!
And what amazing value!

We initially wanted to go to Lotus of Siam, but they were closed due to water damage. This place is a short walk away. *Don't be deterred by the outside appearance! The interior is gorgeous and clean!

Their lunch special is $9.95 and you get the soup of the day (Thursday is chicken sour), a LARGE entree, and a dessert. 

The food itself is delicious. They do a really great job with presentation and their flavors blend well together on each plate. 

Worth a try! So happy we accidentally came across this place, because we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Unbelievable food.  The Curry's are AWESOME!  Great service from Heather and chic atmosphere.  Don't let the exterior fool you."}
{"text":"The food was great. I ordered the Cashew Chicken, a staple at Thai restaurants, and it was one of the best I've had throughout the years.

What really distinguishes this place though is the service. The staff is extremely nice and attentive. Beyond what you'd expect."}
{"text":"So amazing! I went for the lunch special with my fiance and we both loved it! The atmosphere is wonderful and the food is great. Lunch specials come with soup and a dessert. We got the yellow curry (it was good, but not amazing) and the orange chicken which was phenomenal. For dessert we had raspberry tarts. I'm more of a chocolate person but they were amazing!! HIGHLY RECOMMEND!! We will definitely come back next time we're in Becca's Vegas."}
{"text":"Good food 
Good service
Went there for lunch and had the pad see ew and drunken noodle. It comes with chocolate mousse dessert.
Taste was not bad at all, definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"Wow. Just......wow!

We actually had never heard of this place until last week when we passed it while leaving Lotus of Siam. Looked up the reviews on Yelp! and decided that we had to try this place soon...and what a great decision that ended up being!

Ordered-
- Thai Lemongrass Chicken Wings ($8)
- Chicken Pad See Ew ($12)
- Thai BBQ Chicken ($12)
- Tom Yum Goong Nam Khon ($7)

Thai Lemongrass Chicken Wings (3.5/5) Very unique tasting wings. Meat was extremely juicy and tender and took zero effort to pull from the bone! Even though it indicates Lemongrass in the title, the flavor reminded me more of the flavor of the tom yum. Very good wings!

Chicken Pad See Ew (5/5) Incredibly tasty and flavorful chicken pad see ew. The chicken was cooked to perfection! I thought Lotus had a mighty fine version of this dish, but Arawans was flawless! Perfect blend of sweet and salty!

Thai BBQ Chicken (5/5) Very generous portion of BBQ chicken! Also cooked superbly, the meat was so tender and juicy as well! 

Tom Yum Goong Nam Khon (5/5) Wow. Best Tom Yum I have ever.had.in.my.life! I am in love! Seriously. The soup base for the tom yum is about as authentic as you are going to find outside of Thailand itself! The spice level was on point and there were plenty of large shrimp within the soup. Sheer gratification!

Service (10/5) Easily some of the best service I have ever experienced at a restaurant of any kind in my life! Our server, Tanya, was so friendly and sweet and personable! We actually were waited on by at least 4 different employees at some point and all were incredible! Our drinks never reached even the halfway point before being refilled! 

What I find most impressive about all of this is the fact that they use NO MSG in any of their food! To have this kind of flavor in Asian food with zero MSG really speaks to the skill and expertise of the cooks here! 

- Side note: I love how the glasses of ice water come with a 1/2 strawberry! It is the unique little details that stand out in Arawans presentation!

This was a fantastic dining experience and we are already planning a return visit to try other menu items!I can't even begin to recommend this place highly enough!

5 stars.

Woohoo! As good as it gets!"}
{"text":"Food was excellent! The restaurant decor and environment was super friendly! I would say that I did feel a little rushed by my server even though they weren't particularly busy. Otherwise, it was an enjoyable experience!"}
{"text":"I have been  four + times and never disappointed with food and desert. The spicy mint eggplant is amazing and a must try . If you are in Las Vegas looking for THE place to eat Thai you have to visit ."}
{"text":"If I could give 6 stars I would. By far the best Thai I have ever had... amazing staff. Phenomenal dessert"}

{"text":"This review is for lunch at Arawan....hands down, my favorite Thai \"Lunch Special\" experience.

I have been a huge fan of Arawan Thai Bistro and Dessert for some time now, but after enjoying their lunch specials with one of my absolute favorite people in the world, I sat myself down to write this well deserving review.

$9.95 gets you 
      Soup
      Salad
      Entree
      Dessert 
      Fruit infused water with ice

We ordered Yellow Curry and Pad See Ew with Chicken. The soup of the day was egg drop soup with thin crackers...it was well balanced in flavor and lacked any of the raw after taste that often comes with egg drop soup. The salad was made with mixed spring vegetables and a light ginger dressing. The Yellow Curry is served with steamed white rice--it has potatoes and carrots that my lunch date loves. The Pad See Ew is made with stir fried flat rice noodle, Chinese broccoli, and egg...and to top it off, they served us both a small strawberry pie...almost like puff pastry. I routinely enjoy a bite of a shared dessert after dinner at Arawan, but these were the perfect size, with just enough sweetness to finish our meal perfectly.

Service is always wonderful. For example, our water was filled as often as needed, without asking, and the green tea we ordered came dressed in style with a timer, honey, and slices of lemon.

Thank you chefs and staff at Arawan for having such a elegant service and satisfying lunch meal for $9.95...Vegas has lots of great options for all types of cuisines, at a variety of price ranges, but Arawan's lunch stands out for us both!

Arawan is also a favorite option for dinner. They offer traditional Thai dishes as well as refined Arawan Special dishes that are more sophisticated than any other Thai options in town.

{"text":"Love this place. Small and intimate with good service. I'm even going here tonight for my birthday"}
{"text":"As a writer and an avid reader, one thing I have learned to do is not judge a book by its cover. Same is true, it seems, for restaurants. First, DO NOT judge this fantastic restaurant by its location. It is in the Commercial Center on Sahara. Also, do not judge the restaurant by its front as it looks a little worn out (maybe in keeping with the Commercial Center). Once I stepped into this restaurant, I was shocked by clean, almost crisp, and trendy look. It was 6 p.m. and the restaurant wasn't yet busy. Still they had my table ready (reserved with my name on it) and I was seated immediately even though I was an hour early for our reservation.

The front of the menu had house specialties and the back were the more traditional Thai dishes. We started with the Arawan Fresh Roll which was shrimps, fresh cucumber, crunchy carrots, bean sprouts, aromatic mint leaves, and crisp lettuce wrapped with moist rice paper - served with homemade semi-sweet chili sauce. It was delicious as expected but I was really surprised at how fresh and crisp the vegetables were.

Next we had the Yellow Curry Short Ribs. (Beef short ribs meat simmered in a hearty yellow curry coconut milk broth, with roasted red potatoes, carrots and onions). It was just crazy good with mild yellow curry made creamy by the coconut milk broth. We paired that with the Pineapple Fried Rice which contained  shrimp and chicken, egg, cashew nut, pineapple and onion. The sweetness of the fried rice was a great pairing for the curry.

We finished the meal by not sharing dessert. Kathy had the Mango Island dessert which was mango gelato, creamy sweet sticky rice, mango passion fruit cremeux, crispy waffle, whipped cream, crunch almond, mango sauce, and creamy coconut sauce. I had the Sweet Sensation which was a Thai pancake with sweetened condensed milk and sugar, Thai tea ice cream, brulee banana, fresh strawberries, and oreo crumb. I was amazed at how much the ice cream actually did taste like a Thai Tea which I love.

The food and service were well beyond any expectations I may have had. They have an inventive menu and I can hardly wait to go back and try more of the house specialties and some of the other desserts as well. By the way, they have an in-house pastry chef that makes the desserts to order.

This is a place that should be high on the list of anyone who enjoys GOOD Thai food served in a manner more found in high end, expensive restaurants."}
{"text":"Great restaurant with delicious food. Good vegan options available. Impressive ambience and service. Overall great place! Definitely coming back :)"}
{"text":"I had a doctors appointment nearby and I was starving by the time I got out of it.  I yelped to see what was closeby and this place popped up and I had to read the reviews and look at the photos since this place had 5 stars.  It's rare seeing a place with so many reviews have 5 stars so naturally I had to check it out.

Thanks to Yelpers, I was able to see what they had for lunch specials so I called in my order for the garlic short ribs and a beef pad thai.  Their dessert of the day was creme brûlée and they apologized that they couldn't give that to me since it was baked in ramekins so they offered Thai Ice Teas in place of dessert.  That was perfectly fine with me since I had forgotten to order some when I called in my order.

Upon entering the place I thought, oh man, where am I?  The decor was very tasteful, it reminds me of my favorite places in NYC.  My boyfriend said the bathroom was very impressive and that he would want to sit down and eat here.  

The staff was super helpful and nice.  Our food came out shortly after we arrived and I scarfed down the food in the car as we were going shopping right after that.  Oh man, the garlic ribs were soooooo yummy!  They were a little salty but so good!  The pad thai was on point and I love the dressing they used on their salad.  The Thai tea was a little on the sweet side but still really good.  

We will definitely be back and hopefully have enough time to sit down and enjoy the atmosphere."}
{"text":"Fantastic food. Best panang I've had to date.. everything was very flavorful, prices a little high for thai and location but otherwise, good food"}
{"text":"Update: Came in last night and was blown away by the mix of flavors and exceptional service! You must try the Pad Thai and the short rib yellow curry. The short ribs are fall off the bone juicy and the curry is the perfect mix of sweetness, texture, and flavor. This is one of my favorite Thai restaurants in town in large part fue to their amazing service. Our server was kind and attentive making sure to recommend their signature dishes. We also tried the spicy mint eggplant dish and it blew me away. What a delicious side, lucky for me it wasn't  too spicy because I can hardly handle the heat haha! We ended the night with their signature dessert, a delicious mango sorbet sticky rice combo with coconut milk drizzle served in a glass. Make sure to call in reservations because this place is small and intimate. You will love it! 

Went in to have dinner with my best friend and we were so pleasantly surprised at how great this place was! It was so clean and modern, but also welcoming and organized. The food was delicious, everything we ordered was great, especially the yellow curry! Our servers were attentive and kind as well as very friendly. It's a smaller place and might require reservations on busy nights but we would definitely go back. Oh and their plating is amazing, all the food was so beautiful to look at!"}
{"text":"What a nice find!  If you are tired of being ripped off by the strip, try this Thai Bistro!

Modern deco, friendly and attentive services, great dishes, hidden little gem from the tourists.- you will leave this place with a smile like my party did.

We tried Tom Kha Gai, fried cat fish, squid ink seafood wok-fried noodle, ahi tuna, fried calamari and duck red curry together with a round of coconut drinks.  All were great!

(Alright I have to continue with my food yummm)"}
{"text":"This is is really great for their dessert, everything else was just too salty or to blend. The worker here are definitely nice even though some people on my group were giving them a hard time, I'm glad they have such good services and dessert"}
{"text":"Dining atmosphere is simply beautiful. I ordered Kao Kha Moo for dinner. It was well worthy the money you spend. Taste was absolutely amazing. I will be back to try something else next time."}
{"text":"Add the word \"Bistro\" to the title and it's also a bit pretentious+slightly more expensive. 

If you're looking for an American Standard Thai Restaurant, this isn't it. What I had was good, and I don't do desserts and those might also be very good but were untested. It has a nice decor, which others mention, but I wasn't going for ambiance, rather, good food in wide variety. The variety isn't as good as other places, and if you're vegetarian or close, you won't find much to your liking. Appetizers might be really good, but they're priced just below what I would expect for entrés at other Thai restaurants where I've dined.

Service is also slower, and isn't as attentive as other places, too. Overall: good food, not stellar, at above average prices. Probably not going to go again."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. Fancy place, actually."}
{"text":"Some of the best Thai food I've had, Super amazing! The meat was tender, the spices were strong (but not overbearing), and the service was great. We are coming back here for sure next time we're in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Without google map very hard for find here...
Once here never forget  everything is perfect  only the outside not good looking Still will be back."}
{"text":"Fabulous!
Love Thai food. Have had fabulous food in Thailand.
If you want tastes that wake up your taste buds. This is the place.
My taste buds had tasty dreams .
Oh yeah."}
{"text":"Went here last night and it was great!  The food was fantastic, and the presentation was gorgeous!  Not only was the meal delicious but the service was impeccable.  Make sure you save room for desert!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and presentation. Ambiance and decor is clean & modern. We loved everything we ordered!"}
{"text":"We have been here a couple of times, the food was outstanding. The best Thai food we had so far. We will definitely go back when we go Vegas next time."}
{"text":"I've been looking forward to trying Arawan ever since I started dining at Komol next door. It looks more intimidating so I knew I had to have a special occasion to try it. I brought my parents here when they were in town and it did not disappoint as an intro to Thai food in Vegas. 

Most of the diners at Arawan are couples enjoying a fancy date night, though the restaurant wasn't too busy on a Wednesday night. They only serve beer and wine but have an extensive tea list. We started with a large order of Tom Yum with shrimp and the Tofu Larb. The Tom Yum was perfect with a spicy level 7 that had everyone sweating a bit. I've never heard of a tofu larb but it was a nice, light dish packed with tangy and fresh flavors. We continued with the Arawan Pad Thai, Short Rib Yellow Curry, and Crispy Duck, which is a dry rub version of the saucier Duck Palow. I've had duck a Thai restaurants before and sometimes the sauce makes it a soggy mess but this duck was truly crispy on the outside and tender inside - my dad's favorite dish of the night. The Arawan Pad Thai is as beautiful as the pictures show with its egg net presentation. The prawns are huge and go well with the slightly sweet noodles. The short rib yellow curry was the overall winner with the rich beef paired in a creamy, hearty curry. Fantastic. The only complaint is the lack of table space for our ambitious dinner. 

We had to get dessert right? Well yeah we got TWO desserts: the raspberry chocolate lava cake and Mango Paradise, along with a few shots of espresso. The lava cake takes 15 minutes so the mango paradise came out first: slices of mango served with two mounds of colored sticky rice, each with a slightly different texture. It's served with an eyedropper of condensed milk, though the dish is pretty sweet on its own. This is a great twist on a traditional Thai dessert. The raspberry lava cake is a little more familiar to most: a fluffy chocolate cake injected with raspberry sauce and a side of sorbet. Everything was presented beautifully and Arawan really elevates the Thai food experience. If you want to eat Thai comfort food with a couple friends, Komol may be the best choice but when you want to really treat yourself come to Arawan!"}

{"text":"If you want to have an awesome Thai bite while in Vegas, don't think it twice and come to this gem.

The place is sort of hard to find in a big strip mall in the middle of a residential area. Once you find it, you realize you are in the right place for a good meal.

I had the Arawan rolls, steak salad, pad Thai, fried rice and Panang curry. Everything was delicious.

Waiters and supportive staff are attentive and constantly checking on the water and stuff.

Bon Appetit!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars

Was in town with some friends for a 4 day trip.   They all wanted to go to a steakhouse.  I talked them into going to this place solely based on the Yelp reviews.    

When we got there at 8:30pm on a Friday night the place was absolutely dead (only two other tables seated).  My friends sarcastically said \"Great choice; its obviously really popular\", and they started complaining that they should have gone to the steakhouse.

Well, their attitude completely changed after they sunk their teeth into their meals.    Everyone thought there meals were nothing short of fantastic, and in the end were really glad we ended up here.     

I am deducting 1/2 star because:
Although the place has a pleasant decor, the atmosphere is not one that someone expects for a \"vegas experience\" due to the lack of people and hustle and bustle in the place.     Also, we weren't very impressed with the \"vanilla bean ice cream\" in the dessert; it wasn't bad, but it just wasn't creamy enough to say it was good....they should look for another supplier for their ice cream."}
{"text":"I love this little place. I always tell my friends about the catfish. It tastes fresh and authentic. I'll branch out and try new things. More and more people are finding put about this place and I believe they are expanding"}
{"text":"Absolutely fabulous food. Food presentation very artistic and beautiful.  Ambience ok.  Service good."}
{"text":"Have gone in for lunch three times now and this place totally hits the mark, seemingly without even trying hard.  The food is first rate; the service is unobtrusive and top notch plus the staff is friendly and helpful.  The decor is cool and you have your choice of seating, including one area without chairs if that is your desire.  
This appears to be all family run, as we have chatted with the greeter (the father) the mother, who is the cook, 2 sons who are waiters and the daughter who is the pastry chef.
Lunch specials here include drink & dessert and are all under 10 bucks.  Portions are generous.  I am a big guy and I always leave full.  This place is fresh, clean and comfortable, and is (IMHO) definitely on a par with Lotus of Siam, which is a neighbor in this multi use center.  You have a fan, Arawan...  I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Super super curry. Got it medium spice.  And it was pretty spicy. So go easy. Great atmosphere.  Great lunch specials too. Service just ok. They were busy."}
{"text":"Damn. This place is good. We ordered the rib-eye crispy basil and the short rib yellow curry, and I can't decide which is better. The rib-eye's sauce was legit, and was cooked medium rare just the way we ordered it. The short rib was falling off the bone. Perfectly cooked. Melt in your mouth good. 

Even though we were full, we couldn't leave without ordering dessert. Highly recommend the creme brûlée...the presentation of it was as good as it tasted. 

Last but not least, we were fascinated by their tea. We ordered the glorious paradise blossoming blooming tea. We didn't know what to expect, and was told to wait 6 min for it the flower to bloom...so we did. Do a time-lapse video if you order this drink. It's pretty awesome. 

Hands down one of the best Thai restaurants we've eaten at...try it. Seriously. We are Thai food snobs, and this place lives up to the 5 stars. Great service too."}
{"text":"Of the three Thai restaurants(Lotus of Siam, Komol and Arawan) on this commercial center, Arawan tops them all. The quality of the food and scenery is far superior. The deserts are the best I ever had."}
{"text":"This is by the far the fanciest Asian restaurant I've ever been to. They serve typical Thai food with elevated presentation. I like their yellow curry, very yummy and tasty. Their papaya salad is a let down, because they add a bunch of unnecessary fluff and charge you more for it, like salted egg, fried pork skin, and cold cut. Their tom-yum soup was average, nothing that you can't get at any other Thai restaurant. Most notable favorite is definitely their squid ink pasta (26$). it was a good portion, excellent taste, and had great plating. I also really like their creme brulee, it was so delicious. It's probably the best creme brulee I've had so far. Service is impeccable, and the ambiance was very cozy."}
{"text":"This is for the take out. I would say this place really skimps on the portions. For sure this is not a family style portion place as well. The restaurant itself is nice when I came to pick up our togo order. I opened up the nice plastic containers to find maybe 1/3 of it full if not even less. The green curry at least had good amount of chicken just missing everything else that goes in a green curry like bellpepper or something. There were some bamboo shoots in there though. I would say the pad see ew only used the slices of the bottom stems of the Chinese broccoli. The less desireable cheap part and mainly lots of flat noodle. The fried egg rolls amounted to about three sliced diagnally into bit size pieces. If you're looking for portion control but not pay the proportional price then come here. I think I should have told my friends to wait at Lotus of Siam. At least you'll get fed right there. They live up to their yelp rating."}
{"text":"Best Thai in Vegas! Amazing Phai Thai and all curries are amazing. All ingredients so fresh. Best desserts."}
{"text":"If you're a savvy tourist or an in-the-know local, off-strip Vegas dining is where the real action is for price-point, innovation, and community.  And the questions we had for our dinner at Arawan were: 1) would the food be as good or better than other well-known Thai restaurants and 2) was it the sort of experience that could be easily duplicated elsewhere?  For our party of two, the answers were 1) YES and 2) NO.  Here's why.  Everything that's already been said is true.  The interior is beautiful, peaceful, and thought-out.  It's not gaudy, it doesn't bump loud music, and there isn't some attempt to make it seem as if you're in the middle of a billion dollar casino.  It makes you feel like you're in a really nice restaurant where people cared about your experience when they decorated and designed it.  Is the service great? YES.  This was the sort of service that you often crave and wonder why others can't duplicate.  The entire team made a point to stop by the table, offer answers to various questions, and then to chat after the meal to ensure that it was well received.  It felt like the entire team truly wanted to make sure we left happy.  Was the food as pretty and tasty and original as others have said?  Yes, and there's not much to add there.  The only critique is that it's definitely not the place that you go if you want a high-energy dinner filled with a trend-setting LED panel display behind an in-house \"dining dj\", bustier-wearing waiter, and a $80 filet with $10 sauce.   But, if you want quality off-strip food in downtown Las Vegas, could you find another place with this serene environment, focus on diner happiness, and with absolutely gorgeous plating and food?  NO.  And that's why we'll be back soon to Arawan Thai."}
{"text":"Looks kind of unappealing from the outside But inside is very nice and cozy. Foods presentation awesome, the menu is not as big as other Thai places but they have all the favorites, slightly more expensive for being Thai, but worth the extra penny $5-36. 
service was A+ I def recommend."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I love Asian food and I'm picky about such food. This is my second time here and first review. 

GPS dumped me off in the street, just look for the proper address and suite number (E-14) behind Sahara street. The outside is a little bit of a turnoff, in my opinion, very crowded with posters at the door. 

Once inside, it's clean, very well spaced out and (did I mention?) CLEAN! Excellent service, excellent food. 

Wait staff comes over and keeps drinks refilled, picks up plates, brings extra napkins and more. All  without asking. Very impressive service. 

Let's get to the food...."}
{"text":"Great meal, service and atmosphere, loved the Pad Thai and Rib Eye with crispy basil, excellent crispy calamari, oh, the tea, in the glass cup was a delight too!"}
{"text":"The food here is fantastic! Very authentic, but with a twist that makes it fancy and fun. The restaurant is well appointed and seemed like a place really built with love. We enjoyed everything we had here. Perfectly spiced and excellent service."}
{"text":"Very nice dining experience!

When we arrived we were immediately greeted. Since we may a reservation on eat24 they seated us right away ahead of waiting customers.

I really enjoyed the cute tables. Our seats had individual cushions that made my back feel well-supported after a long day.

The food was way better than I expected even after the reviews. The only reason I did not give 5 stars was that they did not ask how spicy we wanted our food. My yellow Thai curry could have been a little spicier and my boyfriend's pad see ew was so spicy I couldn't eat it. We usually share our dishes so I was a little disappointed.

If they start inquiring about the \"spicy\" level and augment the food appropriately, they will take their food to the next level!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent!!! We thought at first that the Crispy Lemongrass Catfish was a bit pricey but when it arrived it was a huge whole fish! So delicious and worth the price! Nice ambiance and excellent service."}
{"text":"You can't judge a book by its cover   pretty well describes Arawan.  Great food, great service and a VERY classy decor sum this place up. Check it out."}
{"text":"Food is good but the serving size is small. I liked the ted curry but rice was very sticky. The item ate little pricy too"}
{"text":"Do not let the outside of Arawan Thai Bistro fool you. I was a little sketched before walking in, but once inside, you will be pleased. But the true joy of this place is the lunch special. The dinner prices seem a little high, but if you are coming for lunch...wow!! Salad, soup, meal and dessert... 10 bucks! And on top of it all, the food is fantastic! I love Pad Thai and will be coming here again and again. This is the good stuff.?"}
{"text":"The food was tasty, spicy and fresh. Service was on point, our strawberry water was always filled. They also had a mango desert that is a must. It's a combination of flavors and textures that make your eyes light up! 

Arawan is definitely off the Vegas strip and doesn't carry the big Vegas flare, but it has good food and service. If you're looking to get away from the glam for a meal, venture to this small strip and give the locals some love. It definitely looks slightly sketchy from the outside, the strip the restaurant was located in made me feel vulnerable because I didn't know where it was exactly, but once we found it, I felt more secure. There are lots of vacant spaces available for rent and needs cleaned up a bit."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were actually trying to go to Lotus of Siam which is nearby but they told us an hour to two hour wait time so we decided to go here and we were not disappointed! I had a glass of their Merlot and my boyfriend had the Thai beer and the satay appetizer to start. Good stuff! Now we usually decide we like a Thai restaurant based off their curries. We ordered the panang curry and it was very delicious! My boyfriend thought there could've more curry but I was pleased. We finished with desserts and I really enjoyed this place because of their much better dessert selection compared to other Thai restaurants. Would go back!!"}
{"text":"Played restaurant roulette by hopping in a cab and asking for him to take us off the strip. Felt like we lost a bet when we were left in this sketch strip mall, but then we found Arawan, what a pleasant surprise! Staff attentive and warm. Food presentation is lovely. Taste, wow. Highly recommend the Short Rib Yellow Curry. I had my leftovers in my hand while we waited for Uber. I'm normally willing to share part of my dinner with someone in need, but when a lady wanted to wash car windows for money to buy food; we had no car, or cash.  I somewhat reluctantly gave her my Panang curry.  Homeless people deserve yummy Thai food too."}
{"text":"Located in the small plaza as where Lotus of Siam used to be is this small and nice restaurant. For some odd reason Google maps had troubles finding this restaurant. This turn out to be somewhat an expensive experiment that was a little disappointing. We really wanted Thai food but Lotus is temporarily closed so we went here. The Tom yum soup we ordered was really good when it is hot. We ordered it with medium spice and we weren't disappointed at first. However, as the soup got colder the flavor started to be really off. Also, there wasn't that many shrimps inside. The shrimps were good though and I like that they removed the tail. We also ordered our usual pad see ew and crying tiger. The pad see ew wasn't bad. Again, there wasn't enough meat and just like the tom yum soup. The crying tiger was okay. I usually order this item when I go to other Thai location so this one is in the middle of the pack. Unfortunately, my overall experience tells me to continue to go to Lotus of Siam. I cannot wait for it to return."}
{"text":"What a fresh difference...water was served with sliced strawberry and mint leaves, every dish has wonderful presentation, and taste was downright authentic. Service was attentive and fast. And the atmosphere was very pleasant and casually classy. Will be back!"}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I went here for dinner recently. Right when we walked through the door, I felt very calm. That may be strange to some, but it was so refreshing. Arawan is very clean, comfortable, quiet, and it has the perfect ambiance for a nice relaxing dinner. 

The food was excellent. We got the lemongrass chicken wings as an appetizer. They were very flavorful and cooked perfectly. Then, I ordered the red chicken curry along with the orange chicken plate (I was hungry) Both were fantastic. What I love about the food is that it is extremely flavorful, yet pretty light. Despite how much I ate, I did not feel sluggish. 

Lastly, the customer service was top notch. I don't recall our waitress' name, but her cadence with checking up on us was perfect. She was very friendly and genuine. 

Whether you're looking for a new place for a romantic date, or you're a foodie looking to try some great food, this is definitely a place you want to try."}
{"text":"Too sweet for any curry and tie tea. Duck noodle is pretty local according to my Thai friend. While for me the smell is not that acceptable. Salty salmon cup, but I do like the lava cake."}
{"text":"I'll make this review short and sweet.
Server was super sweet, even with a language barrier she was very hospitable. She explained the menu very well to where she intrigued me to get the $9.99 lunch special. It's a salad, soup, entree and dessert all for 9.99. That's awesome.

Soup and salad were small portions. I like that size though because you aren't full by the time your entree gets there. Basic salad with a peanut dressing. A very lite and delicious egg drop soup. 

I got the pad Thai and made it spicy. Extra peanuts. Great flavor. Chicken was cooked great. My buddy got the short ribs and I tried them. Great flavor, able to bite right off bone and great portion size. It was followed up by a caramel flan that had kiwi and strawberries on it. Very very tasty.  It was a small dessert so it wasn't overwhelming. Great way to end a great priced, portioned and tasting meal. Definitely coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Wow!   Trust the reviews, trust the GPS, open the door and be amazed.  Food is amazing, service is superb, great atmosphere.  Bring your date here and be sure to order dessert.  This is an experience."}
{"text":"Great lunch deal. Delicious and fresh.  Egg flower soup was lovely.  Panang curry at medium was quite spicy.  Pad Thai at medium not as spicy.  Came with a creamy chocolate mousse.  Nice meal.  Weird commercial location that may be being revitalized.  Don't let the outside fool you.  Nicely decorated interior, quiet ambience and large banquet room."}
{"text":"Very tasty! Wifey had the shrimp pad thai and I had the garlic short ribs & the squid ink drunken noodles! Best Thai dish I ever had!"}
{"text":"Each dish is very beautiful and delicate, of course taste so good.
Must try Tom Yam soup.
Dessert were wonderful. my favorite is Mango's one. 
They will serve alcohol soon. gonna e more popular and popular. 
The rice noodle was not so good compare to other dishes.
Green Curry, Crab fried rice, Tom yam soup, are highly recomended!"}
{"text":"My favorite thai restaurant! Great customer service, the food is amazing, and the chef is cute! Lol"}
{"text":"This is a very solid Thai restaurant. It has hints of Chinese fusion with dishes such as wonton soup, orange chicken, and complimentary wonton appetizer, but overall it's a solid Thai restaurant to add to the Vegas list of great Thai cuisine. 

The beer and wine menu is pretty limited compared to other Thai restaurants, but the food is great. The look and preparation of the food might be one of the best in Vegas. The pad Thai was a gourmet dish that looked absolutely spectacular. And as far as spicy goes this might be the best bang for your buck at good Thai in Vegas. Desserts are supposed to be their specialty but I didn't try any this time around. 

Arawan is worth a try. Not too expensive and good portion sizes make it a great stop if in the area. Or come during lunch if you can for their cheap and great 3 part lunch deal which is tough to beat in Vegas"}
{"text":"What an amazing find. The ambiance was very calming and well appointed. The chefs here deserve accolades for the quality of the food as well as the meticulous attention to the plating. 

We started with the simple egg papaya salad and moved to a ton yum soup both at medium spicy (just enough for me). Then, we were astounded with the presentation of the short rib curry as well as the squid drunken noodle. Both were stunning. The short rib just melted in your mouth. It wasn't a meager portion either. And the seafood in the drunken noodle was top notch. The mussels were plump, the squid cut beautifully and generously, the prawns jumbo sized, the scallops succulent, and the fish perfect.

Even the drinks were amazing. The ice cubes in the Thai ice coffee were unusual, but made the drink \"sparkle\" visually. And, the honey bliss blossoming tea was a vision to watch actually blossoming in the see-through glass teapot. 

If that wasn't enough, the deserts took my breath away. We ordered a simple mango sticky rice and it came with a delicate silver sugar arch with two colours of sticky rice. I kept eyeing the table next to me because all they ordered was dessert!

I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"wow!! this place is amazing, starting from the service we got to the food that was very tasty even though that i have been to so many Thai restaurants, i went with my family and had an amazing time, thank you so much and to our server tony."}
{"text":"This place is such a gem! Don't let the surrounding shopping center scare you away. Inside, you'll find a cozy, clean and friendly dining environment. Went there with a few friends on our lunch break and their $9.95 lunch special was just unbeatable! For that price, you get soup, an entree and dessert! I had the chicken pad see ew and was not disappointed in the serving size, the presentation or the flavor. It was all top-notch and I'll be back."}
{"text":"This cute restaurant is definitely worth a try! Dim lights and a relaxed atmosphere make it great for dinner with friends, or a date night with your boo. 

The food is awesome, I love the yellow curry chicken. And the house wontons are amazing! I could eat those bad boys alone for a meal. I also tried the short rib yellow curry, it was yummy but my favorite is definitely the chicken. I also enjoyed the Penang chicken curry. 

I do 4/5 stars simply because I felt like $18 for a plate of pineapple fried rice is a bit high. The presentation and flavor is there, don't let the extra few dollars detour you from trying it. My boyfriend and I both enjoyed it. Also comes with 2 shrimps. 

Service is always amazing the staff is lovely, it's clean and even though the location may have you feeling a bit sketched out once you go inside you'll forget you're right next to the green door"}
{"text":"Service was amazing! We came here with 19 people with a reservation. Silly me... I made the reservation on the wrong date...Called the same day to adjust for the next day. 

Birthday boy's birthday was that day but we were going to have dinner the next day and I mixed up the days. Whoops. They were very accommodating and didn't hesitate to fix my mistake.

They do set expectations that the food will not all come out at the same time and will probably take longer. This is expected with a large party especially since we didn't want the set menu. That is the best part, not having to use a set menu! Their food came out pretty fast though aside from that.

Got the Arawan pad thai and it was pretty good. Nice presentation on the egg wrap. Their desserts were amazing! The mango dessert and the coconut ice cream. I don't exactly remember the name of them. I'd say everyone ordered an entrée and dessert.

They also did something nice for the birthday boy! I will be back to try everything else!"}
{"text":"Lotus of siam move over. This place is the new awesome place to get Thai food. Great setting? Check. Beautiful presentation of food? Check. Good tasty food? Check. Do yourself a favor and go to this restaurant."}
{"text":"Menu selection was wonderful, taste was great, and presentation was fantastic. The decor is gorgeous and the staff is exceptional!"}
{"text":"Wow. A friend of mine brought me here for lunch and I'm way impressed. I really like that that both chefs are women. I just love to support women business owners. As we were driving to this complex, I assumed she was taking me to Komol. I love Komol, which is located next door. I'm not exactly sure why this plaza has three thai restaurants but these two are delicious. 
This place is very modern and trendy. Cute decor, but the food is top notch as well as the service. Highly recommend. We ordered a bunch of stuff to share. My friend loves the Thai Tea, but I just had regular iced tea. For lunch we had the short rib with yellow curry. The meat was perfectly tender and you could easily pull it apart with your fork. The curry was very flavorful. Great dish. The spicy green beans had great texture. I know we also ordered a chicken dish, but for the life of me I can't remember which one. I do remember that the sauce was really good. Actually, everything was so good that I wanted to eat more, but I was stuffed. 
I especially like that they never add msg and use quality ingredients. Prices are competitive and completely worth it for the taste. Great restaurant. They have vegan and vegetarian options - obviously that isn't something I require, but I appreciate because I have a fair amount of veggie/vegan friends. It makes it easier to know I can bring them without issue. 
Now I have a decision to make the next time I want Thai - both Komol and Arawan are so good. It's going to be a tough choice :)"}
{"text":"First time here. Charming cozy place. Waitress Tana, I think that was her name I know it started with a T was friendly and efficient. We had crispy duck which was right on and the ribeye crispy basil. The ribeye was tough, I think they substituted a sirloin, ribeye isn't that tough. We will try this place again and order something else."}
{"text":"During my business trip in Vegas, I was in charge of finding good restaurants for the team's dinner. It was a challenging job because my boss is really picky about food and wine. We went to Arawan Thai Bistro for our dinner. We had an awesome time! My boss and the team really liked the food. Customer service was great. Excellent presentation. Great selections of Thai food."}
{"text":"Arawan was legitimately impressive and in my opinion, absolutely worth the trip off the strip. The food is pretty close to one star Michelin level for a very reasonable. price. Give the pad thai and earthquake dessert a try. 

The restaurant is located in a sketchy, unassuming strip mall area. I visited on a Saturday morning and the parking lot was pretty abandoned. It was kind of hard to find because the sign wasn't very conspicuous. 

The interior of the place is pleasant and minimalist. My group of 14 put in orders and the food came out pretty quickly. I ordered the Pad Thai, which was very interestingly made. It was contained in an egg webbing that held the noodles in a flattened ball state. I've never seen anything like it. 

The flavors of the food was excellent. As someone who spent 3 weeks in Thailand constantly eating Pad Thai, I was impressed by the sweetness and spicy kick. 

Dessert is where Arawan really shined. I ordered the earthquake, which was basically lime sherbet with chocolate. The twist is that the chocolate is molded into a ball with the sherbet nestled inside. The dish also came up warm raspberry sauce that's meant to be poured onto the chocolate ball to get in the middle. The dish is elegantly crafted, well plated, and fun on execution. I've really only seen this level of creativity and craftsmanship at MIchelin level restaurants.

Finally, we visited for my girlfriend's birthday. Arawan gave us a nice ice cream dessert plate with Thai iced tea ice cream and happy birthday elegantly written in cursive.

Give Arawan a visit - it ranks better than Star of Siam in my book."}
{"text":"Located inside the historic commercial center district on Sahara, this restaurant is a little hard to find at first. My GPS took us to the Onyx theatre and said we had arrived, but it turns out they're right next door to Komol, facing west. That's right, there are 3 notable Thai joints competing for your loyalty in this plaza, with Lotus of Siam also a few steps away. Thai cuisine lovers, choose your poison wisely!

Well-kept and Western-influenced, with a touch of modern-rustic. Rattan chairs with cushions and a wooden motif throughout. The dessert preparation station is akin to something you'd see at a crafty Pinterest couple's wedding, which is becoming an increasingly popular look at new restaurants. Our friendly server promptly gave us food recommendations and strawberry-infused water, which he continually refilled. A small jar of fresh flowers sat atop our table. Nice touches like that make a difference. (Bathrooms could use some work, though.)

We sat in for their $9.95 lunch special, which occurs 11a-3p weekdays. This price included soup and crispy noodle chips to start, followed by an entree with rice, AND dessert! Yesss, that's something pretty unheard of. Beautiful presentation. I got the chicken yellow curry and my brother got the thai bbq chicken. My curry was smaller-portioned, compared to other places, but still satisfying. The chicken was tender and carrots thoroughly cooked. I hate when other restaurants seem to rush the process and I end up with hard ingredients in my curry.

Service is tops~! Maybe because it was fairly empty when we went, but our waiters were so attentive and periodically dropped in to ask how everything was. (One even held the door open for us on the way out.) The dessert of the day was a chocolate caramel pecan tart, which another employee garnished at the dessert station. Not as elaborate as some of the other dessert pictures (creme brûlée), but a good way to wrap up an enjoyable lunch."}
{"text":"So disappointing to not be able to give this place 5 stars.  I had such high hopes after reading all the reviews.  I told my BFF this is where I wanted to have my bday lunch and that they had a special!  Too bad it wasn't avail the day we visited :( Strike 1!  Strike 2, there were food caked on my fork!  How did they not see it while wrapping it all pretty in a linen napkin??  And when I brought it to the servers attention, she took it, didn't apologize or anything and just brought me a new one.  Not sure what that was about, maybe she was too embarrassed?  We ordered the larb salad which I'm used to it being with pork but they only had it with chicken, the flavor was good but the chicken was not.  It was crumbled to the point of disintegration, not what I want for food texture.  We had also the tom yom soup with shrimp, it was tasty but for $7, I expected more than 2 shrimps!  And the final dish was the Thai spiced seabass. 1st of all, I don't think it was seabass that we were served, and for $24, we expected more than just lumpia sauce served over pan fried fish. Was that the last strike?  Nope!  After a disspointing meal, my BFF wanted to see if their dessert that everyone was raving over could save the day.  Um can't happen if they don't have it!  We ordered the mango & sticky rice, oh sorry, we don't have it.  What?!  That is the most popular dessert ordered at any Thai restaurant, how can they not have any?  Oh yikes!  I don't care how many people think this place is the bomb, they sure did bomb in a bad way for us!  Won't ever be back!"}
{"text":"Update 7/4/17: Unique and innovative Thai food, served in a chill lounge atmosphere. Comfortable seats, dimmed lights and soft jazz music were all really nice. We ordered short rib curry, which was very good. Duck pad Thai was excellent also. Lots of inventive options put a modern twist on old Thai favorites. Service was outstanding and attentive. It's little pricy, so be prepared to pay for the pleasure. Recommended."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. In Vegas for business. In the shadows of the stratosphere, a few blocks out from the strip. I yelped Thai and this place came up. Reservations via open table. In at 5:30 no problem. Prompt and happy, very accommodating and hospitable service. The food was outstanding. Had a Satay chicken app, drunken noodles and a tasty Thai beer Singha. Creme brûlée for dessert was unreal. Shady part of town - we're at first concerned about our safety. The strip mall is pretty scary. But it was like walking into an oasis. Very happy. 4 stars for location and lack of liquor. Short Beer menu (4) and lots of wines."}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant ever! This comes from some who traveled to Thailand early part of this year and tasted some of the Thailand's most well known restaurants. The restaurant's ambiance is relaxing and modern. The food tasted authentic yet the presentation is like a gourmet French dish. The size and portion of the dishes are quite good. 

The Duck Red Curry is absolutely one of the best curry dishes I ever had. The duck meat are sliced duck breast joined by various fresh fruits, vegetable, and herb. There was not a drop of curry left in the plate after we're done with it.  


The Squid-Ink Drunken Noodles dish is also wonderful. The high quality of the seafood ingredient in this dish mixed with sweet spicy chili sauce created a nice balanced taste.

The Crispy Lemongrass Catfish was served on a large plate with a whole fish. Deep fried with lightly battered crispy skin on the outside and fresh tender inside. The taste of the fished was enhanced by dipping it in the spiced dressing.

Unlike similar dish in other Thai restaurants,the beef in the Tenderloin Black Pepper dish is from high grade steak. It's like ordering a piece of marinaded steak with black pepper onion sauce dressing. It definitely worth its value if not exceeding it.

Lastly to finish off the meal with the Vanilla Bean Crème Brûlée and Coconut Treasure. The Crème Brûlée looks fantastic served with a golden-net made with sugar. The vanilla custard is smooth and tasty. The sweet rice hidden under the coconut ice cream of the Coconut Treasure is a pleasant surprise. The combination of the sweet rice and the coconut is delightful and refreshing. 

I am looking forward to dine at the Arawak Bistro again for other item."}
{"text":"We wandered in here by accident and were very impressed with both the taste and presentation of the meal.  No time to write so I'll make it quick:  absolutely wonderful Thai food.  5 stars - would stop by again without hesitation."}
{"text":"This place is exceptional! I used to love the restaurant when it was Stick-E-Rice, so I had to try their new location. The main dining room is intimate & contains the same decor from their previous location. I noticed that they also have a couple private rooms as well. Their new menu is great! The presentation of their dishes is more sophisticated & it offers more entree-type options. The food is still delicious & the service is excellent. The only thing I didn't like too much was the shopping center where the restaurant is located. I feel that they belong somewhere better. Nonetheless, I am happy that they have reopened."}
{"text":"Took a cab out of the Vegas Strip.  Takes about 15min.  It is a bit tricky to find.  It is actually in the same strip mall as Lotus of Siam ^^    Stay inside the strip mall and keep driving around the parking lot to find the restaurant.  Inside the restaurant is nicer than the outward appearance.  Could not try a lot of the dishes since it was just two adults.   We ordered the catfish for our main.  The waitress was nice and actually advised not to order 2 entrees since the order would be huge.  She was right.  1 entree split between two and there was still leftovers at the end.  The Catfish was great.  Most catfish have a distinctive scent which I am not a fan of but this place cooked it just right.  Had calamari for appetizer and it was fine.  The green tea was awesome.  Just sad that we couldn't order more dishes.  If it was back home, we would have ordered just more and packed all the leftovers."}
{"text":"This restaurant made my first time in Las Vegas extremely special. Many thanks to Chef Gail. The Mango island for dessert is an absolute must!"}
{"text":"I recently returned to Arawan while I was in town visiting. This time I give it five stars without hesitation. The service was great, the atmosphere is peaceful and the food is just delicious! Every dish is created with loving detail and not only is the presentation wonderful but the food itself is outstanding. This time we started with the cucumber salad. It looked and tasted fresh, colorful and just the right amount of tang to it. Next we had the Catfish, Ribeye Steak, Drunken Noodles and Won Ton Soup. Every dish was perfect. I highly recommend the Catfish which can be ordered and shared by a group. Everyone at the table had some and thought it was the best dish of the night. This will be my go to place every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"I lived in Thailand for a bit. This is my favorite Thai restaurant on the West Coast. I live in Vegas and always bring visitors, guests, and business partners here

Ask for Drake the server! He will serenade your table"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place by chance since the wait at Lotus of Siam was so long. Nicest restaurant in this old plaza - interior is modern and beautiful. Overall, everyone in the dinner party was very impressed with the quality, flavor and presentation of the food. I don't think we got any dishes that wasn't completely demolished! 

Highlights: 
- Papaya salad
- Crab fried rice
- Thai glass noodle with chicken (can't remember what the exact name of the dish was)
- Mango Island - beautifully presented and tasted as good as it looked!"}
{"text":"Wow what a meal! My wife and I had the lunch special. A perfect amount of food for a very good price. I will warn for those with a low spice tolerance that it can be a little hot. Not a judgement of the staff but rather my Midwestern upbringing lacks spice in my diet. Also the staff was very warm and helpful."}
{"text":"Thank you for providing great food and giving my friend a good time. It was amazed by the crispy lemongrass catfish. It was fresh and crispy. And the desert is so delicious and good  presentation 


Thank you Arawan, you are awesome and keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Came here for the lunch special and I got the beef panang curry.  I asked the waiter whether the beef is tender and he said yes.  His definition of tender must differ from mine because it was quite chewy.  Won't be ordering this again.

The lunch special comes with a tiny bowl of soup of the day and a tiny dessert.
I think i prefer the lunch special that comes with a bowl of soup and a fried spring roll.

I may come back to try something different, but for now, it's a A-OK."}
{"text":"HANDS DOWN BEST THAI RESTAURANT IN LV.

I probably eat thai food weekly and this is my favorite place. It's in a very unassuming location but its actually nice inside and service is top notch. The dishes are creative but still very thai. I've liked everything I've tried here. It's such a good price too for what you're getting! This is more of a sit down and enjoy thai restaurant as opposed to a quick take out place. The dishes are presented beautifully. 

For starters - thai lemongrass chicken wings and ahi tuna larb. The tuna was fresh and has a lot of citrus. Chicken wings were amazing. I would order both of these again. For entrees- garlic short ribs and duck red curry. The short ribs melt in your mouth and the curry was tasty - I never would've thought to put grapes in it but it just works. As much as I liked everything, dessert is the BEST part. YOU CANNOT SKIP DESSERT and you have to order the mango island."}
{"text":"I've seen some people question the five star and number one rating for this restaurant and based on my experience I don't know why LOL. I am not an expert on Thai cuisine, so I don't know if its the best Thai food one could ever have but I know what I like. I found this place on Yelp in search of some good Thai grub and had a taste for some Shrimp Pad Thai as well as Thai Iced Tea. The place is tucked away in one of several buildings in a strip mall on East Sahara Avenue, not far from the strip but definitely not in the glitziest part of town by no means. LOL You won't come across it by accident but if you are looking for it, you can easily find it. (Use Google Maps) The outside is simple but, once you walk inside the atmosphere is cozy, relaxed, clean, and has the ambiance down almost perfectly. You feel right at home once inside this business.The host the night we were there was both friendly and helpful. It is a little small inside and he told us their were a couple of tables that just finished up and would have us seated withing 10 to 15 minutes. In terms of the food, to me everything was amazing. The Thai Wings and Shrimp Pad Thai are must orders. The presentation was for the Shrimp Pad Thai and tasted as good as it looked. Our server was so pleasant and nice like i said you felt at home as soon as you entered their establishment. They even got the little things right, such as a slice of strawberry in the water that was served. (Not Pictured) Again, I loved what we had, and the presentation, just like the meal itself, was completely professional. I gave it 5 stars because every one of my expectations for a relaxing and enjoyable meal out was met and exceeded to be honest. There is no doubt we will be back when I am in Vegas. 

What you must try:

Thai Lemongrass Wings. 
Shrimp Pad Thai"}
{"text":"Can I say wow!?  I just found my favorite Thai cuisine, presentation is beautiful and delicious; prices are very reasonable! The staff is so kind. We loved the service and if I could give more stars I would...wait! I can!"}
{"text":"Amazing presentation and service! Will definitely add this to our local favorites! Try the Catfish and Crispy Duck......not to mention their Shrimp Pad Thai."}
{"text":"Amazing service and really good food! I went with my family after seeing the blue man group. The place is located in a quiet area that looks deserted. The place is nicely decorated. 
Appetizer: We ordered the red curry crab cake or fish cake I forgot. But it's an interesting flavor. I probably wouldn't order it again and try a different app, just because it wasn't outstanding in my opinion. 
Main course: We ordered the squid ink pasta, arawan pad thai, and pineapple fried rice. The squid ink pasta was Amazing! Definitely would come back here just for that dish alone. It had amazing flavor and everything (pasta and seafood) was cooked perfectly. The pad thai was pretty good. The presentation of the dish was very nice and I've never seen pad thai presented that way. The pineapple fried rice was decent, not too outstanding. It tasted like any other asian place you go to. 
Dessert: We ordered the raspberry chocolate lava cake. The ice cream and hazelnut strussel on the bottom were great! I'd probably just have that alone and I would be fine. The chocolate lava cake was ok. It was probably because I'm not a fan of the raspberry sauce that was inside of it. I personally would like regular chocolate instead of that sauce inside. 
Service: The service was great! Our hostess was Beer (she said that was her nickname) and she was beyond amazing! Very happy and friendly and always stopped by to ask if we needed anything."}
{"text":"Loved this restaurant! It's too bad that I can't transport it to the Valley of the Sun!

I enjoyed the Arawan Pad Thai that was presented beautifully on my plate: looking around at the other patrons, it appeared all their food is artfully placed on dishes...everything looked gorgeous!  Next time I go, I will order the regular Pad Thai, the two butterflied shrimp on top of the Arawan dish are not worth the extra $7. As for the Pad Thai itself, it was presented in what appeared to have been a lattice-like basket made of eggs.  It was the best I've ever had!!! I can't possibly, find the words to describe the deliciousness that unfolded in my mouth...

For dessert I had their Mango Island dessert.  It was too pretty to eat; but, despite that, I ate it. It was different but good. I can't accurately describe it because I've never had anything like it before...I'll be more descriptive next time (I have to come back again)!

DO NOT hesitate to come here! It is DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"The best of the best.  Arawan Roll, Pad Thai Pork, Larb, Garlic Short Ribs, and Sweet Sensations.  Also try the Arnapalma!"}
{"text":"This place is legit. Don't let the outside steer you away from coming in. It's actually really nice. It's a bit pricier then other places, but so good. I ordered the Chicken Pad Thai medium. It needed a little more spice, but that's easy to add in. Everything was cooked so well and the flavors were out of this world. I would go back in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"So glad to see this restaurant open. Food authentic, delicious. The atmosphere is modern, and attractive. The staff are friendly and attentive. This will be on our list of local go-to restaurants. A favorite! Posted several pictures for your viewing pleasure."}
{"text":"Great food - excellent service and amazing desert. We had their special sea bass and the garlic sauce is to die for!"}
{"text":"I had Thai beef salad and veg. egg roll for lunch today. The egg rolls were quite ok but the salad for $20. was disappointing. The ribeye beef slices are tough and over cooked, the mixed baby greens covered the tiny slices of regular cucumber and halved pear tomatoes. The entire salad was 90 % boring baby greens in which I found some slimey leaves. I suggested using some frizze, radicchio and wedges of heirloom tomatoes to the mix. The service however was very good. The waiters were very attentive and responsive."}
{"text":"This gem is hidden in an area that doesn't look that great but once you find it and walk in the door you're immediately transported to an enchanting dining experience. We went for lunch and I must say its the best Thai food I've ever eaten. Everything was delicious! Lunch specials were $10 served with egg drop soup, jasmine flower tea, then your entree which included a salad, rice and then dessert. Everything was flavorful, fresh and nicely presented. The ambiance is delightful right down to the music and service is excellent. 
I will eat here anytime I'm in Vegas. Highly recommend it and there's plenty of parking too."}
{"text":"I always love ordering from Arawan.  I was a little disappointed with my last delivery through postmates because I only got 3 scallops in my order.  If I'm gonna pay 20 some dollars for one dish, it should have more than 3 scallops."}
{"text":"The food is awesome and potion sizes large. We were here as a group of friends and had a little too much to eat. The hosts were very accommodating. If there is one thing negative about this place it is it the shady strip mall it is located in. But if in Vegas, certainly worth a trip. At least I loved the evening with friends."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  The food, the service, you name it.  A great find.  Away from the hustle and bustle of the strip, but totally worth it.  The squid ink drunken noodles are some of the best Thai cuisine I have ever had.  This place is a gem!"}
{"text":"Nice little place. The lunch special is pretty good deal. I got the drunken duck noodles and it's so good!, great portion for the lunch special price. I'll definitely comeback. I'm giving it 4s only because I think some of their dishes are overpriced. While nam tok salad is around $10-12 in most places is $20 in here. Also some of their noodle soups are kinda pricey."}
{"text":"I came here yesterday with no expectations since I had never heard of the place. It's understandable since Arawan Thai Bistro just opened up a little over a month now. Entering the restaurant brings you to an entirely different atmosphere given its location. The atmosphere is relaxing and very inviting. 
Our server was very polite throughout the duration of  our meal. He was kind and was very attentive to filling out glasses with water. My glass was never 1/3 empty! 
Me being a meat person, I decided to try out the deep fried short ribs. I thought it was really good and the sauce that came with it really complimented the short ribs. It's something I'd definitely get again."}
{"text":"Just discovered this new Thai place! I highly suggest the short ribs with yellow curry. The beef falls apart with a fork it so tender. The vanilla bean creme brulee is to die for. I can't wait to come back and try other things!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant. Probably the best Thai restaurant in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"If you're used to waiting for another Thai place, skip the wait and give this place a try for amazing food and great service. It doesn't look like much on the outside, but everything is first class once you step through the door.  Not only were the dishes bursting with flavor, they were gorgeously presented with details worthy of being in any of the high end restaurants around here. We had the soft shell crab, rib eye, squid ink, egg papaya salad, and tom yum soup. Each dish was a hit with our group of five picky foodies. What really blew us away were the desserts. Not your typical Thai desserts. The quality is on another level. The coconut dessert was perfect with bits of peanuts, tender coconut flesh, and sweet sticky rice underneath. Order the creme brûlée and it'll come out with enough flair to warrant a photo or two. Of course, it'll taste as good as it looks. The manager Gail stopped by and we learned that she is a pastry chef. Totally shows in the food."}
{"text":"Amazing food ,great Service , good music . Totally recommended. Family owned biz the wife is the chef - will come back again and again"}
{"text":"I ate here again last night. I don't know if its because I was hungrier this time around or something, but I noticed the portion size was not enough for the price I paid. Either they served a smaller size or I was not hungry last time I came. My friend who is not a big eater also was not full after finishing their order that I ordered another plate of Shrimp Pad Thai to satiate our appetite. The bill was over $100 for 3 entrees, 1 appetizer and 1 dessert. Way too much for Thai food. I will probably eat something before eating here again so I won't be hungry."}
{"text":"The ABSOLUTE BEST THAI FOOD I've eaten in a long time. I travel a lot and is always in seek of the foods out there, especially Thai. I can now say I've found it!!! The out of Arawan restaurant is a bit sketchy but once inside it's paradise. The decor and food is that good! You won't regret it, I promise you."}
{"text":"Great food and service. We made reservations and were pleasantly surprised upon arrival to be seated in a semiprivate room. The crispy catfish, ribeye and baby back ribs were excellent. They offer wine and beer options. The local secret spot used to be Lotus of Siam near by. It is getting harder and harder to get into when there is a convention in town. This was an excellent option. The atmosphere is also very nice."}
{"text":"Although Lotus of Siam gets all the attention, this Thai place is equally amazing. If you're looking for something a little nicer on the inside - this place is it and their plating is spectacular. This is proof you can find amazing food outside of the main Last Vegas Strip. 

Arawan is a little more intimate and quieter, and service is a little better as well. The food is delicious and a little more elevated. 

We ordered the crispy soft shell crab, pad thai, tea and one of their signature desserts topped with fresh fruit. The visit was memorable and I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"For you are in Vegas and looking for a great place to have Thai food this is the place to go!!! It's a little away from the strip but if you want great amazing Thai food go here! #padThaiWithBBQPrawnS was amazing omg! The prawn was huge and they cooked everything so well! And so tasteful!  
 #RedCurry was just as good! Well made! Very authentic Thai. 
Service was beyond amazing! They are so welcoming and so attentive 
I love this place!"}
{"text":"Great thai restaurant in a run down strip mall. I'm thai and I was not expecting much, and was pleasantly surprised at the quality of the dishes. Great flavors and presentation. The best thing is, they also have really nice desserts. Would definitely come back next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Probably the best Aisian food I've had in my life! Definitely the best pad thai and desert ( mango paradise) I've ever had."}
{"text":"In this restaurant their food is very good, it does not take a while for the food to come. They have very nice service. Lastly they have a good atmosphere"}
{"text":"Loved the setting! And the food is the best Thai food I've ever tried I had that spicy mint eggplant, and the flavor was amazing! My friend had a tofu Curry and it was delicious as well. Good customer service, the restaurant itself it's very home like, we both enjoyed ourselves, we will definitely come back"}
{"text":"We went to Arawan for my brother-in-law's bday and it was wonderful! We didn't have a reservation but they were able to accommodate us they even surprised him with ice cream they made my brother-in-law a salad that was not in the menu. Highly recommended! We'll definitely go there again!"}
{"text":"5 stars all around!!!

This is my favorite Thai spot in Vegas. 
My friends and I stumbled  across this awesome restaurant by accident. We were in the same shopping complex trying to get a table at lotus of Siam(a very popular Thai restaurant) but, with the 45min wait we walked out and headed to arawan.

The decor is beautiful and the atmosphere is very relaxing. 
Bond our server was prompt, pollite and knowledgeable about the menu.  He suggested we try the pad Thai and the deep fried catfish.

Everything was amazing. Make sure you save room for dessert!!!

We will be back

Thankyou Bond and Thang for the great food and service!!!"}
{"text":"Thai food in Vegas? ARAWAN IS THE ONE! Especially for their lunch 'cause the lunch special is definitely worth it.

FOOD: Like I said, there is a lunch special from 11pm-3pm on weekdays for $9.95 that includes soup, entree, and dessert. The soup changes every day, I think, and we got the Tofu Vegetable soup with our meal. For entrees, my friend got the Pad Thai and I got the Panang Curry. You can choose your spicy level. My friend asked for no spice, but she said it was still spicy. But she still still enjoyed it. I liked my curry, but just wish it came with a bit more rice because they give you way more curry. For dessert, we had a pudding cake type thing (?) that was pretty tasty. 

SERVICE: Quick and kind service. Our food came out pretty fast. However, when we asked about the dessert, he didn't know what it was. 

ATMOSPHERE: The outer appearance doesn't do justice to the inside. The inside looks very fancy, has cool decor, and is very inviting. 

Overall, the food was good Thai food at a reasonable price. I'd definitely go back for lunch and try one of their other entrees!"}
{"text":"The outside appearance of the restaurant is a little menacing but you won't be disappointed when you step inside. I ordered the squid ink pad Thai and it was delicious. The service and the overall experience was good."}
{"text":"Wow I hope that I can express in words how much of a delight this place was from the moment I walked into the door. 

The restaurant  is located in a large parking lot and from the outside it didn't seem like anything special. I was greatly surprised when I walked in to hear the sound of swanky jazz music playing in this beautiful lit little restaurant. 
The atmosphere is so calming and comfortable. They set us in these comfy wicker chairs nestled in the corner of the room. I was instantly happy. But wait, it doesn't stop there! The wait staff were so welcoming and brought us strawberry infused water before we had a chance to even ask for anything. There's more!! Again, I was shocked by the service here, before we even finished ordering we had two little bowls of delicious egg drop soup places on our table. It may have possibly been some of the best I've tasted. 

So the run down on the food:
Panang Curry: the dish came out in a large plate with a small medium bowl of juicy curry chicken along side a gracious portion of rice. 
The chicken was cooked perfect and the seasonings were excellent. 


The menu had many options and reasonably priced as well. They have lunch specials for $9.95 which is what we chose. I ordered the Panang Curry and my partner ordered the Brocolli Beef. 

Broccoli Beef: The portion was large, the beef was tender and the flavor was made to perfection. The chicken was definitely my favorite but need was great also. 

If I could give 6 stars I would! Just when I thought this place couldnt get any better, anoghe r surprise came! The most delightful little slice of chocolate dusted cheesecake was the final touch to our oh so amazing $10 lunch special. Yes, that's right for only $10 we enjoyed a three course meal!! Tell all your friends! 

5 stars across the board!!!"}
{"text":"Crispy Cstfish with lemon grass sauce was one of the best dshes Ive ever eaten and i ddidnt even think i liked catfish very much."}
{"text":"The service is great! The wait staff is super friendly. And the food is fantastic! They have the best calamari!"}
{"text":"My negative review is mostly because of the service. It was so incredibly slow and it wasn't even busy. We went for lunch on a weekday about 1:30 so it was not the lunch rush. Three of us got the lunch specials and I got a salad. We got the small soup bowl--nice touch--but then waited 45 minutes before my salad came out and then we kept waiting for the rest of our party's food. We waited 15 minutes more and I finally got up from the table and tracked down the waiter to ask him about the 3 other meals. He looked at our table and ran to the kitchen. About 15 minutes later he brought out three more meals. Total 1.5 hours to get the food! Ridiculous. The table next to us was having the same problem getting their food. Was it good? It was as good as any good Thai restaurant. But no way is it worth the poor service. They never apologized or even came back to see how the food was."}
{"text":"The best Thai restaurant ever. Great good and really friendly people. Thank you Drake we will visit again for sure"}
{"text":"Beautiful decor, small intimate dining, and the best Thai tea ice cream I've ever had."}
{"text":"So delicious!! Their pad Thai in that egg cage thing is amazing... food is high quality, presentation is wonderful and it's consistent! Save room for dessert it's heavenly! And this Thai food doesn't give you that after meal greasy feeling, it's pure and clean!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai place in town. It's down the way from Lotus of Siam, which don't get me wrong is fantastic too. It's even next door to Komal, another one of my favorite Thai spots. But to me, it tops both. It's seriously easy to be missed from the outside but so cute and modern inside! I just love the food here. It's SO delicious. The presentation is always so pretty and unique. Service is consistently good. I always tell my guests that of course they want to go to Lotus of Siam because of its accolades, but if you ever can't get in... Arawan is a very close second- so just walk a few doors down. However, I actually prefer it over Lotus!"}
{"text":"Went for dinner place was really nice inside great for dates. It's not in the greatest part of town. Seats are really comfy. The service was on point the food was great. Had the veggie spring rolls, Thai spiced sea bass, crispy basil rib eye and for dessert had the creme burlee.

Keep up the good work!

Def will be back to try other items."}
{"text":"We made a reservation through open table that they couldn't even find, so the host walked around confused for a bit before seating us. The food is good and played well, but my girls food had a hair in it, and we made the mistake of ordering the coconut ice cream with sticky rice, 10$ for a little ice cream and rice in a damn martini glass... the place did seem very overpriced, our server was awesome.  I got the ahi larb and the Thai BBQ chicken, both were good, but the chicken could've used more garnish to eat it with, cilantro, etc.  end of the day our bill was almost 100$ for an 1 App, 1 salad, my chicken, and her pad Thai.... food was good but not good if you're looking to easy cheap.."}
{"text":"One of the greatest Thai restaurant in Vegas, the decoration is nice and cozy make me feel comfortable. 

I've first started with appetizer 'Thai Lemongrass Chicken wing', the taste is tasty and intense. 
Next one is 'Egg papaya salad', very lovely. Not too spicy, just the right taste! 

For the main course I had 'Pad Thai' lovely egg net decoration and tasty!! 

And lastly don't miss desert in Arawan!!! I could say it's one of that place that you must have the desert. I had 'Vanilla Bean Creme Brûlée' It's like love at first sight. Another one I had was 'Mango Island' everything is home made and delicious! Worth to have! Just come and try here, you will get the new experience that you can't find in other Thai restaurant. I'll definitely gonna come back again and be an frequent customer! ^^"}
{"text":"Ordered the tofu green curry (spicy), chicken wings (beef pad see ew, but overall happy camper. Delivery was also timely."}
{"text":"Excellent food, desserts and customer service.  Lucky us to find this restaurant today before heading home  and we promised to come back every time when we're in town to try different dishes."}
{"text":"This Thai restaurant has a very nice design. Try all the house special foods you won't regret. Great foods and services. The owner is very polite. Located in the same plaza with vegas most popular and overrated Thai restaurant -Lotus of Siam. Skip the wait at Lotus of Siam and try this restaurant."}
{"text":"Super very good thaï food, we loved it. Very well surprised by this restaurant hidden. Everything was so good!!! We recommend"}
{"text":"Yummmmmmmo!

I originally came here to try their lunch special... But I came on a Sunday. They only have lunch special Monday-Friday from the time they open until 3pm. Defiantly will be coming back to try their lunch special, which gets you an entree, drink & dessert... All for $10! I can't wait!"}
{"text":"Arawan is a little out of the place, off the strip and a great find. Nice atmosphere, fabulous food and a wonderful staff. If you love Thai food, you will not be disappointed. And save room for desert!"}
{"text":"We finally ventured off the strip and found this hidden gem. The food was delicious and the service was solid. I'm not a big desert guy but my girlfriend ordered the Mango Treasure desert and wow was it good. Will definitely return on my next visit to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Someone recommended this Thai restaurant to us. Glad they did because it was GREAT! First impression, very clean and stylist. Felt very welcomed by the staff who were VERY helpful. The food was presented like a work of art... Everything was bursting with perfect authentic flavors... And the dessert was mouth watering! The prices were reasonable... We will definitely be back or order for delivery since we are only 5 mins away!!! A great find!!"}
{"text":"Great restaurant! Recommend it to anyone who loves Thai food.  The staff is friendly as they made us feel very welcomed.  They took the time to explain in detail what they do.  

Food is delicious as we had the Crispy Catfish, Chicken Satay and Mango Island dessert. Everything is fresh and shortcuts are not taken! 

Will definitely return and recommend to everyone as it is a hidden gem in Commercial Center.  Very close to the strip as it is down the street from the SLS hotel."}
{"text":"With all of the Thai restaurants in town, it's easy to miss a few places. I really wish I would of found this place sooner. If this place was in a hotel on the strip it would get the notoriety it deserves. Every course was awesome and the service was perfect. We had the lunch specials that came with soup, entree, and dessert. The egg drop soup was hands down the best I've  ever had. We ordered the garlic short ribs and the pad Thai, both were excellent and flavorful. We also ordered the crab fried rice. For dessert they had a parfait with marshmallow and graham crackers...ridiculously good. We will definitely be back to try other dishes."}
{"text":"Wow diamond in a rough. Definitely wouldn't find this place if it wasn't for yelp. Really good presentation of food and way more reasonable than eating on the strip."}
{"text":"Good food, great service with the modern decor!  We heard of this place from a friend.  We decided to come check them out.  They just opened on beginning of June.  We tried all Thais favorite salad Somtum.  It was great. Both dinner we had were good too.  Ended the meal with dessert.  Homemade dessert.  
Keep up the great service."}
{"text":"We came across the nice Thai restaurant inside commercial center. Pleasantly surprised with very new updated interior. I would give it a solid 9 for decoration and surroundings. Very clean and modern decor. The food presentation of each and every platter we order a solid 10. We had several of the appetizers and each one was superb in presentation. The food taste gets an 8 except for the soup we had - now that gets a 10 for taste. My favorite Thai dish is pad Thai and though we ordered the Arawan pas Thai it fell short. It was mainly the noddles, no peanuts (I've always eaten pad Thai with peanuts), and the only protein on this platter was one large prawn sliced in half and nicely decorated ontop. Would I return? Yes I would but will be ordering something other than the pad Thai. And hoping that next time we are there, they have their alcohol license straightened out. On this trip they didn't sell any alcohol and on a Friday night after working all week a glass of wine or a beer would have been great."}
{"text":"Location: Yelp took us to Suite A, but Suite E is not hard to find (Even though we were confused by the vast area)

Interior: Warm welcomed atmosphere. Modern decoration. Cozy furniture. There are horigotatsu (Japanese style seating) section too!

Food: My friend recommended Kao Mun Gai (Hainan chicken rice), Guay Jub and Kao Ka Moo.... but they ran out all of them!! So we tried Chicken Wings (Marinated with Tom Yum sauce), Tom Kha Gai (Coconut soup), Pad Thai and Arawan Duck instead. Normally I do not order Pad Thai because most of Thai restaurants make them so sweet. But for this place, it is a must! 

We finished our meal with Roti and homemade thai tea gelato. We were not disappointed. Their food presentations are awesome! 10/10!

Service: Triple A. Attentive. Amazing. Awesome."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery to my hotel.  Delivery was quick and the driver was nice.  I ordered the arawan fresh roll with shrimp, spicy mint and spicy green beans.

Portions were small.  The fresh roll was basically lettuce and a cut up shrimp.  The main dishes lacked any depth.  When you think of a dish that boasts of chili garlic basil you'd expect a whole lot of flavor.  Ii got bland food that bordered on Chinese.

Not even close to lotus of Siam."}
{"text":"Appearance: I love the \"If you never try you'll never know\" sign, it's absolutely true. Once you enter you totally forget you are in a commercial center. The decor is simply beautiful.

Food: Great upscale Thai food. Definitely not what you'd expect. I especially enjoy the lunch special. I love that they put tons of care into their presentation. Even the water is served with fresh fruit and mint!  The desserts are almost too beautiful to eat :)

Customer service: Wonderful. Staff is friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. Very attentive. 

Overall: Arawan is one of my top spots for Thai food. If I could have lunch there every day I would!!"}
{"text":"We were very impressed with how good and authentic their Thai food was in this place. Everything we ordered was just delicious! The restaurant was clean, the staff was attentive, food was fresh. The price is on the higher scale of what you would typically pay for a mid gourmet Thai food but it's you really get what you pay for. Something this good speaks for itself so I'll end my review with, this is by far the BEST Thai restaurant in town."}
{"text":"I stopped here before going to the Smith Center to see a show.  I was the only one in the restaurant during the entire time I was there, so things were quiet and service was excellent. 

After checking the menu--it's different than the one online--I ordered a small bowl of Tom Yum soup.  For the main course, I ordered soft shell crab pad pong karee.  I also ordered a Thai iced coffee.  When I was asked for the spiciness of both dishes, I was given a scale of mild, medium, or spicy.  I asked for medium to spicy and the server said I'll put medium ++.  My receipt shows them both as medium.  

Before ordering, I was brought three fried wonton pieces with chile sweet and sour sauce much like noodles in a Chinese restaurant.

The iced coffee and a glass of water and a carafe of water were brought.  There was a fresh rose in a glass on the table.  When my soup came, it was perfect.  The right size for a person dining alone and seasoned spicier than medium but not burn your mouth hot.  The broth was excellent.  The soup was not overwhelmed with lemongrass as some Thai places do.  This was an auspicious start to the evening!

Then the soft shell crab was brought along with a small bowl of rice.  The spiciness of the crab was opposite the soup.  In fact, there was little flavor to the sauce itself.  The flavor of the dish came from the crab and the vegetables in the dish.  On a scale of 1 to 5 for spiciness, this dish was 0. This was a big disappointment!  I should have ordered the duck as I was planning.

I ordered the sweet sensation banana Thai pancake with Thai iced tea ice cream.  The dessert was fine.  The pancake was tough and the ice cream had little taste.  The presentation was excellent with a small square of chocolate with the Arawan logo on it.

Service was excellent and not simply because I was the only person there.  I can see the people giving courteous and friendly service to all customers.  The room is nicely done aand so open compared to the restaurant it replaced.

I'm not sure if I will return.  There are so many good Thai restaurants that we have to choose from and there's no reason to accept an entrée lacking as much as this was."}
{"text":"My 2nd time here in two weeks. The 1st time was off the good good. Last night, I was embarrassed taking my friends there. What happened??  Coconut dessert was delicious though! 

Averaging the score leaves me to put down 3 1/3 stars."}
{"text":"??????
???????????????????
??????????????????????????????????????"}
{"text":"Authentic Thai restaurant and some unique dishes not found anywhere else. Love the egg shells over the pad thai. Heavy on fish sauce-more traditional. Love the loose leaf tea selection"}
{"text":"I give Arawan 4 stars for the food but only 1 or 2 stars for the price. Definitely way over priced Thai food. Arawan is a cute little restaurant with a fairly small menu that's almost double the price of most the restaurants. We went there for lunch and my husband ordered the Thai beef salad which cost $20. Yes $20 for some steak on top of lettuce. No rice included. He said the salad was good but the meat was not high quality and a little hard to chew. For $20 you should be getting a good quality meat. I ordered the glass noodle salad which was good but again overpriced. I paid $16 for my salad which is basically some noodles with ground chicken and only 2 shrimp. I get much more food at Archies for a lower price. The dessert was good. We had the mango island which cost $12. My coconut juice was $5.00 and my husbands Thai tea was over $4.00. All in all we spent over $70.00 for two salads two drinks and one dessert. They do have a lunch special which had limited items so it may not be so bad if you go and order from the lunch menu. There is just to many good Thai restaurants in town to pay so much for similar food."}
{"text":"Definitely a hole in the wall Thai Bistro. Hard to find located in a big mom and pop style partially empty lot shopping center. However, as you open the door to the restaurant; you will be surprised with a cool air conditioned, clean comfy cozy ambiance. Food is not typical Thai food. Items on the menu have its twist of elegance and unique display. We had the Penang curry which was light enough for a hot day but well flavored. The shrimp pad Thai was uniquely put together in a egg net. Crispy duck was a bit dry."}
{"text":"I am glad we found this place. The food and desserts were delicious! The presentation of their dishes were very eye appealing and tasty as well. Their Arawan Pad Thai is by far the most pretty Pad Thai dish I have seen on all Thai restaurants I have been to. Try it! The lemongrass chicken wings were very tasty as well. We were full, but could not resist in trying their desserts. Beautifully decorated and very delicious. I really enjoyed the ambiance of this place. Very modern and spacious. I would definitely come back here when I am in Las Vegas. Thank you for a lovely dinner experience."}
{"text":"They got us waiting for food  40 mins. We ordered a beer but the forgot to bring until we asked again. Forgot to bring soups even they are supposed to come before the main dishes. We had to ask again. Will never come."}
{"text":"Found Arawan on the web.  Close to the strip and good reviews.  Crappy, rundown shopping center, but inside of restaurant is pretty nice.  Ordered Singha beer, egg rolls, and Spicy Mint (basil) with beef. 

Beer was great, egg rolls were mushy, and the entree was incredibly salty.  I ordered the entree medium hot at the advice of the waiter and it was not spicy at all. The beef in the entree was ground.  I thought that was weird.

The services was good and I did not try dessert."}
{"text":"Had lunch with my boyfriend here.

Very cute and quaint inside. Great customer Service! The waitress new the menu inside and out.

I had the crab fried rice that had real chunks of crab. Seasoned lightly with a little spice.

Rib Eye was nice and tender with just hint of spice.

The spring rolls tasted fresh and veggies were crisp. The dessert was presented nicely and was nice & sweet."}
{"text":"I ordered on the Yelp app dinner for me and my boyfriend for pick up. Even though my order was a little wrong (I had ordered vegetarian pad Thai but they gave us shrimp pad Thai) they were more than happy to remake my order right away while giving us ice cold waters and letting us sit in the main area with other patrons. The ambiance is really cool and I would definitely come back and recommend to others."}
{"text":"Best Thai food I've ever eaten!  Fabulous service and the owner, Tom, is very gracious.  An oasis in a desert of so so Vegas restaurants.  You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"My family loves this place. The service and decor are amazing. The food along with its presentation are great. We've actually never had to wait for a table here. It's really a hole in the wall in Vegas. Hopefully it doesn't become too popular or it'll get crowded. We always keep this place in mind for any special dinners and I recommend this to anyone who likes Thai food!"}
{"text":"Delicious food with both bold and subtle flavors. The yellow curry is my favorite. The restaurant is nicely decorated and the staff are friendly and efficient.  They have done a great job of providing quality dining with a touch of elegance and delicious food while not being too pricey.  I enjoy dining here and will return."}
{"text":"Very good service. Not your typical Thai restaurant. Food was great! Try the crispy catfish. But u'll need at least 4 people to eat it. Also had the pad see ew, yellow curry, ribeye basil. All good food  Loved the desserts too! Real vanilla bean in the creme brûlée. Thai tea ice cream with the banana crepe was delish! Yummm!!"}
{"text":"Kori is the sweetest server in the world!    This is the best Thai restaurant in town.  Not just another hole in the wall place!"}
{"text":"We had a fantastic meal here.  We are Lotus of Siam lovers, but couldn't get a table there.  This is a much nicer, more relaxed room than Lotus.  Great service, great interesting thai food, and insane desserts.  We LOVED IT."}
{"text":"Walked over from the north strip -- when we entered the overall \"strip mall\", which is a bit downtrodden, sort of wondering.  But really nice restaurant.  The decor has that modern Thai look that I like.  Very clean, comfortable, great decor.  Service was very good.  They have the traditional menu items you expect, but also their versions -- The short rib yellow curry ($20 I think) got a good review at our table and my black ink pasta with seafood was really good ($24).  Presentation was beautiful.  Decent wine list-- simple, but some good, reasonable choices.  This is \"upscale\" Thai, but the prices are reasonable.  Flavors really good.  As I said, I was wondering a bit when I was walking over, but I was so glad I did as it really was the right break from the bustle of the convention and the strip."}
{"text":"This off the strip restaurant looks very nice on the inside. The food is decent not really exceptional. We order the vegetarian egg roll, pineapple fried rice without shrimp and yellow curry. While the entrees were good, the egg roll was ordinary. I have had better egg rolls in other less nice looking Thai places. The main issue was the thick the fried dough. The portion sizes are small but also not super small. Each entree is good for one person at the most, which is unlike most Thai places. 

The desserts look fantastic and I am sure they tasted fantastic. However, we were not super adventurous and decided to try their chocolate mousse cake. It was fantastic. I wish we could have tried their creme brûlée which looked like it was masterfully crafted. Too late! Maybe next time"}
{"text":"We've been to this restaurant several times.  The first time was a wow, the second was not all that great, but now they are going down in quality and quantity.  There are 2 other choices of Thai food in the same parking lot.  Lotus of Siam is the best, more down to earth as opposed to this one which is more high end, and more costly.  Their desserts are great though.  If you haven't tried,  I would still recommend Arawan, but make sure you try the Mango dessert.  Their padthai was great, the sea bass was not up to par."}
{"text":"From the outside this place looks like a dive. However, it is a transformation when you walk in. Very upscale modern look. Very nice and casual dress is ok. 

From a food perspective, my dish (spicy mint-vegan style) was excellent. I ordered medium spice and it was just the right spice. Very fresh and delicious! I'll definitely be back.

I would say that if you are in a hurry, the service is not completely fast. That's not a negative as you can tell the food is freshly cooked. I put this out there as you may want to have some time to enjoy the ambience and the relaxing environment."}
{"text":"Arawan Thai Bistro is an awesome restaurant. They have feature traditional flavor profiles enhanced by their unique presentation style.  Their flavor profiles are spot on Thai enhanced with creative plating. For example we had their shrimp pad thai which features a net made from egg. The net holds the noodles together in a package. Most pad thai chefs just mix an egg in willy nilly. Not Arawan, they had to go and make a net package out of the egg. (See photo). I have never seen that before. So delicious  and inventive. Their pad that is a perfect balance of flavors; tamarind, fish sauce and coconut sugar. Get it as spicy as you want or mild. We also loved their crab fried rice. It it pressed into a cylinder shaped mountain of crabby goodness, shot through and through with big chunks of fresh crab. Light, and not greasy like most fried rice.  We also enjoyed their Thai iced tea with our dinner.  Arawan also features an extensive desert menu with lots of unique creations. The staff is super friendly and attentive, our water glasses were always topped off and our server checked on us frequently. Park for free in the adjoining lot. Overall, highly recommend."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best Thai food I have ever had. 

Located in the commercial center with two other very well regarded Thai restaurants, I wasn't sure how well this place was going to do. It definitely deserves a spot among the best.

The ambiance is classy without being uptight. The wicker chairs are a pleasure to sit in. The service was prompt. Everything was clean. 

The Short Rib Yellow Curry is where it's at. This will not disappoint. The rib has plenty of tender meat that melts in your mouth. The roasted vegetables pair wonderfully with the curry. Spoon that curry on everything. I went with medium spice for the curry and got the perfect blend of taste and heat. 

The Arawan Pad Thai is presented like a work of art. Beautiful criss-cross pattern and it's loaded with prawns. The prices are a bit higher than other Thai restaurants but it's definitely worth it. 

The atmosphere, the presentation, the food. This place has it and at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"We came here because we we're craving Thai and the hype from this restaurant was great. We go for lunch and there was no wait so we sit as soon as we get in. We take our time searching the menu for all the goodies we wanted to try. Finally we are ready to order we start with BBQ, broccoli beef, pineapple shrimp fried rice, beef curry (mild). He has to come back 2 more times the first to tell us they don't have any BBQ beef, the second to tell us he was also out of BBQ chicken. The ambiance was nice and quiet, the service was very good. But the fact that they didn't have any BBQ ready was bothersome. The food was good not great but that can be because it wasn't my style. Lastly for the restaurant to be so lovely their bathrooms were not. They got another star off from that alone.

PS
Note the no alcohol. I didn't do that before going in just because I don't drink but I was with a person who did. I do not want that to affect this review so I put a PS."}
{"text":"Let's start with the ambience. Really cool and chic! The prices are pretty high for OKAY Thai food. I'm surprised the ratings for this place is pretty high because it didn't wow me. I'm pretty disappointed but what can I do you have to try out new restaurants to see what's out there.
So we ordered our standard Thai dishes which was the typical pad Se ewe, wings, and yellow curry. I mean you def can't go wrong with those dishes. But no, I was wrong. The pad Se ewe lacked in flavor. Very Bland... The curry was okay it needed a kick. And the white rice was so soggy!! Who wants to eat soggy rice with their dishes?? I sure don't. It messes the whole dish up. 
The wings were the best actually.
Another thing that made me disappointed, was one of our servers. I received a bit of an attitude requesting a spice rack. It was surprising to me because we were the only ones at the restaurant."}
{"text":"Why the quick update? Menu changes, yo. Why the drastic downgrade? Read on.

My opinion of Arawan was already trending downward after my second visit for lunch. The chicken pad see ew lunch special was underwhelming compared to some pad see ew dishes that I'd had in the past. The protein portion was small, which perhaps I should have taken as a warning because chicken is such a cheap protein, and it was undersauced compared to most restaurants' takes on the dish. The cream cheese dessert wasn't very memorable either. For context on how this changes things numbers-wise, this whole lunch was at best (what some would phrase as) a 3.75 star rating.

I went back to Arawan less than a month after that for lunch. I was very surprised to learn that they'd gotten rid of their $9.95 lunch specials menu and replaced it with a bit of a beast. There are now 21 \"plates\" available weekdays 11am-3pm, in contrast with 10 options on the old menu. Unfortunately, other than the Mixed Vegetable dish ($10), the dishes are all $12-19. I was also shocked that they'd removed the beef panang curry from this section, although to be fair it's still present in another section of the menu.

The salad was the same, and it was served with the crispy noodles mixed in / dressed now instead of placed awkwardly on the side as before. My first disappointment was when I realized that they'd stopped serving the egg drop soup with the lunch special. You may recall from my first review that I loved that soup, and if so, you'll understand my despair.

Then my entree arrived, the Duck Drunken Noodles ($15). Again, it was underwhelming in overall flavor. It's solidly a notch below the dish at another local Thai restaurant that launched my love affair with drunken noodles. The duck portion was frankly pathetic. I know duck isn't the cheapest protein, but the price was higher than baseline dishes, and I only got maybe 3 or 4 pieces of duck meat, and 2 to 3 pieces of skin.

The \"coffee cake\" dessert was slightly tinier than I'd expected. Good flavor, not too sweet, but somewhat of an afterthought. 

I may come back to Arawan for dinner to give them a fair shot at their best dishes and dessert. For now though, I don't envision myself returning for lunch, even if the next closest option for Thai gives me stomachaches (that's Komol, by the way). They just left me with a sour taste."}
{"text":"Must try if you're in Las Vegas. Nice staffs, very welcoming. Liked everything we had even their water with fresh strawberries!  Good presentation in every dishes even not the signature menus. Their desserts are made fresh which you can see the server making puff starch right behind drink corner. Not recommend ordering desserts when they're busy cuz the servers have to do it themselves."}
{"text":"The service was amazing. I would give that 5 stars for sure. But I didn't care for the food. I kept thinking about getting up and going to Komol instead. Sometimes it's good to try new places. I'm glad I tried it. But I am not sure if I will return."}
{"text":"Nice ambiance, friendly service, and delicious food. The portions were perfect and dessert was a work of art. They seated us without a reservation and even let us in while wearing golf clothes. Everyone else was dressed nicely so I don't recommend doing that! Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant in Las Vegas. Good prices, gourmet and killer desserts. I dare to say on par with Lotus without the wait times. Favorite dishes would be the chicken wings for appetizer, duck curry, Phad Thai was the best my co-worker ever had and he's from Chicago culinary.

Dessert... I love the Roti Pancakes with banana dripped in Carmel sauce. Yum... Do it!

LV Local speaking truth!"}
{"text":"Drove all the way across town to check this place out due to raving 5 star Yelp reviews. 

The food is mediocre, sorry but this is coming from someone who's Thai. I appreciate the food design on plates but the flavor just isn't there. 

Service = 5 stars

From the moment we walked in, to the moment we left, staff was friendly and attentive. 

Restaurant became busy after 630pm (weekend) and service was still great. 

If they hire a new chef, I might come back."}
{"text":"Arrived during the week for a client luncheon. Located directly next store to Komol and steps from Lotus of Siam, this is the newest Thai restaurant in Las Vegas  is only a few months new. This was our first time any of us dined at Arawan - which I selected.

 After looking over the lunch specials my client asked me to select our lunch which I jumped on the opportunity. I chose the Thai steak salad with mint, crispy lemongrass catfish and short rib yellow curry. We were brought out egg flower soup with crispy fried noodles which tasted different from any egg flower soup I've encountered. It was yummy. We then received the steakThai salad which the beef was tender and delicious, followed by the short rib curry which was another hit. Lastly the whole deep fried catfish arrived, it was beautifully stunning and tasted as delicious as it was presented. The lemongrass sauce for dipping was the just right flavor and not overbearing.

Overall my client was impressed as I was with the decor, food and service. I'll definitely be returning my next trip to Las Vegas."}
{"text":"My wife and I were going to go to Lotus of Saim but they had an hour wait and we saw that this was another Thai place right next door with great reviews. We had been to Lotus of Saim a couple of times in the past and loved it! 

We were extemely happy with the food,  service and atmosphere at Arawan and would recommend this place yo anyone we know!

We will be back!"}
{"text":"Nice ambiance! Excellent customer service! Beautiful presentation! My favorite dessert is the Mango Island"}
{"text":"Lovely small business restaurant. I love the decor and appreciate the attention to detail. 

I have been there 3 different times during lunch and I find it to be consistently good food and decent service. There is a lunch special that includes soup, entree, and a dessert. The portions are generous, hot and delicious that I find the price very reasonable. 

I enjoy ordering the blossoming tea because I think it is beautiful to watch. 

The service is decent, you will often see the owner walking around and helping with service which I consider to be a mark of a well-run restaurant and an invested owner. From one small business to another, this ranks high in my book. There was only one time the waitress took far too long to bring my check which is crucial during lunch time when many are headed back to their offices or to the courthouses which are nearby. 

We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This was probably the best Thai food I've had since going to Thailand 4 years ago. If I lived here, I would legit be at this restaurant every week. We randomly found it online when we were initially looking to go to Lotus of Siam. It's located in the same sketchy strip mall, which is about 10 minutes from the strip. I can definitely overlook the strange location (right near strip clubs/swinger clubs/tranny joints per our uber driver!) for the quality of the food.

I started with the small Tom Yum soup which was amazing. It had incredible flavors and was so authentic with pieces of lemongrass, galangal, and kaffir lime swimming in it. The soup had mushroom and big shrimp in it as well. I did not want that bowl to end! It brought me right back to my cooking class in Chiang Mai and I was in heaven.

I also ordered the Pad thai with tofu which was also delicious. I judge a Thai place by their Pad Thai and most unfortunately, do not get it right. Arawan delivered with authentic Pad Thai that I could not stop eating. I was stuffed to the brim by the end and was so sad to leave some tender well flavored noodles on my plate. The spice was just right as well. 

Service was great and so was the pricing. I only wish a place like this existed in the Philadelphia area!"}
{"text":"The dining experience was fantastic.   My favorite was the the drunken noodles with beef, but also enhoyed the tom yum, panang curry, and ahi tuna larb.  Everything was very authentic and I couldn't wait to try the next dish.  The wait staff was very friendly and made great recommendations. The setting was intimate and a great place for a date.  I will definitely be making another stop here on my next trip back to Vegas."}
{"text":"Perfect place for lunch, dinner, or dessert (especially dessert)! 

I've been here a few times with friends and family, but the ambience is so nice that it was the perfect place for date night. The always have fresh flowers,  relaxing music, and the service is fast and friendly. More importantly,  the food is delicious! 

They're open weekdays for dinner, but also have lunch on weekends.  Lunch specials cone with a tiny dessert,  but you'll want to order a full one too!

All the food I've had had been yummy, but here are the faves:

So far my favorite dish is the short rib yellow curry. While it's a little pricy (around $22 I believe) the meat is so tender and flavorful. Must try! 

Another one not to miss is the Arawan pad thai. One of the tastiest pad thais I've had,  plus the presentation is very impressive. They wrap the noodles in a net made of egg, and top it off with giant prawns. 

Ok, the desserts. They have a little nook in the corner where they prepare their desserts. They're prepared to order,  and they look amazing. It kinda reminds me of Sweets Raku, but with a lot more seating space. 

I usually get the Mango Island as a standard,  plus another for fun haha.  All the desserts are good,  but their signature has so many flavors and textures, and looks like a cute little edible terrarium. Nice for sharing. 

Always a good experience here!"}
{"text":"Decided to treat myself on my way home from work and though I felt severely underdressed for such a nice place, the staff didn't bat an eye at my steel toe boots, bandana and construction chick attire.  

The food and service was thoroughly fantastic. I ordered spicy duck curry and the presentation was both beautiful and tiny. No American sized portions here but it truly was the perfect amount of food.

Dessert was an amazing coconut ice cream with coconut flesh, sweet sticky rice and lychee gel cubes... Wow wow wow!!! Again, presentation was stunning and it was so delicious I couldn't help but devour before realizing I didn't take any pics. Sorry yelpers, but believe me, it's definitely worth a try. Fabulous date night place, bringing the man with me next time."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem! Located in a pretty shady area, I was hesitant to come here. I was so happy I did. The inside looks very well kept and has a great ambiance for a date night. I only had one dessert and one entree (the seabass) but it was enough for me to want to come back and try everything!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!!!! Looks scary from the outside but walking in is like.... Whoa. Excellent service overall. Super friendly and professional. Amazing food!!!!!!! All theyre missing is alcohol."}
{"text":"I loved this place and I do give it the ultimate rating.  The food was outstanding and all 4 people went home happy ... I had duck soup which was out of this world.  I was so happy  The noodle dish (drunken noodles) amazing  the short ribs with curry Delish... 
I highly recommend this fine establishment.  The service was almost impeccable (I never received my cucumber salad) ... 
I will definitely be back and hope to
Bring others."}
{"text":"My favorite Thai food in Vegas, I even prefer it to Lotus of Siam. All of the appetizers and curries I have tried have been excellent and the service is always top notch. It's a more relaxed vibe than Lotus and you can almost always get a table without a reservation. Will be back soon!"}
{"text":"This place has been on my radar for a while. It did not disappoint!

Very beautiful on the inside. I was very impressed to see it because commercial center is old and it is probably easy for businesses to kind of leave their space \"as is\" when moving in. The chairs were comfy and I liked the pillows for back support (I sound like my mom right now). 

The water had a little strawberry slice which is a nice little touch. I love pad Thai so much, so I already knew that my first time here, I was going to get their Arawan pad Thai. 

Oh man, their presentation was beautiful. They did some artwork with that. I enjoyed the dish, although I asked for medium and it did not have any sort of spice profile whatsoever. I would have asked the young lady for something to make it spicier, but some people were loudly arguing their bill and change for 15 minutes so I did not get the chance. They were very polite in their interaction with the loud guests. 

My fiancé got the short rib curry. I took
a bit of that tender baby and it was delicious. I know he was pretty satisfied so I look forward to many lunch and dinner dates here with my sweetie to work through their menu!"}
{"text":"Yummy in the tummy!! Arawan is a hidden treasure in an otherwise unassuming shopping plaza off Saraha. The food, the service...well actually just everything here is on point! If you love Thai food, you NEED to come here!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a high end gourmet Thai experience, with extraordinary food and incredible presentations made by people who clearly know and love and celebrate the best in food, then this is your place! The staff is first rate, the chef is exceptional, the food is creative and consistently a feast for the eyes and the palate! I am loyal to restaurants that bring it every single time and I have just added a new treasure to my tour.  

ps. The prices are gorgeous too! WAY less than you'd pay on the Strip, and the quality of the dining experience consistently stacks up against anything available in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"It started with the web page and got even better after we arrived. Biggest parking lot around. Very nice interior decor. The five of us shared a few starters, mains and two desserts. We enjoyed it all. Pad Thai may have won the day but there were close seconds like the black ink squid drunken noodles and the panang curry. Great and speedy service. 5 of us ate for $200 tip included.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Someone turn on the AC because this place is HOT.... like temperature wise. They don't have an AC- even after asking for their small cooler to be turned up I was still sweating. 

The food is as good as it is beautiful. All of the Thai restaurants I have been to up to this point sort of blend together. Arawan stands out. The decor is very modern, the presentation of the food is Instagram worthy and the food doesn't give you that post-MSG hangover feel. 
Their food is light and flavors subtle. Also beautiful presentation does not= small, their portions are big! 

Chicken pad thai: Mild, medium, hot or no spice. My dad went with no spice and loved it. I would suggest going with mild. Pad thai doesn't taste like pad thai if it's not a little spicy! 
Beef yellow curry: My favorite out of the dishes we ordered. It really stood out and was different from previous curries I've had. It had a ton of meat in it! Too much that I couldn't finish it. 
Pineapple fried rice: Very, very subtle taste of pineapple. It was perfect. 

This was the first Thai restaurant that I've been to that gets the rice to curry portion right. Good job guys. I didn't end up with leftover curry and no rice like I normally do :) 
Will be back to try the dessert!...... In the winter when the AC is not a necessity. They have large party rooms with tatami mats in the back. The pictures make them look nicer than they did when I was there...
The outside of the restaurant is not fancy. You get a perfect view of a deserted parking lot, swingers club, discount dentist and raunchy costume store. This would be the perfect place to take your girlfriend on a surprise date with a blindfold. Take if off once you get inside ;)
With a little more work Arawan could be 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Great food. I tried the Tom Ka, Crab Fried Rice, and BBQ Chicken. Chicken was so tender. The Tom Ka has to be the best I ever tasted here in Vegas. I love their interpretation of this soup and consider this soup even better than Lotus of Siam's version. 

Very cozy and impressive décor. Water was also fresh tasting with a strawberry added on the bottom for a unique flavor.

I will definitely be back to try the fabulous looking Pad Thai dish, and now consider this place my favorite Thai spot."}
{"text":"Excellent Thai cuisine off the strip. You can see  plenty of locals dining here--a good sign. Don't let the non-descript exterior and the fact that it's in an old outdoor mall deter you. The interior is surprisingly upscale along w the service and food. The food is terrific as is the presentation. First-class food at reasonable prices. Came here for lunch after checking out Escapology nearby (which is also recommended) and glad we did. Lunch specials come with soup and dessert (fresh mango and sticky rice on our visit). I ordered the Drunken Noodles for lunch. It came with plenty of beef, flat noodles and veggies. Better than what I've had in San Francisco area. My son got the Yellow Curry with chicken. It was also wonderful. And the great thai tea comes with free refills! I would return without hesitation."}
{"text":"I had the Thai spiced sea bass medium spicy. It was great. The medium is pretty spicy. Starter egg roll was good as well. Most importantly the service was good. Just like the experiences in the reviews posted here"}
{"text":"Food was ok, but it is expensive & no line. Service is very good & the setting is not like Thai."}
{"text":"We are fortunate to have a ton of great Thai restaurants in Las Vegas. From Lotus of Siam, Komol, and Pin Kaow to Le Thai & Chads Thai among others. Looks like it's time to add another to that stellar list, Arawan excels in every possible way. The dining room is classy and quaint. The flavors are on point and presentation is modern and upscale. The service is friendly and attentive. Do yourself a favor and visit Arawan immediately, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Food was very yummy and delicious. 

Go to this restaurant if you are really hungry. 

Try drunken noodles for sure."}
{"text":"I've been there twice and it is my \"go-to\" place in Las Vegas for Thai food. (No, I haven't been to the \"other\" Thai restaurant.

Each dish is not only a culinary delight, but a work of art as well.

The staff is gracious and attentive, but not overbearing.

At lunch we had the special.  I had the garlic pork, and my colleague had the drunken noodles.  The garlic pork was very tasty, but could have had a little more \"gravy\" (just a personal preference).

For dessert my colleague had the Creme Brulee and I had a banana pan that wasn't on the website menu, but be assured that it was excellent

I visit Las Vegas 6-10 times a year and each time I travel, if I can get there, I eat at Arawan."}
{"text":"What a serendipitous find!  We came here because Lotus of Siam was closed from roof leaks.  At first we thought it was just a pastry and coffee place but we were pleasantly surprised.  We ordered the lunch specials that came with a dessert.  The vegetarian mint stir fry was really good as well as the chicken curry.  

The service was really good with an eclectic decor.  We were so surprised that good Thai food was so close to each other."}
{"text":"Amazing! Whoever said any sauce, broth or soup lacked flavor.. Your crazy! We had the whole fried catfish, the short rib with curry, and the small soup that had mushrooms shrimp and a cream like sauce and everything was perfect. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"The outside area looks a bit sketchy, but then as soon as you walk through the doors, it's like you're in a whole different world. It's Vegas best kept secrets. Hands down, one of the very best places to eat here. The staff is probably the best you'll ever encounter. The food ALWAYS is freshly made and it is incredibly delicious. This is our favorite date place and we try to come at least 2 times a month. Highly recommend that you try the dessert! Special shout out to our waiter Luis. It was EDC weekend so of course it was super busy, but, judging by quality of his service, you would have never guessed it. He was cool, calm, collected, extremely attentive, friendly and even let us move to our \"usual table\" as soon as it cleared. (Talk about going above and beyond). It's staff like Luis that make this place so special. Also, the atmosphere is one of the best. Thanks Luis and everyone at Arawan. We'll see you soon!"}
{"text":"Terrific Thai food.  I love Thai food and have been to Thailand over 20 times and many times disappointed with Thai food in the US.  This place is very authentic and the foods are  aromatic.  The restaurant is very comfy and nicely decorated but not fancy.  Highly recommended"}
{"text":"we are regular visitors to Vegas from the east coast. my wife is Thai and always enjoys Dining at Lotus of Siam. but the last few visits have had very long wait times and slower service. while welove their authentic dishes, we decided to try the newly opened Arawan Thai located in the same center. dishes have been excellent. service top notch. and the mango with sticky rice superb. so we will avoid the crowds at Lotus and walk a few steps south to our new favorite Thai place in Vegas - Arawan."}
{"text":"All I can really say is wow!!! This place exceeded my expectations by a crazy amount. I actually went to try Lotus of Siam but saw it was still closed. Saw this in the same lot, thought I'd give it a shot. Do not be drawn away by the rough exterior, the inside is very cute and inviting. The lunch special for $9.95 is an incredible deal. They bring you soup (mine was egg flower, best I've ever had), I ordered chicken woodsen pad thai (medium, it was sooo spicy but amazing)...and their dessert chef wasn't here yet, so they brought me a Thai iced tea, it was also amazing. The service was perfect, my experience was amazing, and I can't wait to be back. This was the best Thai food I've ever eaten by far! Wow."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere, great service, amazing Thai food. I often go to other Thai restaurants in the area, and this one popped up recently - so we decide to try it. Their food and service is very competitive with some of the best Thai places in the greater Las Vegas area. We had the chicken chili mint and ribeye dishes. Both were juicy and very flavorful. We ordered medium spicy ness and this was exactly what we were given - not too hot, but still had a kick. I would definitely recommend this restaurant to my friends and family."}
{"text":"Overall ambiance at the restaurant was great. Have a wonderful selection of hot teas and start you off with strawberry water which was a nice little touch. Won ton soup was very flavorful. Yellow curry was very good although even having ordered it mild it still had a kick to it. Would absolutely recommend you try this place if you're in the mood for Thai food."}
{"text":"Very good food! Don't let the store front fool you.  The area os off the strip and shopping center is run down but the food was fabulous!   Service was on point and the o resentati9n of food was beautiful.   The place was pretty, too!"}
{"text":"The only reason I am giving it 4 stars vs. 5 is due to the strange location. If that doesn't scare you away, you'll open the door and be transported to a cute and clean restaurant. I started with the wonton soup. The chicken wontons were flavorful and delicious and I appreciated the fresh and bright veggies. I then ordered the chicken pad see ew from the lunch menu. It was so tasty that ate every. single. bite. If you order from the lunch menu, they also give you an adorable little dessert. It was as scrumptious as it was pleasing on the plate. Since I was stuffed from eating all of my noodles, the petite size was just right. It was perfectly paired with Thai iced coffee. Our waitress was great."}
{"text":"I've been here twice so far, and I e noticed that staff are very prompt, nice, the place is clean, and the food is very delicious. I enjoy the atmosphere, tasty smells from the kitchen that fills the air, and how cozy the place is. Thank you guys."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise this place was! After trying to eat next door at the Sahara Korean Restaurant, and checking all the other \"closed\" restaurants around the block, we popped into this place. It has a very elegant atmosphere, which given the surroundings was a nice surprise.
Our server, Bond? Was very polite, and informed us right away alcoholic beverages weren't served there.

The menu was nice, not a ton of options, but there's nothing wrong with that.

I had the red curry duck, spicy! It did pack a punch, but not so much that it was unbearable. Beautiful presentation, great service. It was really quite nice, and unexpected!!
A+++!"}
{"text":"After a fantastic dinner last year we returned this year to crushing disappointment!
We had reservations for 7 but walked in right behind a group of 7 local girls who spoke to the host in his native language.  Next thing we know, we are shuttled off to the side room. Service was slow & only got worse from here.
It took 90 minutes (yes 90!) for 3 out of 4 appetizers to arrive.  The fourth- never came & the waiter was completely confused about it.  He had it written down, but didn't know why it never came.
3 of our 7 entrees get delivered..no apologies.
A few minutes later,  I go to check things out since no one has come by our table with the rest of our entrees, to apologize or refill drinks.  
I see the waiter in the main room and ask if there was a problem with there remainder of our order.  He says no, he will check on it.  I see the earlier mentioned table of 7 in the main dining room- all with their drinks and entrees.  45 minutes go by and finally the last of our dishes come out.  I tell him to make sure he takes the appetizer that never came off the bill.  He says he will bring it now- no thanks!  He offered a complimentary dessert instead.  
My meal (Drunken Duck) was 1 star at best.  The noodles were congealed together and it was lukewarm.
When he came by for dessert, I told him we weren't interested and he was annoyed that I wouldn't order a dessert, that I wouldn't eat, to make him feel better about the bad service.  He could have comped a number of items from the meal we ordered but chose not to.
Over three hours from start to finish with 7 of us talking about how bad the service was and disappointing the food was.  
Save yourself the trouble- the whole experience was inhospitable, rude and not good."}
{"text":"First off, I love the vibe of this place. I was a little surprised to hear light jazz in the background of a Thai restaurant, but it worked well with the overall setting. The decor is as hip as any new restaurant can be without feeling pretentious.

The food was all light and fresh, with just a very subtle hint of spiciness. The Arawan Fresh Rolls are similar to spring rolls you'll get elsewhere. The Pad See Ew was great, and not as oily as Lotus of Siam. The Ribeye Crispy Basil is one of the more expensive things on the menu, but totally worth it - lightly pan fried Thai basil leaves atop slices of ribeye steak and thinly-sliced veggies with young green Thai peppercorns. Dee-lish. The Spicy Mint (ground beef) was tasty, too. I could have done without the Fried Tofu appetizer, but I don't think it's on the menu they're about to debut.

Con:
No liquor license yet (as of 8/5/2015)"}
{"text":"Amazing pad Thai! Loved the spicy peanut sauce. Great service will defiantly be back!"}
{"text":"The best dessert everrrrrrr! We ordered the mango island and shared it. Totally regret not ordering the Coconut Island as well ! We devoured the Mango Island and wanted to lick the glass! Seriously you HAVE to order their desserts! We had the papaya salad, tom yum soup and pad sey yew. Everything was delicious! Especially the soup! The flavors were so well balanced without being overly spicy or sour and they give you a lot of mushrooms and shrimps (unlike other restaurants that barely give you anything in their soups). I can't wait to come back here and try the other items! The staff are all very friendly and the space is clean w a modern look."}
{"text":"Gotta say, best Thai food in Vegas hands down. We started with the Tom Ka which was perfect, followed by the Squid Ink Drunken noodles and the Orange Chicken. Service was speedy and the staff were friendly. The atmosphere was relaxing also, feels upscale and casual. Definitely will come here again!"}
{"text":"Great food. We ordered pad Thai, rib eye steak dish, orange chicken and chowmein 
Everything was amazing."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai restaurant. Food and presentations are beyond wonderful and services are great especially Apple. We will definitely come back here every time we go Vegas."}
{"text":"Superb!! We enjoyed our dinner from beginning to end. Arawan is definitely in my top three of Thai restaurants in Las Vegas. 
Like most Yelp reviews these are the musts haves for your first visit (though what ever you explore on the menu will be well worth your venture)
but for the first visit.....
ARAWAN PAD THAI..... Immaculate presentation, and the taste is not far behind! Delicious!
CRAB FRIED RICE..... so light fluffy... flavorful.... yum!
CRISPY LEMONGRASS CATFISH ..Whole catfish crispy-fried and topped with lemongrass, fresh mint, red onion, garlic, cashews, crispy basils and a homemade semi-spicy dressing.......Yes!!! again..... Yes!!!! 
For some odd reason I did not get this on my first visit to Arawan, but I will highly recommend you try the catfish! Even if you are like me and not a big catfish fan.... this one is different... it is Amazing!!!! I beg you... try the catfish!
Our dessert was the Banana Puff. It is Caramel banana ice creme, crispy puff pastry, banana, strawberry, chantilly creme, caramel sauce, walnut, walnut chocolate sauce. Oooooo yeah!
Gotta add this to your bookmarks!"}
{"text":"The entrees and Mango Island were incredible.  Yellow curry was perfection.   Service however was quite poor.  The service problems began the moment we walked in.  We arrived 5 minutes before our reservation, yet several others without reservations walked in after us and were seated right away while we had to sit for another 20 minutes and wait.  Once we sat at our table, we waited 15 minutes before being greeted by the waitress. Everything continued without issues until dessert. We placed our order for dessert and waited another 20 minutes before dessert was served.  A+ for the food (some of the best Thai I've had), D+ for service."}
{"text":"Experience:  I've heard good things about this place, and when my friend said she was in the mood for Thai, I brought her here to try it out. It was noon on a Friday. 

Facility: This place is pretty nice. It has a very upscale feel with beautiful tables and chairs and elegant decor. I loved they had a different fresh flower on every table. This would be a great date night restaurant. 

Service:  The service was very good here. Fairly attentive and when we asked for a big portion to go of what was left on our plates, they came out to find out if there was a problem with the food so they could \"improve\" anything. I like that. :)

Food: They serve a slice of strawberry in the very elegant water glass, which I thought classed it up. 
We ordered the lunch deals, which is a choice of a main dish, rice on the side, soup, and a dessert for $9.99. 
The soup was an egg drop soup 3/5 with some fried noodles to drop in. Something was a tad sweet, which I threw it off for me. I think it was the noodles. 
My main dish was the Chicken Pad See Ew 4/5. It had a good flavor, but it was a tad mushy. The spice level I asked for the spiciest, and it was more like a med spice. 
For dessert, they bring a slice of blueberry cheesecake 4/5. I was too full, but took one bite to taste and it was very good. 

Overall:  I liked this place. Great atmosphere!!!  The food was good, but I'd like to come back for dinner and try something else. For the record, I like this better than the Thai neighbors in commercial center ... K and LOS. ;)"}
{"text":"It felt like a slight mission finding this place considering we went on a night full of detours due to the RnR half marathon, but it was well worth it!

The place itself is in a very large and outdated shopping center, but this place upon entering is very cute and well decorated. We were seated promptly and given a complimentary appetizer by our waitress. The service was great, both our waitress as well as the manager (we think he was the manager) were very attentive and friendly during our entire time there, making sure we had everything we needed. 

As far as food goes, very delish! I ordered the shrimp with green beans and ordered it with the hot sauce per our waitress's recommendation. My bf ordered the pad see ew with beef and it was also really good. I also had a lychee black tea (hot) that was so light and perfect on a cold, rainy and windy night! The thing that really put everything over the top was the creme brulee! OMG, it was very delicious and the presentation was beautiful! So glad to have opted for dessert! 

I would definitely make the trek here again next time I'm in town!"}
{"text":"I came here last night with my friends by recommendation. The food was delicious, the presentation was impressive as well, but they had us waiting for a good minute for our check. Then when I finally paid the tab they came out with \" sorry we gave you the wrong bill.\" My guests and I didn't like their lag time for the bill. I understand you were busy but from a management point of view, but you might want to schedule more people on a busy night as expected. The food was amazing though!"}
{"text":"So Tasty! Food was one of the best Thai I've had but service was OK...would recommend!"}
{"text":"We have decided that Las Vegas wins the 'don't judge a restaurant by its exterior\" award.  In the same totally rundown strip mall as Lotus of Siam, Arawan is hidden behind an even-less inviting exterior.  Two steps through the door and you realize you are in for a special experience.  The interior is simple but lovely with comfortable seating throughout.  We were greeted by a lovely waitress who explained all the unusual menu items.  Each dish was sublime in both flavor and presentation from the Tom Kah Gah through the beautiful, handcrafted desert.  A memorable dining experience which we look forward to repeating."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Thai place in Vegas and I've probably been to about 10 of them in town. The prices are a little expensive during dinner, but an appetizer, one entree and dessert is definitely enough for you and date. Come during lunch for the special and you will get full off of the lunch special for a really good price. I recommend getting the Short Rib Yellow curry for your entree. The Mango Island for dessert is also very good."}
{"text":"Have been wanting to try this place since it opened.  And I truly have to say EVERYTHING was amazing.  We had the crispy lemongrass catfish, ribeye crispy basil, and of course I had to the kao min kai and the kao kha moo.  The catfish and the ribeye is a must try.  As of dessert we had the creme brulee and the sweet sensation.  Beautiful!!!! Most of the time I would only like one or two things from a restaurant.  But everything was perfect."}
{"text":"Everything about this place is great, from the cleanliness of the interior to the aesthetically-plated dishes. The staff is also very polite and friendly. I came here for dinner with a couple of friends. We ordered individual dishes and they all were brought out in a timely fashion. For appetizers, they brought out some wonton chips and a sweet/spicy dipping sauce. Delicious! We also ordered the Tom Kah Chicken soup, which was sour enough from the lemongrass to tease our taste buds.

I ordered the Crispy Pork Belly with Chinese Broccoli. OMG. So good! The bite-size pieces of fatty pork were seasoned well and the acidity of the Chinese broccoli was a nice balance to the overall saltiness. I would definitely order this again or even take it to go after trying something else!

My friends ordered the Garlic Short Ribs and the Short Rib Yellow Curry. The Garlic Short Ribs were good. You might want to use your fingers to get all the meat off the bones. Personally, they were probably cooked a minute too long as they were a little too chewy for my taste. The Short Rib Yellow Curry was also good. As they set the plate down, the huge rib of meat jiggled and glistened in the light and I could tell it was perfectly cooked. And it was! The curry itself was also tasty. No complaints here.

The desserts probably stole the show. We ordered the Vanilla Bean Créme Brûlée and the Earthquake. The Earthquake was fun. You pour the hot raspberry sauce over the chocolate ball. As the chocolate melts, the lychee sorbet inside is slowly revealed. The sorbet was good, but probably too sweet for my taste and a bit too tart. The creme brûlée was yummy! Order one of your own and don't share! This one is beautifully plated. The candied sugar cage will crumble as you give it a light tap with your spoon. The crust on the creme brûlée was perfect and nothing was too sweet.

Everything about this visit was pleasant, except for the point lighting, which I thought was too harsh at times. It was difficult getting the right picture as my own shadow would cast too harshly over the food. There are lots of dishes to choose from and I will definitely be back to try more! I noticed the family next to us ordered a whole catfish that looked delicious. Maybe I'll try that next!"}
{"text":"Authentic, delicious, great value and wonderful staff!  Best experience in Vegas - twice!"}
{"text":"Hidden gem on East side of Sahara, excellent pad thai and amazing desserts. Five stars."}
{"text":"If you find yourself in Las Vegas do not miss going to dinner at Arawan! The food is incredible, shared the Crispy Lemongrass Catfish with my boss and we couldn't stop raving about it. In fact, we went back the next day for another amazing dinner of Short Rib Yellow Curry and Squid Ink Drunken Noodles - equally as incredible. The flavor combinations are wonderful.

Then it's time for dessert. Chef Gail creates beautifully constructed desserts that are equally amazing to look as they are to taste! Again, flavor combinations are out of this world.

On top of all of this is great service. 

My highest recommendation to Arawan Thai Bistro and Dessert.

A must try on your next trip to Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"We took my mom here on Mother's Day. The restaurant is a little hard to find since the navigation guides you to the other side of the plaza - a pretty sketchy looking area - but it's definitely worth eating at.

The inside of the restaurant is nicely decorated and has a good ambiance. The food tasted AMAZING and used some unique ingredients and garnishes. For appetizers we ordered calamari and fresh spring rolls. We got the squid ink noodles, duck curry, and ribeye steak as entrees. For dessert we got the coconut treasure, crème brûlée, and chocolate lava cake - all amazing as well. Overall, the whole experience was very good. Our server (Chinta?) was funny and attentive. The food had a great looking presentation and flavor.

The only negative comment I have is that the pricing is high for the portion size. The spring roll entree was one roll cut up into about 6 pieces. Each entree was ~$20+ and just enough for one person and a bite or two for someone else to try. I think if there was a bit more food I wouldn't mind frequenting this place more often instead of just for special occasions."}
{"text":"The food here was delicious. I ordered chicken pad Thai and it came wrapped in an egg shell and was very good. Everyone that I was with really enjoyed their meals."}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Ordered tea for the dinner but got them after all the meal is done. Complaint about it and they argued saying that we only ordered 5 minutes ago. It's definitely more than 5 minutes. Such a small thing and really ruin the whole dinner by arguing with us.

I hate server that arguing with cuatomer. What's the point?"}
{"text":"5 star from cleanliness to service to food! Went in for dinner, got seated right away. Yelp reviews lead me to this restaurant. Im a sucker when it comes to thai food! Yummm! It's a little joint in a ghetto area, but once ur inside the restaurant, it feels different! It has this upscale casual ambiance. Place is clean! Servers are very friendly. Always had our water refilled. We had calamari for app, took about 5 mins to serve. Then I had mild panang curry shrimp and bf had the pad thai! Took about 10 minutes to serve. We also tried their vanilla creme brulee. Everything was excellent!!"}
{"text":"The biggest issue this restaurant has is location. It is in a tiny old strip mall. The area is a bit cleaned up but still lacks the classy atmosphere you find indoors!
This restaurant serves up fresh gourmet Thai foods. The flavored are wonderful! I'm really excited they are so close to me!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch on a weekday because of all the raving reviews! I'm so glad I did. It's pretty far from where I live but definitely worth it. 

They have an affordable lunch menu. I opted for the chicken panang curry. The flavors were alllll there & it was so spot on. I don't remember which spice level I got (probably 4/5) but I just remember the curry being super delicious!! The plate also comes with soup & a dessert. I'm pretty sure everything was under $10 - amazing food & great prices!! The soup wasn't bland - pretty flavorful. The dessert was some sort of cake topped with a scoop of ice cream - yummy!! 

The service here is impeccable! The servers made sure my water was topped off & always asked if i was doing okay, not in an annoying way though. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Stepping through the doors transports one from the decrepit Commercial Center into a  beautifully decorated, bright and impeccably clean dining room.  We were greeted cheerfully on entering and experienced similar hospitality throughout our meal.  Our visit was scheduled in order to take advantage of the 3-course, $9.95 luncheon special that is offered on weekdays.  The first course of egg drop soup is not what comes to mind when dining in a Thai restaurant though it was probably the lightest and best we have ever experienced.  Entrees of Pad Thai and BBQ chicken were shared with the former being slightly over sauced while the latter a tad overdone though the wing and thigh meat were juicy.  The last course was a raspberry panna cotta that was a light and delicious conclusion to our filling meal."}
{"text":"Arawan is a Thai restaurant located in the same strip mall as the original Lotus of Siam restaurant(my favorite Thai restaurant in the States). It was a spontaneous lunch date since I was pressed for time for my flight back to LA. 

The restaurant was actually larger than what I expected. It was nicely decorated and the chairs were super comfortable. It was simple, yet elegant. 

The menu itself was large but not overwhelming. There was a variety of the usual dishes to choose from, i.e. noodles, soup, curries and rice dishes. I wanted to stick with their most popular dishes.

Larb ($14.00): Ground chicken tossed in spicy lime dressing with rice powder, red onion, green onion and cilantro-served with lettuce. The larb was actually quite tasty. We asked for mild and it was the perfect level of spice. I  thought it was refreshing since the lime cut through the heaviness of the dish. 
 
KA MOO ARAWAN ($15.00): Stew pork hog with boiled egg and steam Chinese broccoli. This dish was nothing special. It was tasty, but reminded me of a Chinese dish my mom would make than a Thai dish. It has a slightly sweet taste from the soy sauce and the Chinese broccoli was cooked perfectly. 

MY FAVORITE DISH. ARAWAN PAD THAI ($22.00): Fresh prawn wok-stir fried in a tamarind sauce with rice noodle, slice chicken, peanut, green onions and bean sprouts-wrapped with lattice egg and side of crushed peanuts. This dish was amazing. I normally wouldn't care for pad thai, but the watier recommended it and said it was one of the most popular dishes. Seriously though, I can totally see why...it's beautifully presented and there was tons of flavor. The pad thai wasn't overly sauced and it wasn't dry either. It was made perfectly. At $22, it better be though. 

DUCK RED CURRY ($18.00): Roasted duck in a red curry coconut milk broth with red peppers, zucchini, tomato, grapes, pineapple, asparagus and sweet basil leaves. The flavor of the curry was good but it wasn't anything memorable. I thought the duck was quite dry and it was disappointing. The pineapple was actually a nice touch to the dish but that was the only thing great about it. I would pass. 
 
Overall, I thought Arawan is a decent Thai spot if you want a change from Lotus of Siam. The place is also known for desserts, but unfortunately, they do not serve it during lunch. The service was good, always making sure the water was full. The food was served pretty fast as well. I think what made this place stick out was the pad thai and I would literally just visit Arawan for that noodle dish."}
{"text":"Typically love this place. But definitely slipping in the last 2 months.

Ordered the same entree one shrimp and one beef. Got shrimp and chicken by mistake and accepted the chicken. Both dishes were too spicy were sent back. Server told us that we could only a reorder the chicken, no beef. But we  originally ordered the beef. Very strange.

Also, service was super slow.

I will give it one more try."}
{"text":"I normally don't give 5 stars for first visit, but based on our experience, they really do deserve it.  I came here based on reviews and all those YELPers didn't let us down.

We came early before a show, and we were actually the only ones in the place.  Several people came in after us, which is always a good sign.  This place is close to the strip, but not on it, and it appears to be a local spot.  The décor was very nice.  Service was top notch, everything you would really ask for in a restaurant experience.  

Lets talk food.  There were 5 of us, 2 Adults, 1 Teen, 2 kids.  I was really looking forward to this meal, so I dove right in with 3 appetizers.  We had the Arawan Fresh Roll, Thai-Style Calamari and the Vegetable Egg Rolls.  All of them were fantastic.  The fresh roll was very delicate and very fresh.  The sweet chili sauce was very flavorful.  The Calamari was so crispy and non-greasy, tender on the inside and lots of tentacles.  The actual size of the Calamari was on the smaller side (not the portion) which was interesting, because I never really saw Calamari that small, but it packed a lot of flavor.  The sauce it came with says \"home-made\" and it was like a sriracha spicy type concoction.  The Vegetable egg rolls came with a sweeter sauce, and also very flavorful and overall delicious appetizer.  I could have left happy at this point.

For Entrees, we ordered Tofu Panang Curry, Shrimp Red Curry, Shrimp Pad Thai, Tofu Pad Thai, and Orange Chicken.  The food came out shortly after the appetizers, and was phenomenal.  I tried everything but the Orange Chicken (tried the sauce which was good).  The Panang Curry was my favorite, as this has become my staple when ordering Thai, and they did not disappoint.  Very Flavorful, as was the Red Curry.  Both Pad Thai dishes also very good.  Fried Tofu was nice and crispy, soft on the inside, and the Shrimp was not overcooked whatsoever.  The entire family enjoyed everything, and the staff certainly made us feel welcomed.  As I mentioned, we came early, and very little other patrons at the time, so we got excellent service.  They were not on top of us either, which is always a big no-no for me.  

The price was definitely appropriate based on the portion sizes, and no complaints at all in that department.  If we lived close to this place, we would definitely be regulars, without a doubt.  I hope to be back in town, and will certainly come back and check them out again.

Definitely stop by this place if you are in the area, for great service and exquisite Thai cuisine."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely incredible! The panang curry is something I still think about to this day!Michelin Star level service and all the dishes are presented beautifully."}
{"text":"This place is one of the reason why I wish I was living in Vegas instead of LA. Family and I came for a simple dinner, before flying back to LA. We took 2 tables and we weren't hoping for a great experience but we were definitely wrong. It's a little gem, nicely decorated and the people here are very polite. You barely get to go to a restaurant and order a bunch of stuff and have it all consistently good from appetizers to dessert. Well, this is one of them. Our party was big, so we pretty much got to try almost everything on the menu. Everything was just perfectly cooked and flavorful, there's literally nothing bad we could say about our experience here that night. There's a dessert bar right next to where we were sitting, the whole idea of being able to see how your desserts were made was great but the fact that they were so diligently placing each item in the glass was a treat to see. This place definitely became our must visit Thai restaurant whenever we're in vegas. Asked the owner/manager to open one in LA and he politely smiled. I really hope they do."}
{"text":"Coming back here after 2 years and I love it even more! This is not your regular traditional Thai restaurant, it's a place with beautiful decoration, relaxing music, friendly service and tasty food with innovative presentation. This is the place that I said to myself: screw that diet after 3 Vegas buffets, just not today! We finished up every bits in the plates, so clean that they don't need to wash our dishes  

Started with the fresh rolls, main course were duck drunken noodles and short ribs yellow curry, ended with refreshing coconut ice cream dessert. It's so perfect and I think I had a food orgasm"}
{"text":"Had the ribeye plate. Wow..tender and so good..the calamari appetizer was very tasty and tender. The dessert is worth the price..I had the creme . This is the best Thai food."}
{"text":"Amazing  place couldn't believe  how great the food was! And the prize outstanding  definitely coming here again next time I come to Vegas!"}
{"text":"This is honestly the best restaurant I've ever been to! The food was DELICIOUS and the pricing was reasonable. The dessert was AMAZING as well! Definitely should try the mango island. So good.  Our server, Drake, was very helpful and the service was great. Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Very little food and high prices for Thai food that was ok.   Their dessert was pretty but again small servings"}
{"text":"I love Arawan for it's fancy feel, but lack of crowds and uppityness :-) the main dishes are a delicious modern twist on Thai cuisine, the desserts are very interesting and scrumptious, and the variety of high-quality teas makes it my favorite date night spot."}
{"text":"Best Thai restaurant! We have a sizeable party so our dinner was from a pre-ordered menu. I think they dropped 10 different dishes for us vegetarians. The flavors all blended well and I was completely stuffed. Amazing. Excellent and attentive staff. It is away from the strip and I am so glad we ventured off for a superb birthday celebration dinner."}
{"text":"Experience was amazing beginning to end. We had an awesome server, Drake. He was really nice and personable. Food was absolutely delicious. My party ordered the lemongrass chicken wings for an appetizer, seabass, Arawan pad thai, and yellow curry for our entree. Each dish was unique and very flavorful. We got two desserts, Earthquake and Mango Island. Mango Island is a MUST! Best dessert hands down! Overall, great place, nice ambiance, and awesome service!"}
{"text":"Excellent choices for Vegans! 

Our colleague took us here for a business meeting. 

The decor was really nice and the food was Awesome. 

We chose the vegan options...There were 3 of us and we shared everything.

For appetizers, we had the Arawan Fresh Roll (we requested the vegetarian version) and we ordered the Cucumber Salad. Both were excellent. We were also served with a complimentary dish of fried crispy wontons with a sweet vegetarian duck sauce. 

I also ordered a side of peanut sauce for the fresh rolls but that never arrived.

We also ordered the Honey Dew hot tea which was fantastic!

For entrees, we had:

The Spicy Mint Eggplant (delicious)
The Vegan Pad Thai
Vegan Green Curry (we requested it mild but it was still somewhat on the spicy side. 
a side of Brown rice.

It was all really good.


The only reason I did not give this place 5 stars was because the waitress was a bit annoying. 
She kept interrupting our business meeting and asking if we needed everything, and forgot to bring the peanut sauce."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Great service and the food is delicious, pictures don't do it justice, a hidden gem . By far one of the best Thai spots in town!"}
{"text":"A M A Z I N G. 

If I need to describe it further then you really don't care what I have to say. If you wait, when you finally come here you will kick yourself for having waited. Don't be a fool. 

A M A Z I N G."}
{"text":"Came here by accident. We were waiting to be seated at the other Thai restaurant in the same shopping center that everyone has been raving about but decided that we were too hungry to wait 45 minutes... A secret gem in the area! Very clean and the service was great. As for the food, it did not disappoint! Delicious! Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I was eager to try Arawan Thai Bistro because my eyes eat first. I've got to commend the chef for the most beautiful plate of pad thai I've ever seen in my life! Flavor wise, it's similar to good pad thais around town. Also, you pay for creativity! I think my bill came out to $18ish. I could pay two orders of less creative pad thais somewhere else with the same flavor. Overall, I did not regret my visit!"}
{"text":"Great lunch special!! $9.99 comes with soup, entree, and dessert. I ordered the drunken noodles and my friend ordered the pad see ew. We also shared their creme brulee. Everything was delicious! If you are looking for a reasonable lunch deal, you must try this place. I will come back to try their dinner menu! The area is easy to find with lots of parking. Inside has a very nice decoration and it seems more of like a fine-dining restaurant. Their dinner menu looks a little pricy though for thai food but I will give it a try!"}
{"text":"Amazing pork stew...tasted like roast duck lol

Crab fried rice was not fishy at all, very yummy 

Calamari was good so was the chicken satay 

The chicken pad seewu wasn't too greasy!

Definitely would return"}
{"text":"The House Shrimp and Chicken Pad Thai was below average.  The Shrimp were cooked to powder.  I have never been in a place they over helped me, but they did.  Every two or three minutes they came up and talked to me.  I don't normally ever post a bad review, but hey maybe it was just an off day for them.   Weird."}
{"text":"The food was pretty darned good, we had the braised beef curry, the duck, garlic ribs, phad see ew, cucumber salad, amongst other dishes, of which I can't all remember.  

The food is kinda pricey but the braised curry and duck (both specials) were pretty damn good.  The braised beef was so tender and the curry was just the right flavor.  The duck on it's own was decent, but paired with the dipping sauce they provided made it a definite hit.  The rest of the items were standard, and the garlic ribs were actually a little sub par.  It's pricey because it's gourmet thai food, and a little fusion-ish, but we had our kids with us and it is not the most kid-friendly environment.  The dishes are beyond their young palettes too, so if you want to get your typical thai food to satisfy a craving, you can prob get decent thai close by without busting the wallet, esp with little ones.  Be prepared to spend here, esp if you want to have the good stuff.

Our server mentioned to us that they were rated on trip advisor as a top dessert spot, but it was kinda late already and the items we would've selected were going to take at least 15 - 20 minutes long...and it was already like 9:00PM.  it would have been nice to have been notified of that much earlier, but our server either misjudged how far along we were in our dining process, or forgot to mention it at the earlier time.  So we didn't opt for the dessert, but saw the table behind us get almost every item on the dessert menu, and they did look pretty darn good.  Hope to come back soon to try it. 

Service was pretty good, he sold us on his favorite items, which I liked very much, but he kinda struck on the failing to give us enough time to order dessert....but he was super friendly and helpful, and joked with the kids too.

Parking is pretty open, it's a big plaza, and I don't think it gets too insane.  

I gotta agree with Gracie J about the location of the restaurant tho...I know that could possibly not be entirely their fault about their location, but I'm sure there had to be some part of the decision processs that involved going there...and I would not typically think high-end gourmet Thai when I first enter the Plaza.  I hate to do it, but that knocks off a half star right there...you don't feel so comfortable driving in, esp at night, let alone taking a cab, lyft, or uber there...you would think you weren't in the right spot.  And speaking of the right spot, it is incredibly hard to find...we drove around the parking lot for a while before we finally found it.  Maybe a tip on what's nearby might preove useful to some."}
{"text":"We eat quite a bunch of Thai food and have traveled to Thailand, and blown away by Arawan. The food, presentation, staff and the ambience were definitely 5 stars. It doesn't appear as such from outside, but walk in and be surprised."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite Thai restaurant. After heading to Cornish Pasty Company on a hunt for more unique desserts, we spotted Arawan and knew we had to try it. It took a couple of months, but we finally made it and are so glad we did.

The place wasn't very busy, but it certainly should be! It's got a more upscale, romantic vibe than most Thai restaurants, and all the employees were very friendly and open to giving suggestions. 

We started with chicken satay, which was delicious, but that's hard to mess up. In Thailand, we love stopping by the beach for fresh fried fish but had yet to find another restaurant locally that could recreate those flavors...until now. The fried catfish was amazing with the perfect batter and a slightly spicy lemongrassy sauce that I wanted to drink. The fish is also huge so plenty of food for two or even three if you order more appetizers.

We ended with the Mango Island dessert, which was full of flavors and textures. I can't wait to try the other desserts on the menu, none of which are simple.

It seems a lot of customers are overflow from Lotus of Siam. I personally prefer the food here, although the menu isn't as extensive. I also didn't get sick after dinner like I have every time I've gone to LoS. The food tastes fantastic and is presented beautifully, making Arawan a full experience rather than just a place to eat."}
{"text":"I had the padthai and mint eggplant and it was really good! I also had the pineapple cashew fried rice and it was better than the restaurant next to them. The food the presentation the customer service and ambience was very nice.  If you find yourself here you will not be dissatisfied!"}
{"text":"Good!  portion are super small more high end thai dining over all. Food was good but not fabulous."}
{"text":"I came here to celebrate a friend's birthday so there was about 10-12 of us. The food was good like Archi's. Their presentation is prettier though, LOL. I ordered the pad see ew and one of my friend's had their pad thai which was way too sweet for me. Their pineapple fried rice was super yummy, must try that!! We also ordered a couple desserts which was delicious. The Mango Island is a must try!!! The vanilla bean creme brulee was also very good. The only thing I didn't like was that they brought out our food at different times. I think they should have brought it out all at the same time because the time difference was about 10 minutes apart. A couple of my friends were trying to be polite and wait for everyone else to get their food but I told them they should just eat because their food was already getting cold. Oh and one of the appetizers we got and loved was the ahi tuna larp. I'm Laotian and I love larp, so this was different but in a good way."}
{"text":"The greatest hidden gem in Las Vegas! This place is well worth the drive and the food is incredibly decadent! Everything from presentation to taste is just superb, excellent, amazing, fabulous and the list goes on! I will be back NO DOUBT ABOUT THAT! The staff is very humble and the ambiance is just delightful :)"}
{"text":"We came planning for Lotus of Siam, but were sad to see they were closed for lunch on weekends. Not to be deterred from our mission for delicious Thai food, we found Arawan in the same plaza and were intrigued by the rave reviews.

Arawan has excellent atmosphere. When we went for a 12:30PM Sunday lunch, it was quiet, with big comfy chairs and natural lighting. Service was attentive and friendly.

The menu has just enough of just the right kind of options - some classic Thai dishes as well as house specialties. They offer some really delicious sounding entrees (squid ink pad thai? yes please) that are a bit more spendy, but most of the basics were $10-12.

They were happy to accommodate my request for a peanut-free, tofu-veggie pad thai. When it came out, I was surprised at the beautiful, thoughtful presentation - not what I expected for a $10 dish! As I dug in, the flavors and quality of the food were similarly impressive. Some Thai places' fried noodle dishes have indistinguishable, muddy flavors - but Arawan's was bright and clear. I could taste the tamarind, chiles (spice level = just right), and other ingredients clearly - and it was a whole new experience. My husband similarly enjoyed his yellow curry.

We left happy and stuffed, and will definitely return next time we're in town."}
{"text":"I had initially arrived at Lotus of Siam and was informed of an hour and a half wait.  Back on Yelp I saw that Arawan was 50 yards away.  When you first walk in, the relaxed ambiance hits you.  The staff was wonderful.   The chicken satay was cooked to perfection!  Bomb!  Peanut sauce was creamy.  Cucumber Salad and flavorings were tasty with a mixture of sweet and spicy, but not overly done.  The Pad Thai presentation was wrapped in a netting and didn't disappoint.  I'm anxious to try the Spicy Mint eggplant on my next visit.  If you love THAI, you'll love Arawan."}
{"text":"Arawan is a nice alternative when the line at Lotus of Siam is too long and reservation is all booked up. Just 3 minute walk from Lotus of Siam, the décor is cozy contemporary, good for dates or grabbing quick bites.

DRUNKEN NOODLES: yummy and flavorful
PENANG CURRY: flavorful and was a hit at our table
THAI STEAK SALAD WITH MINT LEAF: okay, and we ended up making lettuce wrap
TOM YUM GOONG NAM KHON: soup with shrimp was a bit salty
CHICKEN FRIED RICE: bland and meh, won't order again

Food at Lotus of Siam is still better, but considering the wait time, this is a good option for Thai food in the same plaza."}
{"text":"The best duck red curry I have ever had!!!!! Presentation was amazing and Tom yum was something I would definitely return for!"}
{"text":"Amazing Thai fusion foods, good taste and very nice presentation. Love all the dessert, earthquake is a must!!! And vanilla bean creme brûlée is so beautiful. Also the service is very nice and friendly. Our waitress is Apple , she so nice and give us a good recommendations."}
{"text":"Food was great. Best Thai I have had by far. Don't let the outside of the building and location drive you off.  As soon as you walk through the door you will know you are in the right place. Great decor and service is at a high level."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner with 6 other people and had an amazing experience. Our servers were really nice and the food came out accordingly. The food looked amazing and tasted amazing! We got the pad Thai which had prawns on it, short rib curry, soft shell crab curry, squid ink drunken noodles, pineapple fried rice, beef panang, and chicken basil or something lol the pad Thai was great, not too sweet or greasy. The short rib curry was fall off the bone soft. The squid ink drunken noodles had a lot of seafood on it, they were not stingy at all. This is now my go to Thai place even if the area is a bit shady lol it's a beautiful and quiet space inside and the servers are attentive."}
{"text":"My friend was raving about this place so I wanted to see what all the hype was about. The food presentation is beautiful, as is the decor. I had the tom yum soup, basil fried rice, and arawan pad thai. The mushrooms in the tom yum soup were slightly raw. I would've preferred them to be more tender and able to soak up that tasty broth. The prawns in the pad thai were tasteless and had a mushy/pastey texture, very unappetizing. Besides that, everything else was good. The flavors and seasoning were on point. Service was great. I wasn't completely satisfied but I'd be willing to give to another try."}
{"text":"Never fails, Sweet Sensations Dessert & Coconut Treasure!
This is a true treasure off the Strip ..."}
{"text":"The food is very good.
Service is excellent
I like it here.the tom yum soup.pad Thai
Crispy pork basil n the crab meat garlic rice, yummy. 
Price is reasonable."}
{"text":"Had the yellow curry today with a chicken broth soup and a to die for piece of decadent carrot cake with a dollop of cream cheese whipped cream topping. 

You can't go wrong with this place. Great price @ 9.95. Super friendly service!  My go to Thai restaurant"}
{"text":"Delicious! Don't even hesitate to go. Modern take on classic Thai dishes and some inventive new ones. P.S. Yelpers please stop posting pics of that creme brûlée--yours isn't more special than the hundreds of other ones on here."}
{"text":"I hesitate to write or not to write this remark on this restaurant. But being a business owner myself, I decide to let the owner knows. Which I would appreciate if any customer let me know about my products. 
I had lunch today  with a girlfriend,  the inside of the restaurant is very lovely, tastefully decorated and peaceful atmosphere,  the servers are all super friendly, courteous and dedicated.
Why the 1 star? The food!!! 
The prime rib in the  yellow curry was extremely chewy, can't even cut with the knife, it needs to be cooked for at least another 3 hrs,  the black ink drunken noodle was tasteless,  with pieces of very chewy octopus,  battered fishes,  and undercooked beans,  the taste is blah and the combinations seafood items were just place on top of the black ink noodles,  with no flavor at all tied together!

I'm surprised to see so many stars !!  Definitely not for the food.

Definitely will not return,  too bad it's so close to my place!!!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch and overall it was pretty okay. 
We got the: 
 rib eye crispy basil (3/5)
panang curry (5/5)
drunken noodles (4/5)
crispy shrimp rad na (2/5)
sweet sensation (3/5) 
Overall the food was a 4/5 but the service could have been a lot better hence the rating. We had to call upon the bus boy for most of our needs ( 2 water refills, dessert menu, bill, and etc.) plus the forced 18% gratuity for 5 people didn't make us feel better about the service."}
{"text":"Food: Fantastic!
- Pad Thai: Amazing!
- Green Curry: Good.
- Fried Rice: Good.
- Chicken Satay: Good.
- Ahi Tuna Larb: Amazing!
- Tea: Very good.
- Mango Ice Cream: THE BEST THING IN THE WORLD!!! No joke. A must try.

Atmosphere: Great! It wasn't loud or crowded. The decor was great.

Price: Around $15/dish, but well worth it.

Service: Very warm and helpful. They cleared our dishes and leftovers off the table before service desert in order to make the presentation better."}
{"text":"The service from Tanya was excellent and the Pad Thal was the best I've ever had! The lemongrass catfish was very tasty also. Definitely our new Thai favorite in Vegas."}
{"text":"Food was good but service was a little subpar. I noticed they were more attentive towards the table with white people. I am asian. They didn't refill our waters even once, while our neighbors did. They didn't even bother checking in on us. I was also disappointed they didn't have the sticky rice and mango when we stopped by around noon. I probably should have checked out Komol restaurant next door instead."}
{"text":"This restaurant is so delightful! Everyone was so friendly. The host (michael) was so kind and we loved him!!! The food was unreal!"}
{"text":"So I came to this place couple times before, and the experience were good. The food was good, and the service was okay, however, I never notive they charge 18% tips at the check. Tonight I went here with two of my friends, I noticed this time they put 18% tips for three guests and DID NOT even mention about it. And our server told us they charge every table same percent tip, But the other server said he never did that before. I was really confused, and they did not even give me a proper reason. I'm not sure if that something personal, but I just want everyone know to check you bill before you pay if they put mandatory tips just in case of double charge."}
{"text":"One of the best Thai foods I've ever had. The cuisines were made with twists. Everything we have ordered were sooo sooo delicious! My favorite is Pad Thai. The cat fish served was really humungous. It is a must-try restaurant if ever you are in Las Vegas. The desserts were scrumptious, still daydreaming of the thai tea ice cream. Lastly, service was impeccable. They were all attentive and our glasses were never empty with water. The interior of the place was definitely unexpected, very clean and great ambiance."}
{"text":"Having lived in Thailand and worked for the Thai Government here in the States, its fair to say I've eaten my fair share of US based Thai food. I decided based on some reviews that I would try Arawan Thai in Las Vegas. As others have described the area, it's located in a sketchy -- downright unattractive strip mall sandwiched in between the Las Vegas Strip and downtown. I mean we ain't talking the Bellagio here - I would encourage those with NV carry permits to do so .

Inside the restaurant, the decor is a lot better than the area deserves. As I scanned the menu and looked at prices (which I've found through sad experience has little to do with how well the Thai food is prepared) I couldn't help think what in the hell are they putting in here? Gold flakes?  I mean $16 for a simple chicken penang curry??  Four miserly pieces of chicken satay for $11? And a VERY salty chinese brocolli and crispy pork belly added another 15 bones thank you very much.  WOW. Penang was somewhat decently flavorful with the proper spices but the sauce was thin and bland - despite being ordered \"phet\" aka spicy (I do speak Thai fluently so there should have been no misunderstanding). To add insult to injury to this staple of Thai cuisine, some of chicken pieces (breast meat at least) appeared to be undercooked and chewy.  The four miserly satay skewers were mostly ok but the little glass thimble (about half the size of an ordinary shot glass) of peanut sauce was barely enough to cover one piece. We finally were able to get more after asking twice. Charging for steamed rice seems all the rage these days with Arawan following suit. No problem with an establishment making money, but $2 a peice for small bowl of rice per PERSON seems a tad excessive.

Bottom line, for this overpriced place, the dishes should have been without compromise - not poorly prepared Americanized psuedo-Thai food. A recent interview asked Thai restaurant owners what they do to prepare Thai food in America, the answer was \"easy, we just make it like we would for children\".  In other words, add tons of sugar, and eliminate most of the chilies, and there you have it. This perfectly describes the food here. My conclusion, save your money for the slots where you might have better chance of getting something back for your money. In this same dingy complex there is another Thai food place called Lotus of Siam, I understand it is much better. We will see next time!"}
{"text":"I took a friend to lunch there yesterday and was extremely pleased.  There are three Thai restaurants in this location - Lotus of Siam, Komol and Arawan.  If you love Thai food you would do well to experience all three of these. The best? Today I'm thinking Arawan, but I definitely want to do more experimentation. Big smiles.
UPDATE:  I went back and re-read my reviews of the other two restaurants, which reminded me of some important factors. Although Yelp gives all three restaurants two $$'s for pricing, Lotus of Siam has increased their prices and I think it should be three $$$'s now. And although  the food at Komol is equally good IMHO,  The day I was there there was no music and the service was extremely slow. Therefore... Arawan is truly the best."}
{"text":"Ok, so I get to Vegas and try to go to my fav, Lotus of Siam, but I find out there is a 4 hour wait till 10:00pm for dinner.  I drive over for standby and it's a 2 hour wait, but literally next door the Arawan restaurant is open and able to serve.  I'm so glad I tried it, it was magnificent Thai food!

The menu was simple traditional Thai, but served with very tender meats, excellent presentation, and culinary skill in wrapping the pad Thai in an edible egg basket that was like a thin pancake.

Try this wonderful place out; you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Came here during lunch on a weekday.  We were one of three tables.  
Not only did the food take FOREVER, they brought out chicken curry for me instead of shrimp curry.
By the point I'm starving, so I took out the pieces of chicken so I can start eating the curry and I asked the waiter for a side of shrimp.
He told me he had to take my whole dish away even though I insisted I'd eat around the chicken and to just bring out a side of shrimp....the waiter then said that if I keep the dish he'd have to charge me for chicken curry AND shrimp curry.  Are you kidding me?!  It was your mistake, the food took forever, let me just eat the mistake instead of you guys redoing the whole dish, I would've been completely fine with a side of shrimp.
He took the dish away, and the remake also took forever, my brother was done with his entree by the time my correct curry came out.  Not a pleasant dining experience when we each have to eat our meal alone.
It place is also in a sketchy, dingy part of town and the decor in here looks tacky, you're better off going to the strip for the prices this place is charging.  We bought thought our dishes were totally average."}
{"text":"Vegas has been blessed with some outstanding Thai cuisine.  The Thai food Gods call a shady complex on Sahara & Commercial Center home. 
Lotus of Siam boasts their Northern Thai dishes and Komol offers an extensive vegetarian menu. Arawan, the new kid on the block, has the WOW factor that you cannot get at any Thai place I have been to in Vegas!

I was able to dine in during lunch and dinner. By far, I highly recommend this place for dinner! I will mention that for under $10 they offer lunch specials that include dessert! I had the pad thai, which needed an oomph of something. I ended up using the spice rack more frequently than I was accustomed to. Presentation was simple and not memorable. The dessert that I had was a mini sized creme brûlée, which was absolutely divine! 

I knew I had to come back for dinner some time. On my most recent visit this is what I tried: 

1) Pad Thai - Probably the best plated pad thai I have ever laid my eyes on. Wow. Noodles were encapsulated by a lattice style egg nest, topped with two large prawns, and accompanied with lime, peanuts, and bean sprouts on the side. No spice enhancement needed. Flavors were on point and very different from my lunch time experience.

2) Scallops in green curry - A deliciously light, but very filling and rich dish.  Scallops were on point and I enjoyed the veggies and all the flavors going on.

3) Mango sticky rice - So simple, but so good! The dessert chef at Arawan deserves recognition for the finesse and talent put into the dessert! 

The interior is gorgeous and is perfect for an intimate dinner. Loved the ambience here and the warm, modern decor. The service was very polite and friendly."}
{"text":"Another great Thai place here in Las Vegas! They have delicious meals at reasonable prices. The take out option is also very fast and easy. The ambience is superior to Lotus of Siam and the menu more focused. I agree with some others that Lotus of Siam is perhaps a better option for group dining, but Arawan will have a less crowded, more pleasant dining experience for couples or individuals."}
{"text":"Found a new Thai place to eat at: completed. 

Took my Sugar Toosh out last night for his birthday. We were not disappointed. Well, we're alcoholics, and they don't have their liquor license yet. 
So - fellow alcoholics, beware. 
Also, we both liked this place better than Lotus. I don't get the obsession with that place. Yes, it's good. But I've heard from a lot of people it's not the best in town, and I couldn't agree more. 

The only thing is some of the seafood tasted a little too *fishy*. It could just be me. 

Here are the things we ordered:

Awaran Pad Thai - super yummy. They add chicken and shrimp which is just what we like. Some people didn't read that part and got upset about the chicken. 
Whatevs. 

Crispy Duck - my favorite. I love crispy duck. I love it even more with curry sauce, so that was the only thing I was missing. But they cooked it so well, and it wasn't gamey or tough. Perfect. 

Scallops Green Curry - this was my fishy dish. I don't usually thing scallops taste that fishy. We order them pretty often. The curry itself was delicious. But the overwhelming smell of the scallops made me not want to eat more. My fiance loved it, so maybe it was just me. 

This is a pretty little joint in that weird plaza on Sahara. I feel like they could do a creepy murder movie in there. But that doesn't ever stop me. 
I love little places that the food tastes super authentic and they're NOT CHAINS. I hope this place continues in popularity and that they're able to get their liquor license soon. We'll be back either way, for sure."}
{"text":"I am a regular at Arawan. Both the food and the staff are phenomenal. It's a great quiet place for a \"solo\" lunch or a group lunch. I highly recommend the lunch special (M-F).

Also, the team is very accommodating to my vegan needs. Free Wi-Fi."}
{"text":"2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge 74/100

Dessert served with Lunch Specials! As far as I know, this is the only Thai place in Vegas that does this. If there are other ones, please let me know :-). 

I ordered the Pad See Ew lunch special, it was delish. No complaints. Fair price as well. 

We were lucky enough to have creme brûlée for dessert. It was divine. Creme brûlée is not my fave dessert (don't judge me) but I LOVED Arawan's. It was onoliscious. Day dreamed about it when I got home. 

I loved the interior decor here, intimate and perfect for date night. Service was 5 stars. I also enjoyed watching their baker prepare a beautiful cake at the bar. If you're deciding whether to have dessert or not here, I suggest you do. Like I said, the Creme brûlée was DIVINE.  Yummm. 

Looking forward to trying their dinner menu soon!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent, portions are bistro-style... so you won't get stuffed, unless you decide to try 3 plates each (like we did).

Another reviewer mentioned this isn't a family joint, and I agree. Between the 4 of us, we ordered lots of stuff, and expected to share. Unless you've got a table reserved in the group side of the house, your table will be tiny, and the wait staff won't consider reseating you. So ask for this feature in advance if you wanna do some family style sharing.

Prices were reasonable for the quality being served, but I found some of the little things just plain stingy. Small stuff should be comped. It's America. We don't expect the world, but we do judge when owners are cheap. Example: we took our 8 year old to this joint. I ordered him bowl of white rice, and asked for the most bland-tasting chicken they can make him. But these jokers are like $2 for the \"borr of white rice, and you *have* to order this BBQ chicken dish for $15 darra.\" I'm like, \"you guys microwave the BBQ chicken dish, or does the chicken have to be cooked first?\" And they're like, \"Jimmy crack corn, you gotta buy this BBQ dish for $15 darra.\" (or whatever the Thai version of my Chinese racism sounds like).

Bottom line: good for dates, order everything on the menu that sounds good to you (it's all delicious), come in for lunch to save a couple bucks, come in for dessert on a separate occasion with **really** nice bottles of your own wine (corkage fee is $15 darra per bottle), call in advance to reserve big tables for family-style dining."}
{"text":"I am blown away at how delicious this place is and the food are so beautiful when it came out.  I am so happy that I got a chance to taste this restaurant's food. absolutely mind blowing so five stars for sure thank you"}

{"text":"Had lunch here but can tell it is a great dinner spot/ date spot. Service was attentive. They have a good hot tea selection I look forward to trying. Restaurant is clean and the food was good. Location is random but that's actually good thing (bc Vegas). It's nice on the inside. Idk how long this restaurant has been here but it's def not going anywhere. I am for sure coming back and I heard two other tables say the same thing. Def a bistro atmosphere."}

{"text":"Arawan is the best Thai restaurant in Las Vegas. The atmosphere is swanky and the food is delicious.  The egg wrapped Pad Thai, chicken basil and desserts are favorites!  This place is more authentic and overall better than Lotus of Siam.  This place is a must try!  Don't forget to get reservations!"}
{"text":"Better than anything on the strip. This place is beautiful on the inside. Whoever designed the décor did an outstanding job. Clean. Classy. Upscale. Interesting. Very nice. It's so deceiving from outside the building how nice it is inside. 

The food was  a 5 out of 5. Fresh. Well prepared. Great spice. Excellent. I wish I had time to try a bunch more dishes. It was SO good. 

The staff were super friendly and helpful and it was nice that they checked in to see how I liked everything.  

Get off the strip and go to this place. It's a little hard to find because it's off the street in the middle of a strip mall stand alone building. But you will be so happy you found it. So, so good. And whatever you do, save room for dessert. I had the Mango something and it was one of the best desserts I'd ever had. 

I hardly ever give a 5 star rating. But this place earned it. Excellent!"}
{"text":"The environment and service is good. I like the duck curry but crab fried rice is not very good. the rice is too much water and nothing standout."}
{"text":"The best Thai food!!! The pad Thai is amazing and they have a great selection of hot teas. They plate their food with so much attention to detail and care. The flavors are amazing!!! The ambiance is amazing, a small hole in the wall with great decor! I really do think that this restaurant is much better than Lotus of Siam. The service is amazing and the owner is so friendly and caring. The creme brûlée is beyond delicious!! It's perfectly torched and the custard is just the right consistency. My boyfriend ordered the curry and love it! He's very picky when it comes to his curry and he was loved it. I have been to this restaurant a total of 4 times and I have never been disappointed. Great place for a date, group or friends. You will not leave disappointed."}
{"text":"Been here few times now , amazed me everytime. Pad Thai is consistently good, today we had curry chicken. OMG the chicken is juicy!! Yes Juicy and tender, never had a juicy chicken at Thai food. Service was friendly only thing didn't like was the server keep trying to clear the table take my soup from me lol we also had mango island desert, yummy! They offered 5star restaurant deserts not just the typical mango sticky rice. This place is my top 3 in Vegas. Better than lotus and chada for sure."}
{"text":"Get off the strip and get some great food at regular prices!  I had the Ribeye Crispy Basil and my friend had the Duck Red Curry.  Both dishes were phenomenal.  We also had egg rolls, won ton soup and chicken fried rice.  All of it was delicious!  The I finished up with the creme brulee.  Wow.  What a great meal!  I can't wait to go back and try something else.
I also have to talk about the service.  Best service I've experienced in a while.  Our soda, iced tea and water glasses were never empty.  And if you are a hot tea lover, you must try the blooming teas!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best Thai I've had in Vegas!! We love Lotus, but I think this place takes the cake. Everything was fresh and flavorful with a very upscale feel! The red curry and pad Thai were both incredible!!"}

{"text":"We were looking for a good Thai place in Vegas and we found it. The little street mall were it is, looks pretty ghetto but once you are inside it's like you transport to a different place. The food is unbelievable and the service is fantastic. We had the pad Thai, drunken noodle, squid ink noodle and pineapple rice. All was excellent, but the best part was the mango island dessert. Gotta have it"}
{"text":"Good food, good service, reasonably priced and a hip yet approachable atmosphere. The pad Thai was tasty and beautifully presented."}
{"text":"It was hard to make the choice to go here over the traditionally amazing Lotus, but we are glad that we tried something new. The food here is so very delicious and the atmosphere is beautiful. It's a fancier Thai restaurant with a smaller menu that Lotus; however, they do have a nice selection of loose teas. 

We were celebrating a birthday and wanted something really nice, and this was perfect!

We will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"Loved eating here. The food was excellent and served in a very pleasing, artistic manner. We had the luncheon special, which included soup and dessert with your entree. The service was excellent as well. Plenty of parking is available. Will definitely stop here any time we are in Vegas."}
{"text":"Nice setting and clean. The dessert was out of this world. I actually came back the same day just got dessert again. I ordered the beef jerky (too chewy), rib eyes basil (pretty good but agin beef was chewy), and squid ink pad se ew ( very good!), and the mango dessert (out of this world!)"}

Squid-ink Drunken Noodles
Duck Palow
Sweet Sensation
Earthquake

Open now for just under two years, the choice to join a plaza already featuring world famous Lotus of Siam and Komol Restaurant originally an odd choice that had many labeling them 'that new Thai place near Lotus,' Arawan Thai Bistro and Dessert has defied the odds by etching out their own unique style of Thai cuisine that is quite unlike any other in Las Vegas, the duo of Chefs Jui and Gail creating some truly beautiful dishes with a focus on quality ingredients that do not compromise authenticity.

Technically located in \"Commercial Center,\" though if any local is asked the answer to \"where is it?\" almost always revolves around its Beard Award Winning competition, Arawan Thai Bistro and Dessert joins most of the Las Vegas off-Strip ethnic options in being largely understated in its outward appearance, a noon arrival on Saturday finding the inside perhaps 1/4 full but soon to fill past 2/3 over the course of the next thirty minutes, Its soft soundtrack and light décor making the space seem spacious yet intimate, the overhead lighting great for photographs of the sort of Thai Cuisine that most certainly deserves a Kodak moment.

Dividing the menu into Signatures, Starters, Entrees and Desserts, each section offering ten or more items at prices that are competitive to other fine-dining Thai restaurants in town, service at Arawan is of the gracious, yet not-entirely-organized style familiar to those who've dined in similar restaurants across Sin City, the meal beginning with a small plate of Wonton Chips and a housemade sweet and spicy Dipping Sauce, the Thai Iced Tea ordered mere moments after sitting down completely forgotten until another young woman was reminded, but still arriving more than five minutes after the first plates.

No doubt a refined concept, the focus here moreso on the food and its presentation than esoteric plates or expansive wine list of Lotus or Chada Thai, a perusal of starters shows everything from Spring Rolls to Larb and Papaya Salad present and accounted for, the more interesting options a quartet of Fish Cakes spiked with Red Curry that fry up light and oilless as well as the Ahi Tuna \"Larb\" that forgoes the typical ground Meat in favor of Poke-style Sashimi Cubes bathed in a spicy blend of Citrus, Mango, Avocado and crispy Shallots. 

Moving on to entrees, all three taken from the Signatures though staples such as Drunken Noodles, Curries, and Mint or Ginger dishes are available with a choice of Meat toppings or Tofu, Arawan's Crispy Duck fares similarly to many in the area by way of slow roasting followed by a high temperature finish that leaves center pieces moist and succulent while unfortunately dehydrating the edges, the restaurant's eponymous Pad Thai performing more consistently and one-upping most by placing thin Noodles and Chicken punched up with Fish Sauce beneath an edible net, the two butterflied Prawns on top alone commanding the whole plate's cost at any Casino in town without being nearly as attractive, filling or complex.

Nearly lured in by both the Rib Eye and the Short Rib, but eventually deciding that something as unique as Squid Ink Drunken Noodles probably warranted a look, Arawan takes a chance at offending purists by replacing the flat Rice Noodles more commonly seen with Black Spaghetti and a similar spice profile focused on Thai Basil and Green Peppercorns, the flavors not particularly 'authentic' when paired to Cod, de-shelled Shrimp, Mussels and Scallops but delicious nonetheless, and easily the meal's most highly recommendable savory.

Happy to give any restaurant including \"Dessert\" in its title a chance to wow with sweets, Chef Gail clearly not one to be satisfied with Sticky Rice and Mango slices or Tempura Plantains, it was with tough choices made to account for both time and capacity that two items were selected from a total of nine, the Sweet Sensation taking the aforementioned Banana idea to new heights by wrapping the torched Fruit in a thin Pancake and sweetening it with condensed milk and sugar before adding Thai Tea Ice Cream, while a dish called \"Earthquake\" replicates Le Cirque's Petit Boule de Chocolat presentation, replacing the flavors inside with Lychee sorbet and Fruity Candies that add an extra layer of taste and texture to the melted Chocolate and hot, pureed Raspberries.

***1/2: No doubt committed to its vision, most of the 'modern' ideas performing very well while desserts are not only delicious but aesthetically pleasing, Arawan Thai Bistro and Dessert is a place worth checking out in the same vein as Nittaya's Secret Kitchen in Summerlin, a change of pace from all the other Thai spots in town with an ambiance and variety of plates good for both the adventurous 'foodie' or couples just looking for something new to try on date night."}
{"text":"Another rock star of a meal. Everything was so delicious as always. We tried to order some different items than when we were there before. 

Sadly the one item we wanted to order again was the mango sticky rice and they were out of it.

Wonderful service and great atmosphere. So many things to try next time."}
{"text":"Exceltent place to come visit , came at lunch time with a bunch of great options for under 10 bucks . One of the best Thai in Vegas"}
{"text":"Just one word: WOW! We love everything here from the food to the service. Arawan Pad thai is a must try!!! The soft shell crab is awesome. Last but not least, Tom Yum soup is the perfect choice for a cold night. Too bad we don't have room for deserts which look so good too. Will definitely come back the next time we visit Vegas!!!"}
{"text":"Arawan is standing out as one of the \"nicer\" Thai restaurants, but I did not experience the \"OMG this is delicious\" feeling I've had at others.

Ambiance is definitely nicer than your typical restaurant, but with all of this consideration, I hope they can do away with the four foot tall fan blowing in the entry way.

Thai Steak Salad with Fresh Mint
Silver Noodle Salad
Thai-Spiced Sea Bass
Short Rib Yellow Curry
Arawan Pad Thai
Chicken Wings
Chicken Mint

I felt like the flavors were a little more subtle than I expect to be typical with Thai, and the spiciness level was disappointing (i.e. not spicy). I do, however, recall being fond of the Pad Thai. The sea bass was a regrettable choice, as the sauce was more sweet than spicy (had a slight ketchup-y essence), and we wished we had chosen the fried catfish instead. 

Service was good and they ended our dinner with a surprise birthday creme brûlée for my mother (I'm assuming someone overheard my husband joining our party and wishing my mother a happy birthday). It was very attentive of them and added a personal touch. 

My mother and I can't stop dreaming about the lemongrass catfish, so we will definitely be back. I look forward to finding the \"wowing\" dish."}
{"text":"When you're in the same lot as the two of Vegas' best Thai restaurants, you'd have to be special in order to be noticed. Otherwise, you'll be ignored/forgotten.

We had dinner reservation. I was impressed by the modern decor atypical to most Thai restaurants. They only had two diners when we walked in and there was nobody to welcome us or seat us. I was thinking we were off to a bad start but the two diners assured us that it's worth it.

Our server was a pleasant, soft-spoken gentleman who always had a smile on his face. We got some Thai iced teas (no Arnopalma!) and they gave us strawberry-infused water. The entrees and desserts were amazing! Their level of heat: mild, medium and spicy. We got everything medium just to be safe.

Fried Tofu:
This was alright. I'd skip appetizers and head on to entrees next time. 3.5/5

Thai Beef Steak Salad:
Citrusy, spicy and refreshing. The beef had some fat I had to trim off but other than that, this was great. 4/5

Ribeye Crispy Basil:
Slices of wok-fried ribeye with mushrooms, bell peppers, garlic, chili and crispy basil. Great aroma and flavor. The steak was tender. 5/5

Squid Ink Drunken Noodles:
Squid, shrimp, scallops, fish, mussels, and mushrooms with spaghetti in squid ink, spicy chili sauce. If you love seafood, this is a must-try. 5/5

Mango Paradise:
The sophisticated version of sweet sticky rice. It has the flavor components of the classic sweet treat but presented in a much more elegant way. 5/5

Sweet Sensation:
I love Thai tea so, I had to have this. Bananas wrapped in Thai pancake drizzled with condensed milk with Thai tea ice cream and Oreo crumbles on the side. Soooooo goood!!! 5/5"}
{"text":"Tried this place since Lotu of Siam was completely booked.  The pad thai was one of the best I've ever had.  Not too wet.  Presented artistically, shaped like an inverted bowl.
The green curry was so so.  I like my curry less watery.  
Definitely will come back."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I always come to this spot. It's probably one of the best Thai places in the Las Vegas area. The food is alway consistent, the atmosphere is romantic and relaxing. However, the service is alway top notch. So friendly, warm and welcoming. Shout out to our server today, Luis. He was all alone and since it is EDC weekend it was really busy. He stayed calm and his service was exceptionally wonderful. Thank you again Luis and the wonderful Arawan staff!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful dining experience!  Decided to try this with my wife and another couple. Between the 4 of us we tried half the menu. Lol. We had 5 different appetizers and they were all great. We decided to try a \"little\" soup so we ordered the Won Ton Soup and the   The Won Ton exceeded what I was expecting. Besides the great won tons it was full of fresh vegetables.  For dinner we had the rib eye, pad Thai, Wild ginger beef and a lobster tail panning. The rib eye had a lot of fat but not a big surprise from a rib eye. Everything else was amazing."}
{"text":"Very fancy ambiance without the \"very fancy\" prices. Tasty food, amazing presentation. Very polite and tentative service. Our server happily agreed to take our picture for us with our cameras. The other server made honest recommendations about different entrees, and even told us when he thought we had ordered too much. We ate here around 830 on an Sunday evening. I was surprised that there weren't more customers, but perhaps it's rather new, and I think the restaurant location isn't ideal for them. definitely coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Very good food.  The price is slightly on the high side for Asian food, but worth every penny.  You can't go wrong with any dish on the special menu"}
{"text":"Found this gem on Yelp and it's quickly become my favorite place to eat in Vegas. It's a very unassuming place from the outside, but it is cute, clean and comfortable on the inside.

The highlight, of course, is the food. It is incomparable to my favorite places in San Diego where I live, they are on a whole other level!

I highly recommend anyone to find out for themselves, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"First let me start my review by saying I really admire the chutzpah of Arawan to open right next to Komol and in the same shopping center as Lotus of Siam.   This would be like my opening a little Vegan sandwich/salad shop in the Bronze Cafe parking lot.   Respect for that.

More importantly, respect for the delicious food they're churning out!   I've had the pleasure of having Arawan food twice now, once dining in and once getting carry out.   Dining in is a treat, as you step foot from the outside world of Maryland Square, which, putting it nicely has seen better days, into an immaculately serene and beautiful dining area.   There are various stylings of tables and chairs to choose from and they all look comfy in their own different ways.   Probably the nicest interior of any Thai restaurant in Vegas I've ever been to.   Then the waiter brought over the complimentary water and there was a small slice of strawberry in it to add some flavor.   At this point I was worried about 2 things.   1)  That I didn't make enough at my State funded job to afford the upcoming meal and 2) that my khakis and I might not be welcome in such a fine establishment.    

Perusing the menu alleviated my first concern.   Although their special menu offerings ran a little higher than I like to spend on lunch, the lunch specials were affordable enough for me to still dine there AND not resort to Del Taco for the rest of the week.   Score!   At $9.95 it's a little higher priced than most Thai Lunch Specials, but more on that later.    I went with with the Spicy Mint Chicken LS.   First we were brought out some soup which I liked, but I'll be honest have no recollection of outside of that.  When my entree came out, the extra cost of the lunch special started to show itself.  I've had a ton of \"Spicy Basil\" lunch specials around town and most don't provide a fried egg with it.  I really enjoyed this addition to my \"normal\" order.  Here's where someone tells me an egg costs 2 cents.  I'm dumb and don't know such things.  I did the $1 brown rice substitution which is a fair price compared to some other Thai restaurants that charge more, and every component of the total entree seemed of high quality and cooked very well.  Definitely overall it was on par or better than most similar offerings across town.

After finishing the entrees the table was brought out where the extra money really comes through, the dessert!  The day I was there it was a fried banana egg roll THING with a small vanilla ice cream accompaniment.  If that sounds good to you you'd enjoy it.  Easy!

My second experience was calling in take out for the Spicy Mint Eggplant entree (not a lunch special).   It came to about the same price with a brown rice substitution as my dine-in meal but without soup or dessert :(    Eggplant was really delicious though.   Bright, large perfectly cooked pieces of eggplant.  I wish I could insert the Eggplant Emoji here.   Okay, maybe not.  

The negatives:  I did have some difficulties with actually placing the order, in that the phone went to voicemail for about 15 minutes straight until on the 5th attempt someone picked up.   Also they said it'd be 15 and I ended up sitting in the restaurant for 10 minutes after that 15 minutes was up.   My time is precious, that's 10 minutes that could have been spent watching Drake Hotline Bling Memes.   Lastly they don't have a spice rating SCALE which I prefer, but instead want you to say Mild, Medium or Hot, which doesn't satisfy my desired heat.   I want somewhere in between medium and hot, but more tipped towards hot, but not enough that's going to make me cry.   Basically, a 7.   I can't convey that properly with a choice of 3 words.

All those negatives totaled up still are only worth a 1 star demerit."}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN.

Made a reservation ahead of time for my anniversary. Could hardly find the place. It's a small little hole in the wall. Went inside and there is hardly any waiting area. Nobody there to greet me. Had to walk around a good five minutes before a waiter even asked us anything. Took us to our seat. Brought us water . Then our menus. We decided quickly what we wanted to eat . Took over a half hour for the waitress to remember to take our order . Said she forgot about it and laughed. We ordered all our food at once to hopefully make up time.  Took another half hour for food to get out. The \"chips\" they brought for us to munch on were okay. Only gave us a single chip each! When they brought out our food, they almost gave it to the wrong table. Set the food in front of them and everything . Then the waitress remembered it wasn't theirs and just switched the plates. May I note that the food wasn't horrible. Too much odd flavor combos. But I DID NOT intend to spend over $70 on meat portioned the size of a chicken nugget. Dessert looked good so ordered that as well. Again took forever. Had to push the waitress to give us the bill. Overall will never go again. Strongly encourage nobody to waste their time or money here."}
{"text":"I had the Vegan Pad Thai, and it was delicious. It was spicy and sweet, and the tofu was well-cooked. The service was great; I made a reservation on Christmas Eve and was seated immediately. The place was packed, and I could see why!"}
{"text":"Arawan definitely has the best Thai food I've eaten. I came here for dinner with my family on Christmas day and had made a reservation for 7:30PM. However, we arrived earlier than expected and the restaurant was able to get us seated and served earlier! Both the service and food were great!

I had the Arawan Pad Thai, one of their signature dishes. The presentation of the dish was stunning and the dish itself was delicious! The shrimp were a unique twist to traditional pad thai and worked surprisingly well with the sweet and savory noodles. Best pad thai I've had.

The rest of my family had a Ribeye Crispy Basil, Thai Spiced Sea Bass, and Panang Curry with Chicken. I tried their dishes as well, and everything was very tasty."}
{"text":"Don't let the sketchy location and outside fool you. This place is the best pad Thai I've had since being in Thailand. Super friendly staff, delicious food, you should get here now."}
{"text":"The details are really what matters here. From start to finish, the multiple times i've been here, they go above and beyond to make the experience what you imagine it to be. to the strawberry water, to being accommodating with the fact they're always busy, or just thinking how good the food is. it is no surprise that they're often considered the best thai in the city."}
{"text":"Excellent food and dessert. The service was great...Very attentive. Definitely will be going back."}
{"text":"Probably should be a 4.5 star- food was delicious and ample and nicely presented.  Service was unobtrusive and yet attentive and it was a nice quiet place for a relaxed dinner. Very reasonable costs, especially if you are staying on the strip! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"We were Yelping, looking for a Thai Restaurant and we found this gem. It's in this huge almost empty shopping center with lots of other Asian restaurants, not very welcoming at all. HOWEVER, when you walk in, it is the sexiest little place you will ever see. Now for the food, what is better than excellent? Even the water had a slice of strawberry. We had a whole catfish that was off the charts, with great garnish and sauce. I had the black ink noodle with an assortment of seafood and fish, the taste was incredible. When you think you've had enough they bring you the dessert menu, full of wonderful mango, coconut and wow!. This is really some of the best Thai I've ever had. Highly recommend this gem of a place. Gail is the pastry chef and daughter of the chef, who is her Mother"}
{"text":"Love The atmosphere and food!  Fantastic courteous staff and elegant Thai food that I have not seen anywhere else."}
{"text":"Very nicely decorated intimate interior with a wide selection of menu items. Decided on the calamari, papaya salad, short rib yellow curry and thai spiced sea bass. Had an awesome experience here but knocked one star off because of the prices. 

Calamari was deliciously crispy and not oily. The dipping sauce was the best part which was tangy and spicy but not too overwhelming. Gotta say one of my fave calamari now.

The papaya salad was a little more bland than other places. I couldn't really detect any vinegary or fishy taste which most other papaya salads usually have. Probably wouldn't order this dish again. 

The short rib yellow curry was awesome. Perfectly tender and seasoned and it was perfectly sized to share between two people. And it came with the perfect amount of carrots and potatoes. The curry wasn't too overwhelming spiced which I liked. Definitely a must order. 

I wasn't disappointed by the sea bass either. The skin was crisply fried and remained crispy even after being layered with a chili sauce which wasn't too sweet or spicy. 

My favorite part was the dessert. Ordered the Sweet Sensation which came with thai tea ice cream which was awesome and not overly sweet. The pancake portion of it was delicious and simple and fluffy and buttery. Will order again."}
{"text":"Best deserts and much variety my girlfriends favorite spot to eat she likes it better then me. I cant lie the service is good and its a happy environment so I consider it a good spot to eat and it keeps my lady happy!"}
{"text":"Visiting vegas for a few days and had a craving for thai. We ordered drunken noodles with shrimp, pad thai tofu, and pad prig pao plate with a side of yellow curry. Everything was super delicious. 

First time i ever saw an egg net covering pad thai, it was so cute, innovative, and delicious. 

Next time i visit vegas i will definitely have a meal here.

Decor picking up our order was really nice and modern. Very clean"}
{"text":"The food in this place is AMAZING! The service was GREAT. Louis was our server and he was perfect. We will be back next time we're in Vegas."}
{"text":"Well worth a special trip. Food is amazing with an artistic upscale presentation. Don't let the old shopping center fool you, the inside of the restaurant is nice and modern."}
{"text":"This was a gem  to find!! You would never know how great it is looking from outside 
Wonderful restaurant great  prices awesome food!!!!!! Thanks  so much for a great lunch"}
{"text":"Very Quaint, Yet Chic Thai Restaurant in the most unsuspecting of places.  

For a drink, I had the Thai Iced Coffee.  Not too sweet, just the right amount of coffee to spruce one up.  

I had the Chicken Satay appetizer, which came with a delicious peanut sauce and a cucumber sauce.  

As a main entree, I had the Arawan Pad Thai which was topped with two prawns.

In all, the meal was beautifully plated, fully flavorful, and it was just a delightful ambiance."}
{"text":"We love Arawan! The food is delicious! There is no better Thai food in Vegas. We have been coming to Arawan since they have been open at their old location. We LOVE the Pad Thai and their desserts are absolutely delicious and beautiful! The sticky rice is great and the Thai pancakes are good too.  This is a great place for date night! And the lunch menu is a great price! It comes with desert and a little bowel of soup."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a Sunday and it wasn't too busy. Have been wanting to check this place out for a while now. Although it's right next to Lotus, I've actually never been to Lotus so I won't be making any comparisons between the two. The interior space was relatively dark, but a very clean and modern space. I ordered a duck drunken noodles, one of my favorite Thai dishes, but I've never had it with duck before. I misread the menu and thought there was a lunch special at the time, but it's only for weekdays. The food didn't take too long to come out, and service was very good. The drunken noodles tasted great, but honestly, not the best drunken noodles I've ever had. In my opinion, the portion is a bit small for the price. It would've been a much better deal with the lunch special that comes with soup, salad and dessert. Trying one dish is not enough to judge the quality of the food here, and I definitely want to try their desserts next time. Will definitely come back again for more!"}
{"text":"Great Thai restaurant with a very romantic, modern, and fresh look. 
We tried varied dishes besides the desserts (so full) but would have to go back again to give it a shot. 
Thai iced tea was excellent and the service was superb. 
Recommend going about 6pm since it was a very quiet and relaxing time to dine. 

Although portion sizes are a bit smaller than expected, the presentation of the food was awesome and the delicious tastes made up for it. 

Thanks!!"}
{"text":"This place was really nice inside, despite the area being pretty shady. It's in the same parking lot as Lotus of Siam and the Que Club. The decor inside was very authentic looking, clean and nicely placed. The staff was very friendly and accommodating for our large party. We went here for a lunch meeting, so we had the added benefit of a lunch specials menu, which I recommend since the portions are a good size and there's a good selection to choose from.

I ended up having some fried wontons which were the usual. Quite a few pieces for sharing paired with sweet and sour sauce. For my meal I got the Pad See Ew. This is where my experience went downhill. The Pad See Ew was straight up awful. This is one of my favorite Thai dishes so I do have it frequently. The sauce was off, the chicken was not good quality at all, and the food was cold when it was placed in front of me. As I was with a large group of co workers and staff, I didn't complain or say anything but wow, not a good look on their part.

Instead of saying don't go, I'll say watch what you order, don't order the Pad See Ew, or go with a large group. All of our food was brought out at different times which is rude to the rest of the group. And then the icing on the cake was when our vegetarian coworker was given the chicken curry instead of the vegan curry and started to eat it before realizing it was the wrong one. What kind of service is that?? They barely apologized for this mistake and lucky for them my coworker is nice so she said nothing, but I thought that was ridiculous. Overall not a really great experience and I will take my friends elsewhere for awesome thai food."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite Thai place in vegas... Awesome food... We tried Basil fried rice, Panang curry... Thai tea perfected and best of all creme brûlée, what a taste must try!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome. No need to explain more. One of the best Thai foods I've ever tried in my life. Try it."}
{"text":"Great place to enjoy a lunch or dinner. Will come back in very near future. The food selection is awesomely great and never a bad customer experience"}
{"text":"Had an awesome dinner here with my family. Serving size is just right, and the food presentation is amazing. We ordered the soft shell crab, thai bbq chix, panang curry and crab fried rice along with the delectable dessert, mango island...all of them are delicious and satisfying. Our servers, Pong and Apple were so attentive and were so friendly, always have a smile on their faces while tending to our needs. I would definitely come back and highly recommend this as one of the best Thai restaurants here in Las Vegas that I've been to."}
{"text":"Could not say enough about how great the food is here. Service included. I've had Thai in a lot of different city's and I would say this is by far one of the best. At par with Lotus of Siam (just a walk away). The red curry was one to come back for over and over and over. They have awesome lunch specials too so if you have that hankering for a Thai head here. The space is large and open with great decoration. Just needs more traffic and hopefully the more people that check it out the busier it will become."}
{"text":"Dear friends + great food + amazing dessert = Dinner at Arawan Thai Bistro.

Seven of us gathered here for Sunday dinner and shared several dishes, family style.
Hearing so many good things about Arawan, I was looking forward to the Mango Paradise dessert most of all.   But first, dinner:

-Ribeye Crispy Basil
-Arawan Pad Thai
-Squid-Ink Drunken Noodles
-Panang Curry Chicken
-Soft Shell Crab Pad Pong Karee
-Chicken Chow Mein (yes, this is on the menu)

I didn't have the Squid-Ink dish because I don't eat fish, but I tried every other dish.  Standouts were definitely the Pad Thai with the huge prawns as well as the Panang Curry Chicken.  I also really enjoyed the Soft Shell Crab dish; it was maybe only the second time I've had soft shell crab and the curry flavor was just right.

 The desserts were works of art.  You can definitely just come here for them if you want to treat yourself.

-Mango Paradise (Thai Sweet Sticky Rice with Mango):  I finally got my fix after not getting any last weekend at the monthly Thai food festival.  I kinda wished I didn't have to share.
-Vanilla Bean Creme Brulee:  This was a lovely presentation.  We called it a spiderweb of sugar which covered the creme brulee and fruit.  
-Sweet Sensation:  the Thai Tea ice cream with this dessert was fabuloso.  Add the roti with bananas and it is sensational.

Service was excellent and, all in all, a wonderful dining experience that I look forward to repeating soon.

*Reservations are recommended."}
{"text":"I have to say that I loooove this place. Everything tasted amazing. The desserts made my mouth happy and I got two different ones. I would definitely come back here. The atmosphere was nice and the staff are very sweet."}

{"text":"Absolutely recommend this! Yellow curry short rib was so good and the dessert  Had such a good time there"}
{"text":"There's only a few times in life that you go to a restaurant and say, \"finally...someone who gets it!\" Arawan Thai Bistro and Dessert not only gets it, but they have taken food quality, presentation, ambiance and service to the next level.

We stopped in during busy CES week for a reprieve from The Strip, and boy were we happy we did as this place blows most of those restaurants out of the water - for a fraction of the price to boot!

Sure there's no valet (typical in the Vegas restaurant scene), and it may be wise to lockup your car real well - but none of that matters once you step foot through the doors of Arawan. Pastry Chef Gail and her parents have really done an amazing job creating a warm, tranquil dining experience so as to ensure nothing detracts from the amazing lunch, dinner and dessert menu...and I don't throw around the word amazing lightly.

Signature Thai dishes that will make you sweat with happiness, delicious soups that warm and invigorate the soul, and a vanilla bean Crème Brûlée that I simply cannot describe with words.

On top of everything, my fiancée and I truly felt like we were part of their family while being there, which was certainly a breath of fresh air after being cut off and honked at all week during all the CES hustle and bustle. Our Lunch server (forgot his name), and Dinner server Tanya (who made sure we didn't forget her name, haha) were so hospitable and literally jumped at every request - even while the restaurant was busy. 

Hats off to the folks at Arawan Thai Bistro and Dessert  - you made our trip to Vegas. We'll be back to see you soon! 

Yelpers out there do yourself a favor and try this place out ASAP!"}
{"text":"What a great little place! Wonderful wait staff and great food. We had the Green Curry with Scallops which was delicious. The Tom Kha soup was excellent too. Finished with the \"Earthquake\" dessert which was amazing! 

Update: Back again! Having the Crispy Rad Na. Jumbo prawns wrapped in thin noodles and deep fried. Served  in a savory broth with veggies. Had the \"Earthquake\" again for dessert...so good I posted a video of the \"disaster\" :D"}
{"text":"I think I found a new favorite Thai restaurant!!! 

Came in with the lady at about 5 in the afternoon. 

Wasn't too busy but we loved the decor and feel of the restaurant. 

Had a glass of grape juice and fermented grape soda which were awesome!! 

We went straight to ordering food. Had their fried calamari app and a cucumber salad. Both paired nicely a nice sweet cool salad got the spicy-ish dipping sauce that came with the squid. 

She had pad se ew the noodles chew to them noticed they're are wider and longer than other places. 

I had the short rib in yellow curry or was it
Green? Any ways the thing was literally off the bone delicious. 

We left full and happy!! 

Thank you"}
{"text":"Who knows in the middle of a rundown shopping plaza one can find a nice restaurant.
We ordered one starter, two entrees and a desert.
For the starter we had ahi tuna larb. The dressing was very refreshing and delicious.
We ordered the crispy duck and Thai -spiced sea bass.
The duck was just okay, the meat was a bit dry but the sea bass was excellent, the skin was nice and crispy and the sauce was yummy.
And we had raspberry lava chocolate cake for dessert. It was very delightful.
Definitely will come back. One of my favorite Thai restaurants."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service. If you want to get off the strip and experience one of the best Thai restaurants around, this is it!"}

{"text":"This place keeps drawing me back. The atmosphere is lovely. Nice decor and great soft jazz playing. The best service ever!! Today I tried the Silver Needle Salad for lunch. As always the egg drop soup and salad were very good. The salad had ground chicken, big shrimp, rice noodles, cashews, etc on lettuce. Fabulous dressing. Loved it. It's getting harder to keep my commitment to try something different each time. Maybe dessert counts for that!!  Today's was superb strawberry ice cream."}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Don't let the strip mall and outside appearance fool you. It's a little gem inside. Ordered the Tom yum soup, red duck curry, and chicken drunken noodles. Wonderful portions and plenty of flavor. I would highly recommend to anyone."}

.
This restaurant is located in a shady shopping center on Sahara between Maryland and Paradise.  Lotus of Siam, Komol, Haifa, and Cornish Pasty Co. are in the same shopping center.  
.
Went on Saturday 1-23-16 at about 6pm. The outside is straight up scary but inside it's like being transported to a swanky bistro with dim lighting, lovely modern decor, nicely dressed wait staff, real flowers on the table, strawberry infused water....very peaceful and tranquil. They do have high chairs for the kiddos.  
.
$57.32 got us a thai coffee, thai tea, egg rolls, crispy basil ribeye, pad see ew, and a creme brulee.  Complimentary fried wontons were brought to the table. I could have eaten a whole basket of these...they were wonderfully hot, crispy, salty, and came with a zesty dipping sauce.  I loved them. 
.
$12.00 Pad See Ew with chicken- Well seasoned flat noodles with chicken, scrambed egg, and chinese broccoli.  This was absolutely delicious.  It reminds me of the version at Thai Food to Go.  
.
$19.00 Ribeye crispy basil- Strips of ribeye with perfectly sauteed veggies.  I loved the pod of fresh peppercorns (never seen that before) and the lotus chip on top. The dish feels very elegant yet comforting. 
.
$9.00 creme brulee- hands down the most beautiful thing I've ever eaten...I was so sad to destroy it!  It was topped with fresh fruit, an edible violet, and a breath-taking sugar cage.  It was perfectly bruleed on top and the consistency was decadent and creamy.  It looked like they used real vanilla beans which I don't think I've ever had before but it was quite wonderful....they give a very subtle vanilla flavor.   
.
Egg rolls were hot, crispy, and filled nicely.  My only complaint would be the thai coffee...it was pretty terrible.  It tasted like they used irish cream Coffee Mate creamer instead of half & half.   I did not enjoy it...it was like drinking Bailey's.  Husband's thai tea was good, however.  
.
I think the mark of a good restaurant is wanting to come back....and I can't wait to go back here."}
{"text":"Very delicious food so glad I checked this place out!! Their desserts are everything. I will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This review is way overdue. 
My friend & I dined here for lunch last August for my birthday and the food and experience was memorable. We ordered the papaya salad, tom yum soup & pad Thai. All items tasted fresh & delicious. 
I'd recommend this restaurant if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Located in weird strip mall but once you enter the restaurant the ambience is pleasant and cute. 
Tom yum soup is  one the best i had. Drunken noodles and pad thai also pretty amazing.  Desserts were ok, not great that i would have then again."}
{"text":"Yes, they have a high review rating on Yelp. Yes, their food is good and presentation of dishes and overall atmosphere are more on the fancy side. Yes, this place will probably always be busy with customers and continue to receive accolades. However, my one experience at this place, which was over a four-person dinner reservation on a summer Friday evening while I was in town for the weekend, was less positive than expected. Let me explain why. 

First of all, our server was rude. Not in an overt way, but rather in the manner of her being too overbearing and inconsiderate. After showing us to our table, she began explaining the menu before we all had a chance to sit down, and she even blocked my one friend from getting to her seat, so my friend ended up just going to the bathroom first. On top of that, the server then prematurely came back to take our drink/appetizer order before my friend had returned to the table and sat down--meaning, she hadn't even had a chance to look at the menu yet! To me, this constitutes as rude practice, and that right there had set the negative tone for me. After that, the same server, on several occasions, kept reaching over me and did not allow appropriate space between herself and our table. Also, why do servers/wait staff always want to take our plates away before we are thoroughly done with each dish??!!? On multiple occasions, our server, as well as another wait staff, had tried to reach over our table to take serving plates away, WITHOUT even asking if we were done with them....even my soup cup, which clearly had a good portion of soup left in it, was fair game to them. This is NOT okay, Arawan... Take note!!!!! This is a huge pet peeve for many of us diners, and it's annoying to me no matter the kind of establishment or how fancy the restaurant is.

Although we were satisfied with the food that we ordered, it's highly likely that I, personally speaking, will never return. It's a shame too, because there were quite a few dishes that I would have liked to try. But aside from the less-than-quality service that I experienced, it should also be noted that their prices are more on the expensive end of Thai cuisine. I feel that these combined reasons justify my low rating here. For me, the poor service experience trumped the food, and especially at those prices. Why would I pay more money for really the same quality of food that I can get elsewhere and with better service?"}
{"text":"Came here for dinner since Lotus of Siam quoted more than a 1.5 hour wait and it didn't disappoint. I'm actually glad the wait was long at the other restaurant as I wouldn't have stepped foot in here otherwise. Located in a strip mall, you wouldn't think Arawan Thai Bistro and Dessert would be fancy on the inside. On a Friday night, there was no wait. I'm definitely surprised because the food and service (friendly and attentive) here are fantastic!

Arawan has the usual menu items seen at other Thai restaurants, but they offer dishes with a unique twist as well. Food is meant to be shared family style, so I definitely recommend doing this. Everything we ordered for dinner was packed with flavor...nothing disappointed!

To start we had the Thai-style calarmari, ahi tuna larb, and tom yum soup. Although all three were good, my favorite between the three appetizers was the larb. The ahi tuna was fresh and nicely coated with the spicy lime dressing. Mixed with mango, avocado, and green onions, this larb is a must order. I'm generally not a fan of tom yum soup, but I liked the one here. The lemongrass flavor was present, but not overpowering. Also enjoyed the generous amount of shrimp included in the dish.

For entrees we decided on the duck drunken noodles, Thai BBQ chicken, and garlic short ribs. Loved the drunk noodles. There was more than enough duck in the dish for everyone to enjoy. Noodles were cooked well and the sauce packed just enough heat. Vegetables were fresh, but I could have done without some of them. The Thai BBQ chicken was juicy, tender, and had lots of flavor to it. I especially enjoyed the crispy skin. The accompanied sauce wasn't necessary, but complimented the dish well. Although good, the garlic short ribs had to be the least favorite of the three entrees ordered. They were crispy and garlicky, but fried a little too long for my liking.

Despite the fact I was full at this point, I couldn't resist ordering dessert. The banana puff was different and calling my name. Luckily I was able to convince my dad to share it with me! The banana ice cream was fresh and tasted homemade. I appreciated the caramel drizzle and liked how it wasn't drenched on top of the ice cream. The bananas brulee were great. Not too sweet and all had a nice crispy sugar crust to them. The puff pastry was crispy and added nice texture to the dish. So good! Definitely a must order. I also tried the affogato which was a great pick me up if you are just starting your evening. The shot of espresso offered is definitely strong. 

Wash everything down with a Thai iced tea or a fresh lemonade and you won't regret coming to Arawan!"}
{"text":"Really great and fresh Thai food.  Friends had been encouraging us to try Arawan for several weeks - told us we would love more than Lotus. Finally we did and they were 100% right.

Service was outstanding!  Super attentive servers.  Ambiance was great - very clean and modern design.  You would never know you are in a strip mall from the Inside.  

Food was delicious and so fresh.  Highly recommend the tuna appetizer - we would have rated that as a main course!  The spicy mint with beef was great and so was the drunken noodles with shrimp.  We ordered everything at medium heat, which may have been a little too spicy for my husband, so be specific on heat level.  To end the meal we had the creme brûlée and it was so beautiful - just as nice as a five star restaurant dessert!

Highly recommend and will be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"Checked yelp for a good Thai restaurant in the area and that's how we came across Arawan. Took a taxi from Aria and got lost as the compound where it's located is quite big, we eventually found it and boy am I glad we did! The restaurant is quaint and has a bit of a sit down dinner type of vibe to it. We were greeted by very friendly employees! We ordered the Pad Thai, Short Rib yellow curry, red chicken curry and the mixed vegetables. Let me start with the Pad Thai, the presentation was beautiful! The pad Thai noodles were wrapped in an egg and had two prawns on top of it, it was so delicious! The beefy curry was one of our favorites, the flavor is just so unique and delicious (a must try!), the mixed vegetables were also so delicious, it ha Brown gravy sauce that tastes like nothing I've tried before, the vegetables were cooked to perfection. We only ordered a few dishes to save room for dessert. 

For dessert we ordered the ff:
1. Mango Island - I believe this is their take on the traditional mango sticky rice. The presentation was beautiful and the taste and texture were perfect. I love that they put crispy waffle and crunchy almond and the coconut sauce tasted so fresh! The ice cream they used must be homemade as it was so creamy! Must try!

2. Coconut Treasure- this is basically coconut ice cream (dairy free) with sticky rice, peanuts and coconut milk. So good! I love their homemade arawan chocolate that comes with each dessert entree. 

3. Raspberry Chocolate Lava Cake- this takes 15 minutes to make so I suggest ordering it ahead of time. This is a dark chocolate lava cake with strawberry ice cream, fresh strawberries, raspberry sauce and hazelnut streusel baked to perfection! This was my dessert of choice and it was awesome! It wasn't too sweet nor overwhelming.

All in all I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND THIS RESTAURANT, clean place, quaint ambience, awesome Food and great service!

Good job Arawan!"}
{"text":"Although I wasn't expecting much since I am extremely partial to Chada Thai and Wine, I did think Arawan would be better given the great photos and positive reviews. Sadly, my meal was a total disappointment.

I ordered the Vegan Tofu Larb and was thoroughly disappointed at the lack of noticeable rice powder, cabbage or cucumbers, and underwhelming level of their  interpretation of \"Thai Spicy\". Seriously though, I could have had my dish 5x hotter than what I was served and I do not believe that no one in their history has ever asked for hotter (as I was informed). If so, I suppose I should start carrying a bag of ghost chilis in my bag cause what others think is incredibly spicy tastes like a bell pepper to me. 

Since the Larb was pretty meh and quite small, I decided to order a vegan pad Thai. After some back and forth about whether the dish could be made gluten free, the order was repeated and then placed. To my dismay, what was brought out was encased in a mesh of egg. Since the vegan pad Thai at this restaurant has egg, I sure as heck don't trust their gluten free. Needless to say, I left hungry.

I gave the restaurant one final chance with dessert and ordered the mango sticky rice. At $10, the dish is incredibly overpriced. I liked the plating and presentation, although blue/gray rice is NOT appetizing and I would seriously hope they eventually change that. I also did not understand the chocolate stuck into the sticky rice and I highly doubt it was vegan.

Overall, I did not feel the food at Arawan was truly authentic, nor did I feel that the restaurant was capable of serving the dietary restrictions they advertised as having the ability to cater to. Also, on an awkward side note, the server was rather inappropriate on several occasions and I ultimately left feeling extremely uncomfortable. Honestly, 3 stars might be a bit too generous. If you're looking for Thai, save yourself the trouble and go to one of the other amazing restaurants in Vegas."}
{"text":"Great Thai place! The food was all a work of art I almost didn't want to mess it up because it was so pretty. The crispy basil ribeye was excellent. Also got the signature Pad Thai and it was good too, not the best pad Thai I have had but very very good. The desserts were so good as everyone else has commented on. The prices are a little high but eating out is usually not cheap these days. Highly recommend if not just to stop by to get some dessert."}
{"text":"I am a Thai food lover, and this is one of best I've ever eaten in town. I've eaten here twice now, and it's far better than Lotus of Siam in my opinion. 
I love the Chicken wings, the best tangy sauce ever. Crab fried rice the bomb, curry on point.
The ingredients are fresh, the staff is friendly, and the atmosphere is a great bistro feel. Prices are super reasonable. I haven't tried the famous deserts yet, but they will be for next time I visit :)"}
{"text":"The best thai food and desserts i have ever had. The service was also great, polite and attentive. My water glass was always full. 

The restaurant was clean and cozy.  
We had lunch here and it served with a cup of soup, small garden salad and dessert at the end. 
The presentation of food and desserts were amazing as well as the taste. 

Chef Gail, a pastry chef made us a signature dessert called mango island. It was fantastic, nothing to compare.  It is a must to try!!!! 
My friend had cherry sorbet which was so good and refreshing. 

We would extremely recommend this restaurant for whoever love Thai food and have sweet tooth like us. Go check it out. You will love it."}
{"text":"Modern take on classic Thai dishes.   I would say this place is super overpriced for the portion size but since it is in the same shopping center as Lotus of Siam, I can understand the price hike.  

They have a nice modern decor and the service was quick and friendly. 

None of the food we had was bad but none of it was that memorable either. 

I will say that the desserts were excellent!   I had the mango island and I think it might be one of the best desserts I've had out in quite some time.   Very balanced and just the right amount of sweet."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the atmosphere and the food was delicious.  This is a great Thai restaurant if you are out of town and want to enjoy some good Asian thai while in Vegas"}
{"text":"From the dilapidated parking lot you walk in and are magically transported to a lovely restaurant with simple and elegant decoration. Rare for me to give out 5 stars, but I was impressed by everything here at Arawan. 

Friendly service, the waitress Kim not only asked our names but shook our hand in a genuine greeting. The entire staff was friendly and smiling, and service was on point.

The food was delicious and beautifully presented. My friend and I went with Tom Kha soup, garlic short ribs, and Arawan Pad Thai. The photos say it all for presentation, my mouth says YUM. Prices are decent too, $58 for everything including the Mango Island dessert (this was soooooo good).

I'll definitely be back, again and again. I highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a wonderful dining experience without paying top dollar."}
{"text":"I had the Basil Steak. It was delicious. I really enjoyed my meal. Waitresses were constantly filling up our glasses and came by to ask how we were and to check on us. Prices were affordable"}
{"text":"great food and the ambience was also nice. 
Staff was really friendly, we did not try the desserts but they seem promising"}
{"text":"I went there to eat Pad Thai and Panang curry last week with my friend . I'm a Thai and I really love Thai food also . Pad thai was pretty good but a little bit sweet and also Panag curry was a little bit salty and bitter ."}
{"text":"Amazing place with really classy ambiance..
Great food..had such good thai food after years.
Very mannered and sophisticated staff. 
Going to visit this place every time I am in Vegas :)"}
{"text":"One of the best Thai restaurants that I've been to. A bit pricy, but i think the quality and quantity of the food they provide compensated the high price tag. We had party of five people (2 adult men, 3 adult women), and it was enough to order just four entrees."}
{"text":"Highly recommend the egg rolls, crab fried rice, and creme brûlée! Though everything was phenomenal! The presentation was artful and appetizing. It's family owned by some very friendly people. I hope for lots of success for Arawan!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went for dinner on a recent trip to Vegas. We enjoy eating local and we make a special point to try out good local restaurants any time we travel too. 

Arawan is definitely located in a strange neighborhood/ part of town (not to mention we were there in the dark) - but, it is Vegas. We found the parking lot seemingly pretty busy and were pleasantly surprised by the overall feel and decor when we walked in. We did not make a reservation (for 2) but might be a good idea as they were a little busy on a random Monday night. 

We love Thai food and have our fav that we order back home - red coconut curry. We ordered the spring rolls, Pad Thai (other reviewers raved about it), red coconut chicken curry, chocolate cake and coconut sticky rice. - we were starving but it was a ton of food!!! 

Overalll the food was excellent. The curry was awesome, the Pad Thai was good - not as epic as other reviewers said though. Desserts were amazing. 

Pros: fairly priced, excellent food presentation, good Thai, local and off the strip, in-house pastry chef with awesome desserts. 

Cons: strange neighborhood, not a place to eat at if you are unfamiliar with Thai food (probably why some reviewers didn't like the food), make a reservation so you don't have to wait."}
{"text":"Good atmosphere!! Very nice place! Very clean! Every dishes are nice and I can tell a lot of detail. \"Presentation are Amazing!!\" They put them heart into it!! I Love it!! Service so good nice people."}
{"text":"Arawan is often considered among the best Thai restaurants in Las Vegas if not the BEST, and that status has earned this restaurant a spot on many foodie's bucket list. 

This place is a gem! From the music, food taste, presentation and service... this place has AMAZING food! Their flavors are exquisite and dishes very colorful and aromatic!

The area where restaurant is located and the rather expected entrance might fool the first timers, but once you've had a chance to try the Ahi Tuna Larb, Arawan Pad Thai, the Duck Drunken Noodles or any of the distinctive Thai dishes, you'll understand why the restaurant has such a following. 

Pâtissier Gail is always around assuring satisfaction and making sugar works of art worthy of a photograph. The presentation, attention to detail, exotic flavors, ambiance and service, Arawan serves more than food, you're treated with an entire experience. Art for your eyes and a symphony of flavors to your palate this place DELIVERS! 

Great work! When in Vegas, you HAVE to visit this hidden gem. 

If you want to experience Thai whit the most modern and tasteful approach, you HAVE to come to Arawan."}
{"text":"You guys!! Don't waste your time with Lotus of Siam. Zero ambiance and \"order your food at the bar\" service. Meh.

Walk 500 ft to Arawan. Clean, quiet, welcoming, cool decor & fabulous service (shout out to Drake. Thanks, dude). 

You won't be disappointed. Cheers!"}
{"text":"Amazing family run business. I have been there several times for their lunch special which cant be beat. IF you like spicy, you need to tell them you want thai hot as it is not as spicy as other local thai restaurants.  Décor is beautiful, service is top notch. Amazing desserts. Menu is expanding and they will add liquor soon hopefully.  I rate on par with Chada Thai but give a nod to Chada Thai on some food items.  Service and dessert go to Arawan; no contest.  They have interesting side room that was part of former Japanese restaurant.  This is my new go to place for clients or a great lunch."}
{"text":"Good Thai food. Ordered fish cake, fried tofu, Basil chicken fried rice and garlic pepper meat. It was delicious and sumptuous. Place is near strip and service is courteous."}
{"text":"Look; it's a fine thai place, and some of their dishes are pretty, but its not great.  It's doesn't beat its next door cousin, and it certainly doesn't beat its competition across the plaza.  The dishes are mediocre, lack depth, and aren't worth what they want for them.  Save the time and hit another spot.

Is Thai food going the way of sushi where every sushi place gets 4+ stars simply for existing?"}
{"text":"Arawan is a fantastic gem. I've had so much fun here with my friends I enjoyed the sea bass and the desert is absolutely stunning it's a work of art you must try the creme brulee and sticky rice with mango here are some pictures to titillate and entice you.   I will be coming back."}
{"text":"My fav Thai place in Vegas and I have been to Lotus. 

Service is above and beyond in many ways and the food is presented beautifully! 

Must get their Tom Kha soup! Very tasty with plenty of shrimp. Anything they serve with shrimp is very good ! They devein the shrimp nicely and even take off the tails. 

Their drinks are all good. The tea is presented nicely and is good tea. 

Desserts are beautiful and delicious! 

Highly recommend !"}
{"text":"L-O-V-E!

I moved from Davis, CA (near Sacramento) to Los Angeles 9 years ago. I never found a thai restaurant as good as the one I left back in Davis.  That was, until tonight on vaca in Vegas. Why do you have to break my heart and exist in another state?!? Oh, the sadness. 

We ordered: crab cakes $18: two tiny little tasty cakes with a small spicy ass side salad. It was the least favorite of what we ordered and I probably wouldn't order it again, but it wasn't bad at all. 

Chicken satay $8 for 4 nice sized skewers of good quality chicken seasoned and cooked to perfection with a tiny cup of cucumber salad and peanut sauce on the side. 

Tom Ka soup with chicken. I didn't care the chicken and wished I had either ordered tofu or shrimp, but the broth and flavors in the actual soup were DELISH. In Davis this was my absolute favorite meal and I have never found a place until tonight that serves a coconut milk-based broth that isn't greasy or watered down. It was perfectly rich and creamy and milky and I only wished I had ordered the large order with extra cabbage and mushrooms because it was delightful...even on a 104* day! 

Duck $26-I didn't eat any, but my husband said it was good and chicken-y, but just a bit chewier. Didn't appear too crispy, generous portion, but I don't know how pricy duck is supposed to run. 

Yellow beef curry $12-good, a little less soupy than we like, but LOTS of meat and potatoes and carrots and bell pepper, which we haven't had in too many curries before. It was good. The meat was super chewy and cut in huge pieces, which I didn't care for and didn't eat any of, but in all honesty, I could literally be a vegetarian...except for the occasional
In & Out burger! 

For dessert we ordered the traditional mango and sticky rice and while it was a small portion, it was delectable and the presentation made up for us wishing we had more. For $10 we would recommend this work of art! 

The banana puff pastry with ice cream and bananas and strawberries and chocolate sauce...oh good lord...the best $12 we spent! 

The place: hidden in a sketchy area, in a dark strip mall sort of looking place, near an alley that we drive thru while trying to find the dang place. Passed it once even with the GPS, but so glad we didn't give up and just go somewhere else. Inside is lovely and intimate. Nicely decorated and the layout makes it pretty private. Great date environment, yet good for families, too. The music was perfect: like a soft romantic classical-type blend. 

The people: the gentleman running the place is SO very nice. His wife is the owner and chef. She puts her ENTIRE heart into every single dish and everything we ordered was literally a masterpiece. Everything came out at different times so we are slowly and did courses and we were so excited to dive in that I only got pictures of desserts...and even then little hands had already picked at them! The man's daughter is the pastry chef and prepares the desserts. She is as phenomenal as her mom. Our waitress was Jenny. She was very nice and attentive and deserved her 20% for sure. Everyone sort of whispers here and it's so nice and peaceful. 

A little bummed they don't do anything for birthdays because we were celebrating our two littles, but oh well, still loved everything and left very happy! We will DEFINITELY come back the next time we are in town."}
{"text":"This was an on the whim pick as the wait for their neighbor was 90minutes!

We are so glad Yelp referred us to Arawan as their restaurant was decorated modernly and also seemed roomier and not so \"mom-&-pop\" shop. However as soon as food was ordered and our servers were making suggestions and has great conversations with us, it definitely had the homey feel. 

We tried a few dishes including fried tofu, curry short rib, squid ink pasta with seafood galore and a few other items I can't remember.

Overall rating is I am definitely coming back! Their dessert was nicely presented and delicious."}
{"text":"So it is in the same sketchy shopping center as Lotus of Siam (Los). Full disclosure LoS is one of my favorite restaurants, so know that I am coming in with that perspective.

Based on reviews I tried it instead of LoS, here are my thoughts:
Pros:
Atmosphere: much nicer than LoS,. clearly new, modern and clean interior. Would be nice setting for a date.
Service:, fantastic, friendly and helpful with the menu. Very attentive.
Dessert: this place shines at dessert. Both the mango and the coconut dishes were beautifully presented and tasted even better. Worth coming here for dessert alone.

Cons:
Wine list- so LoS has one of the best lists in America. Arawan does not. I'll leave it at that. Not sure if you can bring your own, but if you want decent wine, you should.

Food- Interesting and smaller menu than LoS (not a negative as I think LoS is too much).  Had the sea bass, which was nicely cooked. Only think that threw off the dish was the gelatin textured sauce. It had almost a distractingly sweet flavor that took away from the heat of the dish.  Other dishes looked decent. General comment was that many lacked flavor.  Not sure if that is clientele driven or what. In fairness, the number of other diners I heard order \"zero spice\" was astounding. What the heck is thai food with zero spice?! 

Overall- I'd go LoS hands down. If LoS was too crowded, I'd definitely come here for a decent meal (not drinks) and amazing drinks."}

The seating area is not very big but they going to expand or remodel the room next door ... I can't wait to go back again!"}

{"text":"We seem to come here when we are in the mood for thai and Lotus has a long wait. But we are always amazed that this place is nicely decorated, little upscale, excellent service, and great unique plates (like whole fish and beef jerky, who'd have thought), and it is so accessible (no waiting).  Excellent shrimp fried rice (they were out of crab). 

Don't want to hype this place up too much, and make it too crowded and popular, but they deserve a great review. 

The deserts are a little pricy but really good. And can't say enough about the service we got. Zagat worthy."}

Very nice ambiance and very comfortable with class.  We ordered pineapple fried rice and lemongrass chicken wings.  The presentation of the dishes were very pleasing and nice.  The taste was delicious.  We also had a mango island dessert and a thai tea for dessert.  Very yummy. 
 We will be coming back here again"}
{"text":"Soft shell crab is recommended!!! However the soup is way to sour. Maybe try duck next time. The service is average good."}
{"text":"Restaurant setting is good.  Foods tend to be sweeter than the authentic Thai food I know."}
{"text":"Let me start this by saying that I went to this restaurant for the first time about a year ago. This was one place that I could not get out of my mind and flavors that I could not get off of my tastebuds.

The first time I went, I was craving Thai and I was staying on The Strip. My friend, who is a local, and I had already checked out Lotus of Siam, which is literally in the same plaza, but I said that we should try somewhere new. We went online and found this place. We had no idea what to expect given the location, but we were definitely pleasantly surprised when we opened the doors. Nestled in such a plaza, we were literally taken away from that when we stepped inside the restaurant with its modern decor and well-balanced casual-yet-upscale dining atmosphere. We were seated next to some sort of a grand dessert that they had on display and my friend asked if it was real to which the waitress responded yes. We were both amazed at the presentation.

The server asked us if it was our first time there. We explained that I was in town for business and we literally had no idea that the restaurant was here, but we wanted to try a new place. We looked over the menu and after having posed a few questions, we had decided on the Soft Shell Crab Pad Pong Karee and the Thai-Spiced Sea Bass as our main dishes and ordered glasses of water and one of the blossoming teas.

When the waitress returned, she had our glasses of water which had strawberries added rather than the usual lemon and the tea as expected. Unexpectedly, she brought along an appetizer of the fish cakes as a thank you. We were very surprised and enjoyed the presentation of everything in front of us, especially the opportunity to see the blossoming tea which included an Easter Lily.

After eating our appetizer, we were wowed again by the presentation of our main dishes. Everything was perfectly spiced (this can be adjusted by notifying your waiter) and the service was excellent. We did not indulge in dessert, but we did see others eating the desserts which were beautifully presented.

Most recently, I returned and they've expanded the menu but everything is still amazing. This time, I tried the Ahi Tuna Larb and the Spicy Mint Mixed Seafood which comes with a side of steamed white rice. This is easily my favorite place in Las Vegas. If you are looking for a unique dining experience outside of The Strip, this is definitely the place."}
{"text":"$10 lunch specials that include soup, salad and dessert! I had the pad Thai! So delicious!!!"}
{"text":"We went to this place for our 2 year anniversary and were pleasantly surprised. Even though it is not located in the best neighborhood, it looked really upscale. The service was excellent and the menu was very clear. What a great idea to put a piece of strawberry in your water! It looks so pretty and tastes so good! Usually my bf orders for me in Asian places because I am not very familiar with this cuisine but this time I decided to order myself. I am a big fan of duck dishes which are a staple in France and they are usually cooked in sauce. So in my opinion the duck I ordered was a little bit dry, but maybe that's the way they cook it in Thailand. We will be back very soon and I want to try something else."}
{"text":"Lovely place.  It's tucked away on the east side of Las Vegas Blvd, and although it didn't look anything great from outside,  it was a pleasant surprise. The ambience was lovely and the food was even better.  We ordered vegetarian food for the most part and the flavors were impeccable.  The tea selection was awesome and the mushroom Tom yum soup was absolutely lovely.   Well go back there again in a heartbeat."}
{"text":"Nice place with good food.  They have my favorite.  Duck with Drunken noodle.  Always perfect.   Prices are good but higher than most Thai but worth it.  It's near Lotus but it's not as busy if your in a rush."}

All the lunch dishes are the perfect size, not too big. And it comes with dessert! Yummy! I've enjoyed everything I've tried, and the spice level isn't too crazy for me. I like a little kick, not my mouth flaming up. 
I really enjoy coming here for lunch and the employees are always super nice to me. 
Put this on your lunch rotation :)"}

I should disclose that my significant other is Thai, so I feel like he would know what good Thai food would be and we definitely both agreed the food was excellent.

We ordered crab fried rice which was made with adequate amounts of real crab. We also ordered tom yum soup with shrimp, portion was enough to share. Broth was light but flavorful. I am subtracting 0.5 stars because it literally had 3 pieces of shrimp but that did not take away from the flavor. For our meat, we ordered the beef salad medium well, mild spice - this was very good also. Beef was cooked to order and portion was enough to share as well. 

For dessert, which yelpers recommended we order, we ordered the Sweet Sensation which consisted of freshly made roti (Thai crepe) drizzled with condensed milk and granulated sugar with fresh banana inside. The roti was soft and warm, and not too sugary! It also came with a scoop of Thai tea ice cream. The ice cream was excellent, robust in taste but not overpowering. They also included a side of fresh diced strawberries. Ugh my only regret is we didn't get to try the entire dessert menu because there were so many!

Location is a little bazaar but parking is ample. Servers were accommodating and very helpful in making our order choices good.

I am subtracting another 0.5 stars because of the prices. They are a little over the top however, I definitely think they are worth the try! Might be our new favorite Thai restaurant in Vegas!"}
