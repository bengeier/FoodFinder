{"text":"Are there really words in the English language to describe how wonderful this food is?  Not even close.  This is by far the best Middle Eastern cuisine I've had in the valley.  Lots of entrees to choose from, so many different desserts, and if you're feeling bold, you can try one of their unique drink options. (+ positive, - negative, -/+ neutral)  -/+ Sometimes the wait can be long, especially during lunch hour.  But I wouldn't say that this should keep you away.  The food is worth it.  + Chicken Shawarma  + Gyros  + Lots of food.  Sometimes you have to roll me out to the car when I'm done... and I STILL have left overs.  + Friendly, helpful staff that will make you feel at home.  -/+  Decor.  I've heard some people hate on the \"look\" of the restaurant.  It's not a wine and dine kind of place and honestly, it's not that bad.  It's just a bunch of tables and chairs, but is that what you're there for?  No, you're there for the amazing, bountiful meal that your little tummy has been begging for.  It's clean, whether some people say that or not.  I'm pretty sure they wouldn't win Best-of awards for almost 30 years if they were bad at keeping things picked up."}
{"text":"Been here 3 times this month. The chicken shwarma plate and gyro plate are excellent. The prices are great, portions are huge and i can never finish it all. Service is good. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"This place is the essence of middle eastern food.  Simple.  Quality Ingredients.  Great Flavors.  No Frills."}
{"text":"This place is really delicious! I ordered a gyro and hummus and they were both very good. It's a fun restaurant/ market. I ordered my meal to-go, which you do in the market, and it was fun to peruse the aisles while I waited for my food. The guys behind the counter were really friendly, I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Their food is amazing -- all of it.  Love the gyro, veggie combo, greek salad, shawerma, falafel, baba ganoush.  Make a point to order the house-made pita instead of the Armenian bread.  Always great service. I'm also a big fan of the grocery store part of the joint.  You just have to try one of their baklavas -- walnut, almond, pistachio or cashew -- all divine.  Fab for tea and spices, too."}
{"text":"Had the regular sample plate and the vegetarian sample plate. Great hummus, falafel, and lamb. Chicken and gyro meat were ok but not awesome. I could not believe how tasty the meat was. Delicate blend of spices where no one thing is overpowering; a symphonic balance of flavors that melds perfectly.   Their iced tea is refreshingly strong, with more than a hint of cinnamon. Guys behind the counter at the to-go/deli are quite opinionated and will not hesitate to steer customers toward their favorites. I like that."}
{"text":"I managed to beat  the lunchtime crush of people heading to Haji Baba by about ten minutes.  I had already placed my order.  My plate of hummus and my yogurt soda was just arriving when I noticed the place was now packed, and a line of people was waiting for a table.  Two obviously out-of-town ladies sat at the table nearest me.  They used loud, awed, slightly bemused voices that hinted they were from the Midwest and had never been \"out West\" before.  \"... couldn't BELIEVE the TRAFFIC!\" one was saying as they sat down.  \"We waited fifteen minutes on the street before we could even turn into the campus!\"  ASU was having their Student Load-In week; traffic was hellish anywhere near the university. \"It was no better when we unloaded Nicole's things,\" the other woman said.  \"We were right in the middle of carrying in everything, and a security guard stopped us an told us we couldn't --\" \"Would you like something to drink?\" the waiter asked, surprising them both. They gave him their orders, after asking \"what kind of pop\" they had.  Definitely Midwestern.  The waiter walked away, and they continued staring at the menus as they assumed looks of deep confusion. \"What is ... shum ... shoe-marmy?\" \"Shoe-arma?  Shuh, warma?\" \"What IS that?\" \"I have no idea.  But it comes in a sandwich.\" \"Like, on bread?\" \"It says on a pita.\" \"Oh .... But isn't a pita a cracker?\" \"What about ... baba gub .... Bana gaboosh?\" \"Where?\"  The friend pointed at the other's menu.  \"Oh my.  Bagga boo ... goosh?  Excuse me?  Sir?\"  I realized she was talking to me.  \"Do you know what this is?\"  She pointed at her menu. \"Baba gannouj,\" I said.  I kind of enjoyed the look of fear that crossed their faces, as though I were uttering a phrase that would summon a lesser demon.  \"It's eggplant dip, kind of lemony.  Kind of like hummus.  You dip pita into it.  It's great.\"  As I spoke, I watched her eyes grow huge as she saw my glass of fizzy, thick white yogurt soda. \"I've never even HEARD of that!\" the other woman said.  \"What's this fluffoofal?\"   \"Felafel,\" I said, and the fact that I avoided laughing then should earn me some kind of award.  \"They're fantastic here, lots of great spices ... have you had felafal before?\"   They hadn't, of course, and I was at a loss to explain it.  I decided the shwarma or the gyros were probably too \"exotic,\" so I recommended the chicken kebab pitas.  My koobideh plate arrived then, prompting another couple of baffled, wide-eyed stares.  I told them to be sure and get a couple pieces of baklava for dessert, since it's better, fresher, and half the price of anywhere else nearby.  They agreed, but I got the impression it was more due to the fact that they had heard of baklava before than my recommendation.  Judging by the yummy noises coming from their table as they ate, they enjoyed their kebabs.  I had to withhold a star, as much as I love Haji Baba, because it does not have the best shwarma I've found.  It's very, very good ... but not the best."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. The moment you step inside and smell the food, you know you came to the right place. Very nice people and great food. So glad I yelped Persian food."}
{"text":"Chicken shawarma might be the best I've ever had. The tabouli, hummus, falafel, gyro.... basically everything is exceptional. I always get an arabic coffee after I eat here   also, it's really good. If you're looking for authentic ingredients than this is the place to go, they literally have almost any indo/pak/med spices you're looking for. Baklava is a must have too."}
{"text":"Well it's a grocery and a restaurant I liked the chicken showema it's tasty plus there prices is reasonable.. There location at yelp"}
{"text":"Love this place. I always tell myself to eat my way through their menu but I never do. I always get the same thing I usually do, which is the chicken shawarma plate. I love it! I get my hummus & pita fix as well as the always yummy garlic sauce on the chicken. I try and get extra garlic sauce with mine :) Get extra pita cause they do give a good serving of hummus. Also, the rice is yummy, although last time I was there, the rice was different than usual."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely AMAZING!  I've been coming here for over 16 years and it's the same AMAZING place today that it was back in 1997.  I've never ventured past the Gyros, Chicken Shawerma, and Hummus Tahini but these three menu items are absolutely AMAZING!  The food is AMAZING, the portions are good, and the prices are right.  I hope to write another review 16 years from now saying how AMAZING this place has been over the last 32 years.  Haji Baba Rocks!"}
{"text":"Excellent Middle Eastern food. Superb prices. Associated with a great grocery. Whatever you need to make your favorite mid east dish is here. Multiple choices for baklava. Great beef shwarma...hard to find and done well here. Good choice for lunch. Busy atmosphere. Basic table/chair configuration but not uncomfortable."}
{"text":"I love this place primarily for either Chicken Schwarma or Falafels and Hummus. I am not a fan of their Gyros though. They have by far the BEST baklava ever! I especially like the Pistachio Baklava. I also go here and get spices and Chamomile tea. Their prices are very reasonable. I really like the food here! We once ordered a whole lamb they had roasted for a Pascha celebration, it was delicious!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here for awhile...food always great and great prices, Turkish coffee amazing...new to this yelp and wanted to review one of my favorite places that I always introduce to my friends...over the years havent had one not LOVE IT as well. It is a casual atmosphere, but dont just dine here the grocery store is a great find, their spices, olive oil is very good good prices...definitely save!  If you like the Feta cheese on their salad and food in the restaurant they sell it behind the counter in the grocery store part...and it is cheaper than in the regular grocery stores. It is the French Feta they serve in restaurant, I asked after picking wrong kind of feta the first time. They have take out. It can get really busy at lunch time during the week......"}
{"text":"Turkish coffee!!  Drink so much.   Thick as dirty motor oil and the fine grounds in the bottom are like chewing on sand. I Love it. The food is also really good."}
{"text":"Chicken Shwarma is da bomb my friends.  Only other dish nearly as amazing is the gyro salad - feta cheese off the hook.  Get the Shwarma or cry in the morning, it's your choice.  Order the Chicken Shwarma and get it to go, it's too busy at lunch here.    Add the Yogurt Soda to drink, it will expand your consciousness to another dimension or be frickin' naughty and grub on some Baklava.   If you are dining in, order an olive plate to compliment it all.  Cheap and fabulous.  Haji, just keep doing what you do.  We love you.  I'll see you tomorrow."}
{"text":"I always stop over here when I'm in Tempe,  you can't be the prices! The hummus, gyro, tabouli have all been great.  My friend and  usually waiter, Ali even convinced me to try the Turkish coffee, that was good.  The baklava counter is always irresistible at checkout.  I'm going to have to visit soon."}
{"text":"I found the food to be average-to-good, I had the kibbeh plate (rather tasty and plentiful portions) and my dining companion enjoyed a sandwich. The food is inexpensive and service is relatively quick. Our server was very pleasant. When I went up to the cashier to settle the tab, I noticed they had an impressive variety of baklava and turkish delight candy in the case. I LOVE turkish delight - it's my favorite candy of all time. Naturally, I requested a few pieces to go. I got home minutes later to find that the turkish delight was completely stale and dried out. I was so disappointed! However, if you're looking for cheap eats, check this place."}
{"text":"Best baklava in town. They are fresh and tasty. Also this is a good place to get quality fast food."}
{"text":"Chicken shawarma ice tea and baklava   Don't miss this jewel, plus you can take a selfie with the payphone...seriously they have a payphone.   Better food than the other place you like."}
{"text":"My de-facto place for Arab food.  I've been here regularly for meeting up with friends and bringing out-of-towners in . The food is always consistently filling and  tasty with flavors. I either go for the gyro wraps or full plates if I'm truly hungry.  The wall art is an interesting mix of Roman and Egyptian architecture. The table seatings is a no frill setting. Service is minimal. But great value for the price.   The restaurant is shared with a Arab mini-market. Plenty of parking and only about 200 feet east of the light rail stop. It's located on the same shopping strip as  Khai Hoan Vietnamese restaurant so coming here creates a choice dilemma for me."}
{"text":"SUPER FRIENDLY,   SUPER FAST  SUPER CHEAP  SUPER CHEAP.    seriously. this place is the best place in all of the phoenix area for middle eastern food .   it has been around forever,    go here.   much better than princess or all the awful middle eastern/turkish/ Mediterranean places on mill..   and dont even think about going to pita jungle across the street. ..seriously"}
{"text":"Haji Baba is a great little restaurant. I ordered the falafil sandwich along with feta cheese and hummus on the side. I really enjoyed this place. The atmosphere was out dated and very small but the food is authentic. Their food is filling and you will somehow leave with fresh baklava in your hand even though you cannot hold anymore food down. I also had the pecan baklava which I highly enjoyed as it was my first time having it. I would definitely return to Haji Baba. Look out chicken shawerma and tabooli...I'm coming for you! Lol"}
{"text":"Incredible little mediterranen oasis in Tempe! The sandwiches (schawarma, Falafel, chicken, beef) are delicious and ridiculously cheap. The hummus is very good as well as the yogurt sauce that is serves with the veggie plate. The baba ghannoush could be better but was still very good! If you don't want to dine in you find a extensive selection of Arabic foods and goods, beautiful spices and herbs, cheeses, canned and pickled vegetable, all sorts of grains, sweets and everything else you could wish for for your mediterranean meal. They even sell household items, cosmetics and home decor. Definitely worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Food taste really good and the price is super!  The gentle man owner was pleasant to talk to.   I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat! Authentic middle eastern food! The iced tea is addicting, i get cravings for just that sometimes! Every time I go in i just cant help myself and order the Vegetarian plate, you get so many choices of delicious food and its all so amazing! I wish it were closer to my house or had delivery, it would be a weekly meal then! I also had them cater baklava for my wedding party and I kid you not the two huge trays we ordered went faster than the alcohol!!! much love for this place... and to add to all the ++++'s they have a store built in so you  can buy alot of the food to make at home as well!!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious! I always bring my friends here and they all love it. The chicken shawerma plate is the BEST and the hummus is so heavenly. I'm drooling just thinking about it right now.  Their food is so authentic and I haven't found a place like this yet.  The best part is that it's so affordable for starving college students."}
{"text":"Soltani plate is pretty good.. I'm Persian , so it's not a Persian plate but definitely is delicious .. In the market , you can find all kinds of Mediterranean spices , food , and other stuff."}
{"text":"their baklava is to KILL FOR !!! Some of the best I've had, and I've lived in the Middle East- Crunchy, Sweet (without being too overbearing), Flakey and Buttery Rich!! Pecan (not traditional) is my fav, followed by walnut, almond and pistachio -- They should have a pine nut version (snobar) made with real lebanese pine nuts !!! mmmm  I limit myself to one piece, if I had it my way I would take the whole tray, but I want to fit through my front door so I'm keeping tabs!"}
{"text":"We have eaten here two times now in the last month. Both times were simply awesome. Can't say enough about the freshness and quality of the food. The flavors are genuine and create a flavorful symphony for your taste buds. From the Falafel to the Gyros, Shawarma and their awesome Hummus I have not had anything that is less than the very best quality. It is also great to see the staff taking pride in what they do. GREAT service. The prices can't be beat!! VERY AUTHENTIC"}
{"text":"Not much in the way of ambiance, but the food is exceptional.  Been looking for a great Gyro?  This place has them.  Very busy and there's good reason for that.  Prices are excellent and service was speedy."}
{"text":"I used to go here a lot. The owners still know my name when I pop in on the occasional shopping visit, which I love. The only reason why I don't go more often is lack of funds.  I am in love with their chicken shwarma and chicken kabobs.  I don't eat red meat, so I cannot comment on their beef dishes, but my son LOVES them. I always order their Arabic coffee.  It's not Turkish, as some people have written.  Turkish coffee is made with a different spice, but the technique is the same. Either way, I love the Arabic coffee here.  I would give them five stars, but their hummus can be too salty at times. Maybe they are using canned hummus, don't know and I hope they don't.  Also their tabouleh usually is dripping with lemon and that's too much for me. The bulgur should soak up just enough to flavor and still be dry.   Here you will also find a great, but quaint, grocery store. Their pricing is awesome and I love the selections of spices, herbs and teas. Their feta is fresh and priced so well that I refuse to buy it anywhere else. They also offer various kitchen items that are priced very reasonably as well.  I've bought my tea and coffee sets from there and my cutting boards. They have a good, not huge, but decent selection of shisha also. This is my one-stop-shop for my Middle Eastern groceries."}
{"text":"Chicken Schwarma is great. Also the baklava is great. Made fresh the food is delicious but we've also had some not so good visits"}
{"text":"This place is super great for lunch and is really cheap. Get all of their sandwiches on handmade pita for a great experience. The arabic coffee and pomegranate juice are great as well. They only do take out on certain days of the week but don't let that stop you. This is the best Middle Eastern food in the Tempe area for sure, not to mention the most affordable! Woop Woop!"}
{"text":"This is a fabulous restaurant, very casual and it gets busy at lunch time but the food is amazing. I highly recommend this place for something a little different, I have been going here for more than 10 years!"}
{"text":"When I first moved to Tempe, I was told by my friend who has lived in Tempe all of his life that this was the first place I had to check out and had to get their Gyros. From a grocery store/sit down store? A place called Haji-Baba? On Apache and McClintock? What? Surely you can't blame me for doubting his convictions.   One day we finally went in. I looked at the menu full of foreign foods and was overtaken by fear. \"What is all of this shit?\", I thought to myself. Of course, this was just a sign of how uncultured I was (and still am). Luckily, my friend took the work out of deciphering the menu and ordered a gyro for me. We got it to go.   I opened up my gyro and saw huge chunks of meat. You know those places that have gyros with thin, insulting, child sized strips of meat? Yeah, this isn't one of those places. This is a gyro for a grown man. So, good start, right? I took a bite. It was... amazing. Their feta cheese, onions, and meat combined for one of the best foods I have ever tasted to this day. It was messy, juicy, the meat was packed so thick that it was difficult to eat (all positive notes), and wow, it was just brilliant. You know that feeling you get when you walk into BevMo for the first time and realize you're in alcohol heaven? When you realize you've stumbled upon something special and that you'll be back again and again? Yeah, that's the feeling.  I ate at Haji Baba's again the next day. And about twice every week for a month afterwards. Later I learned that their \"Deluxe\" gyro is even better. I also discovered that they have some kickass foods in there. Special mention goes out to the chocolates..  Unfortunately, I still haven't tried anything else on the menu. This is probably a result of a combination of me being terrified of the menu due to having no idea what those other foods are, and me internally weighing out the risk of eating an average or only above-average food as compared to eating one of my favorite food items in existence. Easy choice.  I've never sat down to eat at Haji-Baba, but when getting the food to go there has never been a problem. The workers are friendly enough for satisfaction without being friendly to the point of irritation or perceived pretentiousness. There's also never a line and it's $3-4 for a Gyro. God damn I love this place."}
{"text":"First restaurant I ate at in Tempe and I doubt that any others will exceed the experience i had Haji Baba. When I got there (11am) the place was packed. My friends and I sat at the last available table. We were served immediately. Food came out quick, and it was delicious. I recommend the falafel...omg so good. The best part of this place is the character that it has. There's kitschy knickknacks all over the walls by the store that's also inside. It feels like a real local restaurant. I loved eating here."}
{"text":"I stop in here about once every other week. I first discovered this place in the mid 1990's through an old friend.   They have very friendly staff. The chefs are the best.   I love their chicken kabob plate. I always ask for extra tomatoes and cukes on my salad. Also ask for a extra pita with a side of gyro sauce. Try dipping the chicken kabob pieces in the gyro sauce.   Some people don't need \"atmosphere\" to enjoy really good food!! I think Haji would lose it's way if it was a place to see and been seen! Its better to just sit back, relax a little and savor the flavors. Expect about a 15-20 minute wait for that Chicken Kabob to arrive. Its never rushed and I have NEVER had to send anything back."}
{"text":"I am so glad I found this place because I no longer have to make baklava when ever I get the craving. Yes I know there are places to get baklava around Phx but they were either too soggy, too sweet, too sugary, too stale, etc. Something was always wrong. But this place is definitely a diamond in the rough. They have a basic selection of middle eastern food like the sherwarma and the kabobs, which are all very tasty and well prepared and much cheaper than the Persian Room (I'm not the biggest fan of the Persian Room bc its just not worth the drive and money unless you are on a date and trying to impress someone). They also have a great selection of baklava like almond, pistachio, cashew, walnut, and the princess which is think is a combination of all the nuts. Regardless of what you get, you will be happy (both mouth and wallet).   The downside is that since it is in a grocery store, its a bit crowded and sometimes the wait can be a bit long, but I don't really mind the wait bc I know everything is fresh and prepared when ordered."}
{"text":"We have been waiting over 45minutes for two entrees Togo. When asked how much longer it would take, \"It will be ready soon.\" Unfortunate, I don't see how this is possible when a dining experience should take about the same time from beginning to end. Ten minutes later...and we are still waiting.  I think they lost our business for good."}
{"text":"Ok, people. This place is legit.  You walk in and are immediately inundated with a luscious mix of spice and sweet, and all loads of niceness.  You sit and you order off their double-sided laminated menu and you wait. You're hungry as hell and you've got a tenner burning a hole in your pocket.  And then they arrive and you squirm up until the first bite. Then, it's like an explosion of all things holy inside your mouth (That's what she said!).  Their hummus is amazing, feta cheese is da bomb! (I only use this saying in SER-ious situations), and, beyond the food, their service is primo.  Always smiling, the servers will answer your questions kindly, especially if you're a first timer or non-frequenter.  The atmosphere might seem a bit unorganized, but who gives a shit. This place has good food, and if you're coming here for atmosphere, you're not coming for the right reasons. The bathrooms are always clean, albeit tucked away oddly, but whatevs.  I've gone here with vegan and meat-eating friends alike, and all at once (ask me about it, it's quite a story), and we've all come out with both our faces and stomachs happy.  The one kicker: they only do take-out on Sundays. But don't let that stop you, and trust me, it won't. Go, and enjoy.  P.s. Their regular coffee (not Arabic coffee, a.k.a. mud in a cup) is damn-well near perfect if it's up to me. Straight without milk or sugar (and I like my sugar with coffee and cream, thank you Beastie Boys!), this coffee is delicious."}
{"text":"Heard a lot of great things about this place and saw the Yelp reviews ... so I tried this place at last ....   The store is located in a dark corner of the road ... not very noticeable when driving at night ... gotta really look for it Went in there and realized it's inside of a grocery ... I am thinking to myself, ahhh.... this gotta be authentic mom & pop's shop.  Given the review, i though everything must be pretty good, let me have the combination platter so that I have a taste of everything ... Service was quick, but honestly the food was not the best I have had ... no better than any other greek restaurant. Meat was not tendered enough and the friend stuffs are fried too long and making it dry ... for the price, it's not bad but nothing to wow about ..."}
{"text":"I'd eat at Haji-Baba if I was in the neighborhood and wanted something quick and filling.    Actually my favorite thing to get is over at the deli/takeout counter - the great selection of freshly made baklavas - almond, walnut, pistachio.    This is also a good place to pick up spices and other Middle Eastern groceries.  Although I think I like the pickled papaya dish at the Vietnamese place in the plaza more, so my preference is to come here for the baklava afterwards."}
{"text":"tasty, cheap and a grocery store.  also, friendly, fast service. the falafel sandwich is great, they make a mean foul medammas and like a million kinds of baklava!"}
{"text":"I'm visiting Phoenix and went there tonight with a friend from the area who picked the restaurant, and I'm glad I did.  As others have said it's a very casual place attached to a store, but the food is what brings you there.  I couldn't decide what to try so I had the combination plate, from the description it looked like a light meal.  The food was great, but the portions were about double what I expected - instead of a light meal I barely finished it.  Everything was good, but I left wondering what some of the items were so I could get them again."}
{"text":"This is by far, our favorite middle eastern place. We are regulars and always get fantastic service. No matter how busy it gets, we always get our food promptly. The best dishes are chicken schwarma, kafta and chicken kabab and the best sides are salad and rice. You get more for your money when you get the plate, but the sandwiches are great too! Also, the lebni! Honestly you can't go wrong by picking this place."}
{"text":"First time visiting Haji-baba and it was great!! The hummus was awesome and the fresh pitas were amazing.  I ordered the Chicken Shwarma plate and a glass of mango juice.  The portions were great for the price. The food was extremely tasty. I will be going back for more."}
{"text":"The food is great, the shawarma plate, hummus, mixed grill, it could've been better tho. The staff and service is ok.  4-star mostly is for the garlic souce"}
{"text":"We ordered steak and chicken kabobs along with gyro meat for an office party.  Everyone raved about all three of these.   Our order was ready on time and was exactly what we had ordered. I definitely plan to go back again on my own for lunch or dinner. Great food and reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Highly recommend coming here if you want good middle eastern cuisine. I gave it 4 stars because of the slow service. Overall a very good place to eat."}
{"text":"Fantastic! No wonder it's a local favorite! I've been going here for years, one of my favorite spots in Tempe. I love the gyros, falafels, and hummus. Friendly staff, and very reasonable prices. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My favorite Mediterranean place in the valley!!! I've never left here unsatisfied or hungry. I would recommend their chicken shawarma plate, can't leave without trying their baklava either. They have great prices and they're always really quick!"}
{"text":"Haji Baba is great! I always enjoy the beef schwarma plate and the koobideh is excellent as well. I also love that they have a small grocery in the same building, it makes buying certain spices really easy and the prices are really cheap. The baklava is really tasty too!"}
{"text":"It's a grocery/restaurant setting place. I miss going to this place. I try to come in when time lets me. It's in Tempe. My friend from year 2000 introduced me to this place. The place is always packed with many people from different culture. Don't be discouraged by it's looks as the customer service and food is super duper wonderful! I only eat two things here: Gyros Plate and Chicken Shawarma Plate. I usually order a combination of both so my husband can take the shawarma and of course the gyros is mine.   Since I get too busy to stop by, I always buy their gyros meat, which is sold by the pound. Then, I also order their tzatziki sauce and their house dressing for the salad. I haven't found a recipe to match this food, but the food is like my \"comfort food\". I took my kids here and they love it too!   The place has never changed since the first time I came in. The only things that were changed were the prices. Even so, it's still worth it."}
{"text":"Haji Baba is has great  Middle East food. Every weekend I go there. Try Kofta with Tabbouleh and Humous with  bread it's very delicious."}
{"text":"Middle eastern food at its best! personally I enjoy all of their lamb items on the menu. food is prepared fresh. very casual ambiance."}
{"text":"I love this place!  The food is delicious!! Great gyro plates, hummus, and chicken kabobs!  Oh yeah and the tabooli and baklava are awesome! Price is right also! Ding! Ding! Bonus!  Staff is friendly and recognized me as a regular just after a few visits.  I usually call in my order for pick up and they know it's me.  If you cook Middle Eastern food they are also a grocery store.  Gotta try!!"}
{"text":"Today I lost all respect for this restaurant. Despite their success & the surplus of positive reviews, I no longer trust the food that they serve.  After receiving hummus with a teaspoon of olive oil, I asked if I could get some on the side. At first glance I immediately knew what was in the side dish was not olive oil. I smelt it--Nothing. No smell. I tasted it. Gross. Cooking oil. F*cking cooking oil. I buy olive oil. I lived in Lebanon for some time. The fact that the hummus only had a teaspoon of olive oil was irritating in itself. I could go on...  If you can't give me real olive oil, don't give me anything at all--or tell me I'd have to pay for it. Whatever. Don't give me sunflower oil and try to convince me that this is olive oil.   Simply because I am a white American DOES NOT mean I don't know what the difference between cooking oil & olive oil is. I'm offended and disgusted. If you are looking for authentic Middle Eastern food, you are better off elsewhere. Support an honest businessman that has some integrity because it is clearly lacking here."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken shawarma and chicken kabob.  The salad dressing was delicious and their baklava was really a treat.  I'm definitely going to be a repeat patron."}
{"text":"In my humble opinion, this is by far the best Middle Eastern restaurant I ever been to. If you go there, then you must try the chicken shewerma combination. Killer!!!!"}
{"text":"II just started with Yelp, so I decided to go to a restaurant that 'yelpers' recommended, and I'm glad I decided to! This is the best Mediterranean food I have had in a long time, and I will definitely come back and/or send my friends in."}
{"text":"Beef was overcooked and dry. Chicken was basically the same, virtually no flavor. Waited almost 45 minutes for overcooked meat. Disappointed."}
{"text":"I great stand by place with reasonable prices. We also purchase spices, cheese, olives and pantry staples here. I looked all over town for preserved lemons....and finally found them here."}
{"text":"The best gyro you will have in Arizona... or maybe anywhere.  Love the grocery selection. Everyone there is really nice. And you can buy a BUCKET of dates for like $6."}
{"text":"Seriously succulent gyro meat, fabulous home made pitas.  Great prices, too!  Service is slow but friendly.  Definitely going back!!"}
{"text":"Haven't been to Haji yet? Get here. And make sure to ask for extra sauce, their sour cream cucumber sauce is bomb!"}
{"text":"I went here the other day before shopping in Tempe Market Square. Cheap food !"}
{"text":"Addicting! Anytime I want a gyro I think of this place (so like once every couple of weeks lol). I love how fast the service is and the quality. They never disappoint! As a plus, their water cups are huge! That's nice when coming from the Tempe campus in the heat! The atmosphere is nice and casual. Hommos is great - order extra pita! Their pickles are good too!"}
{"text":"Best middle eastern food I've ever had.  grocery/ restaurant.  Shish-kabob plate with a rosewater lemonade is my standby."}
{"text":"I could use their pita bread and wrap every meal I have in it.  Great stuff!"}
{"text":"I've only been a few times, but each visit has been a real treat. The food is great (order the lamb tongue sandwich - TRUST me) and the prices are unbelievable. It's half a restaurant and half a grocery market, so don't be surprised with that. Seating is a bit limited, as the entirety of the venue isn't really that big. But, it's never been an issue for me to be seated.   Perfect for a lunch with a few friends, or even a casual dinner date - show that special someone you met on OK Cupid how cultured you are! Also, it's the complete opposite of douchey, so you're good to go!   Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Fast, friendly service, excellent food. Fairly priced. Authentic middle eastern cuisine. Love the baba. Smoky & lemony. Sandwiches great as well as plates. Juicy lamb. All great."}
{"text":"Incredibly delicious, authentic food for a great price. Large portions and SUPER fast service. They have a fantastic international grocery store too. The gyros, hummus, baba ganoush, falafel, and chicken swarma are my favorites."}
{"text":"Super deal for lunch or dinner. Located on the light rail line in Tempe east of ASU campus, this grocery store / restaurant combo serves up some excellent Mediterranean food. Pita sandwiches are more than enough food for one for lunch or dinner, and if you are feeling extra hungry get a dinner plate with entree, Greek salad and rice. Everything made fresh in-house. The hummus is  as you would expect, but for something different try the eggplant baba ganaoush."}
{"text":"Been going here as far back as I can remember. The store is a bit gangly and outdated, but the food is spectacular. Usually pretty empty except mid day on the weekends. I recommend Haloum cheese, absolutely delicious with pita bread. The olives are also great. In the restaurant I recommend the yebrah, it's a mixture of rice and beef rolled up tight in a maple leaf."}
{"text":"Gyros and baklava are out-of-this world amazing. These folks make the first stuffed grape leaves that I have ever liked.   I liked the flavor of my baba ganouj better after I took it home and ate it the next day. I think the flavors were better blended with time.  Meal portions are generous - good for sharing and/or taking home lots of leftovers.   I have finally found a place in the Phoenix area that has fresh baklava! They make it in-house and in many varieties - almond, pecan, walnut, pistachio, combination... Exquisite as it is so fresh.  Haji-Baba is a small strip-mall restaurant combined with a store (last time I was at the store, I purchased spices, pickled turnips colored with beet juice, rose water, orange water, baklava and other pastries.   If this place were on my side of town, I'd be there several times a month. As it is, I am grateful they are in the Phoenix area. I will be back."}
{"text":"After spending time in the Middle East I had some cravings for some of the things I had eaten and drank in Iraq.  This place had a very friendly staff.  I told them what I was looking for and ironically they had a staff member there from Iraq who was more than willing to show me what I was looking for and what he drinks at home.  I recommend trying this place."}
{"text":"Was in town visiting friends and they wanted to take me here for a quick lunch. Cafeteria style place so don't expect anything special in terms of ambiance or chit chat from the servers.  Tabouli and lamb tongue sandwich were excellent, especially for the price. One of my friends ordered a plate and it was huge. I'd definitely come back."}
{"text":"awesome food...we usually take to go from this place and have lunch at tempe lakes..rose water lemonade,falafal awesome"}
{"text":"The place looks like a dump, but I have three words for you... CHICKEN SCHWARMA SANDWICH. If you put a little Sriracha on that bad boy, you will be hooked for LIFE!"}
{"text":"Yummmmmy! Very good, authentic middle-eastern food. Also, there is a store kind of inside of the restaurant, with lots of spices, snacks, and other things. The hummus is really good, but it isn't really very flavorful. The salads aren't very good, though - too much dressing. The gyros are delicious, and so are the shawarma wraps! Freshly made, yummy pitas. Casual ambience. The tabouli is really good; I really recommend it!"}
{"text":"No wait, cheap prices, and excellent taste. The best hummus and falafel sandwhichs in town. Be sure you order the pita's hand made."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and it's as good today as it was since I first went  \"  over 10 years ago. Everything is freshly made and delicious everytime. Most recently I ordered the chicken schwarma plate. It was enough to feed two people for lunch (we added extra pita)! The chicken was grilled perfectly with a little char, the hummus was creamyand the pita bread is very good. It's not the pocket style stuff, like at the grocery store, it's more like a baked breadier/pancake. It's very delicious!"}
{"text":"A great place my wife and her friends alerted me to. Tucked away in a market, this place services excellent middle eastern food.    I order the gyro platter.The plate is huge and comes with a huge salad, large amount of rice and gyro meat.  I couldn't get enough of the rice. This is my second favorite rice after Moby Dick (east cost) My only complaint is you receive only a small ll piece of flat bread to go with the meal.  I also appreciate the large water glass and not a small glass that requires several refills over the course of a meal.  Payment is done at the market register.  You receive excellent value for what you pay for. A meal for two will cost about $15 (or less)   I will be going back to this place again and again!"}
{"text":"By far the best middle eastern restaurant in Tempe.  Everything from the baklava to the chicken scharama is wonderful.  By go to dish is the felafel plate.  I like the very causal atmosphere and the fact that you can browse the grocery aisles while you wait for your food.  I usually do take out, but have eaten lunch in the restaurant a few times."}
{"text":"Really good food, authentic taste, the service was decent, the place is simple but don't judge it by its looks, the food is really good.  We tried the lamb gyro, lamb tongue sandwich, kebab combination and kebab mixed, all were good.  We have become a returning customer."}
{"text":"One time, of many, I had lunch at Haji's by myself.  I had the best lunch ever and ordered a Turkish coffee.  That was theee best cup of coffee I ever had.  I mean I felt like I had traveled a million miles away.  Seriously!  I felt like I was in the middle east.  and you'd think that a cup of strong Turkish coffee would have had me bouncing off the walls for the rest of the day.  Baby PLEASE!  I went home and was knocked out for the rest of the afternoon.  Just a lovely, lovely food experience.        ..... and I love to buy my ME groceries there too."}
{"text":"Awesome place for some fine middle eastern cuisine.    I always get the Chicken Shawarma plate which comes with rice, succulent chicken (topped off with some amazing garlic sauce), tabouli, hummus, and pita bread.  This is the ultimate meal and it's under $10.  Can't go wrong, although my breath does reek of garlic afterwards.  Save room for  some baklava or some other middle eastern delight for dessert.  For you adventurous chaps out there: I don't recommend the yogurt soda.  Also browse around the market, you can find some interesting things and a huge selection of spices."}
{"text":"Walked in and just stood there because there was no hostess or anyone who looked remotely interested in guiding us on where to sit. Waited 45 minutes for my food. Wasn't that crowded.  Ppl around me who came after me were getting their food before me and my party received ours."}
{"text":"An excellent place to stop if you are in the Tempe/ASU area.  Their Gyro's are overflowing with some of the best Gyro meat I've tasted in AZ.  The only reason it isn't a 5 star for me is the distance.  I live in the North West Valley, and it's a conscious, planned decision to go there.  ASU Students rejoice. You have one of the cheapest, best tasting Mediterranean food joints in AZ right on your back doorstep!"}
{"text":"Haji-Baba is a restaurant/grocery store. Very casual and modest place, all they care for is giving us good food. When I think of good middle-eastern food in Arizona, Haji-Baba is what comes in my mind.  Their price is very cheap compared to the quality of the food. I like their filafil sandwich n shawarmas. I also tried their combo plate which is like hmmm...hmmmm..hmmnnmm.. :)  Anyone who craves for middle-eastern food should try it out. This place is off the hook, the only reason Im giving it a 4-star is because one time they had some soda machine problem and didn't have the soda, service is not very welcoming, place doesn't really look like a grand restaurant. But other than that food is good.."}
{"text":"This place has excellent food, fantastic hummus, all in a great, casual grocery-adjacent atmosphere.  I recommend the tongue sandwich, so delicious and tender, but there's no bad item on the menu.  If you're looking for a place to eat, just stop reading reviews and go there now and get some delicious food. Seriously."}
{"text":"I haven't actually eaten there for lunch but their baklava is the best I've ever had!"}
{"text":"I've ate here a couple of times, after many recommendations from several friends. The food is awesome with a price to match. I love the gyros and swarmas. My first swarma was in when I was stationed in Jebel Ali. This is about as close as it gets. Definitely a must try, if you already havent."}
{"text":"I have been coming here since I was a kid and will never stop. The owner is a class act and the food is amazing. You won't find better kabob anywhere else."}
{"text":"I was so excited to try this place after many people recommend this place. When we arrived we had to wait in the entrance for couple minutes.  Than we were placed at a table and the server came 5 good minutes later.  When he arrived we ordered drink and food.  We had time to visit all the shop and after wait at the table. The food arrived  and all our meats were dry and hard. The tabooli tasted like the presley was old... we all left more than the half of our plates and very disappointed.."}
{"text":"Been coming here for a couple of years on and off, customer service isn't good and at times pretty rude. Chicken shawarma is the best in town, beef shawarma is the worst in town. And their gyro shawarma is alright and I was notified by an employee that the gyro is not halal."}
{"text":"Absolutely my favorite place to eat in Tempe. Cheap prices for great food. Before becoming a vegetarian, my favorite thing to get here was the chicken shwarma plate - and although I have a huge appetite, I still was able to take plenty home for the next day. Now, a falafel plate or pita is the way to satisfy my hunger! Make sure to try their hummous and tabouli! Their baklava is unbelievably good - the almond and pecan varieties are my favorites.   Be sure to check out the grocery section as well - super cheap bulk spices, rice, and legumes (lentils, etc); as well as lots of items necessary for middle eastern and indian cooking.   In all of my years of eating here, I've only once had to wait longer than ten minutes for my food. Usually, it takes less than five, sometimes less than three minutes of time between when I place my order and when it's making its way into my stomach.The employees and servers here are some of the nicest people I've ever met. It only takes a few visits for them to remember you and your favorite thing to eat. I can't recommend Haji Baba's enough."}
{"text":"Some of the best felafel in town. Good food. Pleasant service. Truly affordable. And if you cook with spices, check out theirs. Fresh fragrant and a nice assortment."}
{"text":"Definitely my favorite middle eastern cuisine in the Valley and I was reminded again yesterday. Sad but I always get the same thing: Chicken shawarma plate. You can't go wrong with this and It comes with so much food including rice, to-die-for hummus, a pita and tabouli all yummy and at excellent value too.  The ambiance is nothing to write home about, that is why I take away one star. Part of it is a grocery store with some really great ingredientes you can't find anywhere else, which is cool but can be awkward if you are trying to order take out and someone is checking out their grocery cart full of items in front of you. The food and price more than make up for the lacking ambiance."}
{"text":"Their greek salad made me feel bad about every other greek salad I had eaten elsewhere.  It was brilliant.  I'm especially impressed by the fat feta cheese cubes.  It's like buying a huge salad and getting a block of cheese and side of olives for free."}
{"text":"Forget that it is inside a grocery store. Totally worth it! Excellent service, pleasant and attentive staff, delicious food, big portions. A real unspolied jewel of middle eastern cuisine!"}
{"text":"This place is so delicious! Nothing fancy, just great food! I love their tea, it has a slight cinnamon taste, so good! The market has really cool stuff and cheap spices!"}
{"text":"Truly amazing food. Surprisingly cheap for the quality and the wait time to get your food after ordering was minimal. I for one will be eating here again."}
{"text":"So, so, so GOOD.  Everything I've had here has been amazing. I've been coming here for over 10 years.  The food is always fresh and the service has always been prompt.  My favs - Gyro, chicken shwarma, lamb kebab, and the baklava.  Once in a while, I get the lemonade - they make it with rosewater.  You sip the lemonade and inhale through your nose and you smell roses.  It is freaking amazing.  In college, we used to get the arabic coffee to keep us awake for our late night studies.  Overall, one of my favs!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place.  The food is wonderful.  I am half middle eastern so I grew up on authentic arabic food.  Haji Baba is the only restaurant I have found in the Phoenix metro area that is VERY comparable to my Grandma's cooking.  The hummus and tabouli are excellent.  And if I were to recommend an entree, it would have to be the Chicken Shwarma plate."}
{"text":"I'm a New Yorker and this is the best Middle Eastern restaurant I've eaten at. I came with my husband, son and in-laws. The decor of the restaurant isn't great but I appreciate that since I did not want to be in a fancy restaurant with a crying toddler. The restaurant is attached to the grocery store so if I wanted to attempt making this delicious food I could've bought the ingredients. Amazing food- hummus, tabouli, grilled meats all very tasty. And they receive a 5 star because for the first time my mother-in-law did not send her dish back."}
{"text":"If there's any good reason to walk around with garlic breath, than this place is it. I am definitely addicted to their garlic mayo.   Amazing food, big portions, super friendly owners. AND THEY HAVE GLUTEN FREE OPTIONS. Hidden gluten is the bane of my existence, so I was really happy to find out that they don't add gluten to most of their meats (I've only asked about kabobs and chicken shawarma), hummus or sauces. I also even noticed some gluten free cookies in the market section."}
{"text":"Great prices, very friendly people, neat environment and amazing food!! One of my favorite places to eat. I really enjoy the original gyro plate and pecan Baklava. With that being said there isn't anything here I have disliked. I love to just look around their little market too."}
{"text":"Perfect lunch spot! There was a little wait but so worth it. We ordered a Greek salad and chicken schwarma. It was a lot of food so we split it. Salad was amazing with the freshest feta I've ever tasted. Yum! Chicken schwarma was very good and came with fresh hummus and taboli. Yum ! Make sure to try it with the garlic sauce."}
{"text":"Amazingly cheap and great Middle Eastern food. Warm homemade pita bread. Buckets of feta. Trays and trays of bakhlava. There's really nothing not to love here. Do be wary of the lunch crowd though, as on weekdays, the place can get pretty busy, especially if you're dining in (though you can always takeout and it's just as easy and fast)."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible. Terrible service, terrible food and rude staff. The Sharuma was NOT Sharuma,  very bland. I couldn't even eat it. The \"Arabic\" coffee was awful. A group of us went there because of the ratings and it was the worst place I have ever gone for arabic food. If you want actual arabic food look elsewhere. We will never be back, very disappointed."}
{"text":"Oh yeah. This place is awesome. Visiting Tempe for work and was craving kabobs. Service was super fast and food is really fresh and cooked awesome. Definitely worth 5 stars."}
{"text":"My entire family loves Haji Baba's. I was introduced to this family business back in the early nineties by some Lebanese friends. It's been favorite of mine since and is my oldest son favorite place to go and picks it for his birthday dinner! We come here about six times a year and usually get the Gyro platter but sometimes experiment. The staff is great and it's fun for us to find some candies in the shop that you can't find everywhere. Go get some!"}
{"text":"When we walked in, the layout was a bit confusing and we weren't sure where to go to be seated. The entry is between the store shop and restaurant, and there is not much room to stand at the front. We had walked towards the back of the store and had a waiter tell us, \"There's a line\" and walk away. Still unsure of where to go, we went back to the front, and waited. Despite this first impression, we stayed, and I'm glad we did. The food was amazing. My brother got the lamb tongue and it was surprisingly good; the meat was super tender and flavorful. I got the chicken salad which was amazing. It came on a bed of rice that I really liked with the salad. Even the iced tea I got had a unique blend of spices that made it special.  In the store part, there are so many options and it is well organized. Our waiter was great and helped us with recommendations. I'm so glad I found this place and I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Really bad experience. Do not ever get the chicken shawarma I wouldn't even call it a shawerma. The so called Arabic coffee was not arabic coffee, it was a badly done Turkish coffee. Plus the service was bad, really rude. I came here because of the ratings, big mistake. If you want actual arabic food avoid this place. We will never be back."}
{"text":"Great middle eastern food...  great value... great tasting... casual and  relaxed crowd.  This is my place  to go for this kind of food when I have that craving."}
{"text":"THE PLACE: Easy to miss, as the sign for the place is rather small. Once you find it, not that easy to forget. Place is always busy, most especially during meal hours.  Has a middle eastern grocery on the left and the resto area on the right. To go counter and where you also pay is towards the back. Nothing fancy, but the place is always clean.  THE SERVICE: Super friendly staff. Not a lot of them, but service is fast. New to their food? No problem, they are always helpful. They always make you feel so welcome.  THE FOOD: Best Gyros, Shewarma, Hummus. And I've tried many. My faves though, Babaganouj, Lamb Tongue sandwich, Arabic Coffee. Be sure to save some room for baklava. They have pistachio, almond, pecan, queen. So good!"}
{"text":"I'm not very familiar with middle eastern cuisine so based on reviews, I went to Haji Baba to try it out. My girl had the chicken schwarma and I had this combo plate with a various assortment of meats. I apologize for not remembering the name. Anyways, the food was delicious and for the price you can't beat it. The restaurant is located in a grocery store so don't expect to plan any first dates here. But if she's a keeper, definitely a 3rd date spot. ;)"}
{"text":"Great place, excellent food. Haji-Baba is a combo restaurant and shop, and the restaurant part is pretty tiny so it can sometimes be a wait to get it but you can always get food to go and look around the shop while you wait. The servers are super nice and friendly and the food is consistently fantastic. I usually get the falafel sandwich which is super inexpensive and delicious. I also love the hummus and greek salads, but honestly all the sides are great. I don't live in Arizona anymore and this is one of the places I miss and make sure to visit whenever I'm back home."}
{"text":"Consistent excellent quality food. Best chicken shawarma sandwich I've had, and I have had quite a few-no other comes close to this one! Very fairly priced, generous serving. Add feta to the sandwich-they give you heaps and only charge a little extra. Thinking about moving to Tempe just so I can eat here every day :0)"}
{"text":"My family and I have been eating at Haji Baba since 1996. I ate here today and it is still every bit as good as it was then. My boys like the Gyro Platter. I got the Kabob Combo platter with Lamb Shish Kabob, Chicken Kabob, and Kabab Kubide. The lamb Kabob was amazing!!! The pita bread and hummus that came along with it was also fresh and delicious. I also tried the rose water lemonade, tart and different! The chicken kabob was a little dry hence the 4 stars. Also, ask for the salad dressing on the side, they tweaked the vinaigrette and it is now very spicy! You won't be disappointed at Haji!"}
{"text":"Today was my first time at this place and I am completely blown over by the food here. I had purchased chicken shawarma, hummus and pita bread and baklava and everything is absolutely yum! The hummus was so fresh and the baklava just crispy and very sweet! If you have sweet tooth you just have to have the baklava here."}
{"text":"First off, the entire place has great PRICES and good portions for what you buy. I can order a pita that sustains me for lunch for less than $5. Secondly, the FOOD is good. Chicken plates there are to die for. Third, the SERVICE is good. Generally, places that serve cheap food aren't exactly obligated to have the best service...but this restaurant goes above and beyond that call. I have been there enough times for the workers to recognize me, and know what I want. Preparation of the food seems to always be quick as well. All-around great for college students on a budget as well as a hearty family meal.  Also, the market side seems to sell many cheap, varied food and kitchen items. I don't normally venture on that side of the store, but I do hear it's worth it."}
{"text":"haji - baba is great.  great food quick service,  low prices.  hidden gem yet always @ capacity ....  a change from other pita / med plate center eateries."}
{"text":"The falafel is some of the best in Tempe.  The gyro sandwiches are cheap and solid. They have a gyro deluxe sandwich which comes with feta. Good times. Yes, the lemonade rocks too."}
{"text":"This place has some really good and healthy middle eastern food. Gyro sub is my favorite. No complaints here other than the fact that the air conditioner can get very cold at times. Overall, great food and server was pretty attentive."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean restaurant and market in Tempe in my opinion!  Especially love the chicken shawerma!"}
{"text":"This place is as good as it gets!  The food is authentic and very affordable.  It's a cool little gem."}
{"text":"I had mixed kabob plate, babaganoush and falafel. Yea, a lot, I wanted to try everything. It was yum. Cleaned my plate. Wish is was closer to my house. I could eat like this every day."}
{"text":"Haji Baba is the restaurant (and store) I always refer to as the Gold Standard of Middle Eastern restaurants in the Valley.  To be honest, I've had better Middle Eastern food; but what they offer, how much of it they give you, and the stellar service provided, easily makes this restaurant THE place to beat.  The most-memorable item on their menu is their dolmas, which, I admit, I didn't like when I first tried them, but have since fallen in love with:  fat, with a unique filling I can't really describe and served hot. ( If, like me, you are used to the small, cold, rice-filled dolmas, you really need to try these and keep an open mind.)   Typically, I get the vegetarian platter, which, like most of what they serve, comes with copious amounts of tabooli, hummus, felafel, yoghurt (sort of like tzatziki, but not quite), dolmas, etc.  If you have a big appetite -- and readers of my reviews know I'm gluttonous -- you will NOT be hungry when you leave this place!  My partner is a fan of their gyro sandwich, which, not surprisingly, is big and tasty.  Haji Baba also has a store taking up half the establishment offering a variety of foods and other items from the Middle East and Bosnia.  They also sell fresh Feta (get the Greek, not the Bulgarian), Burek (a cheese-filled pastry), decent baklava and many other things unavailable in the Valley at very reasonable prices.  Disadvantage (for me)?  They're all the way in Tempe; so if you live west of I-17, bring a book and lots of water for your haj across the Valley to get here!  One more important note:  I read, with much amusement, the review from someone complaining that she showed up here in an evening gown only to find out the place is \"one step above a fast-food place.\"  Honestly, that's no exaggeration:  show up here overdressed and don't be surprised if you see people doubling-up in hysterical laughter and running to the bathroom to avoid peeing their pants.  Most of the customers frequenting Haji Baba are students from nearby ASU, local workers on lunch break and your average, every day 'proletariat', as I'm sure the complaining reviewer would refer to them as being.  Haji Baba is by no means fancy; but if you're looking for good food served by friendly employees, who work their rears off, moving fast to serve you and ensure you leave happy with your experience, then this is the place for you.  I've been coming here on and off for more than 15 years now and not once -- NOT ONCE -- have I ever had a complaint or issue with anything there.  If only for the fact I've had better Middle Eastern food in other, less worthy restaurants, I would've given them five stars."}
{"text":"LOOOOOOVE this place! The food is awesome and the prices are too! It's a restaurant/store and is a small place but don't let it fool you... This place is great and there are always people coming through. And they have halal meat."}
{"text":"Absolutely THE BEST gyro I have ever eaten. Hummus was great, along with the baba ganoush. Yum Yum Yum. Wish there was one in Gilbert; I'd be there every day. Only 4 stars though because I ordered the lamb shish kabob and the meat was a little on the  tough side. But the Gyro beats all else anyway."}
{"text":"Great food, interesting atmosphere. Best hummus in town. Also the best selection of baklava...."}
{"text":"Haji Babas is a great place for people who want to check out some of the hidden gems within Tempe. It's one of those places not too many people know about because most of the people that eat or shop there want to keep it a secret!!   I love the beef shawarma plate. HUGE portions, which is nice because the leftovers are just as good the next day.   Not the best dining atmosphere... Somewhat awkward experience last time I was there with people standing in the doorway due to lack of space in the actual restaurant area."}
{"text":"Love it..Cheap, delicious and fresh food.."}
{"text":"I love this place!  Delicious & very affordable. We got the chicken shawarma, the falafel sandwich & pistachio baklava.  The shawarma was filled with perfectly seasoned chicken, garlic sauce & veggies, the falafel was the best I've had and the baklava made my day. We love this place and have come back numerous times."}
{"text":"Been going to Haji-Baba since the 1980's when I was in college at ASU. Always a regular hot spot for me and my fellow art students. The food is still amazing, fresh and tasty! The grocery store still has a great selection of items! Thank you Haji-Baba!"}
{"text":"My friends and I ate here for the first time today. It's a small place attached to a store where you can buy middle eastern foods too.  2 of us had the gyro plate which consisted of gyro meat covered in taziki sauce, jasmine rice and a salad for $7.69. The other person had chicken shwarma with hummas & tabuli.  All plates were excellent! It's not much to look at from the outside, but don't let that fool you, the food was delicious!  Would highly recommend!!"}
{"text":"Great middle eastern hole-in-the-wall grocery store/casual eatery combo.  Went today for lunch with the SO.  We had about a 10 minute wait, which was enough to wander around the grocery store and check out the extensive spice selection.  After being seated, we selected the veggie combo plate and the sultani plate.  There was a TON of food, talk about value! the baba ganoush (smoky eggplant) was spot on perfect, and the pita bread that accompanied it was toasted and warm, which was a great touch!  Tabouleh was also really good, and the falafel was moist and had a great texture.  The only meh item on the veggie combo plate was the grape leaves - they were warm, but didn't have a whole lot of flavor.  In contrast, the koobideh and the grilled beef were extremely flavorful.  The meal plate came with salad as well as rice, but the meat was definitely the star.  Service was friendly and perfunctory.  A no frills, here for the food, leave with a belly ache because you ate so much land of goodness!"}
{"text":"Awesome food, especially the gyro s, and chicken Sharma. I have been coming here with family for the last 15 years, same quality of food still. One of our favorite places to go for middle Eastern food."}
{"text":"Outstanding food , excellent service, simple yet solemn , great smells great taste, great people coming together to share the warmth and culture. Thank you for sharing"}
{"text":"This is always a good choice! Get there early for lunch since this place fills up fast and seating is at a premium. I have never had anything here that wasn't good and portions are large and are easy to share. Staff is friendly, service is quick and prices are very fair. The grocery store attached is awesome for picking up some of the harder to find ingredients one might need for North African or Middle Eastern cuisine (Israeli cous-cous being the one I always get here)."}
{"text":"I discovered the delights of Haji-Baba when I was in grad school at ASU (gulp) 10 years ago.  I decided to take the BF for dinner recently when we were in the Tempe area.  I was pleased that Haji-Baba has stood the test of time.  The decor was exactly as I remembered it.  The market side was still chock-full of Middle Eastern staples.  The bakery case was filled to the brim with homemade baklava.  The dining area even had the same murals on the walls.  Very little has changed indeed at Haji-Baba in the last 10 years.  Haji-Baba offers great value-for-your-dollar.  You get a large quantity of tasty food for a very wallet-friendly price.  Don't get me wrong, this isn't the greatest Middle Eastern food served in the US, but it's very solid.  There's a reason Haji-Baba has been a staple with ASU students over the years.    The hummus was tasty and so were the olives.  The Gyro Plate had so much meat on it that I had to take half to go for lunch the next day.  The gyro meat is very good here, but it's not the best I have ever tasted.  That was at Jimmy's Gyros in Mykonos, Greece.  But I can certainly make do with Haji-Baba."}
{"text":"I love chicken schwarma and seek it out wherever I go. Israel has the best  but Haji Baba is a close second. Besides great schwarma the hummus is very good and the pita good. So if you are in Tempe give it a try. It is a simple resturant inside the store."}
{"text":"Best in town!!! Everything that is served is spectacular. Food is the best Mediterranean food in town. Plus you can shop their spices, canned and packaged foods."}
{"text":"Just visited the Phoenix area for Thanksgiving and had to make a repeat stop at Haji-Baba. The food here is sooo good and sooo reasonably priced and with big portions! I had the chicken shwarma salad. Huge portion of chicken over rice and lettuce with a tasty unique house dressing. Went with a party of 8 and everyone loved their food.  I wish this place were in LA area where I live!"}
{"text":"I come here every so often but rarely eat here because it's usually a visit for groceries and hookah things. Well tonight was different!    I wanted a gyro deluxe with extra sauce to go, and it was the most soul-touchingly delicious sloppy mess I can remember. This is an incredible thing. More tomato bits would've been nice, but that's it. The (goat?) cheese chunks may not be for everyone but I was pleasantly surprised with its presence. For me it's all about the extra sauce. I'm not saying your gyro will be dry unless you have extra, but this is how I love it.    I hear the shwarma is also very good. INSIDE SKINNY: Fresh dates come in November!! $5-something per pound. They're available year-round at the counter, but best in winter and spring after harvest."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. Great Middle Eastern food at a great price. Everything you could want. This is where other restaurants get the food they serve you so why not come to the source. Love the babaganouj and hummus."}
{"text":"Great Middle Eastern cuisine. Chick schwarma so good but the babaganoush is to die for. Unbelievably fresh. A ton of food for a great price. Have been a few times and never disappointed."}
{"text":"The food here has to be good, because curb appeal certainly isn't what draws customers through the door.  If I didn't know what I was looking for, I wouldn't even notice this little shop off Apache Blvd.  Once inside, one room is primarily a middle eastern market with products ranging from cool, to unique, to unidentifiable to my mere American eyes.  The other room is dining area seating, but certainly not high class.  I am not giving points on decor or atmosphere.  The food, service and prices makes up for it.  I've only tried a couple of dishes, but each one has been so full of flavor and so rich that I quickly realize I only need half a portion to be more than satisfied.  This is also because of the huge serving sizes!  All of this for nearly half of what I'd expect to pay at a larger, or chain restaurant.  Come with an appetite and an open mind.  I don't think I'll go out of my way to eat here, but when I'm in Tempe it's great for a quick stop."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday for lunch with a friend, my first time ever. First, for those seeking a place with ambiance, Haji-Baba is purely functional. It is located adjacent to a Middle Eastern grocery store and there really is no decor enlivening the dining room. In other words, you come here if you like the food. I was glad to see that they serve kibbeh, which is a Middle Eastern dish I had trouble finding when I last lived in Phoenix, and so I ordered the kibbeh plate. My reaction was a little mixed. First, the plate came with sides of tabouli and hummus, and both were excellent. The hummus was smooth and creamy and nicely spiced and the tabouli was very enjoyable. My mixed feelings concern the kibbeh, which I found to be mediocre. First, I was surprised by its shape and texture. Anywhere else where I have ordered kibbeh, the kibbeh comes in the shape of a dumpling, whereas this was served like two pieces of cake from a square pan. Also, normally the bulgur wheat shell is crunchy, whereas the bulgur wheat here was soft and only lined the top of each piece. I also found the kibbeh to be slightly on the bland side. However, since the two side dishes I had here were quite good, I feel comfortable giving Haji-Baba four stars and would definitely come here again to try a different dish."}
{"text":"There's a reason why Yelpers are singing praise for Haji-Baba.  The few skeptics must have not taste for good food or must come from Middle Eastern families and hate anything not cooked by their mothers and grandmothers.  Haji-Baba is one of the better Middle Eastern eateries I have had the pleasure to try.  Not just in Tempe but anywhere (including NYC and Toronto).  I had the shish kebab plate that included generous portions of rice and salad along with the chunks of lamb.  It came with a pita slice too.    It's an unorthodox place.  You're given a ticket that you present to the cashier.  Anything you may purchase from the grocery side will be added.  If you cook you might enjoy the wide variety of spices and other items for sale.  They even sell a few edibles from Croatia and Serbia.  Be sure to try the baklava.  They have a few varieties.  I tried the Queen Baklava and it was fantastic.  One of the best I've had."}
{"text":"I love haji baba's quick service and delicious chicken shwerma. No one can beat their prices and most of the food tastes great! It's a grocery store as well and carries most authentic arab spices. Definitely recommend everyone in the greater Phoenix area to try this place."}
{"text":"This place is dirty and stuff is dirty. I recommend to everyone not to come here. I don't understand why is this place so full all the time food is bad."}
{"text":"Wow! Such fantastic food! Try the Queen baklava, best I've ever had."}
{"text":"Best Chicken Shawarma hands down. I have introduced my coworkers to this place and they now want to eat here multiple times a week. Great food, great service and usually very fast. I would highly recommend Haji Baba."}
{"text":"I've visited Haji-Baba's twice now and I am anxious for a return trip.  FIrst, almost any ethnic restaurant with an attached grocery is going to have some good food.  With Haja-baba this is true, but it also comes at such a great value!    I've sampled the hummus, which is wonderful in its simplicity and very fresh.  Same with the tabouli.  The kibbie is brilliant and I will order that again.  On my first visit, I tried the Shish-kabob and, to my delight, they treated the lamb very kindly.  It wasn't brown and cooked to death, which is so often the fate of lamb in far too many restaurants.    On my last visit, a friend and i went to Haja-baba's with one intention: Lamb's tongue Sandwich.  If you like lamb and you're not mouth-squimish concerning texture; it's one of the best things you'll ever eat.  For me, it was heaven.  I will say, that I did order and dress it with a touch of tzatziki sauce, which made the sandwich PERFECT!  The portion, especially for the price, is as astounding as it is tasty!  There's a very short list of things that will make me drive to Tempe.  Haji-baba's is near the top of that list."}
{"text":"Love the chicken shawarma. Ate it weekly when I lived in the area. Miss it dearly. (the dark roast coffee beans in the grocery section are awesomeness)"}
{"text":"After reading all the reviews , we have had this place bookmarked for a while and just couldn't wait to try it.  Price: Very cheap Taste: The food we ordered was just about ok. Possibly it's just the shawarmas. We had ordered the chicken shawarma and it was served in a wrap with lettuce and chicken drizzled with a mayo based sauce. The chicken was good but it wasn't the real shawarma I was looking forward to knowing that this is a Mediterranean place. One of the striking characteristics of shawarma is the toum sauce which was missing here. Might come back again to try the kebabs before I completely makeup my mind on this place"}
{"text":"I have always wanted to write one of these reviews as a letter to a personified establishment. Like the cool kids.  Sweetest Haji Baba,  I am so happy that I waited for you. Had I lost my falafel virginity to anyone but you I surely would have regretted it. Thank you for knowing I was ready to be deflowered. The taste of your falafel lingers on my lips when I think of that day.  I thought we may be a fling, but you are so deep. You have two sides, delicious dining, and grocery I think I am in love. The way your staff is friendly and seem to actually appreciate my business leaves me longing for your sweet lunch.  Your plate of olives is like a plate of olives, heavenly aroma building my hunger for you.   Distance makes the heart grow fonder love, and next time I find myself in Tempe, we will be as though we never parted. Wait for me.  Your dearest, Nathan \"Bear Hands\" S."}
{"text":"There are two distinct kinds of friends who have given me their accounts of Haji Baba, a long-time Middle Eastern culinary institution in Tempe: Arizona natives/ASU alums, and Middle Easterners.  Arizona natives/ASU alums: Why do you go to all these other Middle Eastern places? Haji Baba is the best! The best, I tell you. Are you even listening to me? It's awesome! And cheap! I'd go there after Econ 102 every Tuesday and Thursday. No need to go to any of these other places, see? Haji Baba is the best. Now, go!  Middle Easterners: My friend, why do you want to go here? How is it, you ask me? Meh. It is just ok food. They give you a lot of food, but nothing tasting very special, you know? If you go here, just do your shopping and eat somewhere else.  And with those distinct camps of opinion, it's no wonder that it took 21 months for me to set foot in here. But I finally did so a few nights ago...  Haji Baba is another store/restaurant hybrid, which seems to be the M.O. of most Middle Eastern establishments here in the Valley. The store, to the left-hand side, had a pretty good-sized selection of Middle Eastern goods, except you can obviously tell that this place is right by a college campus, with the near-entirety of one long shelving unit dedicated to every flavor of hookah tobacco known to man. I didn't spot a durian, rhubarb, or garlic-flavored tobacco during my initial scan, but I'm sure they were in there somewhere.  The separate dining area is to the right, except for two small tables on the store-side of the wall. Which is where the waiter decided to seat me, even though there were open tables of equal size in the dining area. I thought this was a little odd. Was I being sequestered for some reason? I didn't think I looked disheveled, but what do I know.   Anyway, I ordered some baba ganoush with pita for appetizer and then the chicken shawarma combination plate for entree. I'll agree about the prices. They did seem very reasonable (the combination plate was $6-something). Also, they had choices of either Arabic-style or Persian-style kabobs, which I pretty much never see in the same restaurant.   As I waited for my food, I was given a tall, frosted plastic cup full of ice water. The problem was, though, that the cup was so tall that my accompanying straw completely disappeared as soon as I dropped it in. Oh well.  My baba ganush arrived and it looked really great. However, the taste was so mild that you could barely distinguish it from hummus. You'd have no inkling whatsoever that this was eggplant mush. It had none of the smoky, slightly bitter flavor that baba ganush is known for. Which is fine. Maybe milder, meeker, less potentially offensive flavors are the way to go in a college setting, but I was a little disappointed.  Then came my chicken shawarma entree, which had a sizeable pile of the aforementioned chicken plus hummus, tabbouleh, rice, and more pita. I could see how as a college student that this would be a great value. Even as a working professional, this was still good value. In front of me was a lot of food for not much money. They were generous with the amount of chicken they gave, a rare sight in many of these restaurants. But again, hoping for amazing things, I was underwhelmed by the taste of each of the elements. Not that any of the items tasted bad, but that their flavors were more muted than other Middle Eastern establishments I've been to in the Valley, which I can say now is more than a small handful.   That said, Haji Baba did succeed in one thing - too *much* food. I was so full that I left with a lot of my rice and pita left over, which pretty much never happens.   So in the end, what do I make of this crowded, local ASU favorite?   5 words: It is ok, my friend.  3 stars."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this cute restaurant/grocery store in the heart of Tempe near the light rail. I was craving a gyro sandwich but got the Gyro Plate with Rice and salad. It truly was amazing and filling. I ordered the Arabic coffee, wow, it woke me right up. An amazing lunch!  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Brilliant. The gyro sandwich and chicken shawarma were great. Service was prompt and courteous, and the iced tea was tasty. And the baklava were the best I think I've ever eaten.   I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place!! Chicken sharwama plate is da bomb! Huge portion, quality is always consistent. highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I really enjoy coming here for their Chicken Shawarma plate and it's more than enough food! Everything just tastes so good at such a great price! Make sure to grab one of their baklava on the way out!"}
{"text":"I went here recently with some co-workers for lunch. I was very impressed. It is just a small hole-in-the-wall type place, those are the best. I ordered a chicken schwerma plate. Generous portion of marinated grilled chicken, hummus, delish rice and a heap of tabouleh. The food was great, fresh, hot and delicious. I also has a rosewater lemonade, what a treat!  My friends ordered the gyro plate and both were quite happy."}
{"text":"Great middle eastern market and restaurant in Tempe!  I love their food. chicken shawarma and gyros are my favorites. I've been there regularly throughout my 4 years at ASU. I'm gonna miss this place."}
{"text":"Fantastic food every time!!!!!! My favorite when coming up from Tucson!!! I found this spot about 6 yrs ago and every time I get up to the Valley I always stop in and eat and also do a little shopping in the market store as well :) Great prices on the spices!!!!"}
{"text":"I have eaten at Haji's many times. The handmade pita is wonderful and the food is usually good. We have gotten the chicken shwarma, hummus, mixed paltter, gyros, olives, baklava, falafal, etc, etc. The thing that is a drawback for me is, well a couple: It is a restaurant on one side and grocery market on the otehr stide. The market is often cluttered and I am not overwhelmed by cleanliness. The other thing that really bothered me was the large jars of olives for people to serve themselves. I saw a guy reach into each of them with his hands and taste one from each jar. When I said something to him, he told me it was fine and basically blew me off. I thought it was disgusting and so I do NOT eat the olives! I have since taught myself to make a lot of my favorite dishes, but still love the bread. As far as handicap accessibility, I would have to look again, I know you must step up from the parking onto the sidewalk curb.  Update, I went there a couple weeks ago and everything was hot or cold as it should be and delicious!!!!! Yum, I am ready to go back!!!"}
{"text":"The best middle eastern food in the valley! Their hummus is real authentic hummus, gyros & chicken shawarma are great, and the prices can't be beat! Very nice staff too. My friends & I love to come here!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to go to Haji-Baba for the 5-star company; I had a lovely Monday lunch w/Bacon Boy. As for the food, it was more of a 3-star mixed bag.  We started with baba ghanouj, which was quite good. I went on to the chicken schwarma, which I adore, but was more like a chicken pita sandwich than I care for. I expect it to be more of a wrap. The chicken was sproingy and there was a ton of lettuce, but the non-sproingy chicken and the garlic sauce were flavorful.  So, I guess what I'd say is that a 5-star friend can save a 3-star meal any day."}
{"text":"I don't know what Haji-Baba means, but based upon our experiences here, I'm going to assume it means GREAT FOOD. The dining area is simple and non-descript, but what comes out of the kitchen is heavenly. No need to be worried if you ordered the right dish as everything is delicious. We have never been disappointed. The Turkish coffee is prepared using the traditional cezve/ibrik (which is an artform in itself) and is to die for. By far the best in the valley! In addition to the restaurant the market is a nice way to finish off one's meal by perusing the aisles for all of the unique spices and goods from a far off land."}
{"text":"A friend recommended we check out Haji-Baba.  Rolling up to the door we weren't sure if we were at the right place - it certainly looks like a slightly run down store.  Inside the place was rammo however.  The atmosphere is great - people from all walks of life seem to congregate here.  The food was epic - large portions, clearly extremely fresh and cooked with care and attention to detail.  The pita is cooked freshly on site (and it shows).  The Baba Ganoush was great.  Also be sure to check out the shop - it's full of Yugoslavian foods (and the only place we found that sells Halloumi in Phoenix)."}
{"text":"This place is EASILY one of my favorite spots in Arizona.    First off, it's Middle Eastern food.  Second, the prices are very very reasonable.  Third, no matter how long it's been since my last visit, they always remember me.   I have had a lot of items on the menu, but I typically gravitate towards the Greek salad (lettuce, tomatoes, kalamata olives, cucumber, fat chunks of sheep milk feta, and their AMAZING dressing) $5.99 for a large salad that includes some pita.  I also really enjoy their vegetarian plate, which comes with: falafel, tzatziki, pita, tabooli, stuffed grape leaves and baba ganoush (but I sub for hummus). $7.99 for two meals worth of food!!  Any and all dining cohorts have equally enjoyed their food selections, and usually go back for more:) In addition to all the veg options, they also have chicken/lamb/beef stuffs and they even have a tongue sandwich! (Ew to me, yum to people I know).  I really dig their beverage options: pomegranate juice, sodas, iced tea with a familiar flavor that I can't quite figure out, yogurt soda, lemonade flavored with rose water (my favorite!).    In addition to having delicious food, great service and low prices, they also have a grocery store on the opposite side of the restaurant.  It's great!  Lots of great ingredients that are hard to find in a regular grocery store.  They even have all the fixings for your hookah enthusiasts.    The walls are adorned with \"Best of Phoenix\" awards dating back to the 80's, and it's no wonder.    I give them two BIG thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I am a little disappointed that they would not make my chicken salad today with Romaine instead of head lettuce.  When I asked if the Romaine was more expensive I was told that no it was not by one of the owners.  This leaves me even more perplexed as Romaine is actually used more in the Mediterranean than regular head lettuce which has very little good food value for a person."}
{"text":"Had take out from this place. It was delicious! Great chicken shawarma, great tabbouleh. Overall I was very satisfied. The food s very authentic and delicious. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This is very good Middle Eastern food. Not as good as the best I've ever had in New York City but definitely well above average and better than Pita Jungle! Pitas tasted as they should, falafel and meats were moist and flavorful and the Arabic coffee was the perfect sweet dessert all by itself. They could add a few little extras to spice up their sandwiches like tomatoes and onions. I asked for some extra tahini and they quickly brought me a cup at no extra charge. I like that!  They seem a bit understaffed with employees going back and forth between the restaurant and the connected grocery store, so getting a waiter's attention can take a few minutes. Despite this, the service was okay. They don't tell you, but they won't give you a check...only a stub that you're supposed to take to the cashier yourself. It's laid back in that way, which is kind of nice. I only wish they had a napkin dispenser or a paper towel roll at the table because this kind of food uses up paper napkins fast and one is far from enough! I'm a tough restaurant critic and I will definitely be back!  Btw, you have to drive slow on Apache to find this place because if you blink, you'll miss it! It is directly across the street from Tempe Fire Engine #1."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, mouthwatering gyro and baklava, and great prices in the restaurant and the attached middle-eastern market."}
{"text":"Better than the pita jungle falafils.  Kinda weird with the grocery store/restaurant thing butgood food."}
{"text":"Had the Gyro DLX and for $4.29 I couldn't have been happier. Generous size, thick chunks of lamb, lots of tzatziki & feta. Loved it, I'd definitely go again!"}
{"text":"I recently co-hosted a Gilligan's Island theme party. In addition to a variety of island-themed foods, we served Haji Baba's kabobs. We ordered 20 chicken and 20 lamb.  The order wash fresh and ready right on time.  The kabobs were flavorful and really added to the meal.   I would highly recommend using these kabobs as a party food item. Just be sure to call 2 or more days in advance to garantee they can fill the order."}
{"text":"Soooo yummmmm and such a good price, especially if you're a struggling college student."}
{"text":"Haji's should seriously have more than 5 stars it's that awesome. Food is all fresh, cheap, filling and delicious. You can call ahead and pick up at the counter or just grab one of the tables to the right of where you walk in, if they are all occupied you just stand kind of by door (but not blocking it) and wait. Once a table leaves and you are up next an employee will run and clear off and wipe down the table and signal you over. I would call the service style at the tables \"fast paced table service\" which is totally fine, the server may not always be able to answer your questions but that has it's benefits as it might get you to take a chance and try something new.   That's what happened to me when I finally decided to try the Lamb Tongue Gyro, a decision that forever changed my life. I know a lot of you are thinking right now that it sounds gross, I mean lamb... tongue...? That's what most everyone thinks till they try it, it's amazing! The meat itself is so tender and juicy, the texture is closer to really tender grilled steak than anything else. The taste is somewhat similar to like dark meat chicken/turkey or maybe even duck just not quite as rich. It's hard to explain but that's why you just have to give it a shot. Plus, even though it's one of the most expensive things on their menu, it's still only like $6.50, and it's a full meal! This applies to basically everything else on their menu, chicken shawarma is another very popular dish that you can't go wrong with.   The building also doubles as a Middle Eastern deli/bakery/small grocery store. They has all kinds of cool products from the Middle East, tons of great spices, some amazing meats and pastries. Basically, it's got everything you could ever want and then some.  Believe the hype! There's a reason Haji's is considered a Tempe institution."}
{"text":"I've been coming here since 1993.  Not much has changed and that is a good thing!  These guys give you a lot of food at a very reasonable price.  The food is delicious.  I've had everything on the menu and it's all good.  The staff are friendly and service is really good.  They make Kabobs that you will measure everyone else against.  For delicious middle-eastern food, don't look anywhere else in the value. They have been around forever for a reason!"}
{"text":"Haji Baba's elegancy and efficiency is best expressed in a style mimicking Ernest Hemingway's famous six-word short story:  Falafel sandwich. $2.99. Delicious. Bring friends."}
{"text":"One stop shop: get your lunch and pick up groceries for dinner! Ok, so maybe the atmosphere is not glamorous, but who cares, part of the charm is that it isn't! The food is authentic and well done. The gyro sandwiches are great and so is the babaghanoush and hummus. Good selection of middle eastern products I can't find at my local grocery store."}
{"text":"Man, this is a college foodie's dream. Incredible, inexpensive food. I used to go so often that the cashier knew I wanted a tabbouli to go with my meal.   Favorites: tabbouli, hummus, lamb tongue sandwich, falafel, kafta koobideh. The plates are a great deal, especially the chicken shawarma. Rice, chicken, garlic sauce, hummus, tabbouli, and pita. It's a mountain of food. Enough for at least 2 meals.   And it's connected to a little grocery so you can stock up on pita, feta cheese, and spices. They used to have a really good peach malt drink, but I couldn't find it last time I went.   Sunday it's only open for takeout, but you can still grab a table and eat there. You just won't have waiter service."}
{"text":"The cheapest and tastiest middle eastern food in Arizona. Period. There was a time I ate here 2 meals a day 3 to 4 times a week and I'm still in love 6 years later.   Next to mahmoun's in NYC this is the 2nd best falafel I've had and the Gyro deluxe is freaking amazing. If you're coming for classy restaurant experience then what the hell are you doing at a market in a run down strip mall? The ambiance is that of an ethnic market/cafe which is awesome!"}
{"text":"Just finished a great lunch  and the yelpers that recommended the gyro plate were spot on. My husband had the Arabic coffee and it was delicious.  for just $2.00 it filled his little coffee cup 3 1/2 times! Try doing that at star bucks. The queen baklava was also wonderful. After we ate we shopped in the little market and picked up all sorts of fun European cookies and candies. Just a fun experience all around. We will return."}
{"text":"Oh my golly! So delicious, I ate there for the first time today! I got the chicken salad and the Sanbusek, the chicken salad was HUMONGOUS and packed full of flavor! The Sanbusek was also full of flavor, but not for me; it is a Middle Eastern Egg Roll and I thought from the description the onions would be more prevalent or maybe something to give it crunch other than the deep fried exterior but that was lacking, but that's okay! It was still one of the best Middle Eastern Cuisine Experiences that I've ever had! I will be returning!"}
{"text":"As a newcomer to broadening my food horizons, and one who is on a budget, I found Haji Baba perfect for reasonably priced middle eastern food.  The attached international foods mini mart is also a plus.  Delicious chicken schwarma and great hummus."}
{"text":"Haji-Baba is SO GOOD! I often crave the Gyros Dlx and their iced tea. The hummus is great, the chicken shawarma is awesome, combo plate etc etc... Great portion sizes and their prices just can't be beat. The place isn't fancy but is certainly a local favorite.  If you aren't too cool to enjoy a great hole in the wall restaurant and grocery, you need to check out Haji-Baba. The place just seriously rocks."}
{"text":"I was questioning whether I should leave a review for a restaurant that has over 500 reviews averaging close to 5 stars.  But that super meal I had at Haji-Baba warrants a review.  Although a distance from my house, I wanted to give this place a try because of the legendary number of positive reviews.  Sure, they have a few unsatisfied customers but their reviews are mostly due to wait time for service.  They do get super crowded so frustration is to be expected.  Now for the REAL DEAL   Service was quick despite it being crowded on a Saturday night.  We were served by the twins---both handsome, both courteous and both efficient.   We had the lamb combination, a side order of Kibbe and the vegetarian platter.  They agreed to substitute hummus for the grape leaves which I haven't learned to love yet.  The lamb platter came with a skewer of wonderfully charred, generously thick chunks of expertly done lamb, a roasted tomato, lettuce and perfectly cooked basmati rice.  Looked amazing and was amazing. The kibbe was baked (sometimes they are fried), stuffed with beef and pine nuts.  Despite being baked, there was not a hint of dryness.  It had cinnamon in it which is not my preference but hubby thought it was delightful and took care of making it disappear.    The vegetable platter consisted of babaganoush, tabouli, falafel, hummus, yogurt and a salad.   I sprinkled it with Sumak to further enhance the flavors and it was really a delicious dish.  Both dishes were accompanied by plenty of arabic bread or pita.   Our food was truly enjoyable.  Nothing like a great meal that doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"I have a hankering for all food of the middle east and these guys know how to throw down. Some of the best schwarma and gyros. Marketplace is great source for spices and sweets you won't find in the neighborhood grocery store."}
{"text":"i've never been upset at haji. never. it's super casual, located inside a middle eastern grocery. the food is fantastic. best falafel in town, hands down. the service is quick and efficient and the same faces have been working there for a long time.   the portions are large, the hummus is great and so is everything else. as a vegetarian, i can't comment on the meat dishes, but my carnivorous friends are never disappointed. me + haji = pure love."}
{"text":"Not impressed at all. I tried several here things and liked about half of them. The only good thing about this place is that it's cheap.   Good:  Babaghanooj Beef shawerma Chicken shawerma  Bad:  Hummus (no flavor) Lamb tongue (chewy and horrible!) Gyro sandwich  Unfortunately, I ordered the lamb tongue and only had one bite. Wish I tried the falafel instead. I won't be back."}
{"text":"You get a lot of food for cheap and it's super delicious!!!  Have been going here for years and it never disappoints me. LOVE the hummus here. And don't forget to ask for handmade pita, it's a little extra but definitely worth it.   I always rotate between the gyro plate and the chicken shawarma plate. You can't go wrong with those two."}
{"text":"If I could give a big fat 0 I would......ARROGANT!! Food is horrible....Really surprised at good reviews. Seriously, how does this place stay in business? Food off the shelves was old and covered in sticky tacky, who knows what. There are definitely better Middle Eastern Stores and Eateries."}
{"text":"Haji Baba was very good. I would absolutely come back if I'm in the neighborhood, and might drive across the entire Phoenix metro area to come here, if I have the time. I had a veggie platter and also ordered a falafel sandwich to go! The baba ghanouj (sp?, depending who you ask) was the best I've ever had. Hummus was top-notch - very smooth and creamy. Tabbouleh (again, sp?, depending who you ask) was a little leafier than I like. My meat-eating family members raved about their gyro and chicken shawarma, too.  Extra particulars: Went with my father and brother after catching a spring training baseball game. It was fairly late, but we slid in about 15 mins before closing and they didn't glare at us, so that was nice. The service was friendly and efficient. The layout of the place seems a little odd - grocery store on one side, casual restaurant on the other side - but I dug it. Overall, a great casual place to get some really good, fresh and healthy food for a great price."}
{"text":"I was joined here today with Robyn N.,Norm R.,Arlin B., and Rand H. and this is one of those places I have heard a lot of hype over the great food with great prices. well the only thing I really liked was the Gyro and it was real good.The kibbee one star the meaty egg roll two star and the thing wrapped in grape leaves one star.The place is also very blah!!! I as well would rather eat at the near by Cafe Istanbul."}
{"text":"Randomly came here for lunch and now I wish I knew about it sooner! It's a small marketplace/restaurant with a homey feel. It looks like a hole in the wall kind of place but the food is really good! You can either order at the counter to go or sit down and a server will come get your order. They are great for vegan options. I ordered the falafel and the hummus. The server was really helpful when I asked to make sure there was no dairy or yogurt in what I ordered. The hummus plate and pita were really tasty and came with tahini mixed in. The falafel came over a lettuce salad and had tahini dressing over it. I was with someone who's a regular and really loves the restaurant. It's good for dinner, lunch, and if you want to pick up some groceries or need catering. Highly recommend this place for vegetarians!"}
{"text":"Absolutely great. Not a traditional setting, but the food is fantastic. Good for lunch or dinner. Skewers of meat, veggies, Turkish coffee, yogurt soda..."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat.  I crave their falafel all the time and could probably eat it every day.  Their iced tea is amazing too!"}
{"text":"Had an excellent experience at Haji-Baba the service was fast and friendly. The food was outstanding, it had been so long since I tasted tabbouli so fresh and flavorful, thank you for the experience I will defiantly be back!"}
{"text":"Best Middle Eastern food I've had hands down! I ordered the combination plate - great variety of food and delightful flavors. The service was quick and friendly, even though they were very busy. I will definitely be going back regularly!"}
{"text":"I'm sorry to say this but this business has gone done in the past few years.  I used to eat here *regularly* when I attended/worked at ASU (00-05).  It was always busy and the service was authentic and the food was authentic (at least all my engineering middle-eastern friends would say). Their hummus was outstanding and this place introduced me to my favorite dish, lamb kefta.  So I was in the neighborhood yesterday and decided to re-live that experience.  They still use good pitas, but the kefta was not how it used to be (they don't even offer lamb kefta anymore, just ground beef!).  The hummus was good, but it lacked the clean taste of a good oil (they may have gone cheap and used canola oil instead of evoo).  The kefta sandwich was soggy and loaded with the lowest quality lettuce I've seen in a while.  I did grab a few market items (always have been reliably stocked), but I was very disappointed with the food.  Let me add that when I used to go there, this place was always busy w/ middle easterners - both as clients and as the servers.  Now, it's nothing like that (it's all non-middle easterners).  I'm just thinking it's lost its authenticity, ergo the change in customer demographics."}
{"text":"Casual and Amazing!! Stopped in here during my visit to Tempe and was amazed at the quality of the food. I'm pretty picky about my Middle Eastern food and this place hits the mark.   It's crowded at lunch and the lines get a little crazy so be prepared. But it's worth it. I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"I went to Haji-Baba with a group of 6 people and we were all pleased with our experience. There were an array of items ordered at the table; I got the chicken shawarma plate & others had gotten the combination plate (vegetarian & non-vegetarian), the chicken kabobs, etc.  As far as my dish goes, I thought the quality and quantity was spot on. The chicken was tender and delicious; it went really well with the rice and the garlic sauce was a good addition but I didn't find it to be necessary (which is not how it is at some other restaurants). I'm not a huge fan of tabouli but I liked how they had made it here, it didn't have an over-powering taste. I'm very critical of hummus typically and I enjoyed this one. It wasn't lemon-y and tasted so good with the pita. I snagged a couple of bites from my friends combination plate and I thought everything from that also tasted good.  As I said before - the quality and quantity was good, as was the price so I'd definitely return."}
{"text":"Great food for sure but that is it.  Unless you are shopping for groceries then don't expect much of anything you would not find in a cafeteria.  Yet for some reason this place just works.  The service is unusually good in a place like this and  the food comes out fast and delicious.  I have had about half of the food on this menu and have never been disappointed. Come to Haji's to be full and chat with some friends over good food.  It may have you searching for more napkins but your belly will be happy."}
{"text":"What an absolute delight!   Stepping into the tiny grocery/cafe, i was washed in delicious smells of curry and every imaginable spice. My dad chose this place for dinner as it conveniently sells leg of lamb (our family's traditional Christmas eve main course).   Myself, my dad & mom, my sister and 7-year old niece found a relatively comfortable table and set up shop. While we waited for menus, my sister & I eagerly gazed at the shelves of exotic foods just a few paces away. After selecting a wide variety of menu items, my sister and I bolted for the grocery area while my dad entertained my niece.   My sister found some curry pastes and I goggled at the biryani rice mix, the watermelon jam, and the super-cheap olive oil. I love places like this!   Our meal came quite quickly, so we barely made it through the 3 small aisles. We rushed back to the table to dig in.   I ordered a gyro on the side to keep for lunch the next day (was it really $3.50 for this massive thing??) My mom ordered a falafel sandwich (she's a vegetarian most of the time), dad started in on his shwarma sandwich (the beef was shredded and tasted like machaca; very flavorful!). My niece is a picky eater but our server accommodated and instructed the kitchen to create a \"chicken-on-a-stick.\" She had a disbelieving, almost grossed-out, expression on her face when it was placed before her (it was basted in a mild yellow curry). After trying the meat, she devoured most of it (we were SO proud!).   The piece d' resistance was the combo platter that my sis & I shared. Gyro meat with the lovely cucumber sauce, 2 falafel (some of the best I've ever had, light, fluffy, melt-in-your mouth), a huge serving of taboli (sp?) salad, 2 warm dolmas (delicious!), an odd little tasty cake (i know it has a name but I'm too lazy to search for it) that had seasoned ground beef sandwich between layers of a slightly sweet wheat cake. Finally, my favorite, the deep fried beef eggroll. The meat was amazingly seasoned but the wrapping was that sweet dough. My sister described it as \"pumpkin pie except with beef.\" Weird combo, but Divine!!!   I'm going back & taking my friends....there are 5 kinds of baklava that we have to try!!!"}
{"text":"This restaurant is located inside of a middle eastern grocery store, which I think is pretty cool.  The gyro was amazing - the pita is so fresh and delicious, the meat is tasty and the sauce is awesome, too.  My mouth just watered thinking about it.  They have a dozen different types of baklava and it's seriously the best I've ever had.  Ever.  The place is clean and the wait staff is nice and efficient.  One of our favorite places."}
{"text":"This whole in the wall place was outstanding. The food was amazing as well as the service. I HIGHLY recommend It. The only reason it gets 4 stars and not 5 is because of the rustic ness of the place. It's actually inside the store !!"}
{"text":"When I want authentic Mediterranean food I always come to Haji Babas restaurant. The chicken shawarma plate is my favorite! The tabooli is to die for. Yum!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and ready fast!! And try their rose water lemonade to go with anything :) defiantly worth checking it out!!"}
{"text":"I have been eating here since the 90s. I have been all over the place and have never found anything that even comes close to Haji-Baba. Best food, best prices. I recommend the veg combo plate and the hummus is the best I've ever had. Please never change anything, keep it just like it is!"}
{"text":"My dear Haji-Baba, oh, how I miss you so! Best chicken shwarma plate in Arizona. Best falafel, best prices, and best dolmas. Great people, good service, and an awesome middle eastern grocery store attached to the dining room. Cheap eats, but huge quality. You can get a great falafel sammy here for under $3. Middle of the day, there's a short wait, but it's worth it. They've also got great baklava. Definitely something I crave on a near-weekly basis."}
{"text":"When in Arizona, stop by the hole in the wall Mediterranean food! the chicken dish was delicious! great experience & cool atmosphere.!"}
{"text":"Great hummus and tasty plate options for lunch in a little grocery store stuffed full of spices, snacks, and sweets. In terms of lunch places, I wish I was a bit closer as I would come here all the time! Food is fresh, well-seasoned, and just plain good. The baklava options at the counter are great, too!"}
{"text":"The food is so good! I crave it! There is a reason why they are busy. Staff have always been friendly. Just go!"}
{"text":"Be sure to get the rose water lemonade. Great food for little money! I usually get a gyro, but everything is awesome."}
{"text":"Best middle eastern food in Tempe by a long shot! The plates are just so flavorful and filled with hummus meat rice pita, etc. and everything on them is far exceeding par. Plus a sandwich is extremely cheap and delicious as well!"}
{"text":"The toum (the white garlic spread) is delicious here. I dream about it sometimes. Everything our table of six had was very good. The pita bread was warm, toasty and fresh. Yes, the kinda cafeteria atmosphere is different but the food made up for it."}
{"text":"First of all, the service was awesome. Food-wise, I tried the Gyro sandwich and the veggie combination plate. The Gyro meat was on par with other places, but probably not the best I've had. To be honest, most Gyro meat is pretty much the same (and all pretty good). It's rare it  knocks your socks, but it does happen sometimes and it's glorious when it does. There were pickles in the sandwich which seemed a little out of place. The tabouli and falafel were probably the best I've had. Grape leaves were good too. The hommus unfortunately was not that good... I would probably go back to this place, and based on my experience, I would order the falafel sandwich with a side of tabouli."}
{"text":"If you want an authentic experience, if you really want to feel like you have some manner of ethnic experience, you need to come to Haji Baba.    It's a little middle-eastern market.  It's a corner grocery.  It's a family-run restaurant.  It's freaking good.    The hummus is pretty good, with fresh-made pita.  The feta cheese app is really good.  The chicken shawerma plate is top-notch, and my god is there a ton of food.  Heck, order the gyros plate for around $6 and when it arrives, mounds of succulent meat, tzsaziki sauce, rice and Greek salad, go ahead and take a bite before you decide to pull a Johnny Depp from Once Upon a Time in Mexico and go back to kill the cook because it's just too good.    It's cheap, it's filling, it's quality, and it's ridiculous that it's not packed from open to close.    Good ol' Haji Baba."}
{"text":"I love Haji! its always a good tasty lunch when I'm feeling for something. the Chicken Shawarma always warms my soul when I eat it. and the Hummus is Fantastic. If you looking for some of the best food in town at the right prices. I love it, your probably going to love it. at the end of the day if your near here you should probably just be eating here already. Just saying"}
{"text":"**Original review from 5/5/2011. Updating new profile.**  I used to go here a lot. The owners still know my name when I pop in on the occasional shopping visit, which I love.   I am in love with their chicken shwarma and chicken kabobs.  I don't eat red meat, so I cannot comment on their beef dishes, but my son LOVES them. I always order their Arabic coffee.  It's not Turkish, as some people have written.  Turkish coffee is made with a different spice, but the technique is the same. Either way, I love the Arabic coffee here.  I would give them five stars, but their hummus can be too salty at times. Maybe they are using canned hummus, don't know and I hope they don't.  Also their tabouleh usually is dripping with lemon and that's too much for me. The bulgur should soak up just enough to flavor and still be dry.   Here you will also find a great, but quaint, grocery store. Their pricing is awesome and I love the selections of spices, herbs and teas. Their feta is fresh and priced so well that I refuse to buy it anywhere else. They also offer various kitchen items that are priced very reasonably as well.  I've bought my tea and coffee sets from there and my cutting boards. They have a good, not huge, but decent selection of shisha also. This is my one-stop-shop for my Middle Eastern groceries."}
{"text":"You have to try this place out if you love Mediterranean food and if you are REALLY hungry. Yes come here really hungry because the portions are huge!   There is a small market that is attached to the small dining area. It's not too pretty but don't let that stop you from trying out their food!   We stopped by for dinner and it was starting to get busy when we arrived. There aren't too many tables but they were definitely doing their best to clean them as soon as people were done.   We were helped right away and menus were given to us. They have sandwiches and a ton of entrees to pick from. We decided to order one shish kabob, one gyro plate, and a chicken schwarma plate.   My chicken schwarma was delicious! It came with a ton of chicken, hummus, delicious basmati rice, and a piece of pita. My husband had the shish kabob plate and the also came with rice, grilled vegetables, and a side salad. He also had a small guava drink for $3.50 (no refill) but it was well worth it.  Each plate was priced about $10 each. We spent about $45 and were there about an hour. Portions are really big and so we still had food leftover.   I would definitely be back to try the chicken schwarma in the sandwich style."}
{"text":"I love this place. The gyro deluxe is amazing. Has a full inch if homemade feta cheese at the bottom. I'm talking bite fulls of feta. The schwarma is great too a little dry, so I get the plate with kibbe, hummus, and cucumber sauce. The vegetarian plate it amazing too. All the plates are huge and will fill up anyone. The single items are great deals for when you just want a gyro for a few bucks. Very loyal customers in there that's because they do it the right way!"}
{"text":"I just found my favorite spot! Hummus and Gyros taste amazing!!  Besides the fact that the food taste so good, they have a mini market next to it. Great location!  Very pleased with service and flavor. Price is very affordable too.  Definitely will come back! Thanks guys! Very happy."}
{"text":"love the gyro plate. Rice is so good and I also dig their candy selection :)"}
{"text":"This place is a staple in the community.  The food and market have great prices and the food is as authentic as it gets! If your looking for ingredients to cook Middle Eastern food this is the place.  I always try to stop in when I'm in the area or if I'm in the mood to do some Armenian cooking at home I go here to get my ingredients."}
{"text":"I had the gyro plate here and I loved it. The food is authentic, the meat is tender and flavorful, and the pita is quite soft. Additionally, I ordered it for takeout when I got the restaurant, and the wait time was less than 5 minutes! For those who are interested, there is a sit-down option available. Additionally, there is a middle eastern grocery store attached to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Went there a few months ago and missed the closing time. It was around 8pm which seemed alittle early...So months later, we went back and I'm glad we were able to find a seat! It's a small place and service is fair, however, the hummus was one of the best I've had around town. Very smooth and creamy. I had the gyro sandwich and he had the shawarma. Both very tasty and great portions!   While he was checking out, I was checking out the grocery part of the place. LOVED IT! I am hoping to get back soon to get some more shawarma seasonings :) Def worth the visit..."}
{"text":"Been going here for years... Gyros, chicken kabob, hummus, shwerma, baklava... All terrific. Gets SUPER busy at traditional meal hours so if possible go a bit later or earlier.... Not much more to say, 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The ambiance was a little concerning. It was pretty dirty and there were tables unbussed. Still, the food was exceptional.   You NEEEEED to try the Rosewater lemonade. The hummus was great, and the lamb shish kabob was mouthwatering."}
{"text":"So wish this place delivered. Really authentic food and very tasty. It's kind of hard to find. We went by it a couple times before we found it. I love the little store too."}
{"text":"I love Mediterranean and visiting Phoenix I decided to check out this place since it was so well rated. I tried something different - the beef/wheat dish and I did not care for it at all unfortunately. The place did look authentic and I will be sure to try the shish kebab or kefta next time."}
{"text":"Delicious food at a great price. Generous portions as well. This is a hole in the wall type place and it's as authentic as it gets!"}
{"text":"Great meal.  We had a group of 5 and it looked like everyone enjoyed their meal.  And the prices were good for the portion size.  Not a large sitting area if it is busy. We came at the end of lunchtime and had to wait about 10-15 minutes.    Would definitely Recommend"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a lot, and it always delivers quality food. I think it's interesting that I can't find better middleeastern /mediterranean food at any price than this dirt-cheap half-grocery store. I rate all other falafels, gyros, shawarmas, etc. against Haji-Baba, and they never stack up. I frequently find myself saying, \"it's good, but it's not Haji good\"."}
{"text":"I've been eating here since I first moved to Arizona in the '90s.  There was a time I worked nearby and had as many as 3 lunches a week here.  The quality has never varied.  This is also my daughter's favorite restaurant and the place she picked for her birthday dinner last week.  Gotta like that since they are so inexpensive.  The hummus and hand-made pitas are the best in town. Forget town.  They are the best I've ever had.  I'm speaking as someone who has eaten  his fair share of pitas, from Connecticut to NYC to CA and AZ.   YOU MUST REMEMBER TO ORDER THE HAND-MADE PITAS.  They cost a little extra (some like .25 if I remember correctly) but are worth every penny.  I can't even eat the non-handmade pitas after having them.  If you order a sandwich, make sure to request them.  You'll thank me later.   I've had pretty much every meatless item on the menu, and everything is good.  The vegetarian sampler plate is my usual choice, but the falafel sandwich and dolmas plate are also very good.  Make sure you order the hummus as an appetizer.  The lebni is also good but if you order both, you'll have leftovers.    I generally order way more handmade pitas than I need and take the leftovers home.   They also have a grocery selection, including olives and feta cheese.  I stocked up on baked giants beans in tomato sauce last week.  They are perfect with those pitas.    Go now, get the hummus and pitas, and yell me I'm wrong.   It is also the perfect place to take a group to lunch.  None of this asking for separate checks here.  You'll also never wait for a check.  They give you a slip after you order, you bring it up front and tell the cashier which items are yours.  Honor system.  Nice people, too."}
{"text":"Best middle eastern restaurants hands down! Fresh and good prices! Best in Arizona. Friendly people awesome staff! Try the baklava! Also shawerma is a must try even if the wait is 30 min!"}
{"text":"My favorite mediterranean around. The falafel plate with rosewater lemonade is my go-to."}
{"text":"I have been eating here since I was a young warthog, and I have never had a bad meal here, the food is out of this world phenomenal, I suggest the shish kabob plate, and the service is awesome as well. When it comes to comfort food, outside of the home kitchen, this is the place. Now quit reading this and go!"}
{"text":"Oh Haji-Baba, where to begin?  We met several years back and it was love at first bite.  This little Middle Eastern market/cafe is definitely what you'd call a \"hole in the wall.\"  It's a real mom and pop shop, so don't come here looking for atmosphere.  That's not what this place is about.  I will now attempt to tell you what this place IS about.  On our last visit, it'd probably been well over a year since we'd been in, but our server (really nice guy) not only remembered us, he remembered our usual orders: two iced teas, hummus served with pita for app, then the Gyros De-lux.  And though it was our usual order, we've tried just about everything on the menu and I can honestly say I've never had anything bad there.  And at prices not much higher than fast food, you absolutely cannot beat the value here.  Great, delicious, quality food at a great price, plus a bonus: the people are wonderful.  Haji-Baba ftw!"}
{"text":"The family and I came here after church at hubby's request. The waiters put 2 tables together for us so we could eat together. Our waiter was attentive. We all ordered sandwiches (pita). The hummus and baba ghanoush were cool. I had never had baba before and probably won't again, but I will say it was very well prepared and presented. So no bad comments about, it's just not my thing.   I got the lamb tongue pita sandwich. Oh sweet baby Jesus that thing was so good. The meat was tender and delicious. I tried to eat with manners but didn't. I inhaled that thang! I put some hummus on it and perfect!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. A wonderful, quick Mediterranean dining experience. Their hummus is smooth and creamy, the rice is always cooked perfectly. My favorite is the chicken shawarma plate, served with a whole bunch of chicken, a whole pita, a generous amount of basmati rice, hummus, and some kind of lemony, parsley salad which is refreshing and delicious."}
{"text":"Been eating here for 25 years. Simply the best middle eastern food around. Love the Sanbusek, Kibbi, Falafel.... awe heck I love it all. Handmade pitta as well. Pretty busy at lunch time so plan a later lunch and you will be fine."}
{"text":"I decided to go vegetarian recently, so this was a perfect choice to have some Middle Eastern food. I had the vegetarian platter which consisted of stuffed grape leaves, baba ghanouj, and falafel. For my drink I had a rose water lemonade which was interesting and  refreshing.  Delicious, I was so full and I had plenty leftover for later.  They have recently put outdoor seating on the covered patio as well."}
{"text":"I can see why this place has good ratings and I so so so wanted to like it. My family and I had an awful experience here tonight. We sat at a table for about 15 minutes with no waiter to even take a drink order. We decided to order to go thinking it would be faster since the table service was so slow. We waited HOUR after ordering our food. I finally asked how much longer only to find that they hadn't started the order. We were there an hour and a half total between all the waiting in line and waiting for food.    If that wasn't bad enough, when we got home my husband and I BOTH found SEVERAL HAIRS in our food. Gross!! Thinking back some of the cooks had no hair cover.   Honestly, the food looked pretty good, so if you don't mind waiting over an hour for your food and getting some bonus hairs from the kitchen then you might like this place. I will not be returning and would recommend to stay away. There are plenty of other good restaurants in the area"}
{"text":"The sign out front may be sun faded, but the inside is alive and thriving!  Haji-Baba offers solid, down-home Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food at very reasonable prices and the well-equipped store make this a worthwhile stop for any ethnic food lover.    One half of Haji-Baba is a small, tightly packed ethnic food store.  The other half is a small, tightly packed restaurant.  While space is certainly limited on both sides, the selection at Haji-Baba is huge!  The store side features everything from large pans of fresh-baked pastries and desserts behind the counter to rows of hard to find spices and aisles of rare, imported ingredients at prices that make exotic cooking at home reasonable for the casual cook like me!  The restaurant side delivers good, authentic food at acceptable prices.  None of the menu items are particularly unique and the overall quality of the food tends to match the cafe styling more than fine dining, but all of the dishes I've tried have been well portioned and tasty!  Space is very limited, though, so groups larger than 4-6 aren't suggested.  Don't hesitate to stop here if you're in the area!  Even if you're not hungry, Haji-Baba has a lot to offer!"}
{"text":"So glad I found this place on Yelp when trying to look around Phoenix, Arizona for someplace to eat. It truly deserves the rating it has because this place will leave you with a full, happy stomach, a content mind, and a smile on your face when you leave.   My boyfriend and I never truly tried Middle Eastern food, but we both were glad we checked this place out and that it served as our first taste ever of Middle Eastern food.   Upon walking into the restaurant, I was a little confused because it was half shopping market and half restaurant. But I felt reassured when I noticed that it was full of people conversing, eating, and looking so glorious with their plates of food! Not only that, but it was a diverse set of people which shows that their food is so great that it breaks cultural/ethnic boundaries.   We were seated in such a down-to-earth fashion that it immediately made us feel so comfortable talking to our host and waiter. Service here is wonderful because not only does the waiter joke with you and is easy to talk to, but they are also efficient when it comes to bringing out your food and checking up on you--they do it so naturally, too.   I decided on ordering the CHICKEN SCHWARMA PLATE (grilled marinated chicken with garlic sauce, rice, flatbread, hummus, and a cilantro salad?) that everyone else recommended. Glad my first Middle Eastern plate was this one because I finished like 95% of it (hey, it was a humongous pile of scrumptious food). The grilled marinated chicken tasted absolutely amazing when you mix it up with the garlic sauce and the rice and add a bit of hummus with each bite. Perfect mixture for the win!!! I made sure to eat the mixture with the flat bread first and when that was over, I killed the rest of it. To make sure my palette wasn't too overwhelmed with the meaty, creamy flavors, they had a cilantro salad that was refreshingly acidic to refresh your taste buds. What I also loved about this plate was the hummus; the hummus was well seasoned where you can eat a lot of it (since it wasn't too salty like store brand hummus usually are)--it had a slight taste to it which complemented pretty much everything on that plate.  Would love to come back here whenever I'm back in Phoenix. Would highly recommend it to those living in the area (you guys are so lucky!). You can tell upon stepping into the door, that you're stepping into a place of authenticity where they don't need the best decor to get you satisfied, all they need is their food and their personalities to keep you coming back for more."}
{"text":"Ahmad Hamdi is the best server. Always and forever. Doesn't matter if he's working here or not."}
{"text":"This place is a good mediterranean restaurant. Very crowded which shows a good sign and very affordable prices. I tried the chicken kabab platter with salad and hummus. Everything was great. Hummus was awesome and salad was delicious. Give it a try and you won't regret it."}
{"text":"SO SO good! I got the combination plate and it was amazing. And I even was able to make a substitution for hummus. Everything on it tasted really authentic and tasty and was enough food for 3 meals for me!"}
{"text":"I was surprised that it was such a small place that is both a grocery and a restaurant.   They have the best homemade iced tea, spiced with tamarind or cardamon or something...  The server was so friendly and cute.  He reminded me of my little brother or someone like that.  They have THE BEST feta cheese ever!!!  It was the perfect blend of moisture and flavor (I hate it when it's so dry that it just crumbles).  And the side of feta that we ordered was the size of a bread plate.  Heaven!  Maybe I shouldn't have ordered that side of pickles, which was also the size of a bread plate :) But they were so good!  We ordered a side of pita bread, too, which came out to our table warm... and then it kept on coming.    I had the vegetarian combination plate for dinner.  I was shocked when I saw the huge portion size... I felt like my eyes might have been bigger than my stomach.  The combo plate came with a small salad, 2 falafel with tahini sauce, tabouleh, 2 dolmas, a huge portion of baba, a side of tzaziki, and pita.  Yeah, WOW!  I fell in love with this food at first bite!  These people really don't want you to leave hungry, that's for sure!  I noticed that they also had so many shisha flavors, so I purchased a huge box of watermelon for $10.92.  I love these prices!!!"}
{"text":"Its about time this place got an actual review for anyone who has never been.   The food is DELICIOUS and inexpensive.  Everything I've ever had there was fantastic. Of all the times I've been and all the people I've taken, I have never heard anything less than a 'wow, that was wonderful.'  Not only is the food reasonably priced, it comes in large portions in a timely manner. Just talking about it is making me crave it.    However, be warned that this place is more of a 'lunch with your friends' restaurant and less of a 'romantic date with your lover.'  While the food is delightful, the atmosphere is strange and, to be frank, slightly dirty.  From the market on the side, to the plastic glassware, to the aged chairs, this place is not much to look at.  So if you're looking for a tasty, affordable meal, Haji-Baba is a must.  If you're looking for the next hip spot, you may want to try somewhere with a little more flattering lighting.    Overall, the service is always wonderful, the food is absolutely worth it, but just know that Haji-Baba is not you're typical 5 star restaurant."}
{"text":"My favorite place to eat in Tempe. It has been around for many years and I love love love their chicken shawarma plate, it's my go to from here. On top of that, their hummus is probably the best hummus I have had."}
{"text":"I go here weekly to pick up food for lunch.  I love their greek salad with a side of chicken schwarma.  It's seriously the best dressing.  Had tons of flavor. I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"My favorite place to stop when I'm passing through Tempe.  Always fresh and great chicken shawarma. Tons of hummus included with the plates."}
{"text":"SOOOOOOO GOOOOODDDD!  Cant say enough about this locally owned gem.  It was super busy both dining in and take out and they close early 8pm and it was already 7pm but we decided to wait anyway.  While waiting I browsed the store and found so many things I wanted to buy! Things that I havent seen since living in NY, like sugar coated chick peas (think Jordan Almonds) and Rose Water which I use to make lemonade and you can order direct off their menu!  So yummy.  The food was fresh and the prices super reasonable. The hummus was fresh and tasty and the chicken kabobs with salad and rice delicious, the dressing on the salad was awesome."}
{"text":"You don't need to break the bank to fly to the Middle East when Haji Baba is right around the corner. Unequivocally this is the best restaurant and everything on the menu is superb.  The overwhelming spicy aroma encompasses you and you really do feel like you have found yourself in a 'whole new world' (as Aladdin would say).  It almost leads to you believe that you just might have a magic carpet out front waiting to fly you home.   Something about Haji Baba stirs up thoughts of romance... maybe its the lamb tongue sandwhich or the hummus platter.  Either way, be careful who you choose to dine with... you might just end up finding true love.    Don't forget to browse the attached Middle Eastern grocery store for all your sardine and pickled onion desires."}
{"text":"Good food, very tasty and authentic, and great prices. Seriously, you cannot beat the prices here, they are downright awesome.  You can walk in this restaurant with 15 bucks and fully feed two adults no problem. The portions are big and they really give you what you pay for. The dishes usually have rice or hummus or salad, and they are all pretty tasty.   The falafels are good, not the greatest on earth, but very good. The hummus too, it's tasty and authentic and has a nice rich flavor. The side salad is surprisingly tasty for being cheap lettuce, it has this tasty sauce that has tahini in it, I personally add a little lemon to it for more taste.  The entrees are good, the meat is tasty, and the sides are heaping. You get a good sized meal for 7-8 bucks.  My only issue are the pitas, they are the same old cheap white flour pitas you can find in the grocery store. Nothing special or tasty, just typical plain old pitas. I really wish they would offer whole wheat pitas, especially for the people with allergies to white flour and simple sugars. It's rare to see whole wheat in any mediterranean place.  My favorite dish here is the one that freaks most people out...THE LAMB'S TONGUE! It sounds weird, but it is absolutely delicious people, you have to try it. Seriously, get over your little phobias and try the lamb tongue pita. It tastes just like the best pastrami or corned beef in mediterranean flavors, it's the best thing on the menu. Try it!"}
{"text":"This is by far the BEST Middle East restaurant i have ever been to. I have read a lot of good reviews of this place and it lives up to it. The hummus is simply superb, it with the bread melts in the mouth. and I had chicken shawarma which was delicious.  The service was fast and courteous. I moved from San Jose , CA and with the restaurant options up there i had hard time finding good ones here in Tempe. Well here is one i love to go over and over again."}
{"text":"I heard from some friends that this place was awesome and that it was much better than Pita Jungle.  If its better than Pita I am all over it.  My husband and I went and we got the two most popular things on their menu plus an iced tea.  The flavors were very nice but I didnt like the use of dark chicken meat.  To me it just doesnt taste as good and there was no choice it just comes that way.  Other things were really dry and not as good as what I am used to when I go out to eat.  The iced tea was nice it was a black tea with cinnamon added so not that special but I guess it is different than the norm which I like.  To me Pita Jungle and My Big Fat Greek are far superior but of course it would depend on what you ordered.  I like spicy and I love tahini.  This place was kinda below average for me and I think its because of the dark meat chicken.  My husband left his whole plate untouched pretty much.  He had a sampler with grape leaves, meat balls, rice, etc.  it wasnt that good but we brought it home and I warmed it up the next day and it was much better for some reason."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been going here for a few years now. It is one of our favorite places. Really low key, affordable, amazing food! Between the 2 of us our bill is never more than $10 and we are always stuffed! I love how casual it is and the humus cannot be beat!"}
{"text":"Pretty darn good! Had the vegetarian combo. The falafal was super slammin'! But the hummus and baba ganoush were a little bland to me. So disappointing! Next time, I'll have what my friends had...a good old fashioned gyro!   Oh, and if you dare, try the Arabic coffee. It's a jolt!   One last tip, if you're going for lunch, don't go straight at noon, there's usually a long line for a table (always a good sign tho')."}
{"text":"Been here many times in the past couple of years and pretty much worked my way around the menu.   Consistently good food each visit and by far the best selection of middle eastern and Indian based food/teas/coffees/spices and paraphernalia.  Whole isles dedicated to cookies, candy and cooking oils and spices.  Really great prices on bulk spices that would normally cost you the same for a tiny package.  Big array of baklava, cheeses, olives etc.  In the restaurant, usual gyro, kafta and shish kebab platters can sandwiches or salads.  Additionally find items like shawerema and koubideh.  Combination plates and many sides.   Great service and friendly staff.  Basic dining area inside and out."}
{"text":"The best middle eastern food in the Phoenix metro area. Authentic, reasonable prices, great service and super friendly owner/staff. Our group had hummus and is was spectacular. The chicken and gyro meat was fresh and tasted great. Overall a great experience, great meal and quality food. Highly recommend it if you are looking for middle eastern food. Not fancy so come in your jeans and comfortable shoes. You will be happy you made the drive to get here."}
{"text":"Dare I say \"the best\" gyros of all time. Yes... yes I dare say \"the best\"... the best indeed!! Absolutely Fantastic!!!"}
{"text":"IN LOVE WITH THE FOOD OF THIS PLACE!!! I must said that middle eastern food is my fav so I get a little fussy about it. I have tried at least +15 different middle eastern places around the valley and none would bet Haji-Baba, food is just amazing, all the flavors are so authentic, plus super good prices, I had tried everything in the menu I would recommend every single dish. I have to drive around 1 hr (no traffic) to get here will be worth it a thousand times."}
{"text":"This place is popular for many reasons. It offers sit down dining or fast easy to-go take out.  There is also a small market offering many Middle Eastern groceries and supplies. It defiantly needs some sprucing up but has a fun ethnic feel. Every time I come here the service is friendly and efficient. I usually get the babbaganoush (delish), which is my fav around town, and the domas, which are handmade here and far superior than other local chain restaurants that use canned or jarred. Yuk! I recommend this place especially for quick take out. A fun place for lunch or dinner. Nothing fancy, but pretty tasty."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place in Phoenix for great chicken schwarma and baba ghanoush.  It can be a bit slow on the service and you are eating in a cramped middle eastern grocery store but these guys do the food right."}
{"text":"So this is a typical mom and pop shop selling killer food. Been there a few times now and never felt disappointed. From their falafel to chicken shawarma..everything is impeccable. I love their bakhlawa. It's the best I have ever tasted. A must try if you are in Tempe."}
{"text":"Burnt food. Rude server. Disaster. Don't go here. Could not give less than one star. The server says \"if you don't want it burnt u ask for medium cooked\" he pulled the menu off my Hand too! This is a bad way to treat your customers. I am never going here again. Period."}
{"text":"Omg...I am sick and the only thing I am craving is a chicken Schwarma plate from Haji Baba!  This was my favorite place to go in college!   I am coming into town Thursday....I have to get takeout!   This place is amazing.  I am so glad they are still around!"}
{"text":"What a great little restaurant!  It is nothing fancy and certainly caters to an eclectic bunch of people, which I think is great!  The service was quick and the food was delicious!  I will certainly be back to eat here!  The store area is quite amazing, too!  When I need spices of ANY kind, this is where I'm going!  The variety is amazing and it is SO CHEAP compared to what you pay in the grocery store!  I'm excited that I found this little place!"}
{"text":"Love the food and the staff is friendly. You cannot beat the price and did I mention the food is top notch!"}
{"text":"Talk about great!! I was very hesitant to go and was sure I wouldn't like Middle eastern food. I was blown away! I had the Gyro DLX minus the onion and added feta. It was out of this world. I was so surprised. It's a mixture of lamb/beef, tomatoes, cucumber mint yogurt sauce. I added in Feta (great choice). I also had a lemonade to which they add rose water. Delicious! You won't be disappointed. It's a bit of a hole in the wall, but who cares? The food is great."}
{"text":"The previous reviewers really do say it all. 500+ reviews at 4+ stars average? Almost unheard of in the area. Walk in open to anything on the menu and leave amazed. The best middle eastern style restaurant I have been to since Mamoun's in New Haven/New York. Keep going back and try more. Then shop next door for one of the best spice selections in the area."}
{"text":"I've been here twice and have eaten the beef and chicken shwarma plates. They're both really good (although the beef is better). Good hummus, good sides. I tried my friend's grape leaves last time and they were delightful. I'll definitely come back!"}
{"text":"I saw the reviews on yelp which took me to this restaurant. It was me and my husband, I ordered the shish ( lamb) kabob plate and my husband ordered the kabob kubideh sandwich. I thought the quantity of lamb on my plate was really less (one small skewer) with lots of rice, salad , one burnt piece of tomato and bell pepper. Plus the dish itself was really dry overall..the taste of the lamb itself was just about average..nothing to rave about. My husband's sandwich was also..well..mehh..very dry, loaded with lettuce and the sandwich bread was not tasty. thing is, we just moved to Arizona from California and the quality of middle eastern food in California is really good and maybe that's why we were disappointed with this place. Anyways I might give this place one more shot to try the chicken shawarma. Till then, I'm going to stick to 'my big fat Greek ' restaurant."}
{"text":"I love holes-in-the-wall and the food here is fantastic. I came with a group and we ordered a bunch of dishes to share. Combination platters offer a sample of everything and we got shwarma to top it all off. The gyro meat was a tad dry but all the other grilled meats and falafel were great. They are not open late so be sure to get here before they close. Prices are excellent for the amount of food you get."}
{"text":"The food here is fast cheap and good! I had the gyro sandwich and also sampled my friends falafel and sambousek. Including my friends sandwich and two drinks, our bill was about $15. Great deal and delicious, loved the cucumber sauce and pickle flavors in the sandwich."}
{"text":"We eat this type of food often and had heard about this restaurant in reviews (people compare other restaurants to it) so when in the area tried it out.  Pros - best halvah I ever had at the deli - joyva brand brought in from New York in large wedges.   Falafel was one of the best - moist inside and more a half ball with a flat side than a ball or oval.    Got the shish kabob - it was well charred on one side and that affected the flavor but it was not burned so bad it could not be eaten. There was no flavor like it was never marinated and not even the typical slightly gamy lamb flavor, just bland and on the tough side.  Dressing on salad was regular Italian and plenty put on rather than a Mediterranean dressing.  Also got the combination.  Gyro was fine - typical taste and texture.  Tabooli about 90% parsley which was ok.  Kibbi had no meat (could not see, feel, or taste any).  It was a nice piece of bread but not what was expected.  Dolmas flavor was ok but the grape leaves were very tough taking effort to bite thru and chew.  We have had the same dishes done much better at other restaurants including ones close by this one and would not return here except maybe rarely to get some halvah."}
{"text":"The great thing about this place is its simplicity, nothing fancy about so the prices are reasonable. I just love the gyros. I can feed the whole family for $25 dollars and the kids love the gyros too. Im there pretty much every Sunday if i'm in town."}
{"text":"Been going there close to 20 years, there is a reason it is still around and busy, it has consistently remained very good. The restaurant is not fancy, but always spotless and welcoming. My boyfriend loves the vegetarian plate. I love all the plates and always have hard time deciding. My son grew up going there and doesnt like any other middle eastern restaurants. Th prices on items in the market area are great for spices, feta cheese in deli case, and olive oils. It is busy at lunch time. You can get take out. The prices are  very reasonable they give quite large portions."}
{"text":"I can understand why this restaurant is a hit with the ASU crowd: its proximity to campus, accessibility by light rail, low prices. The hummus appetizer alone, a generous serving at less than 3 bucks with hot pita halves, could be a heavy snack or a light meal. The very inexpensive sandwiches vary in quality: I found the falafel to be really good, the koubideh was OK, and the beef shawarma was dry and lacking in flavor. The tabouleh was a bit too acidic for my taste and would probably have been better if more bulgur were added.  Waiting time at dinner depends on the size of your group. When I came with a larger group, we had a long wait, but seating was prompt when I came with just 2 friends. Overall, my dining experiences here were OK. For food quality, I consider the nearby Cafe Istanbul to be a better choice; but for price, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"Very yummy! Had the gyros platter. Very nice portion size for a nice price! The store in the restaurant is great to shop."}
{"text":"Always spot on! Great food, prices, service and love supporting the community. Great local find!"}
{"text":"Humble environment - Awesome food - Great price. I love the chicken kabob, tabouli, yogurt salad, lebni, olives, greek pita, pecan and walnut baklavas.  They have the biggest variety of nut baklavas I've ever encountered.  There is also a small grocery on the other half of the building.  Cheap bulk spices galore."}
{"text":"Man o Man. Haji baba may be the best Mediterranean food I have ever had in my life. Ordered the chicken Schwarma. Swapped the tobulli and doubled up on the hummus because it was so good. So fresh. A hidden gem in Tempe. Worth the ride."}
{"text":"Yum chicken swarm hits the spot each and every time. Looks suspect but it's on point."}
{"text":"2 stars - I've experienced better, many times. Anyone who reads my reviews may come to the conclusion that I eat out just so I can write bad reviews. I assure you this is not the case. I always want to be wowed when I go to a restaurant. Nothing is more of a let down than mediocrity during the sacred dining hour.   In a nutshell, it's a neat little place and our service was very good. Nothing was horrible. Appetizer was quite tasty, but the pita was flimsy and had no taste to it. Entree was OK, but the little bubble gum size, chewy chicken is disgraceful. Not appetizing at all, pushed it all to the side.  Arabic (or Turkish) coffee was good, but done too quickly. It's supposed to slowly rise to the top 3 times before being served. I know, you're busy and it's a pain in the ass, but that's how it's done, and tastes much better when cooked properly. Also should have had more cardamom and sugar, but that's probably just my personal taste."}
{"text":"Amazing chicken shawarma! Haji Baba is all around amazing. Their food is great, but their store also has great prices-- I love to buy my spices here as well! I would definitely recommend trying the pistachio baklava at some point. Everything here is truly fantastic!"}
{"text":"In my experience the middle eastern eateries in the Phoenix area all hover around mediocrity.  This place is on the cusp of greatness but is held back with weak supporting dishes.  When I come here I normally get the Sultani or the mixed kabob plate. While the meat is tender, moist, and grilled to perfection it is complemented by subpar basmati rice or hummus that tastes like it came straight from a can. The tabbouleh is ok though.  Their appetizers are also on the wrong side of mediocrity. In addition to the gastronomic catastrophe that they call hummus, their sambusek and fuul is also thoroughly unimpressive. I have lived in Egypt so I know what good fuul tastes like and trust me that is not it. It tasted like it came straight from the can.     Lets end on a positive note though. The meat is succulent and by in large the food is reasonably priced and the service is prompt and friendly. In addition adjoining the eating area is a small market so if you need halal meat in Tempe or any other essentials of Muslim cuisine its worth your time to grab lunch and then do some shopping."}
{"text":"I thoroughly enjoyed my meal. Don't let the look of the place scare you off, five stars if it was nicer on the inside but the food was delicious and we all know that is the most important thing right!"}
{"text":"Haji Baba is a top notch middle eastern grocery store and lunch spot!  They offer all of the Mediterranean favorites for a very reasonable price.  Although I have my favorite Mediterranean places for different dishes, I come to Haji Baba when I want a quick, cheap bite.  You can dine in for under $7 and get in and out in less than 30 minutes.    The ambiance is typical of the standard hole-in-the-wall middle eastern eatery.  During lunch time it gets busy, I have seen people waiting for a table to open up.  The wait staff is a loyal bunch that has worked there for years and it is always nice to see their familiar faces.  The hummus is good and the kalamatas are always a delicious treat.  I highly recommend ordering the homemade pita (not on the menu) with your hummus or your pita sandwich....Haji's finest:)  The Greek salad leaves much  to be desired as it consists solely of iceberg with the usual Greek veggies.  Eat here for the sandwiches or plates, not the salads.  In the grocery you can get a variety of inexpensive spices, olive oil, fresh olives, feta and many other tantalizing treats.  And don't forget to try one of the many different types of Baklava that they make as you are checking out!!  My favorite is the almond or the pecan....yummm!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for 20 years and it is as delicious and as reasonably prized as it was on day 1! Love the rose hip lemonade and the chicken shawarma plate."}
{"text":"Wow this place is incredible! This has to be one of the best spots in Arizona to get some Middle Eastern food. I tried their Chicken Shawarma plate and one of their sandwiches, both were outstanding. The plate was good in just about every way and the portions are huge. The garlic sauce that they use is really good and compliments the rice and chicken so well. My favorite would have to be their sandwiches as it was just perfect.  They do have a small grocery inside as well which is certainly very convenient combined with the restaurant."}
{"text":"Haji Babas is really the best. I live a few blocks away and eat there at least once a week. I usually order sides.. some combination of: hummus, chicken kabab, koobideh, and falafel. I also get a large container of the \"garlic sauce\", and literally put it on anything I eat at my house until it's gone."}
{"text":"i recommend making the people you go with order several things so you can have a bite of everything.  everything is good. so good.   i think the gyro meat was my favorite, their pitas are so fluffy and soft... like little cushions from heaven sent to earth with the sole purpose of harnessing that delicious meat.   i can't even remember everything we had but i know i liked every bite and you will too. we had like 3 days of left overs as well, but we went a little over board in our ordering."}
{"text":"It's almost eerie how much Haji-Baba reminds me of another valley favorite.  For those of you who've been to Middle Eastern Bakery (or MEB as I often refer to it) on 16th Street in Phoenix, Haji in so many ways feels like MEB's twin.  Or perhaps MEB is Haji Baba's twin?  Anyways, I was looking for a place for dinner close to ASU's Gammage Auditorium in advance of going to see The Book of Mormon (fantastic Broadway show, btw), and came upon Haji as one of my bookmarked spots.  I'd talked to a number of ASU grads who'd raved about this place so around 6pm on a Friday night, I made my way in.  Like I said, the place felt perfectly familiar to me as a faithful MEB customer.  A grocery store and bakery up front with a sit down restaurant to the side.  The aroma of fresh baked goods mixed with the smells of cooked meats and seasonings from the grocery store permeating the air.  The place was unsurprisingly jam packed for dinner, but fortunately the wait for a table was less than 5 minutes.  One significant difference here at Haji versus MEB is that you wait in line for a table and the wait staff takes care of you until you pay at the front counter when you're done (whereas you order everything upfront at the counter at MEB).  The menu has a nice variety of salads, sandwiches and mixed plates consisting of Middle Eastern and Mediterranean influences, including plenty of healthy (and perhaps not so healthy) options to choose from.  I led off with the Hummus Tahini appetizer.  This Hummus was doused with lemon juice, garlic, olives, pickles, sesame seeds, and of course a healthy dose of olive oil.  The pita bread it came with was warm, pillowy soft and perfect for dipping.  I apologize for not getting a photo of this as I was so hungry from skipping lunch earlier in the day that I hoover'd this stuff.  My word this hummus dish was luscious.  I could've eaten a gallon of that hummus it was so good.  I also got an order of their lemonade with rose water.  And for those of you MEB loyalists who think MEB has the best lemonade with rose water out there, you can rest easy.  Haji's version of this drink is delicious and refreshing, but I would still give MEB the slight edge on this particular drink.  Now then for the main entree.  I had to watch my portion size a little bit this go around since I was going to have a theatre play to sit through for 3 hours.  The Sultani plate seemed like just the thing.  A steak kebab, a ground beef kebab, rice, salad, plus pita bread and grilled tomatoes (okay, so it was still a large portion, but I could've gone crazier).  The meats were cooked and seasoned perfectly, and the rice (oh man that rice) had a buttery softness which acted as the perfect compliment.  I restrained myself from ordering dessert this go around, but great dinner all around.  Total cost for the lemonade, food, tax and tip came to $22.  Despite a busy night, I was in and out pretty quickly.  It's not hard to see why this place is so popular with locals and ASU students alike.  Great food, great staff, reasonable prices, in a relaxed casual neighborhood setup.  Being right along the light rail route is also a plus.  It is better than MEB?  Honestly, I'd call it a draw.  Both are awesome spots and I'd gladly go back to either anytime.  Phoenix has MEB & Tempe has Haji, so both cities have a spot to call their own.  Great Middle Eastern cuisine isn't always easy to find, so having two 5 star options in the valley is a big plus.  Next time I'm at Haji, its Baklava time."}
{"text":"Awesome..not a bad item on the menu. This is a small international grocery store with a small restaurant attached. Gets very busy at lunch but moves quickly and gives you a chance to see the heaping plates of goodness being delivered efficiently to tables. I had a kibi  plate that came with super fresh tabouleh, lots of humus and beautiful fresh little pitas, and a great creamy yogurt salad. Friend had the gyro platter complete with a pile of tender gyro meat, rice, salad etc. add ice tea and it was under $20 and so filling that I was set for several hours. There is a reason that this place is busy. It rocks!"}
{"text":"This place is probably the cheapest middle eastern food in town. I love it. If you're on a shoestring (read ASU students), then you can have a meal here for under $5. I suggest the falafel sandwich (about $2.75, and filling) and maybe an order of babaganouj if you're looking for a complementary side. Delicious."}
{"text":"My Follow-Up Review:  The food at Haji-Baba is still my standard by which I compare other Middle Eastern and Mediterranean food.  Haji is consistently good, filling and flavorful - albeit healthy even.  A true landmark in the valley that must be visited, at least once, by everyone, anyone who desires a taste of the Mediterranean, or is feeling adventurous, without leaving the East Valley.  Although lacking a bit of ambiance, eat here and it may just inspire you to make your own hummus, tabouli or falafel.  This is why Haji-Baba is a one stop affair: after your meal, pop over to the grocery side and grab the needed items (some found nowhere else) to whip up your own creation.    Don't feel like making the food yourself?  Call them, even with short notice, and you can please a hungry crowd and wow them with tasty morsels of delicious homemade food.  Or just get take-out and call it good!  It is worth the drive or a visit.  Light rail stops right out front, bike parking is nearby. Uber your way here and you will be glad you did!   Overall Rating: 4.5 Stars Food: 4.8 stars Service: 4.1 Stars Cleanliness: 3.8 Stars Atmosphere: 3.2 Price/Value: 4.6 Stars"}
{"text":"So i'm not here to buy spices or shop for sheesha, i'm here for food. Lots and lots of food. Luckily for me, Haji-Baba is known for tons of food at decent prices so I have a promising evening of stuffing my face without breaking my wallet. God, I sound like a really cheap buffet commercial.  But really, to be truthfully, super blunt, honest-to-go-honest truth, Haji-Baba's food is not the best in the world but it is 1) fresh, 2) good quality, 3) tasty and 4) cheap. I am sure you can find better Mediterranean food around town, but this place is really good on your wallet and fits my needs just right. And hey, 215 reviews can't be lying. THE PEOPLE LIKE IT. They like it a lot.  I ordered the gyro deluxe (gyro with raw onions and feta cheese), a side order of hummus, Babaganoush (eggplant dip), tried my friends lamb tongue and a pistachio  baklava.   If you are feeling adventurous and want to try the lamb tongue, lemme tell you: don't. Really, don't. There is nothing tasty about lamb tongue. It tastes slightly like roast beef but the texture resembles congealed liver patee and the big chunks are really scary. The only positive about eating tongue? Infinite pun jokes about talking about it forever. Get it?  The gyro meat was pretty standard in the Gyro deluxe sandwich, the best thing about it was the creamy fresh salty feta cheese. Its the freshest i've ever had and they really DO slap it on that sandwich, like a boss. The babaganoush was also very very tasty with the pickle and the black olive- however- i would have liked bigger pieces of roasted eggplant than a hummus-like texture. The hummus was just A-OK, it needed more of a PUNCH of flavor. Last but not least, the baklava is my favorite dessert in all the land.. so obviously I enjoyed it. Heavy on the honey and not very crispy on the nuts, but pretty decent nonetheless.  In conclusion, only use the tongue in your mouth and not the one on the menu, get as much feta cheese as your body can process and buy a desert to-go. BAM, lunch is served."}
{"text":"If you've ever gyros hopped before, you know that not all gyros are created equal, and until today; if asked, I would have told you my favorite gyros is at Cypress Grill. I am happy to report, opinion changed!  I've had this spot bookmarked for quite a while now, the trouble is that I spoiled myself by moving a mile away from where I work; I've got dining, shopping, and work all within 5 minutes. There's 4 froyo shops, 5 gyros spots, 6 grocery stores, countless dining, dive bars, comedy clubs, open mics, music and more. Travelling outside of my acceptable radius is quite the big deal. There's usually some type of planning, engagement, or craving involved that just can't happen inside my bubble.   I recently was in the Tempe area and decided to strike while the iron is hot. If you visit expecting the usual quick serve, show up, eat, and leave setting - you're only partly right, but Haji-Baba is so much more. Haji is a Middle East / Mediterranean market - who also makes one heck of a gyros, and I'm happy to stamp my opinion of \"Personal Favorite - thus far\" on it.   I ordered up a Gyros DLX - sans tomato. This thing comes falling out the pita with a generous portion of gyros, lettuce, onion, tomato, tatziki, feta cheese and all wrapped up with a hand made pita. Best yet, it's under five bucks! - if you're not into the hand made pita or fresh of the block feta cheese, it's younger brother \"Gyros\" comes with the same delicious lamb and beef gyros for about $3.69.  Though, why stop at just the gyros? This place is flushed with great imported foods and fresh made desserts to order up from their market. Shop through aisles of items like spices, sauces, pickled beets, harissa (spicy pepper sauce), cookies, and so much more. Check in their glass case for fresh made pastires, olives, and feta cheese. On a whim I tried out one of their harissas and haven't looked back since. Now I'm blending up my favorite spicy pepper hummus with jalepeno, garlic, and harissa week after week. - message me if you want the recipe; it's awesome, I promise ;-)  Happy Yelping Phoenix - break outside your bubble once in a while and you'll be surprised at what you can find!"}
{"text":"Looking from the outside in you're wondering what kind of place is this... it looks like a market and maybe a \"deli style\" type of seating. When you walk in you are immediately transferred to the middle east with friendly greetings and delicious smells wafering from the kitchen.  So, you take a seat, wondering what kind of food you can devour and enjoy! I highly recommend the shawarma sandwiches and some pita bread with hummus. The prices are amazing for what you order and get and the staff and service is friendly and prompt.  It is a spot not to be missed!"}
{"text":"All I have to say is haji babas is legit. I always get the plates because you get a good amount of food. My favorite by far is the chicken shawarma plate. The flavor a from the chicken melt in your mouth and their rice is amazing. There is some secret sauce in that rice that makes it taste amazing.  Imagine going to the Middle East and walking into some back street and finding a dive, this is it. A grocery store with a bunch of tables and a couple of servers. My kind of place. Went here for years when I lived in AZ. Now that I live in Cali and miss it all the time, I had to finally give it the review it deserves."}
{"text":"My favorite dish here is the chicken shwarma plate. It's especially good when they burn it a little bit so it's crispy! It comes with weird diced salad, hummus, pita and rice. I could eat here every day it's so good!  Service is alright, but I just care about the food at places like these.  5/5 WCB"}
{"text":"After 2 years, you'd think that a place might improve a bit...alas it did not.  The service on our recent visit was S-L-O-W.  And by slow, I mean that I suspect that the kitchen was still plucking the feathers off the chicken when I ordered by kebabs. Our server had suggested that the schwarma would take at least 30 minutes to prepare and in retrospect, I should have ordered it anyway based on the length of time it took for our order to arrive. And it was NOT busy.  Drinks again were left bone dry. I tried the yogurt soda which was DISGUSTING. Skip it. The food was just meh and the service was yet again, lackluster at best.   I will not be back to Haji Baba. 2 chances and between the meh food and the lackluster service, I just can't see giving more of my time or effort to a place that doesn't seem to want to put in time or effort."}
{"text":"I stopped by this restaurant (recommended by a co-worker) during a school break one day and was pleasantly surprised! The restaurant is split into a \"Mediterranean convenient store\" that sells spices, canned goods, jars etc.I love those types because they typically offer such wonderful and authentic entrees (I used to visit an Indian restaurant in CA that was set-up in this same manner and it is still is the best Indian food in my mind to this day...). I had the vegetarian combo: 2 falafels with tahini sauce, tabouli, a pickle and tomato slices, pita bread, 2 dolmas and cucumber sauce was also provided, On my way out I picked up some baklava for $1.50 each and was as happy as a clam."}
{"text":"Just came over after a day's hike to fill my stomach.  Ordered the combination of 3 kebabs - chicken, ground beef and lamb.  The lamb was the best!   The tabouli and hummus were tasty.  Come hungry as the portions are for champions."}
{"text":"Got the combination plate, I'm not very familiar with Middle Eastern food so I'm not sure I'm a good judge.  The gyro meat was a little greasy..  I liked the thing that looked like egg roll and the thing that looked like hush puppies..  Wasn't a huge fan of the thing that looked like dark corn bread and the salad type couscous thing.  The chicken kabob, koobideh and beef kabobs were not very flavorful and slightly burned.  LOVED the pistachio baklavas!  Which is why I'm giving it 4 stars..  :)"}
{"text":"went cuz of great reviews, place was crowded but slow service and cardboard not fresh pita, overcooked meat, way off the mark from reviews"}
{"text":"Wow, wow, wow!!!  Are you looking for that amazing, authentic middle eastern food, large portions and a reasonable price?!?!  Look no further.  I never would have even thought a restaurant existed here, but thanks to yelp and the amazing reviews I had to try it.  I went to pick up take out and all the tables were seated, so clearly it's not a \"hidden\" gem, and for good reason.  The food, flavors and authenticity are all 5 stars!  The only thing I wish for is another couple pita breads... one to dip in my hummus and one to eat with the gyro meat!  I struggled mightily not giving this place 5 stars.  But that's ONLY because I personally reserve those ratings for destination restaurants.  I highly recommend Haji-baba.  I will be back again and again.  I'm not even done eating my lunch and I can't wait till the next time I go!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely AMAZING!!! Not only is it ridiculously cheap, but it is incredibly delicious, as well! My boyfriend and I went the other day for lunch and ordered the combo platter and a side of babaganoush-$12 total-We were both extremely satisfied and we came home with a huge takeout box(that I have been munching on all weekend) This place is a GEM and you should definitely check it out! I cant wait to go back again this week! Mmmmmmm....soooo tasty!"}
{"text":"Have eaten lots of middle eastern food, even at really good places, and seriously, EVERYTHING at this place is better than the others,....and some others are really good! There is something about the quality and tastes here that simply surpass the others. Is it fancy and well decorated? No. It's in a corner type market. But, amazing food! And the service is always friendly and you feel like part of the family.  Prices? Ridiculously moderate/mainstream for what you get.  Worst thing about this place is I don't get to eat here enough,.....oh, and that I can't get this exact food everywhere at any moment - they've ruined me on middle eastern food anywhere else."}
{"text":"The food and service is always excellent. My favorite is the chicken Schwarma and the walnut baklava. I've never seen such an array of baklava, it's a must try."}
{"text":"Ever since the wife got a tattoo just up the road from this place, giving us an excuse to eat here for the first time (see my original review), I've been jonesing for more. Fortunately, she booked in for another tattoo a couple of days ago which gave us another excuse to travel the 45 miles and have another bite at the Casa la Dinge. Unfortunately, the way the day played out meant that I headed in to Tempe with her, then had to kill about three hours waiting for her tattoo to be completed. During this time I met some friends and because I was starving I wound up having a quasi-lunch with them at Slices Pizza at the cnr of 6th and Mill. Doh! The wife wouldn't have tolerated me doing Haji Baba's with them because SHE wanted to join me at HB for a late lunch. I thus had two lunches on the day, but because I wasn't too hungry after she and I arrived at HB, I had to make do with a couple of appetizers. I ordered the Foul Mudammas, the falafel and the yoghurt soda. The soda made me shudder at the unexpected taste, but I did manage to strangle down about half of it, with a face that probably appeared to onlookers as though I was being cornholed with a pineapple. Reminded me a lot of salt lassi, except this was saltier. Basically like drinking salty melted butter out of a bag of Orville Redenbacher. The wife grimaced at her first swallow, then came back a few minutes later for another go-round (that's my girl!) I can see why the damn stuff is popular - in a Warheads-candy sort of way. The Mudammas was pretty good, but my gut was quite full by this time and I didn't even finish the falafels. Oh well. Wife had the chicken kabob, same as last time I think - the plate was overloaded and the food was delicious, once again.  After we finished I started with the usual wandering up and down the aisles looking at the weird foods and their names. Wife said she needed to hit the restroom. About a minute later she was back, with sort of a guilty wan smile on her face. I was wondering whether the crapper was out of order or something else funny had happened. I was wrong. Apparently the previous occupant had dropped a couple of foul mudammas of his own in the bog, and the stench was so rancid that my wife threw up almost all of her meal. I kid you not. She said she struggled to hold her breath but in the end, blammo. By this time I was doing the potty dance as well and with more than a little trepidation went to the restroom. I sniffed (WHY?!) but the smell had cleared out by now and it was tolerable. However, the toilet fixtures themselves were disgraceful. I took a couple of photos of the faucet (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2GmGT-7QjowR1ihup3FbVA?select=R-J7WlBAZ7cGGRMTetoRxA), and the string holding their mirror above the sink (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2GmGT-7QjowR1ihup3FbVA?select=DkWNs54J3xmfmZ1KHX2CbA). If they're going for realistic Arabic slum atmosphere and decor at this place, congrats - they hit the mark one hundred percent. Please, DON'T go into the restroom if you visit this place.. you'll spend the rest of the day, like I did, wondering if the kitchen fixtures look the same. Spoiled the experience for me, and there's NO reason they can't renovate such a tiny room and make it at least a little more passable. Made the shitter in \"Trainspotting\" look like the jewelry counter at Harrods.  Three stars (two knocked off for the state of the restroom, and I'm not counting the stench/vomiting incident in this demerit), and my brief addiction has been broken. I probably won't go here again since it transcends even my fairly liberal, old-city standards of cleanliness. Cheap food, good tasting, generous portions, I didn't get food poisoning, and the cashew baklava was awesome, but next time we're in town I'll probably go back to Slices Pizza or look for an alternate Middle Eastern fix. Then again, Greek Wraps is closer and just as tasty. And no, owner of Chicago Gyros, they didn't pay me to say that. Seacrest out."}
{"text":"I've been going to Haji Baba since '99 and I have NEVER been disappointed. Nothing that I write will do this place justice. I have had everything but the Kibbi (sp?). Their hummus is always spot on. The Fallafel is always crispy but maintains moistness. Their gyros are delicious. The chicken is beyond reproach.   Afterwards its is always fun to peruse the store. Good prices all around!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I can't believe I have never reviewed this restaurant.  If you like middle eastern food then you are missing out if you have never eaten here, seriously.  We have been coming regularly for over 12 years.  One of our all time favorite restaurants.  We almost always bring company in town here.  The food is amazing.  The cost is so cheap!!  Always order the same thing... Vegetarian combonation plate.  Comes with 2 stuffed grape leaves, 2 falafil balls, babjanoush, tabouli and yogurt salad.  For the appetizer we always get Lebni and the plate is literaly licked clean.  I can't encourage you enough to order hand made pita bread with all of your items.  My husband and kids also love the chicken and beef schwarma as well as the chicken kabobs.  They always order the carbonated yogurt soda- yuck!!"}
{"text":"The first time I sank my teeth into Haji Baba's falafel sandwich, I knew that I had found a winner. Already being a big fan of Phoenecia, I was a little hesitant at first to try Haji Baba, but I had a feeling that I would like it so I gave it a shot. There are three things that you absolutely have to try, and they are:  The falafel sandwich.  The gyro plate.  The dolmas (stuffed grape leaves).  Like most of the reviews read, the falafels are some of the best around! They don't dry out your mouth and are loaded with flavor...not to mention that the sandwich is ultra cheap! As for the gyro plate, I have one thing to say...BEST GYRO MEAT IN PHOENIX! There, I said it. The meat is seriously succulent (you hear that about steak, not gyro meat!), no exaggeration. Just think of the best gyro meat you've ever tasted, but cut thick and served with some of the best tzatziki around. Remember to get the plate when you go and I don't think you will regret it. And lastly, try the dolmas. I say that because they are served here differently than any place in the valley that I've been to, and that is warm. Usually dolmas are served chilled and are brimming with strong sour and oily flavors, not these. Haji Baba's recipe is truly unique; it's mild, not sour and rich with flavor.  Get a small side of lebne to put on em and be prepared for your taste buds to do a little happy dance (not to be confused with the pee pee dance...taste buds don't pee).  There you have it! I finally, after years of going here, reviewed Haji Baba! Now, take it from me and the abundance of other reviewers and go here."}
{"text":"I have never been disappointed by Haji Baba. THe lamb, chicken, and beef are all incredible, the rice is transcendent. I love the market too,"}
{"text":"Great place, amazing food and great prices. Probably going to be a regular spot for Mediterranean food for moi and the lady...."}
{"text":"The food has been uneven in quality for my taste. Today I got the veggie combo platter. The hummus was just nasty. It came from a mix and was not thoroughly dissolved and tasted dusty. Gross. The falafel were burned, and the pita were hard as rocks. Not great. Sorry I went. I will look for another place that is more consistent."}
{"text":"Anyone that knows me knows I only review places I love. I'm no negative Nancy and I refuse to bring down small businesses for simple mistakes. On that note this will be my first and hopefully only bad review I ever have to give.   Before I get into the bad stuff, I have to say that the only reason I gave this place any stars at all is because of the food. If I was reviewing just the food it would be 4 stars. Its the best middle eastern food I've had here so far and I MIGHT return just because it was so good but I'll definitely be taking it to go and will only cave when I really want some chicken Kabob.   Ok now onto the bad stuff. We were greeted by a waiter that seemed nice enough and he sat us down in the store section. As we waited quite a while to be attended we decided we would get the food to go and maybe just eat a bit at our table ( we were starving) and then finish it at home. So we politely told the waiter we would just order the food at the counter and he nicely agreed it wouldn't be a problem. Once we got our food we opened up our togo boxes and started eating quickly so that we could leave asap. Suddenly another waiter (some Asian guy, seemed like the only Asian worker there) decided to rudefully scold us in front of the other customers for staying to eat there when we had ordered our food to go. I manage a restaurant and I always make sure I don't make the workers life more difficult than need be it so I couldn't understand what he was bothered about. There were no customers waiting for tables (plenty of open tables), they weren't closing yet and we were sitting at the table the original waiter had sat us at to begin with. I honestly saw no reason for the rude scolding we had just received. Due to his terrible attitude we decided to finish our plates there and take our time (yeah I decided to be a B**** after being yelled at by a stranger, sue me) and then he still decided to come back and angrily tell us how they usually close that section earlier to which I replied \"ok\". I didn't want to argue with him but if we had decided to eat there that would have been the table we were GIVEN. So his bad attitude was a load of s**t. After that he kept coming back to that section and mumbling stuff under his breath and staring at us. He was a jerk and should be fired. Like I said, I manage a restaurant so I know what its like to have a bad day and sometimes accidentally let it out on someone. If he had been rude and then apologized for his bad attitude (as I have to customers) I wouldn't even be writing this. But that guy was an as*hole and doesn't deserve to work a job where he has to deal with people. Keep him in the back washing dishes or something. If I were them, I'd consider getting rid of him and hiring someone with some people skills."}
{"text":"This place is super hard to find and you'd never think to eat here unless someone refers you. Well I'm referring you. It is awesome! I haven't had anything I didn't like but there gyro is so good. They give generous portions and it is delicious. Also their feta is amazing."}
{"text":"This is a few tables on the side of a Mediterranean grocery. The food is delivered quick, and is very, very delicious and very reasonably priced. Only reason it is not a 5 star, you have to pay at the counter, and during the lunch rush, it can go 10 people deep, and take forever to get out of there.  Lunch rush is super busy."}
{"text":"Don't let the appearance of this place fool you, they may be part of a grocery store, but they make good stuff.  they have a good chicken sherwama, that is crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  A good appetizer would be the dormades (rice wrapped in grape leaves), followed by the chicken sherwama plate and a cup of their nice and thick turkish coffee.  The plates comes with a generous serving of taboili, hummus, rice and meat.  For the price, its definitely worth a visit.  Can be crowded during lunch times."}
{"text":"Haji-Baba has hands down the best middle eastern food I've ever had in Arizona. I went for the first time about 3 weeks ago and have already been back again. You can't beat the price for how much food they give you. I'm partial to the gyro platter, but I've also tried the chicken shawarma and some of the items on the combo platter, such as the dolmades and falafel. Everything I've had has been amazing. I will be back many, many more times!"}
{"text":"Very good Mediterranean and Middle Eastern food. I had the kibbi with a side of olives. The tzatziki and the orzo side salad were awesome. The hummus wasn't bad, though I think it should be a bit more flavorful. The service wasn't bad, considering this place is inside a grocery store."}
{"text":"The absolute best. My family has been coming to Haji Baba for over 30 years. And I'm gonna keep the tradition going. If any meal I could have on a weekly basis it would be at Haji with the chicken shawarma plate.   Small place but they turn tables fast. The food is always good and consistent.   The grocery store is on point too. If you need spices they are 10 times cheaper than anything you will get in the major grocery chains of the same stuff.   They serve Pepsi and not coke it's refreshing. They always have bottles of sriracha hot sauce on tap and goes well with the food. Again this is a must have on a regular basis.   If you can get in at 11-1130 for lunch right before the rush hits you will be glad you did. Again, they do turn tables fast but it's nice to beat the rush. Always will be back without question."}
{"text":"Friendly wait staff.  Authentic ingredients.  However the shawarma are nothing like I had in Kuwait.  The shish kabob is worth getting.   Basmati rice needs some work.   The market next door is great."}
{"text":"Damn! That's really all I got. The food was so DANM good, I ate here twice in one day. I had the gyro plate twice and my lady had the chicken swarma! For $24 we had two plates and two slices of baklava. $8 for a plate??? I'll never eat a value meal again. F*CK fast food from here on out. Haji's is my new joint!"}
{"text":"Went here a few times- their Kababs are on point!! Our server was nice and friendly and the food came out promptly. We got the Chicken and Lamb Kabab which were tender and delicious.   Also got their Chicken Kabab Sandwich which tasted delish! Loved it!"}
{"text":"I seriously love this place. I am a vegetarian and I love their combo platter. The place lacks all types of atmosphere but who cares? Come for the food and take some baklava to go."}
{"text":"The food here is awesome but be prepared to pay the lamb dish I ordered was delicious but only had 4 medium size pieces of lamb I would say two people dining is going to cost at least50.00 dollars it's a place I will return when I have a craving for indian cuisine ."}
{"text":"Place has an old Arabic architecture, even the aura ( mainly because of the spices)  reminds of Arabian culture. Food is priced reasonably and tasted good.  One thing I noticed that it has no female servers because of conservative Arabian culture."}
{"text":"This place is always near the top of my list of places to dine when I'm visiting my old Arizona stomping grounds.    It's fast, it's healthy, it's cheap, and they have best pita bread around.  They have about 7836487236 different kinds of fresh baklava in their case by the register; I go for the pistachio, but you can't go wrong with any of them.    I always order the chicken kabob with tabouli instead of their regular green salad; their hummus is killer.    The restaurant is half-grocery store and half restaurant (well, more like 1/3 restaurant and 2/3 store), and you can get everything from henna and dry lentils and spices to fresh feta, freshly-baked pita and DVDs.  It's a one-stop Persian shop!    LOVE."}
{"text":"The chicken Shawarma & hummus is great, not to mention the rose water lemonade.  Service was quick, pleasant and made eye contact!!  Great Value and a welcoming environment."}
{"text":"My favorite spot to get hummus!! I love their chicken shawrwarma plate. Served with yogurt, veggies, hummus, lots of delicious roasted chicken, and rice. Their sweets from the bar is superr sweet, but if you have a sweet tooth, you'll love it. Definately one of the most authentic middle eastern food in Tempe. The grocery store attached to the store has lots of great snacks and goodies too."}
{"text":"Hands down one of the most authentic middle eastern shops in tempe. Importing some unique items, and genuine foods. Countless times I've enjoyed lunch, and dinner at this gem.   Must haves include the chicken Sharma, and any of the gyros.   Thank you for providing great food, and service to Tempe."}
{"text":"We decided to pay a visit based on reviews and it was delicious. I really enjoyed the orange spiced tea. We each had a different plate to experience the variety of dishes offered.  The pita and hummus was great and the beef kabob was great. The fact that they had a grocery store attached to the restaurant was also great. I was able to pick up some spices, tea and fresh bread. This was a hidden gem!"}
{"text":"Note that I am rating this place based purely on their supreme/deluxe/whatever gyro, and that I've never actually sat down to eat here, just gotten my food to go. Now that's out of the way: sooooo goooood, and inexpensive compared to some other places that offer gyros!  There's a minimum $5 purchase to run a debit card transaction, so if you don't have any cash, be prepared to buy dessert (poor you!)"}
{"text":"Haji Baba is by far my favorite restaurant!  In fact, I fear ever having to move from my current residence as it might mean I wouldn't be within a 5 mile radius.  The service is friendly and fast, and they always remember my favorite order.  My favorites by far are the Gyros!  I've never found a recipe so flavorful and moist.  I can't recommend this place more.  If you're a fan of Middle-Eastern cuisine, there's no way you can pass up this gem."}
{"text":"This place had the cheapest and best falafil (that is how they spell it) pita of anywhere in town.  The falafel was moist, flavorful the lettuce was fresh and there was a copious amount of sauce to cover it. The pita was a bit thin but that can be over looked. At under $3 it might be worthwhile to get two.   As for the hummous we had on the side, it was a great texture but a bit low on flavor. Make sure you order an extra pita and it comes with just one.   We got the order to go so we did not really have any service to review.    When you first walk in you are assaulted by the smells of many spices and many other alien things to most Americans.   There is an attached small market full of spices, and exotics foods and flavored tobaccos for those under 21 who seek a vice. The counter is full of many types of balaclava and olives.  If you want a great falafel pita at a good price, be brave and stop in. Just leave your Pro Bush / Israel gear in the car."}
{"text":"Delicious! I've consistently had excellent customer service here too. You absolutely can't go wrong with Haji-Baba, especially for the prices! The wait can be hectic when it's busy but the food is worth it."}
{"text":"Great little grocery store that has delicious and tasty food. I love getting the frozen gyro meat and pita bread to go. Get home and cook a terrific gyro plate. All good here!"}
{"text":"Awful, dried out and flavorless shawarma meat. I'm not sure where these 5 star reviews are from...can't be from anyone who's eaten real Mediterranean. Save your $ and go elsewhere."}
{"text":"Gyros Sandwich under $4, that's my kind of a meal. I think it was a beef and lamb combo with lettuce and yummy tzatziki sauce, wrapped in scrumptious pita bread. I also ordered the hummus, which was $2.50 - not worth it in my opinion. I think the flavored hummus at grocery stores taste better and it'll be less expensive too. Haji-Baba is definitely a hole in the wall, with little fruit flies and flies buzzing around, but the taste is great, and the price is fair.  Note: If you want to eat at the restaurant, just have a seat at any table on the right hand side and a waiter will come with menus and take your order. If you want to take it to go, then go straight to the register and they'll take care of you.  After you finish eating at the restaurant, bring that little receipt stub left at your table to the cash register, and they'll ring you up. :)"}
{"text":"Ahhhh Yeahhhhh...   Best Mediterranean I've had in AZ. Chicken Shawarma, Gyro, Humas, Tabouli, Falafel... All Amazing.   When you first walk in you don't know what to expect. Don't let that dissuade you. It's part Mediterranean market, part restaurant. Very much a bodega. I usually just odder takeout, but they have a sit down restaurant as well."}
{"text":"You better come hungry because they pile on the food!  I never thought I'd like middle eastern food, but wanted to try something different from the daily chicken sandwich and burgers, and OMG!!!   Come and get the chicken schwerma. I just have never had anything like it.   The location is great but as you walk in you're going to wonder if you're in the right place.   True hole in the wall gold mine!!"}
{"text":"I love gyros and this place has some of the best around. But what's even better than the quality of these great gyros is the price! I have eaten here numerous times over the years and the prices have barley changed. They specialize in Mediterranean food so they have a lot to offer in the even that you'd rather have something different. Wonderful people and a wonderful place.  This one is a for sure place to try!!"}
{"text":"My previous review still stands, though now I'm pretty much all about the Chicken Schwarma \"Sandwich\". I even got scolded once for calling it a \"Chicken Schwarma Gyro\". Since I'm all for delicious, cheap food with a side of cultural sensitivity lessons, 5 stars!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. A awesome hole in the wall joint. Chicken swarma is excellent."}
{"text":"The place looks like a hole in the wall from the outside but the food is Fabulous! I love the Tambuli salad and chicken skewers, jasmine rice! The store has great things to buy like Teas and cookies! Very clean."}
{"text":"The Chicken Shawarma plate is the best around and my favorite. Their humus is excellent too. I've compared their food to other middle eastern restaurants in NM & CA. I was introduced to this place back in the late 1990s and having going since my ASU days. I now live 400 miles and when I come to town I will always eat here every time and sometimes twice. Over the years I recommend and brought friends or family along. The price is reasonable and their service has been quick and friendly!"}
{"text":"The reviews are correct-there's sum great Mediterranean food to be had here. The gyros, feta cheese & hummus is great. Next tym I'll try the chicken Schwarma everyone Raves about. Super busy store so don't freak out if your high maintenance, try n go w the flow....."}
{"text":"I came to Arizona with my friends for the weekend to attend some Dodgers spring training activities and we found this little hole in the wall on Yelp. We decided to try it because the pictures of the food looked promising.   At first sight of the restaurant, we were surprised because it was a restaurant / grocery store hybrid. We found it interesting but were intrigued.   The chicken shawarma plate for $9 was delicious and filling. The chicken had a lot of flavor, the pita bread was warm, and the garlic sauce was strong, just the way I prefer any garlic sauce. The tangy tabouli and moist rice were good complements to the meal as well.  Also, our waiter was very friendly and accommodating! You go up to the register at the end of the meal to individually pay for your food which makes it convenient and easy to dutch pay when youre with friends.   I definitely recommend this place!"}
{"text":"The food was fine, but worst customer service. We sat there for 10 min until someone paid attention to us. People after us were served. First come first served doesn't work there. They can't track who came first. The servers were very rude too."}
{"text":"The Haj is a dope spot.  You can shop here and eat.  It's very very affordable.  I like to hit it up for lunch when I'm short on ends.  They use the bomb feta, which you can buy in a tin.   It's Veg friendly, and their Gyros are good.  Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Excellent chicken schwarma plate. Large portions and cheap price with friendly service."}
{"text":"This is the only place my family and I will even go for middle eastern food. I live 20 minutes away and it's worth the drive. They give you large portions and it's reasonably priced."}
{"text":"We ordered two shish kabobs and asked that it not be burned or dried out LAMB. What do you think they served us? Burned and dried out LAMB! We asked the waiter did he forget he said the meat is fine. Then he called the cook out to talk to us. He told us to order it MEDIUM RARE next time. They said, they would make one LAMB kabob not two, even though both our  shish kabobs were burned and dried out LAMB. They brought us one Lamb stick. When we went to pay the bill at the cashier they charged us for 3 shish kabobs! I don't recommend this place since they ONLY KNOW how to burn and kill the meat 3 times then charge us EXTRA for their mistakes. BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD, BAD,!"}
{"text":"You haven't been to Haji's?    What's wrong with you!   Don't look at the menu,  just get the Gyros DLX and whatever you feel like drinking.     Look at the negative reviews here, notice a trend?   They didn't get the Gyros DLX.     Yeah.    This place gets 0 stars for the chicken shawerma (eh, shawerma sucks anywhere),  3 stars for whatever else,  and 84 stars for their gyros."}
{"text":"Best Chicken Shewarma Plate ever! I don't live in AZ anymore but this is my first stop every time I get back home. Just amazing value for the affordable price! The chicken is always cooked perfectly, it's a must try, even for people who don't typically enjoy Mediterranean food!"}
{"text":"I want to give this place 3.5 stars. Four for food and three for atmosphere.   The space is a awkward (one shared bathroom?), and the check out system is nuts and leads to crazy lines. I can only imagine how frustrating it gets during week day lunch rush... But, the food was very good. I had a chicken shawarma platter and it came with a great amount of food. My dining companion had the greek salad, which was generously feta'd. The pita was warm and the rose water lemonade was fantastic. That said, the server was great and you can buy some crazy groceries on your way out."}
{"text":"OMG This place is more of knick knacks and pulses and Indo afghani spices, pulses and etc. Also on right corner they have little corner ( Not very little ) cafe where you are served food. I ordered Falafel $ 2.99. It came with 3 Falafels with Lettuce and Tomatoes and some sort of curd mix to Grip Lettuce and tomatoes and 2 Pita's . FAlafel is made of fava and garbanzo grounded with spices and deep fried balls.Totally Worth it. It's not spicy at all. So you can add Hot Sauce , Black pepper- available as condiments. Trust me Its more Like Gyrco .The only difference is it comes as wrap when you order and has meat in it. However falafel comes Pita that you can wrap in lettuce, tomatoes and 1 and half falafel for I Pita and Hot sauce and pich of Black Pepper. On the other end Gyro is $ 3.99 I guess. So $2.99 Is inexpensive and when you are veggie eater. Go for Falafel. I had 2 comrades, 1 ordered Gyro, 2nd  ordered Fava Beans and Basmati Rice. it is high quality (Long Grained Rice_ It looks like it is Zafrani for sure. It was in large portions.. It was something $ 3.49 or $3.99.   Almost all things they serve have large portions..and quiet reasonable You feel full when you eat there.Good Mediterranean Food with Large Portions.  Also they have fresh Feta Chese at $ 4.40 approx per pound. Not bad at all. I am to try try that when i head there again. I will post pictures when i go again. I had no battery to take pictures.  Alright Folks Have a great weekend. Bye for now. TC  Sundays They open at 11 A.M."}
{"text":"I get cheap food that's good at the time then you feel like death later.  Haji-baba has cheap food, insanely cheap food, food so cheap you would debate eating there due to the cheapness but have no choice but to give it a shot because.. ITS SO CHEAP.  The quality of the food at Haji-Baba is parallel to high end middle eastern restaurants, its FANTASTIC.  The chicken shawarma wrap I ordered was 3 dollars and change, the size of a glove box ( exaggerating but its BIG) and incredibly delicious!  I cannot recommend this place enough so good, so delicious and the price doesn't factor into the quality at all!  Go here and love it!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem. The food is amazing. It's cheap. The service is good. My favorite part? The place never changes. I can walk through the door and Ali already knows my order. The Chicken Shawarma special comes with their hand-made pita - so soft and delicious. The chicken is seasoned perfectly and comes with a yummy little dollop of garlic sauce. I've never found better hummus in my life. I've had it all around town, in New York, in L.A. (ick...L.A. *shudder*). SO good! The iced tea has a hint of rose water. OH and the gyro? Hands down, the best in town.  Did I mention they have a market attached? Talk about the best price on spices in town! The spices come in little plastic sealed pillows, so get some spice jars from Ikea and stock up!  I couldn't get through this without mentioning the lamb tongue. I am no connoisseur of organ meats, but this sandwich is like the most tender lamb you've ever had in your life. Shut up and try it.  The only sad part about Haji's is that they close early. Usually 8pm on a week-night, but totally worth getting to-go orders if you can swing in on your way home from work!"}
{"text":"Chkn Sharma plate and Greek salad with a side of gyro were good. Fast and friendly service. Any place attached to a market is a plus. Reasonable prices and simple decore. Large portions"}
{"text":"I discovered Haji-Baba in 2001 on a recommendation from the waitress at a middle eastern restaurant in Ahwatukee. I've been a regular customer since. The food is delicious! You can shop for amazing food items in the attached grocery store. I recommend the Kibbe!"}
{"text":"We like this place. Market on one side (the smells of spices when you walk in... yum), little tables for the cafe on the other. We went on Valentine's Day - it was 8pm and PACKED. A line of waiting people. They did their best to accommodate everyone and get food out as fast as they could.   Food was great. Service really good.   It's tucked away, and the tram tracks make it a bit hard to get to now, if you haven't been there and are coming from the 101.   One downside - I used to LOVE their hummus - now I find that there's a better-tasting hummus in the Valley. (I will not name that place in this review - have had the Yelp Gestapo pull my reviews for \"reviewing 2 places in 1 review, violating TOS. Please imagine my huge eyeroll inserted here.)"}
{"text":"I always prder the chicken shawarma sandwich. Closest thing to what i had as a child back when i lived in Saudi Arabia"}
{"text":"Haji-Baba's hummus is the quickest way to my heart. It is also, without question, the best hummus I have ever had. Everyone I have ever brought here agrees. It is worth making the drive from Tucson on its own.  But that is not all thats fantastic about this place. The gyros here are incredible. I prefer mine deluxe which includes their home-made feta cheese, which is also just incredible. Its not as salty as most feta cheeses are, and its a bit more creamy as well. So in other words, its better than most feta cheeses by miles.  The chicken schwarma is also one of my favorites. When I bring someone, I encourage that we each order one or the other and then split them so we each get half of two amazing pita sandwiches. Other favorites of mine include the baba ganouch, the chicken salad, the fallafel, and the rose water lemonade. Ahh, soooo refreshing.  The sandwiches especially are extremely inexpensive and worth every penny, but everything is pretty well priced. The market inside is a great place to buy spices on the cheap and one of the best places to get things like adjvar and middle eastern breads. Fresh made baklava is also a \"dont-miss-it\" item.   Honestly, I've been coming here since I was a little kid and there are not enough good things I can say about this place. Everyone in-the-know knows about this place. So be an upstanding, knowledgeable, productive member of society and find yourself here."}
{"text":"Now on my third time eating here since I found it a few weeks back and everything is amazing. I a big fan of homemade middle eastern food an have been spoiled with it because family and friends would make it (my grandpa made hummus, tabouli and falafel). this place does it right. I have tried the gyro, kifta, hummus, tabouli and more and it has all been great.   My true judge of a mid-eastern place is the hummus since I love it and have been making my own for as long as I can remember. This stuff is great right combo of flavors and good bread to boot. My only knock is it's a but creamier than I like and a bit less garlic(but I love super extra garlic so I can't hold that against them). Overall it's just right and I will devour it.   The meats are all flavorful and moist (especially rare with most other gyros). The tabouli is a nice mix of greens and wheat with a ton of fresh flavors.  Plain in simple if you like mid-eastern food go here you won't regret it. Try the combination meal and get a bit of all the good stuff."}
{"text":"My favorite Middle Eastern food in Phoenix.  Chicken kabobs are the best!"}
{"text":"Great food. Hummus is absolutely amazing. At first, location seems kinda odd but it's pretty perfect. Love this place."}
{"text":"The best Lamb Kebabs in town.  Super attentive staff and a huge selection of Baklava!!!  Make sure you try the salad dressing too.  A must stop in central Tempe.  Don't forget the Turkish coffee!!"}
{"text":"Haji-Baba was recently profiled on the television show \"CHECK PLEASE ARIZONA\" and after the great reviews they got on the tv, we had to try it. This was our BEST \"check please\" experience to date!  THE FOOD: make plans to go more than once, because even with the combination plates, you'll want to go back again and again until you've tasted it all! Yes, yes, the Chicken Shawerma is ah-may-zing! And yes, the portion sizes are very big (most folks leave with to-go boxes, but it's also hard not to over-order with such tasty offerings all over the menu). But the combination plates, in my opinion, are the way to go. It's not just a little bit of this and that... it's a full serving of this and that, and everything is so delicious, you'll be amazed with every bit. From the warm, delicious stuffed grape leaves to the hummous to the kebabs to, well, everything!  THE DRINKS: I have to mention this briefly... I'm an iced tea fan and the tea here is wonderful. They are always so busy, I haven't slowed someone down to ask what the slightly sweet flavor is, but it's the tea itself, not a sweetener. Yum!  THE SHOP: the building is 2/3 restaurant, 1/3 store... don't forget to pick up some truly fantastic baklava and/or turkish delight at the back counter register when you pay after your meal... it may be the best sweet treats you've ever had.  WHEN TO GO: they get busy and you may have to wait a few minutes, but because they are also a store, you can browse the aisles for european/asian cookies and tea and such while you're waiting... and its all worth the wait. so really, it isn't when to go, it's why haven't you already? the chefs in the kitchen are masterful and the staff will make you feel right at home... and, of course, it's likely to be some of the best food you've ever had!"}
{"text":"a restaurant that's INSIDE a grocery store that sells middle eastern fair   the plates have TONS of food, i couldn't even finish half! i guess it's perfect if you like leftovers but i think i'll just stick with a sandwich next time --chicken schwarma: comes w/ hummus, pita bread, rice & tabouli salad...chicken was served w/ a garlic sauce that was very yummy but i wish the sauce was on the side because it drowned the chicken --gyro plate: yummy gyro! comes w/ iceberg lettuce salad, pita bread, & rice   NOTE: i appreciate their toasting of the pita bread  friendly service & portions that make it a bang for your buck!"}
{"text":"My local Fry's ditched a certain brand of kouskous that I was comfortable using. They replaced it with a brand that is $8. Too much! So I found a similar size at Haji-Baba and it's half the price of my former brand, only $2.50. I can live with that.   Also, I finally tried Turkish delight, which they stock by the front counter. When I paid my restaurant bill, I'd always sneak a glance at it. They raised the price to $7.50 a box but it's still okay. Turkish delight is gooey and reminiscent of jujubees. The taste does grow on you."}
{"text":"When it comes to middle eastern food in the Phoenix area, you will not get more value anywhere else but here. The quality and quantity you get per dollar is simply unmatched.  This is definitely my favorite gyro joint, and one of my favorite all around restaurants.  Get the hummus, be sure to specifically ask for the home made pita, it's always perfect. If you get gyros, go big, get the Gyros DLX. It includes feta (a whole lot) and more meat. It's fucking great.  The atmosphere is very \"hole in the wall\" but that can be a good thing I think. The people who work there are friendly and very good at \"reading\" their customers. You never get over or under served, no matter your mood or who you're with.  If you're visiting town, stop by Haji. If you live here, why haven't you gone already? If you have, why aren't you going there now?"}
{"text":"I love Haji-Baba more than words can say. The food is cheap and delicous. Their iced tea is AMAZING (the best I've ever had, and I only drink iced tea and water 99% of the time)! The hummus is to die for. The pitas they make in house are fresh and delicious.   I have yet to find a place as yummy as this anywhere else in the Phoenix area (or even in Seattle where I live now), and the low prices make it that much more awesome!"}
{"text":"we used to love eating here .we are from Phoenix and every time when we're around that area we would eat at haji baba.i feel that the quality is not the same anymore ,our last two times we ate there :once the chicken from the shawarma was pretty dry and occasionally burnt and second time the pita was all burnt on one side and I've got the falafel witch I used to love and I couldn't eat it..it was very weird like undone or I don't know how to explain it .the order was to go or I would've said something ..I hope our next time would be better .i can say that they have nice people working there and nice service"}
{"text":"I've never had anything I didn't like from here. Amazing rice and salad and the chicken kabob plate is my favorite. Very good prices as well. Only complaint is that they don't deliver. It would be awesome to be able to order Haji Baba from Postmates or GrubHub!"}
{"text":"We enjoy coming here for lunch. The food is fresh and delicious. Plus the market area has all the spices we need. Plus we try new things all the time."}
{"text":"Love this place! Love the chicken plate. Their Hummus is on point! Great customer service."}
{"text":"My first time here was great! I ordered the chicken salad, which was a lot bigger than I expected it to be and tasted delicious. I've noticed a lot of reviewers complaining about the atmosphere- the restaurant is situated inside of a Middle Eastern grocery store, which I actually thought was pretty cool. It's a smaller place with not too much seating, but I liked its charm. I'll be back again! Tip- if you like baklava, they have plenty of different kinds here :)"}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! The food is amazing and priced decent. The people are always friendly and its never too loud, although they have a busy lunch rush don't let that scare you, definitely worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Wow, delicious, inexpensive Mediterranean cafe attached to a great Middle Eastern grocery store!  Thanks so much to Kat K for the good lead!  The food is super inexpensive, and everything was not only delicious, but super authentic!!  My husband and I ordered the olives (delicious and multi-colored), yummy humus (and I'm quite picky about humus), tabouli salad and two felafel wraps.  The portions are not enormous, so we were able to try all of this and finish most of it without needing to be wheeled out.  This is hands down the best felafel we've had - crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, full of flavor but not at all greasy.  The hummus has wonderful texture and taste (I'm picky about hummus), the pita bread is fresh and soft, the olives are flavorful (not too dry or too oily, multicolored), and the tabouli salad is some of the best I've had (chopped perfectly with a little couscous and flavors - delish).   The little cafe is super low-key and has cute murals on the walls, and the service is friendly and quick.  After lunch, we picked up some locally baked lavosh bread and some chocolate bars, and out total, uncluding lunch, was still just under $20!  We can't wait to come back!!"}
{"text":"Ever since I tried kebabs whilst visiting the UK 10 yrs ago, I've been on a quest to recreate the experience. Tonight, I finally did. My shish kebab plate tonight was wonderful. Slightly medium rare and not a trace of fat or gristle, perfectly seasoned and melt in my mouth tender. I could have done with a little less rice and a little more pita, but I couldn't have asked for more flavor. We started with the kibbee and sanbusek as appetizers. Both were delightful. I also decided to try the Arabic-style coffee (yum!) and baklava (so many kinds to choose from!) for desert. It couldn't have been more delicious :)  The service was positively perfect, unobtrusive, but we didn't wait for anything, and he never made us feel rushed, even though we were the last people in there.   We will definitely be back :)"}
{"text":"Old is gold and you need no reviews just go sit and eat ....simple and traditional and yeah the eBay Mediterranean food......"}
{"text":"My aunt and all my cousins love coming here and it's no wonder why. Visiting for xmas vacation, my aunt showed my mom and my family this spot the first day we arrived. I didn't go but my mom craved this place during our trip and went back a second time-this time with me.  So basically it's a store with a small kind-of restaurant inside. Serves middle eastern food, I am leaning towards more greek because of grape leaves and the gyros..  Anyhoo, I had a gyro which is lamb, a yogurt sauce, tomatoes and lettuce in a pita type bread. I absolutley cannot stand lamb, I refuse to eat it not because of the taste but...it's a lamb...a fuzzy cute...anyways...  YES I broke down and ate it. I was super starving and it didn't really taste like how I remembered when I first tried lamb...it was really good. My aunt had a veggie platter and everyone also had a gyro and my sister had a gyro platter.  I will come back here again when we visit the family, I think it is probably a staple and as for the lamb...probably the only time I will ever eat it, if it's in a gyro at Haji-Baba."}
{"text":"Cheap is good...not always, but in this case, it is.  Sketchy atmosphere, but come here for the food.  Go to the counter to order take-out, sit in the dining room for service.  Service is kind of slow.  That's just how it is.  My wife ordered baba ganouj and the chicken shawerma platter.  Very good baba ganouj, smokey, mellow, creamy.  Chicken shawerma is very good, tasty, tender, moist, with garlic sauce on the side.  Tabooli is good, although I'm not a fan.  Rice is quite good, as is the hommos (their spelling).    I had the Foul (fava beans), which were quite good, and the Kabab Mixed, which included a chicken kabab, beef koubideh, and shish kabab, hommos, tabouli, but no rice. The chicken was the best of the bunch, good char, tender, moist  The shish kabab was overdone in my opinion, but still tender.  The koubideh, I could pass on.  The pita comes hot, and slightly crispy.  Wonderful!  Grabbed a chicken shawerma and hommos to go, on our way out of town."}
{"text":"Don't take my review for granted if you are a meat lover. Yet another try to embrace Mediterranean. Nah..I ain't impressed. Despite several tries, I totally agree that Mediterranean is not for me. Had only 1 option to eat..lol  Ordered - veggie Combo: apparently tasted good though. The grape leaves wrap was the best on the plate. Hummus was eggplant based and tasted 3/5. Tamarino Juice : I got to try this for first time in USA. Impressive taste.   Overall, decent lowkey ambience. No music, quick service."}
{"text":"Well I guess I'm going to be in the minority here and say that I was somewhat disappointed.  Not too much, but a little.  It is ridiculously inexpensive, and for the money, I thought the food was decent.  We started with the homus.  I didn't think it was great, but it was okay.  The pita bread it was served with was nothing special, similar to the pita pockets from any supermarket.  The Arabic bread my lunch was served with was much better, a soft flat bread.  I had the chicken shawarma plate which was served with rice and tabouli.  The tabouli was very good, although I don't much care for tabouli in general...or rice.  So I'm not sure why I ordered the plate instead of the sandwich.  Maybe I just wanted to see more food on my plate.  That sounds like me.  The flavor of the shawarma was good, but I was really disappointed in the chicken.  It was everything from larger chunks of meat to itty bitty little scraps, mostly scraps.  But again, dirt cheap so you can only complain so much.  We also browsed in the grocery part and picked up some packaged goodies and 2 pieces of baklava.  Probably some of the best baklava I have had!  They were out of the pecan variety, but there was also almond, pistachio, and cashew to choose from.  It was something crazy like a buck a piece.  Overall, I'm glad we went, and I would go again.  But I don't know I would go out of my way unless their dinner menu is different than the lunch menu, or I was seeking out the baklava."}
{"text":"Chicken shawarma sandwich, no veggies. I never feel a need to order anything else. If it's not broke, why fix it?  -------------------------------------------------------------------------  Anyone who's in the know, visits Haji-Baba on a regular basis.  Service has always been phenomenal, despite being quite busy at times."}
{"text":"Always great and fast! Service is always top notch. Beware of big crowds during lunch."}
{"text":"This is a little \"hole in the wall\" gem in Tempe. We eat here about twice a month and I never leave disappointed. Not fancy, but fun atmosphere. They have cool things to look at in the market. I always enjoy taking people here for the first time. If your in the area, check it out !"}
{"text":"Two words. Falafel sandwich.  To die for.  In fact, if I ever wanted to commit suicide it would be death by Haji Baba's falafel sandwich to insure that I would die happy.    Also, when they say pomegranate juice, they are NOT FOOLING AROUND."}
{"text":"It's my favorite place to eat in arizona.    The chicken shawarma is the best.  The only thing you need to eat is the chicken shawarma plate.  My husband and I are addicted.   From the second we go in there they are already putting in our order.  That's how much love this place."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place in the valley.  Been going for over 15 years.  It is far away enough from my home I can't go so much I get tired of it.  But the chicken kabob, salad and rice are amazing.  Simple but delicious.  Ask for the soft pita and humus before hand.  If you don't you will get ok bread but ask for the soft stuff and be amazed. You can also order food from their market.  The people on staff are amazing."}
{"text":"My best friend highly recommended this place.  He usually does not have the best recommendations, so I yelped it first.  I saw the reviews, so we ventured on over.  He had the Chicken Shawerma and I had the Chicken Shawerma Plate.  We also ordered hummus.  I suggest you do not do this if you had ordered a plate meal like I did.  The hummus order was huge, and then my plate come out with another huge dollop of hummus on it.  I was hummused out.   Everything was so flavorful! And the price is amazingly low for what you get.  Honeslty just 2 Chicken Shawerma (no plate) and a side of hummus is the way to go.  Lunch will be less then 15 bucks.  I can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Well, I have to say walking in the door with the trash overflowing was not very appetizing. I really really enjoy the food here, and love the people. I shopped for groceries while I wait for my food, and I am never disappointed in the gyro."}
{"text":"Recently I received word that my favorite Middle Eastern restaurant Alladin's Kitchen closed its doors. This was, at least for me, the best place to get your Mediterranean fix including some of the tastiest stuffed grape leaves around. I can go on and on about how much I loved Alladin's but alas, I have to pick myself up and rise above this terrible loss.   When a door closes a window opens and that window lead me right into the kitchen of Haji Baba. Situated along Apache Blvd in Tempe this spot is half restaurant and half Middle Eastern market and bakery, talk about a one stop shop. Upon entering, please feel free to seat yourself. On my visit there were menus already at each empty table.   Scanning the menu the first thing I noticed was the Abali Yogurt Soda ($1.69). Having never tried this I was quick to get a glass full though the waiter seemed hesitant to bring it. Let's just say after the first sip yogurt soda is an acquired taste. While I liked the yogurt sourness the saltiness of the soda was way too much. Fortunately the waiter was observant and brought over a glass of iced water by his own accord. I have to tell you that the service here is attentive and friendly.   The occasional juvenile in me snickered when I read the first item on the menu, Homos Tahini ($2.29), how appropriate. Joking aside, this was a beautiful puree of chickpeas, tahini or sesame seed paste, lemon juice and garlic. Usually this is served super garlicky elsewhere I was delighted to find this version to be well balanced and flavorful. Getting the same treatment as the homos, the Babaghanooj ($2.99) contains roasted eggplant instead of chickpeas. Both were dressed with olive oil and adorned with pickles and olives, were wishing for a glass of wine to compliment the appetizers, but they serve no liquor here.  Made from a mixture of fava beans and chickpeas, then pressed into patties and deep fried, the filling of the Falafil Sandwich ($2.69) was crunchy on the outside, creamy on the inside. The warm pita bread and the fresh lettuce and tomato made for really good eats, a must.  Kabob Koubideh ($7.49) sounds like quite a mouthful and let me tell you this, it was. Pounded ground meat marinated in onion juice, and then grilled to a juicy smoky excellence. The meat reminded me of a Middle Eastern take on chopped steak, sublimely tender. Along side was a huge pile of super light basmati rice, fresh hot pita and creamy yogurt salad. A sprinkling of sumac over the entire plate adds a slight sourness, which melds incredibly well with this type of food.   Desserts are pretty much limited to Baklava ($1.29), but after such an amazing meal it was a real surprise that the sweet ending was a real disappointment. The nuts in each all tasted old with a slightly bitter rancidity to them. Selections ranged from pistachio, cashew and walnut with the later being the best, using the word \"best\" loosely.   With meager prices, generous portions and outstanding service, Haji Baba will definitely begin to fill the void in my heart and my tummy."}
{"text":"Decent Food at Great Prices   This was my first trip into Haji Baba and I found it thanks to Yelp reviews of this hidden spot. You really could miss this place like me for years as the sign is not stand out at all.   The chicken Shawarma wraps were good, not mind blowing though but for $4.99 it's a good deal and tastes decent. They didn't serve it with the thick garlic sauce like most places though....   All in all it's a decent spot when you need a good deal on a meal..."}
{"text":"Not bad but I have had lots better. The garlic sauce is mayo based, the pita is weird, my husband wasn't in love with the gyros, and everything other than the chicken could have used more flavor, including the hummus. Service was not great - very slow and I had to ask for a spoon about 3 times. Worst of all, this place should be called the dirty baba. The floor under our table was DISGUSTING, like something had been spilled a week ago and never mopped up. Still better than other middle eastern spots I have had so far but then keep in mind I am from Detroit where the middle eastern food is top notch. Nothing here comes close, or hasn't yet."}
{"text":"Go to spot for authentic Middle Eastern eats, this place never ever disappoints!!!  It's very very casual and perfect for a quick lunch.    They've been here for about 30+ years I believe since 1981 !! That's awesome !! I remember this place when I was a kid.  My grandfather lives 2 minutes from here, so anytime I visit & I'm in the mood for some bomb ass food this is where I come.    It's 1/2 cafe & 1/2 market.  You immediately smell deliciousness when you walk in!  all the staff are friendly and more than willing to help out with suggestions on the dishes!!   You can totally tell that all the ingredients are of high quality & very fresh !! The hummus is amazing with the perfect texture and balance of acidity ( not to much lemon ) they sure do give you plenty. It comes with a pickle on top and one olive.   Sandwiches range from $3.49-$5.99   Plates come with Basmati rice & salad, they range from $7.99-9.99  The only thing that could be better about this place is the napkins & plastic ware.  The napkins are the so flimsy it rips so easily even with gentle use.  But its all good !! just use double the napkins and you'll be ok.    Scale of 1-10 this place is a solid 9   ENJOY FELLOW YELPERS"}
{"text":"Great platters for everyone, easy on the pocket, nice grocery store attached! on my favs !!"}
{"text":"Awesome food. Highly recommend. Had gyros platter . Generous portions and excellent meat.  Check out their spices and other food stuff. Got couscous very cheap."}
{"text":"Still great food, but prices have gone up considerably. Used to be college student friendly pricing. Now the prices are on par with all the other middle eaten restaurants in the Valley. This is sad to me because I frequented this place weekly in college for the great food and even better prices!  Still worth checking out if your in the area and in the mood for good middle east food."}
{"text":"I really do enjoy the food here all the ingredients tastes very fresh and it's never that busy. So it makes it easy to stop by for a quick lunch that's price for a modestly and expected to be quick in the service to be good.  And how they recommend checking it out and getting falafel or any of the Mediterranean salads. Also stop by the grocery store nearby and try some new ingredients or dishes that you haven't before. I don't think you'll be mistaken :-)"}
{"text":"Luv this place!!!! Have been coming here for over 15 years! I live in Laveen and me and my family still make at least a monthly trip to eat here!!! The humus is really good. Only place that serves it with a pickle and a calamata olive! Yum! The greek salad is very filling with chunks of feta cheese! Not crumbles! My daughter always gets the chicken kabob plate and leaves no crumbs! Mom enjoys the hot tea with the lamb plate.  Casual atmosphere and prices are good. Highly recommend this place!!! The grocery store is great. Always take some feta cheese, pita's and dates for future meals at home."}
{"text":"I love this hidden diamond in the rough.  It's been around for over 20 yrs. There's the Tempe Firehouse across the street and a new apartment complex in construction off Apache and Elm.  I love the chicken schwerma plate and sandwich like everyone else who commented.  So much so, I bought the spice they sell in their grocery side of the building.  They do it so much better.    It's always packed during lunch time.  I work close by  and find that it is just as fast to go there and order my chicken schwerma sandwich to go, without a call in,  as it does for Jimmy John's sandwich to arrive, which is only half a mile away.  Haji-Baba wins, hands down the better sandwich and better price of $3.89.  This is usually true if there are not people waititng in line to pay for their shopping cart full of groceries.  How does that happen?  The aisles barely fit 2 people in it.   Anyways, if you've never tried it, you're in for real treat.  It is also a great place to buy spices, olive oil, lemon juice and try new things."}
{"text":"Love, Love, Love this place! Authentic middle eastern food and it is dirt cheap. Our family of 3 always eats for less than $20.  My favorite is the gyro delux sandwich, the feta is fresha nd sharp and there is a TON of it on the sandwich. The labne is usually made fresh every day except sunday. The homeade pita bread is warm and fluffy. There was one time we ordered chicken and it wasn't cooked all the way through so that would be my only gripe about this place. This isn't an upscale scottsdale d-bag place, this is a simple, fast, and friendly place to get your grub on."}
{"text":"Friendly staff and delicious food. We practically have tried everything on menu and is delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is a fantastic, hole-in-the-wall sort of place.  I LOVE their schawarma and falafel sandwiches.  This is my go-to place for lunch because I just work a mile down the street.   They guys that work the registers are friendly and the food is delicious.  I've never sat down at the restraunt side.  For To-Go, just walk to the back of the market and order at the register."}
{"text":"My uncle, 2 cousins, my partner, her 2 boys and myself all decided to try this place out a couple weeks ago for dinner. Most of us are very familiar with Middle Eastern food so we had a pretty good idea of what to get and how things should taste.   First, it's a small place, with tables sort of thrown into an add-on to a Mid-Eastern market, so larger parties may have an issue getting seated right away. It took them almost 20 minutes to seat us, but that's not entirely their fault. I mean, you have to work with what you've got, right? Just be prepared to wait if there's more than, say, 5 or so in your group.  The market is kind of nifty, so take the time to browse if you get there and are waiting for a table or for people to show up. Lots of spices, and you can ogle the half dozen different types of baklava they have up front. Yes, I said half a dozen. Pistachio, walnut, pecan, almond, and a couple others. They also have Bulgarian feta, which I haven't had since I left Bangkok, and I highly recommend if you're a fan of Greek feta. I'll be going back for a nice big chunk, this I can promise you.   Now the food: My partner's two boys are two of the pickiest eaters I know, so we got them the chicken kebab sandwich. I didn't get to try it, but they both finished their plates, so I'll take that as a positive testimonial. My partner and I shared a variety of things: gyros, kebab, chicken shwarema, rice, hummus (which on the menu is spelled \"homos,\" much to the amusement of the kids), and tabouli, with homemade pita bread. My cousins both got the veggie platters and I honestly don't remember what my uncle got. :) The gyros and kebab were phenomenal, extremely flavourful, and the gyros was the best I'd had in a long time. I think the chicken shwarama was my favourite though. It almost melts in your mouth and the flavours are fantastic. The hummus was very good, especially with the homemade pita. (Definitely pay the extra for the \"real\" stuff. Store bought just doesn't cut it here.) I'm not really a huge fan of tabouli, but my partner seemed to like it well enough. One great little surprise for me were the dolmas (stuffed grape leaves). A traditional Greek dish, I'm never really a fan. My dad makes these by the bucketful and freezes them. Usually, for me, they tend to be bitter and too bland, but I got to try one off of one of the veggie plates and it was actually REALLY good. I honestly think it may have been the best dolmades I've ever had. So I'd recommend it.   To drink I took a risk and got the yogurt soda. Anyone familiar with Indian food will most likely have tried lassi at one point of another.... this is NOT lassi. This is definitely an acquired taste, but if you want to try something different, give it a shot. It is literally plain, unsweetened yogurt with soda water. No one else at my table liked it, but I thought it was different and in its own way, rather refreshing.   We shared the pistachio and pecan baklava at the end of the meal. Fresh, homemade and soooooo good!   I have lots of reasons to go back, one of which would be the bill at the end of the night. Keep in mind, there were 4 of us on our tab, 2 kebab sandwiches, 3 drinks, my yogurt soda, the chicken shwarama plate, a kebab, a gyros and 2 baklava and it all came up to about $35. You really can't beat that."}
{"text":"Tried the plates in Gyro, koobideh, and chicken shawarma and side of beef shawarma. Quantity is abundant!! Had so much leftovers seemed like we didnt even touch it! Flavor was delicious~  i am not an expert on authenticity but regardless, it was very yummy~ I would definitively return here!!! Tabouli, hummus,  garlic sauce, the yogurty- sauce for the koobideh all were really good too! The counter men were super friendly!"}
{"text":"Yum... Need I say more! Normally my wife and I split a meal but at Haji Baba we don't because it's more fun to share! Not the typical type of food found in the valley a real hidden gem. What it lacks in the decor and atmosphere it makes up for in flavor and price... I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Really amazing food and reasonably priced. Would highly recommend to people. The food arrived quickly and the staff was very efficient. The plates are such a great deal and there's so much food. Will be going here more often."}
{"text":"A true diamond in the rough! I was very impressed by this restaurant, and also surprised that I had never even seen it. I'm not sure if the complex is new but its pretty well camouflaged.   The food was VERY good. It came out in large portions and very quickly. They offer the usual Mediterranean fare, I ordered the Gyro plate, Georgeann G had the lamb tongue sandwich, and we each also had a stuffed grape leaf. The stuffed grape leaves we served hot (which was a first) but they were HUGE compared to others I've had. The Meat was cooked to perfection (the lamb tongue was surprisingly very tasty) and the sides were freshly prepared as well.   Words of advice: go with the sandwich instead of a plate. The plate came with about 2 pounds of rice that was completely not needed (and the total price would've been much less if ordered separately). If you still want more, add a side salad or something.  The prices were very good and the service was nothing to complain about. It was hard to resist the baklava by the register, and we ended up taking a piece of cashew baklava to go (which was heavenly).   I'm glad I've had a chance to check this place out, and I will definitely go back."}
{"text":"Sweet fancy Moses this place is delicious!  Very authentic middle-eastern fare with nice friendly service.  I had the Combination Combination, gyros, dolmas, tabouli, falafel, etc....all the good stuff you would expect when ordering this kind of food.  It was all fantastic and for all this food it was only $11.99!    Highly recommended spot in a strip mall, where apparently all good restaurants in Phoenix are located..."}
{"text":"Absolute favorite place to eat in Tempe. Great prices and very good food. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Great food and fast but don't try the pomegranate juice if you haven't had it before."}
{"text":"This is mediocrity at its best as far as middle eastern food is concerned. Not a bad place but not up to snuff for people who know their kebabs and other middle eastern grub.  Not really inexpensive either. Nestled next to a middle eastern grocery store, it is a Mecca for people for migrated to the West and miss their native fare.  Please do not get me wrong. If you are one of those who like trying international flavors but are not too concerned about authenticity, you will do fine here. But those of you who are in an eternal quest for real ethnic food are sure to leave with an unfulfilled desire.  My kabab was tough and small in quantity. Plenty of salad and bread, but that's not why I gave this place a shot.  Anyway, worth a try!"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Hajis for 19 years and this place literally has not changed....from the smell to the tables/chairs to the layout and even some of the employees. Still the same for nearly 2 decades. The food has always been consistently good. My all time favorite is the chicken shawarma plate...the garlic sauce is insanely good. The service is always above average and quick even though they are typically very busy at most times of the day. I don't think they've ever made a mistake on any of my countless visits over the years."}
{"text":"This place was great.  Nothing fancy, just a small and very busy lunch spot.  Large portions, great hummus and everything tasted amazing.  Go with a big appetite and enjoy.  Thanks to all of the Yelpers that pointed me this way!"}
{"text":"I've been to Haji-Baba's a couple of times now and I must say... my visits have not been met with consistency in the quality of their food.    Haji-Baba is SUPER popular as you can see by the Yelp reviews of this place.  The main reason for their popularity I think is due to their prices.  Their prices are almost ridiculously low for the portion sizes you get when compared to other Mediterranean ~ Greek type of restaurants.       I did find something I liked at Haji-Baba. I recommend you try their Gyros.  It's a really good Gyros and is one of the best in the Phoenix metro.  They don't shave their Gyros meat like at the other places.  They cut their Gyros meat off in long chunks, different sizes.  This adds another level of \"delicious-ness\" when compared to Gyros at other locations.    They OVER STUFF their Gyros with meat, a small amount of tomatoes, red onions and pickled wild cucumbers with some tzatziki sauce.  The pickled wild cucumbers were unexpected and a nice change from other plaecs that serve Gyros.  My Gyros needed a bit more tzatziki, but my server was slammed and forgot it, oh well.  As for everything else on their menu ~ meh, I've had better.  Their dolmades, rice and kibbee all tasted old and over cooked.  The shawarma and falafels also tasted over cooked and were very dry for my liking.    Restaurant location and condition~ 2 to 3 stars Service ~ 3 stars Food ~ 2 to 3 stars (except for the Gyros which are 4.5 stars) Prices ~ 5 plus stars  I'm looking forward to going back for another Gyros and maybe I'll try their hummus and/or a Greek salad on my next.  Hope to see you there."}
{"text":"Food was painfully bland. I dined in a group of four, so I tried several appetizers and main courses.  Appetizers: kibbe, hummus, baba, dolmas. All bland.  Main courses:  lamb kebab, chicken kebab, felafel  Best food I had: felafel, baba, chicken kebab"}
{"text":"So I just have to say that this place is still freakin great!!!  Our lunch was SO DAMN GOOD the other day... I couldn't stop eating the baba ganoush mmmmmmmmmmmmmmm.  Okay sorry... my mouth is watering as I type this.  I could seriously eat this every week, like more than once.  And the store on the other side rocks too... pick up some of those pickled cucumbers... so good with homemade pitas of any sort.  I'm freakin hungry now!"}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!!!!!!!!! I ordered the gyro plate: the meat was perfect; the dressing on the salad was soooooo good and the rice, I could eat the rice all day. The rose water lemonade was so good and so refreshing. I am so glad I was talked into going. My new favorite place"}
{"text":"Go for the food and you won't be disappointed, great middle eastern dishes served up nice and generously whether you get it to go or for dining in.  I went here and ate in and there was initially no one in the restaurant but me and then it quickly filled up with people. So I know that this is a neighborhood spot. The gyros and tzatziki sauce are very good but so is the hummus, falafel, kibbi and shwarma."}
{"text":"My favorite Middle Eastern place in Arizona. I will drive 45 minutes when I am craving chicken shwarma just to go to Haji Baba. The people there are very nice and always give me the greeting when I come. The food is just so good and it is hard to find good middle eastern food.  The garlic sauce is so good with pita bread, if you go there you have to try it."}
{"text":"If you want to try an authentic middle-eastern food...come here!!!! The portions are great! The gyro plate my kids love! The Arabic coffee is something you need to try! I personally tried the lamb tongue sandwich because I'm brave like that!!!!! It was delicious but I also like Lengua Taco soooooo!"}
{"text":"This is the best place to eat middle eastern food in Arizona!!! I try to make it there at lease once a month!!!"}
{"text":"Most of the time I come here to get food to go. But I came here last time to eat there. They have seats outside as well. I order the chicken shawarma plate at $10 all the time and it's always been good. Service is OK, not attentive."}
{"text":"I love this place! Finally found a convenient, affordable, and delicious middle eastern food! Fantastic Falalels, hummus' tabouli, and the like. My very picky lady even devours their shawarma! Healthy, tasty, and inexpensive, you won't find a better mom n pop local joint serving up this level of tastiness!"}
{"text":"Great food and coffee! The value is great. The waiter was kind and helpful! I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"One of the most ironic things about this place is that it's a stone's throw away from Pita Jungle, yet they're completely different restaurants.  At Haji-Baba the exquisite architecture and the scantily-clad waitresses, don't get factored into your bill. Basically because there aren't any.  It's basically a dive attached to a market.  I love the decor at Pita Jungle but I can't make that justify the food prices.  You can order a appetizer at Haji's that can serve as your meal or just a simple gyro which comes served in tin foil.  The iced tea is great and the baklava comes in more flavors than Baskin Robbins has ice cream.  This place is also a fave of many college students.  One thing I can't understand about Haji's is the service. It's kinda like they don't care. Clearing tables is more important to them than taking care of patrons already at a table. Many times I've gotten up and refilled my own drink.   Prices are low, food is good but check the hours before you go. It doesn't keep standard restaurant hours and I think it takes Sundays off. Odd."}
{"text":"I came to Haji-Baba today for some food after a while and let me tell you this, their food is still as great since the first time I ate here. I ordered the chicken shawarma plate and it came with hummus, pita bread,tabouli (but I switched this to a normal salad), and white rice. The portion size is huge at this place and you definitely get your moneys  worth. The food was also outstanding, fresh, and delicious. The flavor combo was out of this world. In addition, the staff was always attentive, kind, and considerate to all their customers. They took orders and served the food in a reasonable amount of time despite being so busy. Seats do fill up quick so I'd recommend you go at a slow time or just wait in line if you don't mind being there longer. This place is absolutely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Friendly, competent counter help, fabulously delicious (if rather mildly flavoured) food, and you can hang out, blissfully inhaling, in the spice aisle while you're waiting. The chicken shawerma plate is huge and the hummus is wonderfully smooth. My sole complaint is that the takeout \"line\" is kind of haphazard and random instead of our polite and orderly Western queues; put it down to cultural differences."}
{"text":"The Shawrma wasn't the best. I don't believe it was off the rotating skewer, as it tasted like grilled chicken.   The ground meat however was delicious. I had all their meats, and chicken by far was my favorite. It was very juicy and flavorful!  For apps, I order the Hummus and Lebni. The Lebni, was plain and excellent.   Great place, there is also a nice grocery store as well."}
{"text":"YUMMM!!! I just came here to get baklava but it was the BEST baklava I've ever eaten!! I'll take salty over sweet any day but I might make an exception for this baklava.  I hate to admit this, but I ate two of them when my boyfriend was at work and just pretended like they didn't exist.  They're that good!!!   I'm so glad I made the impulsive decision to come here.  Have to come back and try the food sometime!"}
{"text":"Such a great hidden gem. I could drive right by it and not know it's there, but now that I do I will definitely be back. Had the gyro plate- tons of food (enough for leftovers) and the rice is to die for. This place kills other Middle Eastern restaurants by far!"}
{"text":"I've love Haji-baba since before I had Yelp. It hasn't changed much since my introductory meal.  I went in for lunch and though it was busy and I was alone, I still got seated and served pretty quickly.   I love the falafel pita and tabouli. The tea was good for just a hot tea as well. Maybe it's the atmosphere that makes it all so good? Or maybe it's that they do what they know and do it well? For me, this is a staple in the valley for middle eastern cuisine. It warms my heart that after all of these years they're still there and seem to do well.   The tahini is perfect, the falafel is perfect I love the halva.   They have a market area with many items that I'm familiar with growing up in Toronto and I've been surprised what I've seen there although admittedly, I believe the only thing I've ever purchased are the seamen snaps.  Anyhow, I imagine Haji-Baba will always be a favorite of mine even though the staff behind the counter aren't always the most chipper I've encountered, it's just that good."}
{"text":"I've been going to this place for years now and have yet to find a place in the valley that will come close.  Haji-baba is in a little plaza with a mini-market attached. If there's a wait or even after you eat, take some time to walk through the aisles of the little market.  I remember the first time my husband brought me a gyro sandwich from this place. I was blown away. You get the perfect amount of gyro meat and tzatziki. It's very filling but every time I go here I have to get a plate of hummus to start! Over the years I have tried different plates and sandwiches but my go-to is the chicken shawarma sandwich. Tender, juicy chicken with an amazing garlic sauce. It is a must try!"}
{"text":"Bad food, not that clean as well!!! They have a good Arabic market but not the restaurant."}
{"text":"Holy lamb of Allah, that's a good gyro! And unlike most religious experiences, this one came cheap! Just $4 for the best Gyro I've had, and I've had a lot of them."}
{"text":"The food was okay but not bad. The hummus was good, the rice was a little plain for me, the chicken had a weird texture and was hard to chew and didn't have any real seasoning but did have a delicious garlic sauce. The tabouli was good as well. Overall 3 stars but not a bad place. Good service :-)"}
{"text":"I ate at Haji-Baba for the first time today and will definitely be going back! I had the beef shawarma plate and it came LOADED with food. The extremely tender beef melted in your mouth and the rice and salad complimented it perfectly. There's no doubt this place is a hit (especially for lunch). We got there before the rush but when we were leaving, there was a line forming just waiting for tables to clear. The sandwiches are a very good price as well ~$4.00 so I might try that next. If you like middle eastern food, this is the place to go!"}
{"text":"Quick, no frill restaurant situated in a Mediterranean/Arabic grocery store. Had lunch here my first day in Tempe and the food kept me fueled for the rest of the day. Ordered the beef shawarma and it was quite good. I think the chicken might've been better as some pieces of the beef had been cooked too long and had that mealy texture. The dish usually came with salad, rice, and Arabic bread, but I don't eat grains so just asked for more salad. It was a big dish. The dressing on the salad was tasty, and even though it was mostly iceberg lettuce, I was fine with it this time. The beef came topped with ample tahini sauce. I ate about 3/4 of it and took the rest with me. Dinner for the night taken care of!  My total came out to $8 something including tax. Pretty good for a quick, tasty yet filling lunch.   When I was leaving saw that they have lamb tongue as a sandwich. I wonder if they would make that into a plate dish instead of a sandwich...I bet that's delicious!"}
{"text":"Sit on side if busy. Henna is of okay quality but I would not use it again on my hair, instead use the body quality henna on your hair. The Arabic coffee is a great treat before or after your meal, so thick and chocolatey.  I hate Pita Jungle and places like Haji's is why!  It can get kind of loud with people running their mouth and the place being so small with sounds bouncing off of the walls, but if you bring enough people with you to strong-arm a big enough table you are set to at least be comfortable."}
{"text":"Always wonderful food over the years until yesterday, when our delicious meal yielded food poisoning for my husband and me.  Not happy at all, and won't be back."}
{"text":"Love love love this place.  Tasty with great prices... who can beat that?  My newest thing is to order a gyro-to-go and enjoy it at home.  I'm a mom now so eating at a restaurant is a lot harder than it used to be. haha  See ya there!"}
{"text":"I've  been going to this place since my college days of ASU.  I think the first time I went here was in 1999 or 2000. Memory is a little foggy.  Food is great.  I think there chicken shawarma is amazing, its my recommendation.  There baba ganoush is incredible, I substitute the baba ganoush for the hummus on the chicken shawarma plate.. As for desert I didn't have any tonight.  In the past I have had the walnut baklava and it is great.     The prices here are very reasonable and the portions are huge.     As for there store if you need bulk spices this is the place to go.  I buy dry parsley here its $4.99 for 8 ounces it will last you years."}
{"text":"Haji Baba, Haji Baba!  I've been wanting to eat here forever and finally had a chance. The dishes are delicious and provide a huge amount for a cheap price. I ordered the stuffed grape leaves that also comes with toubouli, hummus, and pita bread. It was so filling! The toubouli was made just right.  We ate in the actual restaurant, and the service was quick and the wait staff were polite and helpful (rather, sometimes they are polite and helpful depending...).  My friend ordered the Gyro with lamb and beef and said it was fantastic. The meat has slightly crispy edges with perfect spicy flavoring, based on what he had said.  We ordered baklava to go, and I'll definitely be back for more.  Apparently they don't make it there, but we still like it.   The grocery store has some unique spices that are sometimes hard to find at regular grocery stores. There's also a take-out option.  However, I am not a regular and don't know any of the staff, so they weren't that nice when I was buying some groceries. Plus I am quite sure they overcharged me on the grapes. There was some discussion on price as two of the employees looked at me with frowning faces. What is that about?"}
{"text":"Every time I'm in town, it's a must to have lunch here with my uncle. Everything on the menu is good and authentic Mediterranean. They also have a great little bakery and market with canned grape leaves- I stock up every time!"}
{"text":"Oh. My. Gosh. I am obsessed with this place!  I was visiting my aunt and uncle while I was in Arizona and, before my flight home, they suggested we go to this restaurant for lunch.. AND, it was also a store!  We all had a falafel (the best ever...never forget) and split a giant Greek salad. Absolutely everything was incredible - The flavors were on a whole other level of delicious! It's a total hole-in-the-wall and looks a little deceiving, but it's all worth it.  I promise!  I also chose to buy 4 pounds worth of spices. If you choose to do this and fly these with you to wherever you are going, just be prepared to not get your bags delivered until the next day. They may or may not have had to search it due to \"suspicious-looking materials.\" :/"}
{"text":"I come here for all my groceries. Not only do they have a great middle-eastern selection... They have an area to dine indoors with a great selection of middle-eastern foods at great prices. Great for families and even college students to drop by for some quick lunch."}
{"text":"Really good find! The food was delicious, my girlfriend and I really loved it. I ordered the combination plater cause i wanted to try a little bit of everything and it did not disappoint. The best part of it was the lamb gyro, very tender and full of flavor. Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Stopped here for a light lunch so my friend split a plate.  The food was great. Tyey had a small store next door so i bought some tahini. For some reason it was hard to get the waiter to give us the check, or rather, tell us just to go into the store to pay. We waited a long time and asked more than once.  Not sure how the communication broke down."}
{"text":"\"36 falafel and 40 grape leaves to go, please.\"  That was my to-go order at 10:00 am.  They were ready at eleven and our middle eastern party was a success in large part to Haji Baba. This is my go to place for sumac, filo dough, zatar, red powder dye for Knafa, baclava, etc. Service has improved lately.  Is it the best food? Nope.  The reason why I have been coming here for the last 15 years is because of the authentic feel that the store transmits.  That is difficult to replicate."}
{"text":"First off, let me preface this review by saying that I've eaten here a few times in the past and it was mainly a pleasant experience.  I arrived at the restaurant at 11 am on Sunday, the hours clearly written on the door saying that that was the time they opened.  As I waited to be seated, an employee came up to me and said the kitchen would not be opening until 11:30.  No \"I'm sorry for the inconvenience\", no \"I apologize for the wait\", just so matter-of-fact, \"we don't give a crap about you\" attitude that I almost walked out right then and there.  But I brushed it off and gave them another chance.  After waiting for the half hour, I see the employee cleaning the tables and placing menus upon them.  He notices a fly on the window, promptly kills the fly with the menu, and proceeds to place the menu back on the table, dead fly and all.  Very sanitary, well done.  I still waited to be seated after witnessing this, unbelievably.  Finally get seated, was obviously the first one in the place, and this same employee proceeds to take some other customers order before me.  That was the last straw, I was out of there.  NOTE TO STAFF AT HAJI BABA:  I am a paying customer, do not ever act like I am doing you a favor by visiting your establishment.  You provide a service and I choose whether or not to give you my business.  Needless to say, I will never be back to your restaurant, and can only hope that you'll start appreciating the already established customer base that you've somehow held onto."}
{"text":"Very casual. Good for small groups. Service was great, very friendly and gave us recommendations. Got side dishes of hummus & olives to have as apps. Ordered the chicken kababs: a stellar, light dish and full of flavor. My accompaniment ordered the lamb kababs: they give that dish 4 stars, saying the lamb was a tiny bit dry.  Also grabbed a piece of pistachio baklava on the way out: holy smokes, people--my mouth is literally watering while typing pistachio baklava. Overall, everything was very good, will be back for more soon!"}
{"text":"Been here twice and both times it was excellent.  Hard for me to remember the name of the food off the top of my head, but whatever is in the sampler is really good.  Their Baklava is also really good.  Environment is pretty cool bring inside a grocery store.  It's an extremely popular place for a reason, so check it out."}
{"text":"I ate here today for the first time since I was an ASU student long ago - it was as good as I remember. Better, because i have a more sophisticated palette now.  The hummus was yummus.  The baba ghanooj nearly made me spooj.  The tabouli ruled me.  I love the olives. Real olives. Not from a shitty can. I am an olive snob. Trust me. Order the side of olives. Do it!  Yes this review is shamelessly blatantly fishing for cool and or funny ratings.  Give me one then go to Hajis."}
{"text":"I don't think I can add anymore than what everyone else have said. This is likely one of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix. I always get the chicken shawarma. The chicken is soooo moist and perfectly grilled. Just simply amazing. I always ask for extra garlic sauce for dipping. One of the most amazing and flavorful dipping sauce. Only one negative comment: the pita is chewy sometimes. Maybe this is just my personal preference but certainly not a big deal that would keep me from coming back.   -keep eatin'"}
{"text":"One of my favorite food destinations in town! This is my go to destination for Middle Eastern food. Great quality, nice variety, excellent prices.  I went to Haji Baba recently and wondered what I had written in my review of the place. I looked on Yelp and realized that, despite the many times I've visited over the last couple of years, I've never actually written a review. So now I'm fixing that little oversight.  I first came to Haji Baba while living out-of-state on the recommendation from a friend who made sure to come here at least once or twice very time he was in town. And I was immediately impressed by the place. I've since tried nearly everything on the menu, and I'll keep coming back on a regular basis.  Appetizers: The hummus is a fantastic texture and is a great addition to any dish, really. The tabbouli is the best I've had; it's not too oily and has just mild enough of a flavor to not be overpowering. The baba gannoush is nearly as good as the hummus. I know I've had several other appetizers, and they're all great.  Main dishes: I think I've worked through just about everything on the menu, although I wondered the last time I went if I have tried the Lamb Tongue sandwich. There's enough doubt in my mind that I'll try it next time I go. As far as the sandwiches go, my favorite is the chicken shawarma. It's a nice, thick sandwich for not much money, and the ingredients are all excellent. Tender and juicy chicken, lettuce, pickles, sauce. Excellent! The gyros, beef shawarma, chicken and beef kebabs, and other sandwiches are all tasty as well. As for the plate meals, I'd recommend the kebab combination plate first. It has a heaping of chicken and beef kebabs, and it comes out nice and hot with some sides. All delicious!  I've seen several recommendations of the baklava on here, and I wonder if I had a bad batch or something. The one time I tried baklava--which I generally love--it was dry and not very flavorful. I even tried a couple of varieties. Maybe it's time to try it again...  I like the small grocery store here as well. There are a bunch of lovely spices and hard-to-find imported items, and the prices are pretty reasonable.  Love it."}
{"text":"This place is one of those \"I am not sure if this will be good.\" Fortunately you know you have made the right decision when you take a beautiful bite out of their Gyros and Mediterranean cuisine!  I am Greek and it is so refreshing to have a place that reminds me of my heritage.  The market inside has all the necessities needed to create a true authentic meal with no branded items like regular grocery stores.  If you are trying to fine-dine I wouldn't suggest because it is a dive!"}
{"text":"Delicious Kebabs, nice staff, fair prices! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Can't beat it.  Best gyro and chicken shawarma in town!  The staff is nice and the prices are great."}
{"text":"If you can get past the well-worn interior (minus one start just for that), you're in for a treat.  We buy our seasonings here too.  VERY reasonable prices, and it's all good.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  We've been there as a party of two and also accompanied by about 10 more.  Always good food and friendly service."}
{"text":"I visiting from out of town. I'm amazed at how cheap the food was, and very good too. Visit the grocery store and get Ajver. It is the most amazing roasted eggplant spread in the world!"}
{"text":"After the Tempe Art Festival, we made our way back to Haji-Baba.  It was a crowded evening at the cafe.  Service was quick as always and food was generous and good as we remembered.  We always get the chicken shawarma plate and it doesn't disappoint.  A pile of sliced chicken with garlic mayo, rice, tabouli, hummus and pita bread.  I cannot finish the entire plate and help myself to a take out box.  Yearning Mediterranean food at an inexpensive amount?  Try it for a casual dinner."}
{"text":"What can we say... We've been coming to Haji-Baba for over a decade. It's our \"go to\" neighborhood restaurant for fantastic food and service. The food, the people, the market, the smile - peace starts with a smile - and all of Haji's staff embody that high value, and provide a wonderful ethnic culinary experience."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend. He had a combo plate and I had a chicken kabob pita sandwich and a side of rice and we shared food. Everything was full of flavor and tasted very good. It's one of the best Middle Eastern restaurants I've been to. They have a store that you can purchase products from and also a bakery section. Their baklava comes in different nuts including almond, cashew, pecan, walnut, and pistachio. Great place."}
{"text":"nice staff and great food. we ordered the gyros and kebab combination under staff advice. They didn't disappoint us. worthy trying!"}
{"text":"Oh, the hummus.  The hummus.  I've had many hummuses in my life, and Haji-Baba's hummus... just so smooth, so perfect.  Okay... other food.  Right.  Their gyro meat is very well done, and if I have any criticism, it would be they slice their gyro meat off the spit in much too large of slices.  It's not overseasoned or particular greasy, very tender.  When ordering with the plate, it comes with a side salad on house dressing and a helping of rice.  There's nothing particularly to the rice and they offer way, way too much - enough for several days worth of leftovers.  I'm also not too impressed with the side salad - the dressing is a bit salty and my salad was overdressed.  The falafel are fantastic.  Crispy, slightly crumbling, slightly moist, great for some delicious hummus dipping.  Haji-Baba is part sit-down restaurant, part counter-service restaurant, part Middle Eastern market, and it all somehow makes total sense when you step inside.  Prices are excellent.  Service is friendly.  A casual, inexpensive place to grab lunch or pick up some snacks."}
{"text":"The place seems nice, but even the waiter says the food is not very good, in fact, the kafta I tried was so fatty. tastes are not bad, but it needs improvements"}
{"text":"I have been to many Mediterranean restaurants in the valley but not any of those compare to the exquisite taste of this one.   The food in authentic and delicious, being a local it is definitely a go to restaurant.   You notice it is a tight space but that is definitely nothing a detail to hold the business back for when it caters to perfection and the staff are highly attentive.   11/10 highly recommend!"}
{"text":"1st time here.  Good replacement since Sahara closed.  Gyro was good.  Lots of thick cut meat in it.  I was surprised.  Also had the mixed kabob plate.  Everything was fresh. Portions are large, prices are great.  Will be back."}
{"text":"Is it a market with a dining area or a restaurant with a market?  Does it really matter?  It is just plain good!!  If you are looking for a no frills spot, Haji Baba is for you!  The small dining area is on the right side of the market, with a few tables even spilling out into the market itself.  It gets very busy during lunchtime, so arrive early or be prepared for a wait.    While the menu offers a variety of choices, being a creature of habit, I typically stick with what I know and love - the gyro sandwich.  Nice and simple - a hearty portion of gyro meat, cool lettuce, pickle, tomato and creamy tatziki enveloped in a large, soft pita.  All this goodness for $3.99.  Yes, really $3.99.  I can never finish it, even though I really, really try.  I also like their hummus (served with warm soft pita it is a great appetizer to share) as well as the spanakopita.  Actually, I have enjoyed everything I have tried.  So, you really can't go wrong.  The payment process is interesting - the waiter drops off a ticket stub at the table that you bring to the market register to pay.  If you are with a group, each person can pay separately by telling the cashier their items on the total ticket, which is nice.  And, if you happen to grab some of the tasty chocolate wafer cookies by the register to add to your bill, that is not a bad thing.  Be sure to ask for some delicious baklava to go!"}
{"text":"Our first time to the hub of Middle Eastern food, or so it seemed. We loved both meals, the chicken shawarma plate and the gyro plate--lean meat, well-seasoned, great sides--salad, rice, hummus and tabuli. We thought the falafel the best we'd ever had. Having just returned from the Middle East, we were searching for some authentic food and found it here!  Yummy and very affordable--we had enough leftovers for another meal."}
{"text":"I recently discovered Haji-Baba and have really fallen in like with it. It's a grocery store as well that sells hard to find Mediterranean spices, juices and other foods.  The restaurant section is pretty small and the decor is a bit old but the food is really good and quick. It's never too spicy and is always hot and fresh. My favorite is the chicken shawarma. The only draw back is everytime I've order a Sprite, I get water. I'm not sure if the waiters aren't paying attention or what but it happens all the time.  That being said for something different I highly recommend Haji-Baba. The portions are rather large so if you're dieting I'd suggest splitting the meal with someone or going there for a cheat day!"}
{"text":"One word. Shawarma. Do it, do it now! Hummus is pretty darn tasty too!"}
{"text":"Is it a grocery store turned into a small time restaurant ? This was my first impression when I walked in.  We went on a Sunday for lunch and the place was pretty packed. We waited for our turn to sit. We noticed there was one man cleaning and taking orders other serving, just two guys managing everything. I give 0 for the ambiance and cleanliness of the place. There were flies on the table.   My 4star goes completely for the food served. We had Chicken kabab for appetizers which was juicy and rightly cooked. Had chicken shawarma plates which was the best part of the lunch. Garlic sauce kept us wanting more. We had tamarina juice for drinks which was really refreshing. We ended the meal with Walnut Baklava, given that there was hardly any other option. Anyways it was worth it. Had a wonderful lunch.   In the end the price is reasonable and though the service was a bit slow but was up to the mark.  I would definitely recommend the food. It stands out the best."}
{"text":"Haji is by far one of my favorite lunch places in the area. The staff is always on top of their game and the food is consistently great. Maybe the owners feed the staff hummus before their shift. I don't know what the secret is behind their food and staff but it's a fantastic place to go.   They serve the most delicious tongue ever. Their lamb tongue is mild in flavor, very tender, and compliments a side of some of the creamiest and most flavorful hummus I've ever eaten.   Haji-Baba is a great place to go for lunch and for authentic Middle Eastern groceries. If you haven't gone you're missing out. If you do go you have to try their tongue. As they say you won't stop talking about it."}
{"text":"If you're a Tempe/Mesa native or an ASU student or alum, then you probably know Haji-Baba. I, however, am neither and only recently discovered this awesome place by way of a recommendation on Twitter.  Since then, I've been there five times and have tried nearly everything on the menu. The food is delicious! Seriously, there hasn't been one thing I've tried that I haven't enjoyed.  On my first trip, I ordered the combination. I highly recommend doing this if you've never eaten here before. This plate gives you a great sampling of what their menu has to offer and a generous portion at that. It's easily enough for two people and, at only around $12, a great deal too.  On my most recent visit, I had the Gyro plate; again amazing! A very generous portion served with a delicious salad, a side of rice, and I topped the meal off with an Arabic coffee.  Haji-Baba is not really a secret and the place will get very busy at lunch time. If you want to eat there, go for an early or late lunch, otherwise you'll have to wait for a table; it's worth it!  They have a large menu and great prices, and if you don't have time to stay and eat, you can order to-go from the counter.  The staff do a good job, but their food is so good, I'd still eat there if a server punched me in the face every time I walked in the door.  If you haven't tried it, you need to go there. If you have, then you know just how great Haji-Baba is."}
{"text":"Thank You Erica.O and Praise to Allah that I finally found some Baklava worthy of the sacred journey through my Gullet.  Now onto the rest of my review, I met a friend for lunch, I started by ordering the Hummus and a Spanakopita (see pics)   The hummus was good, although I didn't get the the thick fresh pita I saw everyone else eating? I guess you have to ask for the good stuff,  Newbie mistake #1, the pita I got wasn't too bad though.  The Spanakopita wasn't all that it, tasted too \"green\" not enough flavor of feta, and by microwaving  it  the flaky crust became unflaky and jut soft and chewy, not good.  I ordered the Vegetarian Combo she ordered the Shawarma plate (see pics) My plate had babaganoush, falafel (hiding under the tomato salad) Tabbouleh and 2 stuffed grape leaves served with a side of yogurt / tatziki sauce.  I thought everything was really good and tasted pretty fresh except the grape leaves, they were atrocious, the rice inside was unrecognizable, it was so overcooked it completely turned to a mushy paste, bummer, grape leaves are my favorite. ( I will make them for us Andrea, I Promise)  I wish I had more of their falafel I pretty much filled up on the tatziki, babaganoush and pita. Now I know what to get next time.  So our waiter come over and says \"Since this is your first time, I'll take care of the bill, just take your ticket to the counter\"  WOW~ Are you serious, how generous!!  We wait in line, give our ticket to the guy and he keeps asking us to pay???  Well Apparently  there was a confusion of some sort, I don't know what the waiter meant by that, We though our lunch was going to be free.....it wasn't....but that's OK.  That's when I ordered my baklava, one piece.........I go to the car to eat it and went back in for 2 more pieces.....YUM!!  4 stars for the Baklava at least"}
{"text":"I loooooove coming here to get a good meal for a price that doesn't break the pocket book.  My usual meal is a falafel pita with extra pickle, a iced tea, and the hummus or baba ganoush.  All of which I find satisfying.  And they have some of my favorite European treats.  They also have a market which is great for spices and tea stock piling.  I also love the Arabic coffee and a piece of baklava for dessert"}
{"text":"Try their Chicken Swarma plate! Try their chicken Swarma plate!   OK now that you know that I have to say this place is good. I might be overrating it a little bit since their beef Kafka is dry but their Chicken Swarma is great! The best I've had outside of the middle east. The prices are low, the service is adequate, and the food is great. Be sure to pick up some baklava or other dessert on your way out."}
{"text":"Everything here is on point. Chicken shawarma number one. Ask for extra sauce toooo. Baklava is fresh and addicting! Not dry and generous on the nuts. they also have a trendy market with a traditional flare; food is fast and quality."}
{"text":"Who didn't give Haji's 5 stars? They are mental.  I've been coming here for 15 years. I have never had a bad meal, and always leave with a smile on my face. Super inexpensive, amazingly tasty. Really. I wish the rating system for Yelp went to ELEVEN.  I now live in San Francisco and have for about year....you know, the San Francisco that is supposed to be one of those culinary-Mecca type cities? There isn't Mediterranean food in all of SF that is anywhere near as good for 3x the price.  Love the Haji-Baba. You simply don't know how good you have it."}
{"text":"Yummy, affordable, and fast! Depending on what one orders, it may also be healthy:)  Middleeastern diet, even though is high in fat, is high in good kinds of fat. Combining meat like shawarma and salad like tabouli will be helpful to increase absorption of iron. So just go for it! The amount of food served on the plate is huge too, so be ready to share or take some home. The only thing I miss at this restaurant is that there is no fatoush salad!!! I wish they had it on the menu!"}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite restaurant in Tempe. I sometimes dream of their hummus and chicken shwarma. It is that good!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Middle Eastern food I have had. So yummy. I also love the little market"}
{"text":"Really good! Lamb tongue and gyro with hand made pita bread. Really good! Hummus and dessert very good too! Excellent service!"}
{"text":"LOVE Haji-baba! amazing/fresh food! love their spices inside as well"}
{"text":"This establishment is a staple of Tempe.  Go there right now and eat.  You'll be hooked."}
{"text":"This place has a been favorite of mine since my ASU days and it doesn't get as good as having to travel to the Middle East for Shawarma, Falafel, Hummus, Kabobs, Kibbi, Tabouli Salad, etc. Haji Baba at times can be crowded but it is so worth the wait and their prices are super reasonable. After wards one can browse the adjacent market aisles of imported products from the Middle East, Asia and Europe. The front counter space area is filled with baklava, dates, candied fruits and other delectable sweets."}
{"text":"it was good server looked overwhelmed so service was slower than I'd liked it was also very busy good hummus very authentic"}
{"text":"Good food, good service.  The restaurant is inside of a middle eastern grocery store."}
{"text":"Has the lamd kabob and salad. It was sooo yummy. The service was excellent, i loved my waiter and cashier was super friendly. Ill be back."}
{"text":"The place is nothing special, you can even think there is nothing going on there as it is almost hidden. Once you are in, you still won't believe there is something worthy. Sit and try one of their gyros, hummus or the vegetarian combo! All tasty and well served. After that you can check and buy some interesting to impress your friends next time!"}
{"text":"The food is very delicious, some times you get little less in quantity but quality wise these people are really good. I recommend for family as my 4 year old kid also eats without making noise."}
{"text":"Maybe it's the midwestern in me, or maybe I'm just not very adventurous, because when it comes to middle eastern food, it don't have a clue as to what's what. But I've been to Haji Baba a couple times now and have not only found things on the menu I can identify, I found things that are really good!  1. their hummus is really good and their pitas are nice and fresh. 2. the chicken shwarma is also really good, flavorful without being weird. 3. I've never been a big falafel fan, at most places it seems really dry to me, but theirs is not dry, yet not greasy, has a good flavor and is complimented nicely with the tahini sauce.  On my last visit I ordered the falafel (three balls) and a side of rice. They gave me a huge plate of rice, more than I could eat. Between that and the falafel I was full and satisfied.   And like everyone else says, it's cheap, which is always a bonus."}
{"text":"Authentic Mediterranean food in a modest setting. Don't let the outer appearance of the building dissuade you, the food is seriously delicious!  Good options for vegetarians (Vegi platter is quite the feast).  There is also a small grocery section with specialty items (and European candy!!!)"}
{"text":"Not real sure about this place.  It's as if someone put up some shelves and emptied out boxes as they were handed to them without some real thought.  The shelves are jumbled and hard to navigate and if you aren't a man, do not expect any assistance from the cashier.  She was NOT happy to have women in her shop.  If I didn't need something specific while I was in AZ for a dish I was making for my hostess I would have walked right back out.  Normally in a small shop like this I would show my support and do some shopping, but not this time.  I am SO GLAD I do not live here I won't be needing to come back here anytime soon.  Plus the place just looked dirty."}
{"text":"Love the food at haji baba. The gyro deluxe for $4 is great for a cheap lunch and I get the chicken shwarma plate if I'm really hungry. Both dishes are fantastic and very flavorful! Definitely one of the gems in Tempe!"}
{"text":"This is one of the very few Arabic restaurants in Phoenix. It looks like a hole in the wall but generally these places produce the best food.  I have eaten at this restaurant for many years going back to my college days at Arizona State University.   I always love the food especially the chicken showarma plate. I highly recommend the chicken. The beef in my opinion is not that great or tasty and the sides that are served with it are not as tasty.  Falafel ... Humus... Everything else is really authentic and very tasty  When you walk in don't expect to be wild with the core... But expect to have some really tasty food"}
{"text":"If you are reading this today is your lucky day! Truly. I am an on again off again food snob. Maybe reformed. But no.  I'm so sorry to do this. I wanted this place to be the Gem that I just found at the pho place next door. It was not! Sooooo, let me get to it. First BEWARE the \"yogurt soda\" . This is definately something you would have to spend alot of time with. It is exactly what it says it is. Imagine plain, unsweetened yogurt, you drop in plain, unflavored unsweetened soda water in and then add a tablespoon of salt. Sound good. Fuck no! And it is not.  Next.....!  Falafel: Meh! The croquettes could have been crispier on the outside and definately need a lot more flovor to these heavenly middle-eastern balls of goodness. The pickle was actually the best part.  The pita is NOT MADE FRESH!! Some reviews say they are but I can tell you the pita's came from a bag.  Gyro: Meh! The reason for the cone shaped meat loaf of lamb and beef is so the outside cooks quickly buy turning past extremely high heat and the inside stays moist as it is sliced away from the cone. In my Gyro there were no cooke meat ends, in fact it was just inside Gyro meat. I assume this is because they are busy and the outside meat was never given a chance to cook up again.....you see the inside becomes the outsude every slice of the way. I did not have nearly enough tzatziki, no cucumbers, no olive, no red onion. All essential in creating a tasty ass Gyro. I still contend that Jay's Gyros in Tempe are supreme!!  Lamb Tongue Sandwich: Lettuce, Tomato, Tongue wrapped in a bagged pita!! Boring. Dry. The Lamb Tongue is served in the pita WHOLE. I thought it would be sliced but it was'nt. Two little lamb tongue's boiled with ZERO flavor. Baba Gahnoush: OK......... Hummus: OK....... (Pita Jungle has a much heartier flavor on both items) Baklavah: We have a winner!!!! Some of the best I have tasted in recent memory. That will be my reason for a follow up.  I thought it was cool that they sold prayer mat's. The service is ok, nothing bad and nothing over the top."}
{"text":"The two stars is for the restaurant itself. They are understaffed so the service can be slow. The food was mediocre and not very carefully prepared. They are not very consistent with the sauce that they apply to their sandwiches. If you're looking for Mediterranean food, I highly recommend that you go somewhere else as the food they cook isn't very tasty at all. Although, you should not completely avoid this place. Come here if you are looking for fresh baklava, delicious Arabic coffee, feta cheese in brine, or if you want to shop at an ethnic grocery store."}
{"text":"This is hands down my favorite place to eat! I have been coming here for over a decade and have yet to have a bad experience. The place is not fancy, nor do they pretend to be.  It's attached to a small marketplace, which is actually a huge plus for me.  Any time I run out of spices, I have a great excuse to stop by. :) The prices are very fair in both the restaurant and the marketplace. The servers here are great. They stop by when they are needed, but don't try to bombard you and upsell you the entire time you are eating. If you are a garlic lover, I highly recommend the chicken schwarma."}
{"text":"The shawarma melts in your mouth. The dolmas fall apart under the fork. The kibbeh is moist and nutty. And to top it all the baklava is mildly sweet and you can actually taste the nuts and cardamom. Best ME food period."}
{"text":"Still one of the best locally eatery in Tempe! Prices are still from the old days and though menu has not changed, it's still top notch."}
{"text":"I hadn't been to Haji Baba in YEARS. Literally, I couldn't remember the last time I'd been and so I thought I'd change that. I met a friend of mine here who also hadn't been here in a while.   I ordered the chicken shawarma sandwich, usually a standard choice to judge how the food is. Honestly, it was pretty boring and ordinary, nothing special about it. My friend ordered the falafel plate and baba ghanoush. I tried the smoky eggplant dip and liked it, it added some variety when I put it on my sandwich. I need to try more menu items to get a better feel of what they offer.   Service here is quick and friendly, I ended up buying something from their store as they have a neat selection of items for purchase."}
{"text":"So I found this little market place serving Mediterranean  food.  Place reminded me of little Asian market.  Disorganized and cluttered.  I was very skeptical about this place, but I read yelp review and figure what can it go wrong.... Right?  Well, waited 40 mins to get my food, because they forgot my order.  Chicken was burnt.  I mean it was so black, I thought I was eating a charcoal.  I made small compliant to them, they offered to give me $3 off the tab..  I would of been more pleased if they remade my food, but they were closing.  So $3 off the tab was the only option they given me..  Salad was decent.  Fresh and great dressing.  Hummus was decent.  Little salty and sour compared to others.   Rice was okay, nothing special.    Food was about average to me.  I had a better experience eating at \"Greek wrap\" on bell road.    I don't think I will be returning to this place after the experience I've encountered.  It is not worth of waiting 15 mins for seating, getting over cooked food, and not getting my order for 40 mins.    Maybe next time, they will get my order correct, however, it is not worth the trip for average food.."}
{"text":"Yesterday we were searching for a nice little place to eat lunch in Tempe near our apartment. I came across this place on Yelp, I saw that they had 4.5/5 stars with over 400 reviews, that's amazing! So we decided to try it out today. Well, we are SO glad we did! The food was excellent, plus they have a little store as well! Very authentic food, everything was good. Plus it is not very expensive, the plates are well served. We will be back for sure, it is a 3 minutes ride from our apartment!"}
{"text":"This place is freaking awesome. Having been to the middle east and indulged in the best Mediterranean food ever, I have pretty high standards.   I just barely moved to Phoenix, but before I moved here I made it a priority to come eat here every time I was here.   First of all, it's super affordable. For two people you can get sandwiches whether it be a gyro or a shawarma or whatever, plus a side of hummus or falafel or whatever for well under 15 bucks. The food isn't just cheap, it's also delicious. I've tried a lot of different things and it's all pretty authentic.   The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is the seating of the restaurant. It's always packed in there and there is never room. But it's delicious."}
{"text":"Still my most favorite mediterranean restaurant.  Pros; 1. Food is AWESOME: fresh, simple and tasty 2. Prices are low 3. Has a grocery store attached (but that also takes up space that could otherwise be used for seating) 4. Good sized portions  Cons: 1. Space is limited, having to wait during lunch hours 2. Parking is limited and gets full near lunchtime"}
{"text":"Love the gyros. Hands down the best. Great people always friendly and the baklava is freakin on point. Been coming here for 7 years. I'll keep coming!"}
{"text":"This is a little restaurant inside of a market. I got chicken shawarma. Let me tell you something, it was delicious! The chicken was perfect. The dollop of garlic mayo was yum! It also came with hummus, rice and a salad, I forget the name of it. Anyhow, it was fantastic and I will be going back soon!!"}
{"text":"Chicken schwarma plate is LIFE! Honestly everything there is delicious and the servers are great and patient!"}
{"text":"While looking for a place to eat Bakhlava around Chandler, I came up with this place. We went there at Sunday and it was not that crowdy. The place is shared with the grocery store, so don't think its more like a conventional restaurant. The food is very good and price is reasonable. We went with Kabab combo and Sultani. The kababs were well cooked. Later, we picked Pistachio and Cashew Bakhlava. They have I guess 6 different kinds of Bakhlava, Pistachio, Cashew, walnut, Almond and one other. Bakhlava was better than other options definitely. We would love to go again for the food annd its reasonable price!!!"}
{"text":"I guess it is finally time to write a review about Haji-Baba. This place is great, from the restaurant to the to-go service to the grocery store. This place is great, easy to get to, and has almost everything you need at reasonable prices.   My friend loves the food here. He has sampled most things on the menu and has fallen in love with the chicken shawarma.  About once every three weeks, he can speak of nothing else until he gets an order of shawarma. I love the spanakopita and the vegetarian sampler. The apricot juice is great too. Really intense flavor, but really refreshing. Also, a great selection of baklava. Cashew is my favorite so far.  The market/grocery side is great too! Lots of wonderful things for cooking at great prices. We found black mustard seeds here after looking everywhere in town and coming up empty handed. And let me tell you about the dates! Best prices in town to buy dates.   I don't think there is anything else I can say, you must go here and love the food."}
{"text":"Pretty good food for the modest price. I had the beef shwarma and my friend had the kabab koubide. The rice and beef were really creamy and delicious but the pita and bit lacking in flavor in my opinion. Overall, a great place to eat for a quick bite during lunchtime."}
{"text":"My father is really good friends with the owner. So I have been coming to this place since I was probably 4 years old. Still, today, it's the BEST place to go and get middle eastern food. The chicken kabob plate is just absolutely fantastic! They're not pricy and you get your moneys worth with the size of the plates! You could probably even share a plate if you wanted to!"}
{"text":"This was my first place to experience middle eastern food and it is still my favorite after over 20 years!  I love the food, the people and the prices."}
{"text":"The most authentic Middle Eastern food I've had in ages, aside from my mom's cooking that is. Every time I go I get the chicken shawarma with extra garlic sauce. I don't know what they do to the sandwich but it is to die for and so savory. That along with a side of hummus or baba ghanouj and I'm as happy as can be. On days I'm feeling extra super I'll get two sandwiches ;)"}
{"text":"I'm not sure how this place got such raving reviews. It was okay at best. My food wasn't very flavorful and the flavor that it did have wasn't so appetizing. My dining partner's food was also not great. Neither of us finished. The restaurant and market itself were over-crowded and the service was lacking. Wouldn't go back, but everything deserves a second chance."}
{"text":"I've only had the gyros here the couple times I've been here, but they're very good and inexpensive. They've also got a few aisles of imported grocery items, and a big tea selection, to browse while waiting for them to make your order."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for years and years. It hasn't changed a bit in all of those years, and it wasn't looking too great to start with it. Even so, don't let that throw you off. My dad is middle eastern (from Iran), so this place is comfort food for me. It's not the best, high quality middle eastern food, but its similar enough to Persian food that it hits the spot when I'm missing it. The food is cheap, but really, really good. The falafel is amazing. So are the schwarma and the gyros. The hummus is hit or miss depending on the day. I have tried other things in the past but I always regret it, so I've stuck to my usual orders the past several times I've come. I definitely recommend this place."}
{"text":"This place has great Mediterranean food! They have a market and a restaurant. The food is a good price, and it is a lot of food that they give you. I've gotten the gyro and the lamb is very tender and I am not a hug fan of lamb. The hummus is the best hummus I have ever tried. The service isn't amazing, but it is true ethnic Mediterranean food. The people their are very nice."}
{"text":"Chicken shawerma...  Chicken shawerma...  Chicken shawerma...  Sorry, I may have gotten a little distracted there.  Every time I think of Haji Baba I think of three things: their chicken shawerma plate (which is to die for, as in, I would throw myself in the path of a bullet if it meant I could get some), their delicious lemonade, and the store that's attached to the restaurant which always has new discoveries.  I don't get to go here that often since it's a little far away, and until recently the light rail construction traffic made getting there a pain. But when I do I get that chicken shawerma and I tell myself I can eat all of it. Then I eat half of it and box the rest of it up and have a delicious lunch the next day.  I hope this place never closes. NEVER."}
{"text":"If you like Hummus, Falafel, Salad, Chicken, Lamb, Cheap awesome food, great middle eastern markets, tziki, or anything else good in this world.  Then go to Haji-Baba.  They have the best lunch specials.  Their falafel pita is probably the greatest deal in history.  I lived off this for a time."}
{"text":"I just...I find this place to be very unfair.  Why is it in Phoenix when I live in Tucson?  Why does it have way better hummus, chicken schwarma, gyros and babaganoush than anywhere I can find in Tucson?  Why do they have better home-made feta cheese than anywhere in Tucson?  Why, Haji-Baba?  Why?  I want answers!  I really love hole-in-the-wall places.  This place is no exception.  Their hummus was described to me as \"creamy\" and I made a vomit noise.  But it is totally creamy.  But not with dairy, it's like they put it through a mill or something, because a food processor could never in a million years make it that smooth.  The babaganoush was tangy and flavorful, served with freaking amazing pita bread that was warm.  The chicken schwarma was...I don't know that words can describe it.  Basically anything I say will make is sound not as good as it was.  Divine doesn't cut it.  Juicy, perfectly cooked, exploding with flavor...I mean...they work for now.  I will make up a word soon that adequately describes it.  The gyro was spectacular.  The meat was seasoned to tender perfection, and they put home made feta cheese on it!  The feta cheese is not nearly as salty as any other kind I have ever had, and it was way creamier.  We had rose-water lemonade, which I have indeed found in Tucson.  At the street fair.  You know, the one that happens twice a year?  I am pretty happy to find a place that has it year-round!"}
{"text":"Amazing food at a really great price! The servers are very respectful and quick to serve you and the food came out very quickly. I would highly recommend stopping by even if you don't like Middle Eastern food as it is attached to a convenience where you can find things you've never heard of!  Paid: $12 for 2 people!"}
{"text":"Authentic, tasty & expertly prepared food, this pretty much sums up our meal at Haji Baba.  We decided to have lunch here after reading the glowing reviews for this place on yelp. At first glance, it looked like any other store in a strip mall but inside, it is divided into a store front & a restaurant. The space is clean & the service is excellent/attentive.   our lunch consisted of a vegetarian combo plate(falafel x2, baba ganouj, tabbouleh, grape leaves x2) shish kabob plate(lamb kabob x5 pieces,rice, lettuce salad with tahini,1 Arabic bread) side of labni( kind of cream cheese), ful mudammas (mix of beans in a flavored curry sauce)- yes we were really hungry :) In the veggie combo- The falafel was crispy, freshly made & grape leaves were unlike any I have eaten. The ful mudammas was tasty, well prepared/flavored without being spicy. In case of the shish kabob plate- the lamb was well cooked (I asked for medium done meat & that's what I was served) but it was bland. The portions are huge but prices are reasonable .  Don't miss picking up some yummy middle eastern desserts from the store, to finish up your meal.   We left Haji Baba, stuffed/content & with lotsa doggie bags!"}
{"text":"FOOD: This place has some pretty good Middle Eastern food. The hummus was awesome, and the shawermas are always tasty. You get a lot of food on your plate. The meat is actually tasty, as opposed to a lot of places that just throw the some tasteless meat into the shawerma. If you want to try some good low-priced Middle Eastern food, this is the place to come.   PRICE: Pretty cheap for all that you get. You can definitely spend under $10.   ATMOSPHERE: I love the setup of this place! The restaurant is at the side of a small market that sells all types of Middle Eastern ingredients, foods, and snacks. If you enjoy what you eat in the dining area, walk five feet into the aisles and find the required ingredients! This place is actually run by Middle Easterners, not sure which nationality, but it feels authentic and not too Americanized.   SERVICE: No complaints, but not the most outgoing or warm service.  SKINNY: Go to Haji-Baba! If not to eat, then to shop for food! Great place for lunch."}
{"text":"My favorite place to grab a gyro or Shawarma plate in Tempe. The food is very reasonably priced and you get served relatively quickly.   I have had pretty much everything on the menu and there is only one item that I do not recommend. I am a bit of an adventurous eater so last time I was there I decided to try to the lamb's tongue.  I am a fan of beef tongue I think under different circumstances I would enjoy Lamb's tongue but the texture was quite gristley and they flavored the tongue with an inordinate amount of lemon.   There was lemon in everything, the lambs tongue, the rice, and the salad. To make matters worse I ordered a lemonade I could not avoid that damn lemon!   Despite not enjoying the lamb's tongue everything else is quite delicious. The baklava is spot on!"}
{"text":"Ever wonder why small specialty shops that have a deli and/or restaurant have the best food?  I figure it's because they use off the shelf ingredients that they sell. And HAJI BABA is a perfect example. Their food is not gourmet. It's not a fad-diet phenom. It's not even even hip. What it is...is the look and taste of carefully prepared traditional food that these folks would eat at home. Their food brings back memories from when I was a kid.  The difference? I now appreciate the savory flavors and blends of herbs and spices that goes into making their food. During every visit, my wife buys treats with Nutella, also something I grew up with in Europe. My kids have to get their own flavor of Chiklets gum-remember those? We never leave without a plate of baklava to go.  My favorite dish is the gyro plate. It's under $10 and always has been. The plate is heaped with tender meat, fresh tossed salad with dressing and light and fluffy rice. Its like sitting inside your dream car with your hand on the steering wheel - revving the motor. It's the absolute best. Try it. You won't leave hungry or empty handed."}
{"text":"wow and wow. the restaurant lives up to all of the raves. i would return. again. and again as long as i keep visiting PHX + Scottsdale. I hope these folks never go out of business."}
{"text":"If I had to choose one place to eat every single lunch and dinner for the rest of my life, it would be here.  I miss Haji Baba more than anything about living in Tempe."}
{"text":"The best gyro I've ever experienced!! I went there for the first time 2 days ago and I'm currently on my way for round 2. Don't forget the rose water lemonade!"}
{"text":"Damn you Yelpers you steered me wrong!!  I agreed to go to this place only after reading all of these glorious reviews on Yelp, only to be in for a rude awakening upon my arrival.    I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the phrase you get what you pay for has never rang more true for me.  I love Middle Eastern food, like seriously, no joke.  So how excited was I to try a new Middle Eastern restaurant not too far from my office with ridiculously low prices?? You can probably figure it out from there.  The meal started out okay.  I got a pretty darn big piece of Spanakopita for $1.95, which excited me.  It was decent, not very flavorful to be honest but for $1.95 I'll eat them all day long. My boss ordered a side of hummus to start, and his story was pretty much the same.  We then both ordered the Chicken Kabob sandwich for a whopping $3.99 and I was stoked. Until it arrived that is.  I took one bite and could tell right away that something was not right, with the chicken I mean.  After I taste a funky piece of meat, that's it. I will not be taking another bite. It just won't happen.  I did however perform a little surgery on one piece on a side plate to discover that as I suspected, the inside was pink, as in NOT FULLY COOKED.  It took a bit out of me to not get sick right there at the table.  I was hungry though so I tried to eat around the chicken, only to discover that this was the dryest chicken kabob sandwich I had ever had.  I probably should've figured that out by watching my boss douse his with the entire appetizer of hummus to add some flavor, but what can I say, I like to figure some things out on my own.  All in all my meal ending up costing less than $6, which was sweet, except for the fact that I didn't really eat anything.  Oh, and I should probably mention that we got back to the office and my boss didn't stop bitching all afternoon about how badly his stomach hurt. I believe that's called salmonella : )  Anyways, I'm a bit surprised that I had such a lousy experience with so many great reviews before me.  Maybe it was an off day, maybe all the reviewers before me were blinded by the price, regardless, I won't be back to find out."}
{"text":"I was first brought here by a friend from Saudi Arabia many years ago.  He didn't question my selection of burger joints, I didn't question his selection of Middle Eastern Food.  What this place lacks in decor and atmosphere, it makes up in flavor.    You literally eat in the middle of a small grocery market.  Bizarre?  Yes.  A deal breaker?  Not when these flavors await.      We got a mixed platter that gave us a little of everything, and it was all quite good.The two of us took quite a bit of leftovers home.  I've always had a good meal each time I've gone here and if they had better hours I would go more often.   Tempe is Phoenix's hub for Middle Eastern fare, and Haji-Baba is one of the best."}
{"text":"Best hummus I've ever had. The food here is so good. Prices are so good. Literally nothing bad about Haji Baba."}
{"text":"Good and Cheap!  What more do you need?  If you're a fan of mediterranean, you'd be doing yourself a misdeed by not giving this place a try.  I had the beef shawarma.  It was like brisket with a middle eastern sauce wrapped into a pita.  Awesome.  The only problem was that it was really, really messy.  the sauce leaked all over the place.  Napkins are a must.  My friend had gyro.  I took a small bite of the meat.  It may have been the best gyro ever!  I'll have to give a full one a try for myself someday.  The several types of baklava are delightful treat.  We went with cashew, pecan, and walnut.  All three were wonderful.  One big negative.  Only two pieces of pita came with our order of hummus.  Not even close to enough.  Make sure to order an extra (or two).  The hummus, like everything else, is fantastic.  The pita is pretty good, but nothing special by itself.  I didn't set foot inside, so I cannot tell you what it's actually like in there.  But the food is awesome."}
{"text":"Good gyros at very reasonable prices. Gets crowded at lunch time, so get there early."}
{"text":"I love me some middle eastern food, and this place definitely met my expectations.   I gave it four stars because it's not the prettiest atmosphere, it's on the side of a grocery store, but I'm totally a fan of dives so I didn't care.  Also they charge 50 cents for refills on your soda, but the food prices are cheap for what you get so that doesn't matter too much. I ordered the chicken shawerma platter and is was amazing. Lots of food for what you pay for, and a literal MOUNTAIN of tabooli on the side. Yum! After you eat your dinner, remember to get Baklava on your way out.  It is the bomb!"}
{"text":"Hands down the best middle eastern restaurant in the Tempe area.  You can't beat the prices, everything is always consistently good (we go here about once a week).  Favorites:  Hummus and Gyro Delux!  Don't forget to grab some baklava too, this is the best i've ever had (and that includes having some while in the middle east)"}
{"text":"Price is right on and food is pretty good too...I have been to Egypt, Israel and Jordan and had better food there but this was close!   I thought it strange they had no fries though...usually falafel, which is what I had, has fries in the sandwich...the falafel sandwich was only $2.35 and filling; cheaper than a taco bell 7 layer burrito and twice a good!"}
{"text":"This place is a gem. there is a reason it is frequently busy. the prices are fantastic (they did FINALLY raise them a bit, and it's still cheap as hell!). the food is basic, and fresh, and tasty. ask for a side of pickles, for like .75 cents, and they will bring you a bunch of them....and they're so good! the service occasionally comes with a little attitude...but only a little. noisy, crowded, and not fancy. but the food ROCKS. i suggest the falafal sandwich for around $3. THANK YOU HAJI BABA!! oh, and not to mention they have an absolutely kick-ass middle eastern market in the restaurant! Buy your pita bread here for $1, and it's much better than the grocery store one for $3. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Not good!! Yogart salad was good, but the kabab wasn't. Kibby not good at all !! Very disappointed"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple of times before.  The first time, less than two years ago, I ordered the chicken shawarma entree (complete with pickled veggies, hummus, garlic sauce, and pita).  Many of the chicken pieces were still uncooked that I could hardly chew it, and some were still blood-red!  When I started to complain about about this to my server, he acted as if no one has ever complained about the food here before.  He left, and he came back with whom I thought was the cook, who had acted even more offended about my accusation of the meat being uncooked.  He mentioned something about how everything is timed perfectly in the oven, but he offered to bring a new dish out.  Twelve minutes later (yes, I time these things), a slightly more cooked dish of chicken was laid out in front of me.  I decided I'd salvage what I could and just chalk it up to a bad day.  My favorite things in that entree were the pickled veggies and the garlic sauce.  Oh my... the garlic sauce!!    A few days after that, I brought my Mom with me for dinner.  We ordered the lamb kabob entree to share.  She wasn't impressed with the kabobs, since she had Byblos' lamb shanks on the brain (Byblos' lamb is pretty good, we think).  It was official- the hummus here leaves much to be desired.  However, I still thought the garlic sauce was fantastic!  Tastes great with the tabouli/tabouleh (both are correct).  Fast-forward many, many months to two days ago, I decided to order take-out for Mom and me- chicken shawarma sandwich, no pickle (tomatoes, lettuce, and garlic sauce in pita); gyro, no pickle, no cucumber sauce (lamb meat and lettuce in pita); and gyro with everything for Mom.  Why did it take me all this time to finally order these sandwiches to-go?  Both types are must-tries: the shawarma is a popular choice of many here, and all it takes is one bite for you to know why.  The sauce and garlic schmear combo is to-die-for!  And one would think that a pita with only lamb meat and lettuce sounds too simple to be so tasty, but it is!  The meat is so moist and tender, you really don't need any condiment.  Trust me.  Heck, don't trust me and order one plain and one with the works and judge them yourself; Most of the sandwiches costs less than $4 each!    BTW, you may elect to have whole wheat pita instead of the plain normally used.  You may also take Haji-Baba pitas home (made at the Haji-Baba bakery on Apache east of the restaurant); you may find them on the register counter.    You may pay for your take-out in advance and then wait for it to be prepared, or you may want to check out the grocery aisles as you're waiting and pay for everything at the end.  I suggest the chocoholics check out the Swiss chocolate bars here!  I've tried a few brands, and I just love the Milka brand: milk chocolate with whole hazelnut, milk and creamy white layered, plain milk chocolate.  (I love dark chocolate, but couldn't find one allergen-free.)  The flavors are so creamy and you can definitely taste the great quality ingredients used.  There are cheaper brands sold here, but a not-so-quick glance (you may or may not find English among the five or so languages listed on the back) will reveal that other vegetable fat, not cocoa butter, is used.  Go for the \"good chocolate\" brands; At two dollars or less a bar, you can leave with a goodie cache without having to spend much cash.    You'll most likely find something in the grocery you'll want to buy, so don't forget to remember to pick up your take-out order.  The chances of you forgetting about food, however, are slim since that is all you'll be thinking of the moment you walk into the place... the food aromas are mouth-watering!"}
{"text":"I go here alot because its delicious and super affordable. Great Middle eastern food. You know a restaurant is great if they can serve Lamb and it tastes fantastic! Some tips.. Go with the 'hand made pitas!"}
{"text":"Having frequented Haji's throughout my tenure at ASU, my boyfriend and I will sometimes come by for a Chicken Shawarma plate, extra pita and garlic when we're craving great food. The other day, we were too late stopping by another middle eastern restaurant as we had only an hour left until our show at Gammage played. We knew we wanted to sit down and eat, but were trying to figure out a place that would serve us, bill us, and send us on our way (in the most efficient and NICEST way possible). Haji's was it. It has been the EXACT same recipe since 2005 and if it ever changed I'd cry. It is THIS EXACT shawarma that made me attempt to remake it for my parents in DC. VERY TASTY, but nothing will ever be good as the original. I hope they know how much of an institution they are. LOVE!!!"}
{"text":"Exotic smells permeate the room as we enter the restaurant through a store selling middle eastern goods. Turning to our right we enter the restaurant and order kabobs.  The restaurant area is sparsely decorated but we don't mind.  Some of the best food comes from little hole-in-the-wall restaurants with little or no effort put into the decor.  The kabobs were not bad, they just weren't anything special.  The big disappointment was the rice.  It did not taste like basmati and did not have the saffron I'm used to seeing with rice when I order koubideh elsewhere.  There was a strange musty smell and taste to the rice that we just couldn't place.  We left most of the rice, and some of the kabob on the plate.  This would have been a two star experience if it hadn't been for the amazing selection of different types of baklava for sale in the little store.  That baklava was strictly 4 stars for both taste, texture, and freshness.  We bought one of each kind, pistachio baklava, almond baklava, every kind of baklava you can think of.  I highly recommend this little store for their baklava, I just wouldn't come back here to eat a meal."}
{"text":"Hands down, my favorite Mediterranean restaurant. I wish they were open later because y'all know I be cravin' that chicken shawarma and baba ganoush into the late hours of the night. Dine in can be a little awkward but their shop is cute. We usually do take out. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place is the bomb! I love their hummus!  It's great that they are still there."}
{"text":"I have eaten here MANY times and realized I have yet to leave review for Haji~Baba . I adore Middle Easter food if its done right. Here it is! Prices are well lets say amazing as the food! Chicken Shawerma  is my go to meal but I have tried the  kabobs and the Kafta is deelish as well. I also like their tabooli. The other yelpers are correct the hummus is out of the world, I could eat it every day.  It is a  very small pace but if there is a wait I browse the little market inside and drool over their bakery display case.  You can order to go as well."}
{"text":"The dish that stands out at Haji-Baba is their Chicken Shawarma - sandwich or plate. What makes this dish so good and delicious is I think the way Haji-Baba marinates and grills the chicken. And the chicken that comes out of the grill is tender, juicy and bursting with flavor - it is simply delicious. I've also had their chicken and beef kabobs and they are OK; taste wise the kabobs don't even come close to the chicken served in the Shawarma.   Also important to make note of is their Hummus; it is well prepared and can be eaten with a pita or used as excellent dipping sauce if you order kabobs."}
{"text":"Sorry fellow Yelpers, but I'm just not feeling it. On the outset, both my wife and I were happy with our dishes. I had the beef schwerma, she had the chicken schwerma plate. But a funny thing occurred, as we continued to eat, we became less and less excited about the prospects of eating our food, and more and more concerned about the quality of our meat, and ache in our bellies. Haji-Baba's was cheap, and that's good and all, but I think the next time I'm craving middle eastern, I'll find a different place...."}
{"text":"Pure awesomeness........ This is the best middle eastern restaurant we have been too in Phoenix.  The food is great, service is outstanding even when it is packed at lunch time.  Make sure to make time and pick up some treats from the store.  The baklava is to die for, just do it you deserve it."}
{"text":"I used to come here once a week but one time gyro meat was undercooked and nasty.  I haven't been back since.  But, the kefir cheese with the pita is amazing."}
{"text":"A friend recommended Haji-Baba's and I have to say I was really happy I listened. I thought she was crazy when she told me that I had to try the tabbouleh but boy was I wrong. It was amazing. They portion sizes and prices are great. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"3.5 stars  I ordered the vegetarian platter & hummus. Why is it so hard to find good hummus?!?! Their hummus was okay. The tabouli salad & falafel was good and their grape leaves were okay. It's pretty cheap though so I guess I shouldn't complain too much."}
{"text":"TL;dr amazing mediterranean food, with plenty of meat options that will blow your mind. you've never had meat like this before.  I'm really confused as to how I don't have a review for this place already. After living in Tempe/Phoenix for over 20 years, I remember craving gyros from Haji Baba even as a kid. In fact, I would venture to say Haji Baba and Baiz Market are the oldest, quality middle eastern shops in the valley.  Apparently my friend has never been here before, and I decided I would be a terrible friend if I never took him. Of course, he had trouble finding it because he thought it was a restaurant \"restaurant\" and not a hole-in-the-wall type place.  We were seated even though it was lunch, didn't take more than 10 minutes for our gyro plates to come out which were piled high with succulent gyro meat. To perfectly complement the star of the dish, there was white rice and a salad with plenty of unique dressing. Gyro meat by itself is usually amazing, simply because its meat, but when its accompanied with an amazing sauce, it really becomes stellar. The \"white sauce\" or what I think is an iteration of tsaziki sauce is perfect for the juicy ground lamb meat. If you haven't had gyro before and you want to give a try, I would definitely get the gyro plate at Haji Baba.  I almost forgot to mention that you can't leave Haji Baba without trying their baklava. Take your pick at which nuts you want. pistachio, almonds, walnuts, mixed, etc.   Aside from their restaurant food, my family usually buys groceries from here. One of our staples is pita bread, and you can usually get a box of pita bread for like $13. Freeze some of it, and use the rest as you wish. It goes perfectly with store bought hummus and foul (fava beans)."}
{"text":"I rediscovered Haji Baba recently, after eating here years ago and remembering it for having great, reasonably priced Middle Eastern food.  Coming here again, I am sad I didn't come here sooner after moving back to Arizona!  The chicken shawarma is to die for.  Perfectly grilled chicken is complemented with moist fluffy long grain rice, fresh tabbouli, excellent hummus, and an exquisite whipped garlic sauce.  They have some of the best hummus I've had since moving back here.  I've also been happy with their kibbee dish, which is kind of like the Middle Eastern version of meatloaf.  Food is prepared quickly, and while they do charge $.50 for any soda refills, I don't mind so much as long as they keep making that divine chicken shawarma.  I've also tried their vegetarian combo plate, and while I appreciate the enormous amount of food and great variety they give you with this dish, I think their main forte is in their meat dishes."}
{"text":"Dined here for ages! Epic selection of feta cheese if thats your thing - its mine. Amazing food and quite inexpensive. Gyro dishes are outstanding as is baba ganoush, tabooli and hummus. I don't get out to Tempe very often but when I do I always stop in for a snack. Turkish coffee there is awesome and will give you the strength of 10 mortal men/women...a heart murmur too. Baklava is to die for - pistachios, walnuts and cashews they got it all.   Wish the valley had more middle eastern restaurants. But for what they do Hajis is the best!!!"}
{"text":"Love love love. This is a very towny place to go, its been around forever.  Their food is great,  and you can't beat the price."}
{"text":"This place is the best Mediterranean food in town. Love it. When I'm not there I can't stop thinking about it. Gotta get the chicken shwarma plate, I promise you will not be sorry."}
{"text":"Been here a lot of the past few years. All I ever get is a falafel, which is the best you can find in the valley. Just perfect.  In the past I have also taken home some hummus, pita and olives as well as sweets, all excellent!. Lovely people working there, always feel welcome."}
{"text":"I have been here many times for delicious Mediterranean food but yesterday after eating half of a gyro sandwich I got terrible cramps and later spent the entire night sick from food poisoning. Will not be back again. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"Went there of recommendations from yelp.  Food was very good.  Place is crazy busy!!. Love the little shop inside the restaurant."}
{"text":"I've only eaten in the restaurant part of this place once several years ago but was looking to buy black Cardammon to use in making this home-made hard liquor based hot sauce that I read about in the Jan/Feb 2011 edition of Saveur magazine (number 25 of the 100 items identified as chefs' favorites), referred to as boozy hot sauce (I had something like it in Okinawa in November, which the locals make to put on their noodles, it was amazing). The prices on the spices were amazingly cheap and I bought several other spice items for when I do Indian based cooking (lentils are good for you but man they need some spices to taste interesting).  I had the good fortune to talk with the owner of the establishment. He told me the prices are so affordable because he deals with ethnic clientele  who use lots of spices and simply will not pay the sort of prices one sees in most stores. However, he assured me that he buys his spices in small batches (like 5 pounds) and then breaks them up himself and he checks everything when it comes in, if it doesn't smell fresh he sends it back and noted that he has a large base of customers that just buy from him for the spices.   My challenge, of course, is I don't know much at all about Middle Eastern cooking but if you are going to do it, this seems the place to buy the ingredients."}
{"text":"Well, I've been one of their loyal customer since I live in Tempe, AZ and I do enjoy their chicken shawarma from time to time. However, my last experience at this restaurant didn't go well. I wasn't going to post a review about it until that particular incident happen.   I called them at 12:48 for 10 chicken shawarma plates to go. We had a quick conversation and I was told it be ready in ten minutes. I said I'll be there in 15-20 and I was there as I promised. However, I found out that the guy who responded didn't add a zero next to 1 so they made it ready only one. I was totally cool with it cuz, we are human beings and mistaken are so normal. Despite I was in a little bit of rush I was ok with the whole situation. Then the gentlemen told me it will be ready in 2-3 minutes. I said you are fine I'll wait. So after 25 minutes- yes 25 minutes (a duration of numerous customers who are at tables in their restaurant, people who came to buy quick snack or grocery shoppers were served) - 7 of my 10 order was ready to go. They asked me if I'd like to pay after and I said yeah I will... I came to register I'm totally fine despite 45 min passed since my call for the order, and as I was paying the guy literally took some candies (I guess they were turkish delight or some other stuff and start stocking into bags as he was apologizing for the delay. I stopped him there ask not to do and as soon as the other 3 came, I left.   Now,  1) you don't satisfy your frustrated customers with randomly stocked candies  2) If you are sincere about your apology, you go with better solutions than candy( by the way, they candy is always unwrapped I am 100 sure they are all covered with the dust of all the customers walking in-how can you even sell that in the first place is another point 3) If I'd make a big fuss right there instead of writing a review here, probably I'd be the blamed one for making a big drama. Since I was pretty patient with the whole process, you gotta reward that kind customer attitude not with candy.   I am aware I kept forever but last thing, maybe people are enjoying here because they don't find many alternatives to this kind of cuisine and menu but I tell you that, if they would cook, serve the same way back in the hometown of where they are from, They would be one of those average restaurants. So, please whenever you are there; ask for cleanliness and better service and improvement inside the restaurant. Otherwise, if they are not challenged, they will continue to serve average level because of their preferable price/overall ratio."}
{"text":"This place is seriously a gem!! I loved their restaurant and I truly love their market area as well. Their chocolates are so awesome. They have many imported ones that is always fun to try.  I always get the plates when I sit at the restaurant and make sure to try their iced tea. Its a blend of chai and absolutely thirst quenching! The service is fast and they are very polite. Definitely one of my favorite restaurants."}
{"text":"Tasty...reasonable price, ample portions.  The chicken shwarma is delicious."}
{"text":"Prices are great food is better. Get the gyro deluxe, it's very filling. You also can't go wrong with the hummus or the falafel."}
{"text":"BEST CHICKEN SHAWARMA PLATE IN PHOENIX! I could eat this everyday. Worth the rush and small seating area."}
{"text":"The reviews don't lie. The gyro is 3.99 and better than any gyro in town.  I've been disappointed with other gyro s in tempe.  I will come back for sure."}
{"text":"I feel like the Haji-Baba experience is a coming of age one for Yelpers, and now I can join the club!  I came here today for lunch with Jon S. and our friend. We were quickly seated at a table in a mostly full dining room. Got our menus and our server came by soon enough to take our drink orders. Per other yelpers, I had the Turkish coffee with some water. Jon S. ordered some babaganush (btw excuse my spelling for this whole review, their menu isn't online so I have no idea how to spell these things). HEED THE ADVICE OF THOSE who say splurge the extra 30 something cents and get the handmade pita. It is worlds better than what you would get otherwise.   So we munched on the babag and pita and decided what to get. Our friend had been there once before and she got one of the veggie sandwiches, and because there's so much on the menu, Jon and I each got the combination plate. Not too long after, everything came out pretty quickly and hot. Even though I looked at what came with the plate, I had no idea what I was eating so I took it one item at a time.   Gyro meat = BOMB. mmm it was so good.   Not-handmade pita bread = disappointing after having the homemade  version.   Kibbi = I would compare it to the American meatloaf. It was a loaf that was tasty but a little dry.   Falafel = I was full when I got to tasting he falafel, but I really liked it.   Fried egg roll = Can't remember if there was another name for this, but it was surprisingly good. Filled with a bunch of beef, very good.  Stuffed grape leaves = Jon kinda hyped this up as he had heard good things about it. Eh, I guess it's an acquired taste, it was pretty bland, but tolerable when dipped in tzatziki.   Tabouli = the \"salad' on the plate. It was pretty citrusy and bitter for my taste, but Jon really liked it.   And I think that covers everything. While I wasn't a HUGE fan of the entire meal, it was definitely fresh, homemade, and a quality meal. And even though we tried a bunch of stuff, it wasn't nearly everything on the menu. I'll certainly be back."}
{"text":"Walking in I sense aromatic food items! The tabouli was fresh, crisp and amazing. I will be back again."}
{"text":"Needed a Mediterranean fix. We stopped by for a late afternoon snack. We had the Falafel Platter, a side order of Hummus and Olives. Excellent service and excellent food."}
{"text":"Falafel sandwiches here are tasty, filling, and cheap. Really, it is the best value in all of Tempe. Super affordable, and the falafel are quite tasty. I've had better falafel other places, but this place comes pretty close to being the best.   Also, I love their different varieties of baklava. Almond is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Haji Babba is awesome. The food is good and very well priced, the falfel and the baklava are the best in town. Try it you'll love it. The dolmas, and gyros schwermas are excellent. The market is really cool too. They sells tons of flavors of hashish and beautifully designed hookas and at their prices you will never find yourself in paraphernalia or trails again. They also have excellent teas, boxed goods, dishes and all sorts of cool beauty products. It's a lot of  fun to walk around and look at everything while your waiting for your food."}
{"text":"Came out to AZ to visit my cousin who lives not too far in Scottsdale. Honestly one of the better middle eastern restaurants I've been too. really enjoyed the grocery store/restaurant vibes. The food was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic, New York deli style restaurant. You can't go wrong checking this out."}
{"text":"delightful hole in the wall. Have eaten here countless times, and the food is absolutely consistent, delicious, and amazing, regardless of when, or what you order. Waiters are great, funny, friendly, and remember your face. Prices are SO LOW and the food is SO SO SO SO SO SO good. I'm totally lucky to live near this gem!"}
{"text":"I found everything I've ever tried at Haji-Baba to just be \"okay\".  Don't get me wrong, when food is just \"okay\", it's not \"bad\", it's not \"awful\", but it's certainly not \"great\". I tried the hummus and chicken schwarma and there was nothing about either that made it significantly better than the next Middle Eastern joint in Tempe. To top it off, some of the younger staff members are rude and full of themselves and that is pretty irritating. The food was all presented well but there were some things on the plate that were a bit questionable.  I do like the attached shop. This is very traditional for Middle Eastern restaurants. It was nice to take a stroll up and down the aisles after our meal.  All in all, decent."}
{"text":"I can't believe I never before wrote a review of Haji-Baba.  I've literally been going here with varying regularity for most of my life.  I have probably tried most of the menu and never ever had a bad experience, but will admit that I probably fall back on the falafel sandwich more than half the time I go to Haji-Baba.  It really is the best falafel in town.  Additional tip, pick up some decadent baklava (several varieties) or other freshly made Mediterranean pastries and a package of the best pitas in town, along with some other ethnic groceries on your way out.  My promise: you will be happy to know about this place once you try it out."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mediterranean food I've had in a long time! You know it's authentic when it's in the middle of a grocery store lol. But the restaurant portion is actually quite large and is pretty closed off from the rest of the store. The servers were super nice and gave us great recommendations, and the food came out in less than 5 minutes once we had ordered.   The platters are delicious and the portions are HUGE for only $8.99 - definitely had enough leftovers for a whole other meal. I got the gyro plate, which comes with gyro meat, pita, salad, and rice. The meat by itself is slightly salty but everything combined tastes amazing. The dressing on the salad was also pretty unique. My friends got the chicken shawarma plate, which comes with chicken, pita, hummus, tabouli, and rice, and loved it as well. Their only critique was that the garlic sauce was a bit strong, so avoid if you don't like garlic.  Note: when you're done, you can take the receipt/bill up to the main grocery store check-out. We sat around for like 20 minutes before we realized we were supposed to go up and pay lol."}
{"text":"Loved the vibe with the Middle Eastern market. Servers were very friendly, and the menu was approachable for the vanilla people :) I had the ground lamb kabob, and the balance of flavors was incredible. Highly recommend -- one of my new favorite EV lunch/dinner spots"}
{"text":"Best gyro for a great price! This is a true hole in the wall with an authentic feel. The restaurant is located in a small Mediterranean supermarket. You can get both dinner and some authentic spices and tea. They also do take out if you are looking for a night in with great food."}
{"text":"I like Haji-Baba quite a lot. They have a delicious falafel sandwich that is priced well. If you are a vegan or vegetarian like me, this is a big deal. Granted, that's about all I can order here, but it's worth it. Probably the best part about Haji-Baba, though, is their market. The food and kitchen tools are reasonably priced."}
{"text":"Yes.  Yes.  And yes.   Go.  Eat.  Eat more.     Very Very good, well prepared fare (with big portions) very reasonable priced.     And the baklava?   Omg.   Pistachio.  Mixed nuts.  Cashew.   You can't go wrong.     And if you need some olive oil or something else?  Just buy it in the attached small market.  Another dive of a place (though it's clean - just not fancy at all) that shouldn't be missed."}
{"text":"If you want the best Mediterranean food experience I highly recommend Haji Baba. The first must-try item on the menu here is the chicken shawarma plate combination. It is my absolute favorite item. Also they have a nice grocery store where you can purchase international food items as well as fresh deli & bakery goods. The baklava & fresh olives are to die for."}
{"text":"The food is extremely authentic. Took me back to my childhood! Service was great and prices are beyond fair for the amount of food you get. If you're craving Mediterranean food, this is the spot FOR SURE."}
{"text":"Great authentic food, and the service is excellent. I recommend either the mixed grill or the chicken shawarma plate!"}
{"text":"Solid middle eastern food espcially for phoenix/tempe. Its basically a restaurant in a grocery store. We walked in around lunchtime on a Sunday and were seated fairly promptly. I had the Chicken Swarma Plate and my brother had the baba ghanoosh and a chicken wrap. Prices are very reasonable our bill combined was 24 bucks. The place was pretty busy to which is always a good sign for a random 'hole in the wall' restaurant.  As for the actual meal, as you can see in my attached picture the portions were very large. Plenty of chicken rice garlic sauce etc.  Chicken was succulent and the 'arabic bread' they included was nice.  I've had better in LA and Detroit but all in all an above average meal esp for the price. Also when u pay u walk up to the cashier  and pay which I prefer. The whole place has a family run business vibe too it."}
{"text":"Delicious lunch for a fast paced life. I love the atmosphere and the new world that I feel like I'm stepping into everytime I go here"}
{"text":"This place was kind of like all the other middle eastern joints in the area. They aren't anything too fancy. I got the gyro wrap and it was pretty good for what it was. I wasn't too intrigued by it. The service was a little slow but the staff is very friendly. I'd come back again but this time as a takeout option."}
{"text":"I understand that mostly everyone here loves Haji-Baba and I came in wanting to love the place too. We came in for lunch and the place was packed with customers. Despite the business, our food came pretty fast. However, afterwards the food made me sick and I am do not plan on coming back because of this incident."}
{"text":"OK so I'm still amazed how a place can exist for so long be soooo goood, and me not know about it! This place is family owned and has been here for 30 years. The server is family, he was friendly and went out of his way to make sure I made the right choices. He explained what things were and what they tasted like. He even suggested I NOT order something and try something else. It was a perfect fit for me too! The prices are big, the food is very good, and the portions are bigger than most every other place I've been.  I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I have been going to Haji-Baba for over 15 years and have never had a bad meal or bad service! I have tried kabobs, falafel, gyros, baklava, the amazing lemonade with rose water, and have bought many products from the grocery part of the store. My favorite is the gyros plate. It comes with traditional lamb gyros meat, half a pita, a large portion of aromatic rice and a small salad with an excellent dill dressing!  The prices are fair, the quality is excellent and the service is excellent!  Haji-Baba gets my highest recommendation!"}
{"text":"Love this place.  Incredible, authentic Middle Eastern food and great prices.  Nice little market for hard to find things from the region."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. The minute you get to the parking lot you can already smell how great this food is. We started with feta cheese and pita bread and it was probably some of the best feta I've ever had. The best part is that they make their feta cheese fresh so you know it's not from some container they bought at the local store. I ended up getting the shish kabob, which essentially is the lamb kabob and it was out of this world. Perfectly cooked and served with a huge portion of rice and salad that was also great. The portions are great, atmosphere is cool, and the service very friendly. This is a place you need to check out especially if you're a first timer to middle eastern food!"}
{"text":"Love this place!  Fast service, cheap food and TASTY. Best for a quick bite with a bunch of friends or when you are lazy to cook. Serving size is good and portions are filling. Closes before 8 on weekdays, closed on Sunday.  If you like Greek food, you will like it."}
{"text":"I am conflicted.  Haji-Baba, as a restaurant, has some five star strengths and some one star weaknesses.  The strengths: very large portions of food, all of which are appealing even to people who are not familiar with middle eastern cuisine; low prices; an ethnic grocery attached which is a pleasant diversion while you are waiting for your food.    The weaknesses: virtually everything is underspiced, so you get tired of it after two or three bytes.  Apparently, lemon and garlic are spices-non-grata in this kitchen, and even salt and pepper are used sparingly.  For $2.60 you get enough hummous for two, as an appetiser, but you won't want to finish it.  It reminds me a lot of paste.  And the pita (bread) was going stale. Exceptions: their take on a meat-stuffed eggroll, and, believe it or not, the gyros.  Also well-spiced: a variety of sauces which helps offset the blandness of the food.  I must also comment on the tabouleh (which here means ground parsley) served as a huge mound on most plates; it would feed a baseball team, but it, too, is tasteless.  Other, much smaller, issues: it can get crowded, the ambiance does not exist, and they have an odd system for paying your check which puts you in a line with the people buying groceries and can be slow.  Hints: 1.  Order the Combination plate.  For $12 it is definitely enough for two average appetites and you don't get bored so easily.   2.  They have a large grocery using the same name 3/4 mile east. The restaurant is a smaller place hidden away in a strip mall."}
{"text":"Haji-Baba seriously has the best middle eastern cuisine south of the 202, and arguably in the valley. Nearly every time I get the chicken salad with extra dressing.. Uhh its so good I could bottle it and drink it. Every once in a while I will venture out and try something different, and it has all been amazeballs. Although some may argue that all of its charm is the hole in the wall ambiance, I would beg to differ. This place is swamped at all hours of the day, I know they have enough money to do a small remodel. I mean I don't think the building interior has been touched or updated since dinosaurs roamed the earth. Nevertheless, I don't want to take away from the deliciousness and the joy that their food brings me, but it would make me so happy to see the day that their restaurant dining experience to reflect wonderful their food truly is."}
{"text":"Two words:  Chicken shawarma.    That is definitely not an original thought when it comes to this place - but it is that tasty!  I am one of the most picky eaters in Phoenix and I am usually very much about \"atmosphere\" - but this place ROCKS.  If you are new to the valley (can't imagine another scenario where you wouldn't have been here already) you MUST GO!"}
{"text":"I am infuriated to say the least! I just walked out of this place because the waiter completely ignored me.  He started taking orders from guests that arrived arrived way after me, didn't even offer water, utensils, napkins, nothing! When I politely stopped and asked him weather he forgot about me, is arrogant response was \"I know, one by one...\" And I said I had been there before everyone else and been waiting for 10 minutes plus.  I just walked out, called the manager to complain.   arrogant people, Skip it, go somewhere else for authentic Persian food. Besides, this is not even Persian from reading the menu.   Thanks for wasting my time, I came all the way from Chandler after reading good reviews but I regret it.   ----  So, I found Tasty Kabob across the street and it's authentic Persian! 1000% better than this grocery store with GQ wanna be model waiter."}
{"text":"I have been going to Haji Baba for about 18 years now and I have to say, I love, love, love Haji Baba!  Thank you for so many years of service & excellent food!"}
{"text":"I have no idea why anyone, especially a middle eastern person, would ever recommend this place for food. It was barely edible. The employees are nice and it's a no frills kinda place--really casual environment right in Tempe. But wow, the food was terrible. And I'm not just basing this off just one dish. Firstly, it was not authentic tasting at all. I assume the good reviews stem from those who don't know what real Middle Eastern food tastes like. Secondly, the tabouli tastes like the packaged kind you can buy at any other middle eastern market....it ain't good. The kefta was not kefta. TBH, I'm not sure what it was. So maybe the other dishes are not bad but deff don't expect anything edible out of any of the meat dishes."}
{"text":"Awesome!  Our new \"go\" to place for middle eastern food.  Much, much better than Baiz Market.  Also, extremely cheap.  We had the koubeh and kibbedeh plates, along with sides of foul, falafel, a yogurt soda and two orders of baklava to go for the amazingly small sum of $27.  How are you going to beat that ?   Due to the unexpectedly huge portion sizes, we ended up taking most of it home.  Everything was delicious and the service was very fast even though it was packed.    Head and shoulders above every other middle eastern place I've eaten at in town.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This place is not hyped.  Truly the best Gyro I have ever had.  Their chicken shawarma plate is plentiful too, enough to share with 3 people! We always get extra garlic sauce on the side because it goes good with everything.  I have not tried anything here I do not like.    Must tries: Gyro Sandwich Chicken Shawarma plate Pistachio Baklava   Extra garlic sauce please!"}
{"text":"Why didn't I know about this place? I guess my friend Sarah has been hounding me to go here for years, but tonight was my first visit. Where's my time machine so I can go back and eat here more.  I was torn whether to give it a 4 or a 5... The decor is an afterthought - in fact, the restaurant part of it seems to be tacked on to an international foods market. The market side has some amazing foods you won't find in many other places around the Valley - definitely worth going out of your way to check out.   There were 3 of us, and we grabbed a table and sat down. It didn't take long to decide what we wanted - turns out we just about wanted a little bit of everything. The prices on the menu looked like they were from another time. I thought they gave us the old menus by accident. Let me put it this way - the prices were so low, I questioned the quality of the food I was about to eat...   We placed our order, and within a few minutes our table was filled with plates of beautiful food. This was as troubling as the prices - fast food prices and fast food service usually mean fast food and subsequent ring sting. Well, this is not the case. The food here was fantastic. I would say the food is a solid 4. It's not the best example of gyros and hummus etc that I've had, but it ranked quite high. It was delicious and flavorful, and everything seemed to be really fresh.   I cleaned my plate and picked at just about everything - we all shared a bit. Every mouthful was a treat. The service was more fast and efficient than it was friendly, but I never felt unwelcome. In a place like this, I'd rather have a no bullshit sort of experience. Just get this food into my bloodstream as expediently as possible. Really though, the service was plenty nice.   After we finished eating, we wandered around the market side and shopped a bit. We wanted to take so many things home with us - teas, sweets, spices, honey, and assorted unique items... We're definitely going back.   This is a divey hole-in-the-wall that deserves all the praise it is getting. If it turns out to be as reliable and consistent as I've heard it is, we're going to be regulars. If you twisted my arm to complain, I would say it is pretty inconveniently located (or extra convenient depending on from where and how you get there) - I just find it a bit of a pain in the ass trying to drive around and make turns on Apache since the Light Rail went live.   I can tell you this - if you're thinking of eating at Pita Jungle down the street - give this a shot instead. I still love Pita Jungle, but this wins on price and speed, ties on deliciousness, and only loses on decor. It's not a first date spot - it's more of a 4th date spot... impress her with the awesome and interesting eclectic hole in the wall joint."}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD AT GREAT PRICES. What more could you ask for?  This place is truly a gem. Little hole in the wall located in Tempe, AZ. I have been coming here for years and I always get the chicken shawarma plate with extra pita bread for my hummus. I love when the pita bread is burned a little bit because I prefer the crispier taste. The plate comes with chicken, rice, hummus, and tabouli. I prefer this place over pita jungle to be honest. The location is small, but the food is always good and consistent. :)  The grocery store is cool to browse around after you're done eating. They have spices and other cool treats for cheap. I would try the Baklava if I were you. One of the best Baklavas I have ever had.  Tip: When you're done eating, you pay at the grocery store."}
{"text":"Authentic (I guess... what do i know? ) middle eastern food.  Usually pretty crowded at lunch time tho."}
{"text":"What amazing food ! Very quick and quiet authentic. We ordered the veggie platter and falafel. Everything was fresh and tasty. The service was good. Even during the billing proc as the management was courteous."}
{"text":"We have tried many middle eastern restaurants over the years.  I was introduced to Haji Baba during my college years - almost 20 years ago.    Hands down, it is the BEST middle eastern food around and the prices can't be beat.  We moved to Utah about 10 years ago and searched for food that was as tasty as it is here.  At the end of the meal, we would say, \"well, it was okay, but it's no Haji Baba.\"  When we decided to move back to Arizona, the first place we went for lunch out was Haji Baba!  It continues to be delicious.  I also love the market that is inside.  I buy all of my feta here as well as greek olives.  They have awesome prices on the feta and olives as well as spices that can be hard to find elsewhere.    There are several things worthy of complaining about, but the food is so good that it makes it all worth it.  This place is very popular, which makes it difficult to find a table during peak times.  Lunch is crazy busy!  The service in the restaurant leaves something to be desired.  It's pretty bare bones and definitely not at all like the nice chain greek restaurants (think My Big Fat Greek....)  We no longer eat in the restaurant, we now go for take out.  This place does a huge amount of take out so call your order in ahead of time.  Great food, good portion sizes, great prices.  I don't know why we keep trying different middle eastern food restaurants, it's Haji Baba's gyros that we always wish we had eaten instead!  Nothing is better!"}
{"text":"This place has really good and really bad aspects to it.  The good is that most of the food is pretty good.  The bad is the service/overall friendliness.    The hummus, babaganoush, gyros,  feta (of various varieties) are all great.  The falafel isn't great -- dense & tough without a huge amount of flavor.  My mother refers to the service as like the Soup Nazi in Seinfeld... don't ask for any favors.  For instance, we went on Sunday at 4:30pm,  Yelp says open until 5pm, the door says open until 5pm.  We went to the counter and they say  \"sorry we close at 4:30\" (we were there at 4:32).  Out of the \"goodness\" of their hearts, they give us salad and falafel and hummus but nothing else.  Anyways, the food would get 4* the service gets a 1*.   I'll be generous and give 3*."}
{"text":"I love this place. My husband and I have been coming here for over a decade. The food is always fresh and delicious. The environment warm and friendly. Service is great! Also if you'd like to shop for unique spices, great pitas or exotic incenses there is a small market adjacent to the restaurant."}
{"text":"Don't let Haji Baba's humble appearance fool you, this is probably one of the best restaurants in all of Tempe. I've never had chicken shawarma like they make it at Haji Baba. They always serve it with just enough garlic sauce, unlike many other Middle Eastern restaurants in Tempe.  It gets packed around 11:30am-1pm, but still wait for a table instead of ordering to go. Your order will get pushed back behind all ones for people who are seated if you order to go and it will take about 40 minutes to get anything."}
{"text":"Started with the olives and babaganoush.  Tasty olive selection.  The babaganoush wasn't the best I've ever had, but it was pretty good.  My daughter had the kabob koubideh sandwich, which I just happened to take a bite or three of when she was done.  Nice and savory and perfectly cooked.  My sister had the chicken schwarma, of which I had a bite and the chicken was tender and flavorful.  I had the combination combination plate.  The gyro meat was very savory and my favorite part of the meal.  The grape leaves, with the warm orange rice, were the best I've ever had.  The falafel were average.  Too much crunch and not enough flavor.  The tabooli was the perfect complement to the savory meat.  I'm not a huge kibbeh fan, but it was decent.  The sambousek was delicious.    Good service.  Next time I go, I want a tour of the grocery store."}
{"text":"I found this place from other reviews here on YELP (and double-checking for recent inspection reports on Maricopa.gov site...this place usually gets SILVER or GOLD awards! No worries...)  It was EVERYTHING I read about...the food was incredibly inexpensive and pretty good! I tried the Gyro Deluxe, which is a gyro with onions, feta, dressing, lettuce, & tomato on a pita for about $4.25...really good (except for the PITA was stale and started to fall apart, like it was old!)  Of course, they served us MORE stale pita with the bland hummus...a little disappointing.  It is 1/2 market and 1/2 sit down restaurant. They have a counter for take-out orders. It's not fancy by any means, but good food in a clean place at a great price is what you can expect here.  The water is nasty Phoenix Tap (not the filtered version), but they sell bottles of Arrowhead water in the sports top for .99 cents in the market part of the place....good price!  There is only one restroom, usually it's occupied.  I always see the same two waiters...one older skinny middle eastern guy and the other younger dude reminds me of Adam Sandler's Don't Mess with the Zohan...hee hee!  If I were driving down the street, I wouldn't had thought about eating here. It's busy and worth some good eats."}
{"text":"Very inexpensive delicious food. Their vegetarian plate is so good. They'll substitute things for you too. Their rosewater lemonade is amazing. Waiters and guys behind the counter are so nice and funny. They have a little grocery store thing going on in there too, with a lot of interesting stuff. Definitely go here if you want good greek food!!!"}
{"text":"Love this place! It's great immersion in to world of their cuisine. Not only do you have a restaurant inside you also get an ethnic grocery store and bakery.  When you walk in you are all your senses are overwhelmed. The smell from the cooking food just makes you want to run to the counter and order everything that is on the menu. And if you can control yourself form doing that you walk by any aisle of goodies ranging from crackers and cookies to delectable chocolates you can't easily find anywhere else. If you are not sitting down to eat and just getting something to take home you will arrive at the baklava counter to order with just as many dessert in the case as on top. The sandwiches are a great grab and go lunch that will have you craving more for dinner. As for dine in you can't go wrong with trying any of the plates. I personally recommend the chicken shawarma plate if you're new to get a good sample of the food. The tabooli and hummus that it comes with are on point."}
{"text":"It's no coincidence that a place as inconspicuous as Haji-Baba could get so many Yelp reviews (and most of them stellar).  This was the first place I ever met fellow Yelpers in Phoenix, as it was the venue for an UYE (Unofficial Yelp Event) and I was brand new to the valley.  It did not disappoint... the food is amazing, for both the price and the quality.  And, of course, I was thrilled to discover how nice all of the new people I met from Phoenix were.  I've continued the tradition of introducting people from out of town to one of Phoenix's (Tempe... you know) brightest gems.  Even a friend from Napa, who knows fine wine and fine dining, was blown away by the food here.  I had the chicken schwarma platter which, in my opinion, is the best sampler of what they offer here: delicate Basmati rice, creamy creamy hummus, spicy chunky chicken and tabouleh (I believe that's what they call the greenish side salad-ish stuff). My dining companions ordered the gyro platter and were happy as can be.  Another treat here, besides the incredible food, is the grocery store.  I was on a mission to find a spicy Tunisian pepper condiment, harissa, for eventual use in homemade merguez sausages. I found it and have it tucked away for the next time I dare to make my own sausage.  Haji Baba has become my one-stop shop for all things Middle Eastern and delicious."}
{"text":"Best Mediterranean food in town. This restaurant is casual and half of the space is a market with everything from candy to spices to jars of banana peppers. My two favorite things on the menu are the DLX gyro and the chicken shawarma plate. The gyro is packed with feta cheese and the meat has a great seasoned flavor. The shawarma plate comes with hummus, tabooli, rice, and pita. I like to mix mine all together as it creates a nice flavor combination. Other highlights are the hummus plate appetizer and the rose water lemonade. The babaganooj can be good but it is a bit unreliable here and sometimes it tastes very different than usual. Make sure you grab a baklava on your way out!"}
{"text":"The best gyros ever! The sandwich is tender and tasty. The sauce is flavorful, the feta tastes fresh. Order two because you will want to eat it again! Service is okay & friendly."}
{"text":"The BEST chicken shawarma in AZ hands down.  I started my Haji love affair in college, and have introduced many friends to this charming little hole in the wall over the years.  The ambiance is not great, but the food more than makes up for it.  They are crazy that they are still this inexpensive, where else can you get a gyro for under $5?!  I always get the same thing tho, the chicken shawarma.  It comes with a big plate of rice, hummus, taboule, and garlic sauce.  O.m.g. good.  Bonus that I get to also do a lil grocery shopping on my way out."}
{"text":"I had no lunch plans and was looking for a new spot. Now I must admit that this was before I had been turned onto Yelp so I was still relying on colleague recommendations.   Having grown up on Middle Eastern food any opportunity I get to take down an authentic Gyro I won't pass up. So my buddy Dan and I go to one of his old local favorites Haji-Baba.   I order the Gyro and fries and was blown away. The price was cheap; the meat was well seasoned and thinly sliced. I hate it when they slice it too thick.  All in all I had a great time the only reason why it didn't get five stars is it took a while because it was slammed during lunch. But if you work anywhere near ASU in Tempe and are craving a good Gyro don't think twice...Haji Baba."}
{"text":"Go and check chicken Shawarma out. It's  a big  dish so if you don't eat too much you might want to share it with your friend."}
{"text":"The food is horrible.  I never had such dried out gyro meat in my life.  The sauce that came with it was unrecognizable because it was so watered down and tasteless.  The place is absolutely filthy.  The products they sell in the grocery store side have been on those shelves for years.  There is much better elsewhere.  Oh yes, it is cheap, and that's probably the only good thing."}
{"text":"Still on the hunt for the best baba ganoush!  Solid 9 out of 10 stars! Delish!  Fast, friendly service.  Little hole in the wall in Tempe. (Those are usually the best kind of places right!)  Not a lot of options for the vegan/vegetarian but I was only there for the baba g anyways.  Huge bags of bulk Rice in their little mini market which seemed like decent pricing which I will be back for.  Definitely on my list to return!"}
{"text":"This place was AMAZING!! We got here 2 minutes before they closed and they seated us right away :) My boyfriend and I both ordered lamb gyro plates with a side of hummus & pita.  This place was SO GOOD & I was really impressed with the quality of the food. This little spot is located inside of a grocery store & we even walked around and bought some candy after dinner. I can't wait to return here for mediterranean food!!"}
{"text":"Whoa, Yelp - you really shined on this one! Reading several Yelps describing the great prices, portions and quality I had to see for myself... The location is conveniently close to the ASU campus, though you need to be ready for the turn as the place is a little hard to spot..    Wanting to spice things up for a looong Monday I felt compelled to follow the suggestions of 6-year Haji-Babanian veteran Alexis R. and went for the lamb tongue sandwich with babaganooj appetizer. The baba' came out first, quickly and with accompanying pita bread - bursting with flavor.. I'm glad the sandwich came out fast too, else I miss the chance to throw some 'ganoush in there for good measure.    The sandwich was tasty, and different (and my supernormal appetite would not have protested more meat).. Would try again, likely in the 'platter' form that includes more food and variety for under $10.    This would suffice for a good review yet the place is half devoted to a cultural grocery store! I had a nice chat with Mohammad up front, picked up 2 varieties of baklava for dessert and a packet of beef shwarma spices for a future attempt at some home cookin'!"}
{"text":"Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Based on the chicken schwarma plate and the lamb tongue pita, 5 stinkin stars.  Seating can suck when it's busy.  If you're over the age of 8, you have the capacity to be patient and handle it.  The lamb tongue is moist and well-seasoned and delicious.  The very first time I had it, I was thrown off by the pickle in the pita, but I like it there now.  A little tart acidity to balance the richness of the tongue meat.  I don't understand people's aversion to tongue.  Whether it's beef or lamb, its flavor is peerless and it can be one of the most tender cuts of meat.  This is one of the best chicken schwarma plates anywhere.  Every element on the plate, apart from being huge, is good.  More garlic sauce would be appreciated, but again, no real complaints.  (The pita, sometimes, is lacking.)  It is all well-seasoned, the chicken isn't overcooked, flavorful, with a nice and fresh tasting taboulleh - it hits the spot every time.    Even my wife, who does not really enjoy Middle Eastern food, enjoys this place.  That says a lot."}
{"text":"It doesn't look much from the outside, but I was surprised to see that it was busy and full. My husband and I got the Veggie Combo Platter, Hummus and Turkish Coffee. The Veggie Platter came with baba ghanouj, tabouleh, a yogurt dip, two pieces of falafel and two pieces of dolma along with some pita bread. Everything tasted fresh and great. The Turkish coffee had a tinge of cardamom in it which I really liked. For dessert, we got a walnut baklava and a pistachio baklava. It is probably the best baklava that I have eaten so far in my life. Plenty of vegetarian options in the menu. I'll be coming back to Haji-Baba just for the hummus and the baklava."}
{"text":"We come here for the grocery, and more importantly, the food! Not the cleanest atmosphere, but they have a great selection of spices and ingredients. The wholesale warehouse a ways down the street is now open to the public and has more of a selection for grocery stuff.  The restaurant is known for the food, not the service. They have a simple menu, hand cooked food, and cheap prices. Falafel is tasty and they have a good selection of necessities; tabbouleh, gyro meat, rice, salads, pitas, and dessert. You can go in and get the food for take out, or take a seat for a quick bite on the other half of the store.  I would highly recommend the chicken shawarma plate. You'll be stuffed if you finish the whole thing, but I always want more, and as soon as I leave I think of the next time I get to go back and get it again. It has a great sampling of the best seasoned tabbouleh I've had at a restaurant, creamy hummus and some amazing garlic sauce. The chicken is moist and you cannot go wrong with putting sumac on everything (the dark red spice in the glass shaker on the table). Finish off with some of the amazing baklava and you'll be all set for the day!  Staff is friendly, and this place is worth going to if you need middle eastern spices and canned goods that you can't get at a normal grocery store."}
{"text":"Just had lunch at this place for the first time. After all the outstanding reviews I tried the Chicken Shawarma sandwich and some hummus. Hummas was okay, not a lot of flavor. The sandwich was not that great. The chicken was dry and overcooked and while it was grilled, it tasted more like dried out hunks from the bottom of a pan. The sauce they added was all that saved my lunch. I would have sent it back at another place, but after all the disciple reviews, I felt guilty for not liking it. Maybe I got an off batch of chicken.   My friend tried the beef shawarma plate. The beef was also overcooked and dry and the rice had a flavor that hit your nose like a fish tank. I'm really not being mean or snarky. It smelled like fish tank water. Taste was okay.  Place was packed, so it's a popular spot, but I won't hurry back. Service was fast. Prices were reasonable. Store has some cool items.   I was disappointed after so many great reviews."}
{"text":"I met up with some friends. This place was highly recommended to me by my girlfriend and her hubby. They go here often. The place is old and could use an update on their interior BUT their food is great! I had their chicken shawarma plate. It was a large portion and I shared it with my kids. Their fresh handmade pita is the best!!! And oh yes, don't order their yogurt soda drink- it's not the best tasting and they will inform you \"no refund! \" :)"}
{"text":"Delicious chicken shawarma with an amazing creamy garlic sauce, and the HUMMUS.  Best hummus I have ever had, I'll definitely come here again to try the other dishes!"}
{"text":"Love this place. The flavors are spot on, the portions generous and the people are nice."}
{"text":"I've been shopping and eating here for years.   I love the food,  the price,  and the groceries.   I get things here you can't get at the supermarket.    I especially love to order the vegetarian platter,  but I've had almost everything on the menu,  and have never been disappointed!"}
{"text":"Authentic and delicious! I've only tried one thing on the menu and haven't veered since it is that amazing! Don't forget baklava;the cashew one is my favorite."}
{"text":"This is my favorite restaurant in the city. Delicious food, crazy cheap. I eat here multiple times a week."}
{"text":"If you're looking for middle eastern food in Tempe, this is a must. While the food can be slightly blander at times than some over-spiced alternatives the menu options are all delicious, the food has an authentic taste to it, and is packed with flavor.  Great venue and one of Tempe's cornerstones."}
{"text":"I've been back two more times this week. Three times in one week to a single place is a new record for me. I have had a chance to try the koobideah and the beef shawarma. Both were very good, but to me nothing compares to their chicken shawarma. I'll keep sampling though."}
{"text":"I have been going to Haji Baba's since I was a kid. I grew up eating Lebanese food so this little place is like a taste of home. I love their restaurant! The food is outstanding and priced very reasonably. I have tried all the plates and loved them all. One of my favorites is their falafel. Delicious! They actually have their own falafel mix frozen to buy and cook at home! And in the market I can find everything I need to prepare a meal and then some. The guys who work there are very helpful and nice. I will definitely continue to patronize this amazing little place!"}
{"text":"Another Gem in Tempe!   My party of 3 ordered the Gyros Plate and the Gyros Sandwich. I still can't get over how cheap and delicious the food was! The Gyros Plate totaled to $7.49 and the Gyros Sandwich was only $3.69. Splitting the Gyros Plate is a fantastic idea since the portions are huge enough to feed two people. What I absolutely love about the place is the lamb was so soft and tender. The plate also came with the salad with a unique dressing--It was the first thing I gobbled down! Adding siracha gives the food an extra kick, but its not necessary to add since each bite is so savory! The hummus was A-OK, and I would suggest passing on that.  Overall, the place has slightly loud Middle Eastern music in the background, great service, and great food (most important)."}
{"text":"We just moved to Arizona and have been busy checking out all the cool places to eat & shop. Living out in Laveen we were craving some Middle Eastern food and found this lovely gem on the East side. Visited on a Saturday afternoon about 3pm and the place was rockin' I can see why. The feel is super casual, affordable & food is delicious! We will definitely be coming back again. Not seen here is a Falafil wrap and a Shish wrap, both very filling and delicious. Loved the market as well. I enjoyed taking some Labneh (kefir cheese) back home as well as some sweets. Glad we found this grocery/restaurant on our explorations of the area. Can't wait to go back again."}
{"text":"Haji Baba is good. Not exceptional, but good. I don't understand all the fuss about this place, kind of like Fez where everyone raves about it and I just don't get it, so maybe it is me.   There is no atmosphere to speak of, what so ever, not that its a bad thing. The place is sectioned off into two portions, one a dining area, and one a grocery store. We were seated at one of the tables in the grocery store, like.... IN the grocery store. No complaints here, I find something oddly comforting about eating in a place like this.  The food was good, hummus though was very good. We had a nice array of salads, gyros, shwarmas, hummus, spanikopita, baklava, etc. All sorts of shit was at the table, and it was all good, but none of it made me go oh man this is the best I've ever had.   I'd return for two reasons, one is the price. Dinner for 4 with more than we could eat was less than $30. reason two is the great service. We didn't more than 5 minutes for ANYthing. They are quick here, and very accommodating."}
{"text":"Best middle eastern food I've had outside of the Middle East. So delicious, cheap, huge portions. Awesome little market of middle eastern goods attached. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Mmmmm.... Love this place! Make it a point to go here every chance I can! The vegetarian combo is my fave. Staff is always nice and polite and right on it... even at their busiest! Had lunch there last weekend again with a good friend... and although he is not generally adventurous when it comes to something other than meat and potatoes this has become one of his favorite places too... Now if I can get him to try something other than the beef schwarma! : )   The food is consistently good, service is always good and the market is fun to browse in after a great meal!"}
{"text":"I love this place. My mom and I went here for lunch. I ordered the Chicken Schwarma which came with hummus, tabooli, rice, and pita bread. The portions are huge. My mom got the lamb kabab and was very pleased at the tenderness and taste of the meat. Everything was so fresh and out waiter was so nice and accommodating. I will definitely come back anytime I am in the area. Delicious!"}
{"text":"Nice food. Ordered takeouts a couple of times from this place and they never disappointed me. Maybe add more spices?"}
{"text":"Good, fast, cheap food!  The falafil was great, all ingredients tasted fresh, and as a bonus they have a great little shop attached containing lots of things you can't get at your local grocer, from tobacco to spices & desserts."}
{"text":"I just had their gyro dinner and was very happy with the food.  It tasted good and was reasonably priced.  Didn't take very long for takeout either.  The hummus was kind of bland though, and they didn't give me much pita to go with it.  Hand made pita was very good."}
{"text":"Great Middle Eastern food at the super price!  I come to this place often and always leave full and happy.  Half of the place it a grocery store with all sorts of fun stuff to buy!  I tend to pick up a few things after eating.  The sign on the front does not stand out at all.  They should get a nice light up sign even though they have no problem filling all the seats.    Further east on the same road they have a larger grocery store which I have not been to but I should check it out soon.  You can't beat the prices on the sandwiches for the amount of food you get.  Check this place out and you may just become a regular!"}
{"text":"I have been around the Tempe area and most of the central phoenix and not many Mediterranean businesses compare to this place. Haji Baba has a very traditional but calm atmosphere. They have a restaurant and two locations on Main ave. The first one has a restaurant and serve very very delicious Mediterranean food and drinks. The second location is much bigger and offer more of a variety of Mediterranean foods at very good costs. If your in the area and want a taste for mediterranean, check this place out."}
{"text":"liked this vibe inside with the market restaurant combo.  quiet environment and prompt service makes for a good dinner.  ordered 3 items off the smaller plate menu thinking i wouldnt be overindulging.  i was wrong.  ordered hummus, nothing special there but would order it again as hummus really isnt anything special in the first place.  greeek salad was really good, could have used a little less dressing, but the olives alone were worth it.  also got the chicken schwarma.    everything in all was fresh and large servings.  cool little middle eastern spot for a cheap filling meal."}
{"text":"Yeah so I don't really review places on here but I want to get a review in for at least my staple. (read: i love these places) Anyway this place is amazing for the price a gyro is 3.29 and I haven't gotten anything else here yet but this by itself merits the 5 stars. It is delicious and at 3.29 the first time I came here I bought two thinking they'd be small. I was completely wrong and ended up pretty much wasting a whole gyro (although it was so good I was wanting to down it no matter how stuffed I was. Anyway maybe I'll expand my horizons on the menu in the future, maybe not but this place earned itself 5 stars in my book and I'll be here often. Oh and there is also a market inside which sells hookah supplies at very good prices so if you are into that its another great reason to come here."}
{"text":"I have come here a bunch of times and decided it is time to write a review.   I have tried many things on the menu, including the falafel, shawarma, gyro and chicken kebob and they were all great!  Literally the BEST chicken shawarma I have every had in my entire life (including the when I was in the middle east). The gyro is also really good.  I always sub salad for tabouleh because the salad dressing is amazing.   I must come here once a week for a chicken shawarma plate with rice, hummus and salad!  Highly Recommended!"}
{"text":"Definitely a hole in-the-wall place but absolutely worth it. I go here for lunch all the time and like to try something new each time. Never been let down! Amazing food and service."}
{"text":"Kind of a funky little place for a restaurant but the food is amazing, and you can't beat the price. Love it!!!"}
{"text":"While I was eating I thought to myself ah Haji-Baba is just a four star. The food was good, not blow my mind great, but good. What did it for me was the price, whoa I couldn't believe how cheap everything was. Insane prices! And decent food as well, with out a doubt worth trying for yourself."}
{"text":"DROOL.   Every time I want Middle Eastern food (and I am today but Seattle sucks for such thing thus far)....I think of Haji Baba. Introduced to me as one of the first restaurants I ate at when I was a freshman at ASU (wow that was 6 years ago-- I'm old).   What I miss most is the chicken shawarma plate that I would order with salad instead of tabooli and hummus (no offense to tabooli-- it's great here but I'm not a fan). Their hummus is good because it is made with the right ingredients and it's simple. Hummus should be kept simple.  The shawarma garlic sauce with the sririacha-- is a true delight.    What else is good: EVERYTHING! Falafel, gyro, shawarama salad, all their appetizers. Their lemonade is homemade and not too sweet. It has a weird flavor that gives it a \" what is this?\" appeal. Also in AZ when it's hot, drinks = must because the water sucks.   Don't  forget to get a baklava. They have like 6 or 7 diff varieties and they are all delicious. You can also check out their small market which is a part of the restaurant and has a wide variety of middle eastern random goods and spices.   Big portions (I always had lots of leftovers), cheap food and a simple approach. I MISS YOU HAJI BABA and I promise I will go back to you every time I visit."}
{"text":"This place is a little small and definitely a family owned, authentic place! It's a grocery store and a restaurant all in one. So yummy, and definitely AMAZING hangover food! Would highly recommend (even if you aren't hungover)."}
{"text":"You can't find better. Shawarma is a force to be reckoned with, great homemade pita bread, and amazing hummus. Also insanely friendly staff, great iced tea and lemonade, and perfect pricing."}
{"text":"Yes, come eat here!  The food here is delicious and reasonably priced, staff was nice to us and fast service.  My boyfriend and I had the falafel sandwhiches and Arabic coffee (all delicious).  The adjacent store is also fully stocked with exotic ingredients/goodies.  Wish we could have a place like this in LA."}
{"text":"Very solid middle eastern food in a below average location. Chicken shwerma was the outstanding as was the Taboule and Gyro meat. Very reasonably priced as well which is good because the atmosphere is quite bad and the neighborhood is not the greatest.  Also, do yourself a favor, don't look into the kitchen when you're paying. Just don't. Clearly the health inspector is being paid to look the other way at this place. At this delicious place!!"}
{"text":"I've lived in LA for the past 2.5 years and this is probably the best Middle Eastern food I've had.  The chicken shawarma was so so tender and flavorful. The garlic sauce on top was kinda like an aoili and looks a little iffy but is actually really tasty. The hummus was really creamy and rich as well. So good."}
{"text":"Haji Baba never disappoints.  Must haves include tabouli, hummus, greek salad, rice and pistachio baklava.  It is completely affordable and next to a small market which is also affordable.  When I have money I can't leave without buying some dates, spices, pita and fresh bulgarian feta.  Everything is good here!"}
{"text":"Some people choose their law school based on school rating or program strength. I chose ASU for the chicken shawarma at Haji-Baba.  Ok, it may not have been the sole determining factor, but once you try the food here, you will quickly understand that it honestly COULD have been!  I partook of the cuisine of three different Middle Eastern restaurants in the last month and none of them can even compare to Haji-Baba.  The chicken here is tender, moist, and well-flavored. The tahini sauce for the chicken must contain crack because it is utterly addicting and a little goes a long way. The pita is soft and light--a perfect dipping tool for the smooth and creamy hummus.  There are not enough words in any language to describe the oral ecstasy you will discover here at Haji-Baba so do yourself a favor and get in here now!"}
{"text":"I've been going to Haji for about a decade.  Love the food (although with I go I'm usually craving the Chicken Shawarma and Gyro plates.  Just very tasty and other Middle Eastern restaurants pale in comparison.  Only complaint?  It's not closer to me so I can go more often."}
{"text":"Very cute deli and market, love the gyro special lunch with extra sauce. Cheap, delish and authentic food! We always get a mix of all the different flavors of baklava after as well.   Will have to try the lamb next time!!"}
{"text":"The Chicken Shawarma - so good!   Atmosphere: not there? But the tables were actually set up in a way in which I felt cozy eating there with my friend. The restaurant/store isn't dressed up in any way, and it felt comfortable.  Service: friendly. The workers joke around with you.   Price: reasonable! I paid $~9 for my meal."}
{"text":"I just visited Haji-Baba on a recent trip to Tempe! We usually go to princess on Broadway but for a change, we tried this place. We walked in & were seated within two minutes. The place was pretty occupied with 8 other tables including us on a saturday 4pm. We enjoyed our shish kabob & shwarma combos, big & filling! The waiter was a young man, did a decent job serving us. The prices were very reasonable, our total was only $20! We will definitely be back!   THANK YOU."}
{"text":"Saw this place on \"Check Please\" and the reviews looked awesome so when we were in the area I begged my husband to take me!   I was super excited when we pulled up but we got there a little early and ended up having to wait for the owner to open up. I walked into the cashier blocking off the dining area, when I tried to get his attention he practically jumped at me telling me that the dining room was closed. (like there should have been a huge DO NOT ENTER sign at the entrance) OK..... so when I ask him when its open he says \"to go only\" another OK .... when I walk up to order he says \"but the kitchen won't be ready for an hour\" AN HOUR?!?! its 11, most restaurants are ready to serve food at 11, you want me to wait an hour?? NO  I really did want to try the food at this place, but quite frankly I'm not willing to give any of my hard earned money to a restaurant that is going to be rude and unhelpful.  I don't care how good ppl say their food is.. no thank you!"}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant in Tempe. The chicken Schwarma is amazing. You get a lot of food for the price you're paying and its quality."}
{"text":"My mom used a gift card to try this place when she was in town.  We ordered just a few starters but what we tried was really good food.  My taste buds were overloaded with favors, its a nice change from eating plain old American food.  I would take my wife back for us to try a main dish."}
{"text":"Service was great. Fast and friendly.   Value. Very good. For the portions we got.   Food. Good. But not award winning. I ate the kabob plate. Meat was juicy but lacked any spices. Rice was very plain in comparison to other middle eastern and kabob / gyro restaurants.   My dinner guest had the kibbi plate. Again the value was great but the flavor was bland and spiceless.   The market was nice."}
{"text":"The Chicken Shawarma is awesome.   Hummus, Tabule and freshly made pita bread Arabic coffee will put hair on your chest but YUM!  Iced tea is the sh*t - its an orange black tea  Salad dressing is freshly made and you can buy a container to take home The market area has great prices on spices  Quick service once you finally get a table, lunch is a nightmare Call it in ahead of time & get it to go or get there early"}
{"text":"ok, im a little jaded writing this review..living my life in dearborn for 30 years ive had the best of middle east fare....moving to AZ its hard to find good middle eastern food..  the store is awesome, great selection.. Service was lacking, the manager/owner/cashier went on and on talking politics with customer in front of me..5 minutes later i ordered the shish kebob sandwich..took about 15 minutes..it was ok, no onions?  this was my first visit..i plan to head back and try a combo plate and other items  for a wednesday the small place was packed    Second visit, tried the chicken shawama was good, not mind-blowing..wasnt made as requested   third and last visit, i treated a friend,  both orders made wrong...and was ok..  i will probably look elsewhere for good middle eastern food...definitely will use the store for items tho  i really wanted to love this place, but more of a let down"}
{"text":"Back when I was amongst the working class before the housing market crashed and builders still needed interior designers to do their model homes, we ordered a lot of lunches a lot of times (seriously, a lot) from Haji. Really, when you order that often, you can just call it Haji. You're free to take that artistic (or maybe culinary) liberty.  Everything I've had is good but I always lean towards the vegetarian choices and often would get the vegetarian plate (I think that's what it's called) with hummus, baba ganush, dolmas and tabbouleh. My husband loves their rosewater lemonade and often stops here to pick some up after the zen center on Sundays. If you haven't been in here, they're not just a restaurant. They stock all kinds of middle eastern grocery items. I even found some of my favorite Belgium berry and raisin filled biscuit cookies. I bought them all. I haven't seen them outside of Belgium. Belgium and Haji-Baba's. Go figure."}
{"text":"Food is always so tasty! I usually go for the kebabs and tabouli. Good humus and pita as well. Decor could use a refresh but that's really the only downside, that and it can get pretty busy during lunch. Staff is always friendly and attentive. Great local spot."}
{"text":"When visiting with family in Phoenix area all of us hankering for some Middle Eastern food.  We heard this place got some really good reviews.  For the most part was all pretty good.  Oddly all the folks eating here were all Caucasian. Kind of surprised me.  Probably just the time we went.  When I eat ethnic foods I usually look forward to seeing folks who know what good food is.  I'm just being quirky and silly.  Nice menu with all the usual goodies you find in most Middle Eastern restaurants.  One of had the Chicken Shawma plate with pita bread, tabouli, and plain white rice. I had the Gyro Platter and was with a salad, pita bread, and plain white rice.  A little boring.  The gyro meat was a bit dry.  I have to say they have huge portions.  The restaurant is combined with a market and browsing through some of the foods of Middle Eastern groceries.  Very nice.  Prices are fair.  Service was very very slow.  We also got the egg roll with had meat, onions and nice flavorings.  Very tasty."}
{"text":"Three words:  food borne illness.  Frankly, their food isn't tasty enough to warrant the risk."}
{"text":"The best restaurant you will ever go to. They have the best service, big variety of food, and they have a marketplace next to the restaurant. You can even buy grocery with food! If you want to get bigger selection, then Go to haji baba international foods. And the best part about this place, it's halal! No pork, no wine, none of that bad stuff. It's all the good stuff! This place is the best Mediterranean restaurant, and the most convenient place in Arizona. And their prices are low."}
{"text":"It rocks. Some of the best Med food in the valley. Took two of my friends there last night and they really liked it, too. Except for the part of getting pulled over by the Tempe police for temporarily stopping in the bike lane, an excellent evening was had by all."}
{"text":"Bring yourself to this place. Your taste buds deserve it.   The hummus and aioli make you want to spin in your chair.   The chicken shwarma is fit for a King, both in taste and portion.   The lemonade and baklava are fresh and delicious.   A list of eclectic and cheap starters to invigorate your palate.   I'm visibly heart broken that I don't live down the street from Haji's anymore.   This is as good and as cheap as it gets.   The waiters are characters too. Bring a date. Impress them with your worldly food tastes.   I could keep going. I love this place."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best middle eastern food I've had. The chicken schwarma is spot on. You can get it low carb and double up on the salad. Was only visiting the area a short time and ate there 3 times. Each time service was great, wait was short, food was amazingly good and the prices reasonable. You need to go here."}
{"text":"Just come here and eat. Everything is delicious. If you want to eat a delicious falafel, look no further.  Kabobs? Shawarma? Same thing.  I've been coming here since my ASU days and I definitely missed it when I moved away. I've never heard a complaint or dissatisfaction from anyone who has come here to eat.  It's a casual eatery with tasty food at a great price.   I like to split dishes so I can enjoy the different tastes more.  Although salad is really standard, the dressing is amazing for their signature side salad."}
{"text":"Great Gyros & baklava authentic Indian market as well.  Hidden Gem here, great place for lunch, cheap prices to boot."}
{"text":"Good food at very reasonable prices. Could use a little cleaning and \"freshening up\" but I've enjoyed all the food I've eaten there - I've been there about 7 or 8 times."}
{"text":"Busy, friendly service, good food, super cheap prices, awesome lemonade.  I think that about sums it up.  After 48 reviews I can't really think of anything that hasn't been said, or even anything witty or crude, so I'll leave it at that.  I had the kafta plate with rice and a lemonade for less than $10 and loved every bite."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time when I lived in Arizona. My ex-boyfriend was born and raised in Saudi Arabia and swore this place had the best schwarma he'd ever had in the US. It is the basis for all my comparisons and I've never been as satisfied as when I get it here. It is uniformly amazing. Their grape leaves are also delicious and made with what must be fresh ones, not canned, as they have such a better texture than any others I've had. I have had better falafel elsewhere, but that's not what I come here for so I can't dock them any stars. And staff has become SO much friendlier than when I first started coming here (about 10 years ago). The grocery store also has a huge selection of the real deal. I'm so glad I made a point of coming by on my way to the airport. I'd have never forgiven myself if I missed out!"}
{"text":"I have been here a couple times after my last review. IT IS HEAVEN. I get the chicken shawarma plate every time. There are no regrets. Humus is perfect and so is the service. I also love shopping in the store."}
{"text":"Haji Baba is the best Middle Eastern food I've had without question.  The restaurant is located inside a small grocery store.  It's always extremely busy for lunch, and during peak lunch hours the lines are literally out the door.  Once seated the service is good and the staff is attentive.  My favorite items on the menu are the Chicken Shawarma, Gyro Sandwich, Shish Kabob, Hummus and Pita Bread, and the Ice Tea is out of this world good too!   As a testament to how good HB is, my wife even calls this place a favorite restaurant of hers.  Now keep in mind, she's not very open minded when it comes to trying new foods.  When I first brought her here several years ago she didn't even want to go inside based on the look of the place.  I finally persuaded her to just give it a try, which was no small feat.  The rest is history as she's now one of the biggest HB fans in the family if not the entire East Valley :).    Excellent food, large portions, and inexpensive prices provide a triple benefit that's impossible to beat when you want Middle Eastern food."}
{"text":"Imagine a small grocery store.  Now split the grocery store in half... - Remove groceries from one half so that you have an empty half. - Add tables and chairs to the empty half.  Essentially, you now have 1/2 a grocery store and 1/2 a restaurant -- which is what Haji-Baba is.  From the restaurant, I recommend shawarma plate, gyros, and any of the kabobs.  The food is cooked fresh, noticeably healthy, in large portion, and is remarkably low-priced.  Following your meal, I suggest you purchase an almond Baklava from the market. The almond Baklava (especially when heated for about 15 seconds in the microwave) is fantastic!  Also, the staff has always been great.  Meals are generally less than $10.  Fantastic value! Please, do not change a thing!"}
{"text":"At first I only came here looking for clove oil, then I smelled the food and stayed to eat. It was amazing and totally unexpected. Get your shopping done, then grab a bite. Try the shawarma!"}
{"text":"Oh yelpers....you steered me wrong this time.... I went to Haji Baba yesterday with a friend after having a friend recommend it in addition to having great yelp reviews. Let me say, it was not so awesome. My friend went to wash her hands and said the bathroom was one of the most disgusting bathrooms she had ever seen in a restaurant. We both got the chicken shwarma plate with the garlic sauce...the plate was large, but the food on it was not very good. The chicken was some of the worst quality I have had in a long time....having cartilage and other chewy grossness.... The garlic 'sauce' was more like mayo...really gelatinous. The rice was just plain white rice, the hummus was ok....pretty generic, the tabbouleh was almost all parsley, barely any grains or tomato.....it just was not so pleasant. I would not go back for sure."}
{"text":"I work right by Haji Babas and I've tried everything on the menu. I can't seem to bring myself to resist going there! I literally eat at Haji's 2 times a week, sometimes more. This place is awesome! I'd reccomend something in specific, but I love it all! If you want to try something different go for the stuffed grape leaves or the Kibbi; they are soooo tasty."}
{"text":"I am Shawarma satisfied!  My hubby and I both dined on the GENEROUS Shawarma plate and every bite was mouth watering.  Too much garlic?  Never!  I love all the combinations of flavors-Tabbouleh, Rice, Hummus, Pita, Garlic Sauce and Chicken-I scoop different combinations onto my fork for a new tasty bite.  This place is always packed. No surprise!"}
{"text":"Oh, Haji-Baba, I love you. The chicken shawarma plate is ridiculous. The hummus? Perfection! Your pita bread? Heaven!  My review, however, is based on take-out. I never eat at Haji-Baba. To me, HB is a place to grab a cheap, delicious lunch and take it back to the office to snack on throughout the day. The plates are so huge, they end up being all I eat all day.  And my god, I could eat HB every.single.day!"}
{"text":"I'm pretty sure this is my favorite restaurant at the moment.  I never leave Phoenix without stopping here.   The shawarma is divine (best I've had in Arizona, and a close runner-up for all time) and the gyros are outstanding.  In fact, I've never had anything bad here.  I'm not even a huge tabbouleh fan, and I still wolf down Haji-Baba's.  On top of that, everything is pretty cheap and you get huge portions.  I can always get at least two meals out of one of their platters.  The place itself is a little unassuming storefront.  It's almost a diner feeling in the restaurant area.  It also has a pretty awesome little grocery where you can pick up a little bit of everything from fresh feta, hookah supplies and (my favorite) Kinder chocolates.  It can get a bit hectic at peak meal times (you pay up at the front in the grocery), but always worth it.  We've only had bad service once and even then, they were very good about making it up to us and gave us a free bakalava and mint tea for dessert.  Definitely give this place a try, even if you're not a fan of Middle Eastern food. It'll change your mind!"}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of living across the street from this treasure for about 6 years. I'm still lucky enough to work close by.   Let me be clear. I 'm reviewing Haji Baba as a GROCERY STORE first.  Then I will give you some insight into the prepared food for take-out or in-store dining.  This is one of the few stores in Arizona where you have several choices for pita bread--it's also the ONLY place I've found for whole wheat pita. There are several choices for Feta cheese. Danish, French,Greek...same with olives--there are choices. I ALWAYS buy my tahini here. All the prices are very inexpensive.  Need spices???  They have them all.  At about 25% of the price you would pay anywhere else. The best way to describe Haji Baba is that it is a REAL grocery store, with REAL prices, for REAL people.  It is NOT a \"specialty store\" with trendy items and inflated prices.  They sell food items that you will actually use.  The bonus here?  You won't find a 10 year old can or jar of something.  On to the \"restaurant\" portion.  Haji Baba is better if you think of it as a take-out joint that happens to have places to sit and eat.  They do have tables and they do perform table service, it's just got zero charm.  You go for the food, that's it.  Okay, food.  The lamb tongue sandwich is to die for.  Let me repeat.  The LAMB TONGUE PITA SANDWICH.  GET IT!  Their baba ganouj is also darned tootin' tasty.  Actually, I sometimes dream about their baba ganouj. I'm not crazy about their hummus, maybe because making hummus takes 5 minutes and mine is bomb? But it's not bad. Gyros are good and not greasy. Greasy gyro meat is a pet peeve of mine. Chicken shwarma?  Yup, that's good too. I'm sure I've had something  to eat  here that I was a little disappointed in, but I honestly can't remember what, or when ."}
{"text":"The quality perhaps has slipped slightly, or my tastes have changed.  I was not as impressed this time at lunch.  I got the lamb tongue sandwich (I was not pleased).  My wife's chicken kabab sandwich was okay (the chicken was a bit chewy and burnt).  Previous Review Dated 01/24/2015, 4 Stars: Went to Haji Baba with my wife.  My wife and I got a kabab combination, order of foul, and an order of kibbeh.  It was good.  This is the standard Middle Eastern/Lebanese fare.  It is a place that you go for good food.  The restaurant is pretty casual."}
{"text":"The food was really good. We ended up getting the gyro plate and the chicken shawarma plate. Amazing flavors all together. I dinged it because the service was lacking. My husband and I had been there eating for over an hour and not once were we checked in on nor was our water refilled. I'm not sure if this is bc it's not exactly a restaurant or a diner but if you're going to have sit down seating that takes reservations it would be nice to have someone seeing how everything is etc.   Other than that, food is really great."}
{"text":"Haji Babba is amazing.  The food is cheap and delicious.  It's easy to \"build\" a meal by adding up a bunch of appetizers.  The combination plates are great too!  The feta cheese appetizer and falafel sandwich are my favorites.  You can't leave without trying one of the delicious varieties of baklava they prepare as well.  This is *the* place to enjoy Middle Eastern food!  The staff is charming and prompt.  The place gets very, very busy at lunch time, so plan ahead for work lunches.  The grocery store is pretty fun too, if you have time to browse around after you eat."}
{"text":"The best middle eastern food I have eaten in Phoenix. The service is very prompt and the food comes out quickly. My favorite plate is the Gyro deluxe with pita and hummus. Cannot go wrong with Haji-Baba!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. I got the chicken shawerma plate and it was so good. It was cheap and I got enough for two meals which I liked because I can take some home. I love how they have sriracha on the table too. Will definitelty be back."}
{"text":"Perhaps the greatest Little Middle Eastern market & restaurant in the valley! The Hummus & Lebni are to DIE FOR, the Lamb is out of this world and the Feta cheese may be the freshest I have ever experienced. My favorite Med. cuisine location by far. I love that I can Buy everything I have just eaten at the market next door and prepare it at home as well. Only One Issue, PARKING IS TERRIBLE during busy hours.  This is a MUST SEE for anyone seeking this type of cuisine! GO NOW!   P.S. Dont  know why this review shows up in 2 places, oh well this place is worth it!"}
{"text":"If not THE, then one of the best chicken shwarma dishes I've had. Just the right degree of succulent and tender. And the garlic, yogurt sauce that comes with it is almost like crack. The jasmine rice was perfect in its softness and saltiness. Taboule was good and the pita was mmm..mmmm...good. Hummus was awesome too. Definitely going back to work my way down the menu. My friend who recommended it said she'd never had any bad item there. I totally believe her."}
{"text":"Haji-Baba is unique by being both a restaurant and a store! As such, the restaurant is fairly small- so if you're up for some delicious middle-eastern food on a Friday afternoon, make sure you arrive early!  The prices are good, the selection is better and the food is great! I ordered the falafel plate which came with 4 falafels, a side of hummus, and I subbed the tabooli out for a salad. The portion size was pretty big, so I left quite full, and it was all delicous! I'll definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Haji-baba I love you! Best middle eastern food!!! :) I came here last week 3 times for the chicken shawarma plate and kabob.  If I lived in Arizona I would have to come here at least once a week... it's that good! Reasonable prices, casual dining and friendly service! Stress free parking! If I ever visit Arizona again... HAJIBABA will be first on the the list! If you live in the area or visiting Arizona... and love middle eastern food... you have to eat here! Arizona I'm so jealous! I'm a fan! -Miss Yelp 2012"}
{"text":"I hate this place! They're soo good I don't mind waiting for an hour during weekday lunches, argggghhh!"}
{"text":"A-Ok.  I had the gyro plate which comes with a really fresh salad with yummy dressing.  The tzaziki  (sp) sauce was really good.  The rice side was bland with no seasoning of any kind at all.  Lots of food for the $$."}
{"text":"Let me add to the chorus of 5 star reviews here! Oh my Lord is this place good! If we had one in Bend, Oregon, I would dine there 2x per week at least. Killer kebabs, fresh, warm pita, mouth watering hummous and baklava and dirt cheap prices! I think this says it all, right? Don't walk, run to this place.."}
{"text":"This place is really unique!  It's a family-owned business that has been in this location for many many years (I forget how many, something like 80).  They serve good quality food for low prices.  I ordered the chicken schwarma plate and really enjoyed it.  The chicken was moist, flavorful, and tender.  I did not like the green side (I think it's tabouleh?) that consisted of parsley and other things, a salad of sorts.  But I usually don't like that stuff at any restaurant.  The hummus was good and they bring you plenty of bread/pita.  While you are there, check out the little grocery market attached.  They sell some items for really cheap, such as spices and dates.  They also have goodies from other countries, such as chocolates from London and Germany."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for many many years. Still as good as always. I love all of their food. Great gyros and chicken shawarma, falafel and everything on their menu. Cooked to order fresh ingredients and an attentive staff. Plus very inexpensive with large portions."}
{"text":"This place is one of Tempe's hidden or perhaps not so hidden gems! It is quite popular .    SO where to begin ... Well to be completely honest I'm pretty sure anything you order here you cant go wrong.  To make it simple:  Food: Plates are quite big so if you aren't starving to death prepare to take some home or share it with a friend. I like ordering the gyro sandwich, chicken shish kabob, side of grape leaves. Those are just the items I have continually ordered I am positive there are many more wonderful items to try as well.  Food is always fresh and authentic.  Also, buy their Turkish delight. It is fresh and quite possibly the best Turkish delight i have ever had ( no exaggeration) !  Price: Prices here are very economical; For both the restaurant  and the store section. They have a lot of goodies throughout the store that are hard to find other places.  Customer service: This is a family owned business and it is run accordingly. The employees here are very kind and efficient. I feel like they value their customers and that is important to me.  Even when I have been here and it is quite crowded I have never had to wait too long.   SO long story short. If you haven't been here GO! Don't waste anytime reading any more reviews or pondering just go straight here, You will not regret it ! Thanks Haji Baba"}
{"text":"A lot of people probably drives by this place daily and doesn't know what this place had to offer. I been coming to Haji baba for past five years and food quality havens changed. I love everything on the menu. Plus the price is reasonable and great service which is rare in Tempe. Place is a little small since it is dinning room and store. Anyway if you haven't been here it is about time to come in and have some delicious middle eastern food."}
{"text":"I have eaten at Haji-Baba many times over the 20 years I have been living in Scottsdale.  My ACIM/Unity minister Julianne Lewis used to eat here once a week in the late 90's, with whoever wanted to join her.    I ate here most recently a month ago with a lunch bunch MeetUp.  I paid $12 for the lamb kabob. I asked for the kabobs to be grilled RED on the inside.  Server said OK, but when the kabobs came 9and there were only 5 one inch cubes or so, I wish there were more for the $12, some were well-done, kinda hard and dry, not even pink inside.  Some were pink but none were red on inside.  I told the server but he said \"that's the way we make them, we grill them all the same.  If we made them rare, people can't chew them\".  Well I don't mean THAT raw, but I find anything cooked longer than red on the inside, makes it kinda tough.  Even lamb.  Taste was just A -OK, but I could smell the charbroil.  Years ago, I ordered the lamb tongue sandwich.  It turned out to be whole lamb tongue all hanging out of the bread and wagging and lollying at you !!!  Kinda gross to bite down on the whole tongues and shut them up, but someone ordered the lamb tongue this most recent visit and the tongue was sliced.  So I guess they had to tone down the tongues for us Whitey-Gringos, tho I am Chinese and have no problem eating fish with the heads attached.    I prefer going to Khyber Halal at 24th St and Indian School for this type of food, grilled lamb, sharwarma, etc."}
{"text":"It was OK but I don't think we will go back. The service was good but the food was just ok. It's not good that we have had Greek Wrap in Peoria."}
{"text":"There are very few places that I can say that I would seriously depressed me if I found out that they closed. Haji-baba is one of those places. I lived across the street from this place when I was in college and absolutely loved it. My family would insist that we go every time they were in town. That was almost 20 years ago and now that I've moved back to Arizona 10 years ago, I'm still going.   What's even more amazing is that the same wonderful people that ran the place then, are still running it now and making the same fantastic food. While the prices have increased in almost 20 years, it's certainly not noticeable over that duration of time. The place is extremely affordable and delicious. You will not find a better hummus in the valley. The chicken salad is absolutely one of my favorite things in the world to eat after a good workout as it's a wonderful mix of salad, rice, and tasty chicken. I can honestly say that I don't think I've tried another gyro in the last 10 years since I've been going here. So while I can't say if there's one better out there, but theirs is a certainly amazing. But I will warn you that there is a pickle hidden inside of it! I wasn't expecting that the first time I tried it all those years ago but now I've gotten used to it and simply pull it out and eat it separately.  I can't post a review without at least mentioning decor. This is a very low-key, no-frills restaurant located inside a grocery store. You are going there for the food and not the atmosphere. But if you do decide to have a seat (there will probably be a wait if you go around lunch during the week), I promise you that you will get great service from this family run place. I have never had a bad experience there in 20 years!"}
{"text":"Read the reviews and didn't believe it. Had to visit myself and discovered that it is true. Their dishes are delicious and generous. I think I've tried all middle eastern restaurants in a 20 mile radius and Haji Baba it is! THE BEST!"}
{"text":"My family's been coming to Haji Baba for 20 years (I'm 24), well before Yelp popularity. The food is delicious, my favorite is Kabob Koubidah with a side of falafel and sambousek. Also, I crave their rose water lemonade all year round! I'm a little sad it's so popular now and busy all the time but the restaurant deserves it. They haven't raised their prices and some of the waiters have been there for 10+ years. Their groceries are unique and well priced and I can't say enough good about their baklava. This place is home to me!"}
{"text":"I have to say, I've had WAY better middle eastern food. If it wasn't for the price and the fact that my significant other adores the place, I'd probably never eat here.   The service has always been good, even when packed. Their pitas are decent and for less than $4 for an entire meal, you can't go wrong. However, their actual dishes have left much to be desired.   I'm not a fan of their hummus, AT ALL. In fact I think it's bland and tasteless. Their garlic sauce is made with mayo which isn't my favorite. I personally think it's tastier when it's just mashed garlic. The chicken shawarma just didn't do it for me, however I have enjoyed the kafta plate on more than one occasion. Overall, it's not the worst I've had but definitely nowhere near the top of Middle Eastern restaurants in the valley."}
{"text":"Fyresite.com love's Haji for lunch. Its our default lunch spot. Favorite menu item: Chicken Shwarma Plate. They have the best chicken shwarma in Phoenix, hands down! highly recommended"}
{"text":"The highlight of my visit was finding delicious, high quality Armenian String Cheese in the deli case, in addition to all sorts of interesting and unusual items in the market.  I went for a late lunch, and had no problem being seated. Service was good, and the atmosphere was friendly. I ordered the chicken shawarma plate with hummus, tabouli and garlic sauce.   The food portions were huge. The hummus was good, but a bit too salty. The chicken shawarma was nicely seasoned in general, but was all dark meat, which I don't care for. Also, the garlic sauce was more like garlic mayonnaise, which I also dislike. I came prepared for the more traditional blend of garlic, lemon juice and olive oil which is generally served at my favorite Lebanese restaurant in Minneapolis.  All in all, I was let down by my meal. I will however be returning to the market again soon."}
{"text":"I loved coming here when I was in college and I love coming here 5 years later.  This place is very inexpensive and the food is very authentic, a wonderful portion size and delicious.  I don't feel it is the cleanest place, but I have eaten here over 20 times and have never gotten sick.  It is a small restaurant inside a small grocery store.  Even though it is a small restaurant, I have never had to wait more than 20 minutes.  Be careful to not miss it in the plaza as it is very small and it's almost difficult to find in the plaza, but it's there.  I love eating two things here, any of the sandwiches (especially the gyro) and the hummus with pita.  It is extremely delicious!  My friends like getting the full meal dishes, and any of them are very good.    If you are a person that likes to all kinds of food or does not have alot of money in the bank and wants to eat well , this place is perfect for you."}
{"text":"You know when you absolutely adore a restaurant and it's like they don't even know you exist? Like you're in some endless John Hughes film where you never, ever get to that final birthday cake scene? I hate unrequited love.   But at Haji Baba, the feeling's alllll mutual, baby.   No, really. They love me. I swear. Stop laughing.   The bestest service, the nicest chitchat and the friendliest not-creepy flirting. And, of course, the most delicious hummus (with a pickle on top).  OK, so maybe everyone gets the hummus. But does everyone get a big smile and a compliment from the kitchen staff?   Maybe it's because I always stop by after work, gussied up in heels and other lady-things. Maybe it's because I tip on takeout orders. Always. Or maybe it's just because I shop the store like I mean it: canned goods, feta, olives, pita, maybe some naan, baklava, wacky Eastern European chocolate, baba ganoush, spices, pistachios, etc. etc. etc. Not to mention the dirt-cheap, super-tasty kebab, shwarma and koubideh.   And while Haji Baba may be the Sam Schoeffling to my Molly Ringwald, Long Duk Dong has never made an appearance during my meal."}
{"text":"A restaurant inside a grocery store... but they serve up some great food! I got the chicken shwarma and it was delicious! Don't let the weird locale steer you away from this place. The prices were right, the taste, and portions were decent. The owner of the store was very friendly and cordial as well."}
{"text":"Just recently moved to Tempe and I can't get enough of this place. I love their chicken shawarma plate but unfortunately the beef shawarma wasn't so great."}
{"text":"My first time at this East Valley institution...had the lamb tongue sandwich...tasty!"}
{"text":"The 5 star rating says it all. If anyone visits me in Tempe, there are 2 places I take them: Four Peaks, and Haji-Baba."}
{"text":"This place was unfortunately not all that amazing. You get a decent amount of food, and the prices aren't bad at all, but the food is very average, and fairly bland. I got the combination plate and everything on it was pretty mediocre. You can get better gyros at many other places in the valley."}
{"text":"Add my review to everyone else's 5-stars. Great food, funky local restaurant - my favorite kind. The baba ganoush is smoky and delicious, the dolmades are hand-made with grape leaves that are perfect, not slimy or too mushy. My friend had gyro, I had some of the lamb - soft and flavorful. Everything was so good. They were busy for lunch but server and cashier were still gracious and nice. We enjoyed our lunch, thank you!!"}
{"text":"I was with a friend for random chase for Mediterranean cuisine, and we ran into this little grocery store/mini restaurant.  Chicken gyro for $4 is unheard of these days.  The size of the gyro is almost like a burrito and is extremely filling.  The full plate comes with the meat, plenty of rice, hummus, and salad for just $7.  The tastes are very flavorful and authentic."}
{"text":"I'd go here again and again throughout my life if it remains open. There are better places to pick up a good pita, but this stuff is authentic. There are hispanic men in the back cooking the meals, and the employees are of middle eastern descent. I don't think I've ever had to wait for a table at Haji Baba's, and the meals come out quick and they're still hot.  The pita is one thing, but I feel the rest of the meal lacks luster. The lentils are just \"ok\" and the rice serves the same. Something dull about the flavor. Maybe I'm too american for their own good.  The hours of operation at this place are extremely weird. If you go on Sunday I believe, it's closed. It also closes early on the week days. But they are good for pick up if you want to order in.  This is another one of those \"you get a lot for your money\" places.  It's worth the trip, but don't expect fireworks."}
{"text":"Best Middle Eastern Food in Tempe! Their gyro plate is absolutely massive and their lamb gyro is perfectly seasoned and tender! Two thumbs up! Get here early or you will wait to eat. This place is in a really cool bodega style restaurant with a full middle eastern grocery store inside."}
{"text":"The Gyro is to die for... and the hummus has a wonderful flavor, though lighter on the garlic and lemon than I would usually like. I can't wait to go back and try the chicken shawerma and other offerings."}
{"text":"This place is fire son. Me and the my friends come here all the time for the chicken shwarma's. Also the owner's son has fresh kicks"}
{"text":"I used to live in Tempe and came here constantly. I now live 40 minutes away and I still occasionally make the trip just for this restaurant.  The food is incredible. Simply some of the best middle eastern food I have ever had. What really makes it special is how incredibly cheap it is. Think along the lines of $6-10 for massive dinner combo plates and $3 for appetizers. Even their import store is cheap.   Some star features:  -Enormous portions -Incredible food -Wonderful arabic coffee -You can buy a massive block of fresh feta for like $7 -Delicious rosewater lemonade -'Exotic' spices for less than $2 for a massive bag. -Imported chocolate for only a few cents more than domestic chocolate costs.  -See above: They have nestle kitkats instead of the inferior american hershey kitkats  My wife and I eat out constantly and this is absolutely in our top 3 restaurants in the entire valley."}
{"text":"Friends raved about this place. Personally, I've had better. The seating was awful, we sat in an aisle of the market. The waiter wasn't helpful what so ever. I ordered a shawarma and wanted a SIDE of rice. The menu states SIDES. The small table we were seated at could not fit these so called sides because they were large plates of food. Why would it say side and not a plate of rice. The sides basically served all four of us. The food was just as bad as the experience. We tried to check out and we're basically ignored till we had to make noise we had been waiting 20 minutes. Not worth the wait, trouble or 5 plates of sides."}
{"text":"Everybody I know loves Haji-Baba. For me it's just okay. I love Mediterranean food - veggies, hummus, babbaganouch (sp?) and all the rest. I just feel that the food here is mediocre. With as many choices as there are in the valley for finer food, this one ranks lower. If you're on a budget, however, this is your place. Great prices."}
{"text":"Best Gyro in Phoenix! Period! I order the Gyro DLX. The feta is awesome. Recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! Such a hole in the wall but so good and authentic. The portions are insane, so big had to take half home. We will be back many times."}
{"text":"This place is very good and authentic. I go there all of the time and it has minimal impact on my wallet. If feel like the price makes it taste even better. The gyro and shawarma are very good."}
{"text":"I freaking love this place! The chicken shawarma and that garlic sauce is more magical than Disneyland. The servings are pretty big and the service is good. The baklava selection is out of this world awesome! I highly suggest trying this place"}
{"text":"I'm on the fence.  It wasn't by any stretch of the imagination bad.  On the other hand I didn't find it great.  It was merely good.  The pickle they put on the hummus was, for some reason, slightly fishy tasting.  I didn't want to try the one they put on my kabob sandwich.  The person with me pulled the pickles out of his gyro.  So the off putting taste just wasn't me."}
{"text":"Everyone's right -- there's not much of an ambience at this 2/3-grocer 1/3-restaurant nestled away in a stripmall, but what Haji-Baba lacks in ambience, it more that compensates for in fresh, delicious, authentic Middle Eastern food.  My boyfriend and I split the non-veggie combination platter, and everything was fantastic: the falafel was light and fluffy, on par with the NY street vendor fare I'm accustomed to, and the gyro was so delicious that I managed to finagle 3/4 of it away before he noticed there'd been more under a piece of hummus-y lettuce.  I would not recommend it for a first date -- hipper joints like Pita Jungle across the street would better fit the bill -- but if you're in a comfortable relationship and craving a delicious meal after a long day's ridiculous lightrail experiment, Haji-Baba's got your back.  And your belly..."}
{"text":"My favorite middle eastern food for over 15 years! I haven't eaten at any other middle eastern food joint anywhere in the country that even comes close. Price is also unbeatable."}
{"text":"Is it a grocery store or is it a restaurant?  It is both, but the food is top notch.  I had the gyro which had lamb and beef, prepared in Greek spices with a sour cream cucumber sauce and lettuce.   The place is small and no frills and the service is shaky at best. There are 2 cash registers which accomodate the store and restaurant.  Parking is small but you can also park in the back.  Come for the food you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Oh boy, this was a happy find!!!! When we walked in, this place was PACKED (good sign!!) but happily we found a seat right away. Whenever we eat at Middle Eastern restaurants such as this, I always gotta test them out with my tried and true favorites, Gyro and Hummus.   And, YES......they were both GOOOOD!! Fantastic even! Excellent flavors on the gyro, and not too greasy either. The pita was fantabulous, so soft and perfect. And the hummus? WINNING. NOW I found the best hummus in Phx, really now, this time I'm certain! ;D So creamy with the perfect about of garlic, oh, it was really divine.  Next time I'll be brave and try the lamb tongue, (no really, when you go, read the menu, Hilarious! You'll see what I mean.......then you'll chuckle to yourself and order it next time hahahaha)   Service was great, super speedy, even despite the mad lunch rush. As far as the actual market goes, they had what typically middle eastern markets have, spices, rosewater, tea, stuff. We did notice that they seemed to have a lot of items from Jordan in particular.     This is for sure my new gyro and hummus spot, and who knows, it might soon become my new lamb tongue spot too! tee hee....."}
