{"text":"Their photo of Lumprais is NOT lumprais. Lumprais has 7 different dishes wrapped in banana leaf. SL Restaurants serve rice and curries in a banana leaf and call it Lumprais, LOL! 

A lamprais will ALWAYS consist ONLY the following dishes:
1. Lamprais Curry 
2. Frikkadels 
3. Brinjal (Egg plant) paella 
4. Chilli & Onion sambol 
5. Pawn blachang 
6. Ash Plantain fries
7. The Rice"}
{"text":"This tiny little place is geared towards take-out as there are no places to sit down. But the place itself is very clean and the owner (or I'm guessing he's the owner) was very friendly and suggested the lamprais.  The lamprais was steaming hot and the aroma of the banana leaf was very apparent.  Upon the first bite, I could tell that a fair amount of chili peppers had been added to the dish and I loved how it made my eyes tear up and my nose run.  The chicken was just a little bit dry but it was seasoned very well and everything else (dal, potatoes, eggplant, pickles, seeni sambol) was right on the money.  The rice was also perfectly cooked although if I had one complaint, there was probably too much of it.  The prices here are a touch higher than most other Sri Lankan places in Scarborough but in my opinion, the food is well worth it."}

{"text":"Small unit located on Markham Road, strictly take out and catering. One thing to note is that the place accepts ONLY CASH...which is a major annoyance if your plastic like me. Prices average $11 among the main stuff. Clean environment, and the service was quick. When it comes to Sri Lankan food you can include this place on your list. Good simple straight forward selection. Ordered Shrimp Lamprais and Chicken Biriyani.

Chicken Biriyani - Was a bit disappointing. Did not even look like biriyani -_-. Got some rice, chicken leg/thigh, and some veggies....Asides from that it tasted good thou. Spice and flavor was present, but yeah.....

Shrimp Lamprais - The packaging was unexpected. The lamprais was wrapped in foil, then placed in a box. Compared to the red paper that most places wrap it in, this was better and was still steaming hot when I got home. Coming to the food, flavor flavor spice spice flavor. It was great, had a hint of that Colombo taste. Potato curry, fried eggplant curry, dal , onion curry, yellow rice, egg, good amount of shrimp, and some chili's for good measure. It was good. 

Good refreshing taste, overall would recommend Araliya. For me it was a something new, and heard positive reviews from word of mouth. Cant give it as 3.5, but cause of the lamprais giving it a 4/5. Planning on trying other items soon."}
