{"text":"Free birthday bento box on the day of your birthday. No purchase necessary. We always come here on our birthdays. 
Service is friendly and food is simple and delicious. A regular spot for lunch. Prices very reasonable. I would recommend Axia to any of my friends."}
{"text":"There is a Korean restaurant, also have sushi. There are a lot of choice.

I love the Stone BibimBap Rice and beef fried ramen. The Sushi Bento looks soooo yummy. 

Anddd the waiter was friendly.

Anyway?I will come back again!!!"}
{"text":"10/10 my favourite sushi place. The decor feels nice and cozy and the staff are always great. They make the best avocado rolls and the inari are to die for. The crispy mini tofu is amazing as well. They also use real wasabi here.
If you order a main they will also give you free appetizer of kimchi, sprouts, and vegetables. Wonderful food for a cheap price!

The quality of the food always impresses me and I've never had a bad experience once. This is also my favourite place to get bubble tea from. 

Occasionally the food can take a bit to arrive, but usually only during peak times. 

And....deep fried cheesecake... need I say more?"}
{"text":"I had Osaka Ramen it was so good . Also there Pork bone soup ...10/10
Great clean and great service also a grat price."}
{"text":"super great menu."}
{"text":"First entering this place, I had low expectations. At P-Mall, I never expect the best. Axia is a rather cramped, dingy looking \"restaurant\". When my boyfriend went to the bathroom, he didn't even feel comfortable enough to wash his hands, saying how dirty it was.

When looking at the menu, three different people asked whether or not we were ready to order in a row. Since we weren't, we kept telling them a few more minutes. When we were ready, no one came to take our order. It took about 10 minutes until someone actually took notice.

I decided to order a bibimbap; no meat, no egg. My boyfriend decided to get a chicken teriyaki bento. When the appetizers came, it was pretty good. I loved the glass noodles and the bean sprouts. So far, the food was looking good and I was impressed.

Now, on to the main courses. The teriyaki chicken first to arrive. When he was eating the food, he felt as though there was something odd in his teriyaki sauce. It was his second time having it there and he said it tasted like soap or dish wash. He couldn't finish his food and felt a little sick for the rest of the day.

When my food arrived, the waitress dropped the hot bowl, almost hitting my phone. She apologized so I brushed it off as a simple accident. Initially, the taste was good but you can't really fuck up vegetables and rice. Half way through, I found cooked egg yolk. I, again, ignored this mistake since I wasn't vegan and was just vegetarian. A few minutes later, I found small bits of BEEF in my bowl. What the hell? How can there be meat if I specifically asked for no meat? Did they cook it with meat and then just picked it all out? Or was it just leftovers and they picked it all out? Either way, I was furious. It was a good thing that I observe every thing bite I take out of my food. I called over the waitress and told her my problems. She was very apologetic and took it item off of the bill, even offering for a new dish. I declined, wanting to leave ASAP.

Overall, I'm pretty dissatisfied with what this restaurant had to offer. I wouldn't suggest anyone to come here. Ever."}
{"text":"I've visited this place many times for a quick Korean meal. It is located on the second floor of Pacific Mall and the service is excellent. The flavour of the Pork Bone Soup and Kimchi Chigae is decent and not overly salty but I have definitely tasted better. That said, with their low prices they still offer a great deal with large portions. Each meal also comes with miso soup and AYCE Korean side dishes. Their menu gives you the option of customizing your own bento box which is nice and there is a wide variety of Chinese, Korean and Japanese foods to choose from. The one thing that stands out about Axia is their excellent customer service. The waiters & waitresses are all very friendly and service is extremely quick and efficient. I would definitely give this place a try if you are looking for a restaurant atmosphere inside Pacific Mall."}
{"text":"Location/Service
The restaurant is located upstairs (2nd floor) of Pacific Mall - by the corner unit off the escalators. Plenty of parking available in the mall and underground, but it does get pretty busy during weekends/holiday.
Interior is okay, it's a little bit of open concept to the mall. Good lightning. Also can make reservations, which is perfect as my group was 10 people (with 1 child) - so very accommodating in that sense.
Waitress was also nice with orders and food - it was a little bit slow, but maybe cause it was during lunch time.

Food
Ordered their pork bone soup (~$12.99). There is an option for all-you-can-eat version for $14.99. Sounds tempting, but I can't really eat that much, especially for lunch. The spiciness level was really tailored down - where I couldn't even taste any spice at all (and I can't eat spice). Portion was sufficient, had 3 full sizes of the pork bone. Also, came with a bowl of rice, mixing it well with the soup as a supplement.

Overall it was a-ok at Axia Cafe. This restaurant has been here as long as I can remember when Pacific Mall opened. They're still able to maintain a decent quality and service, so props for that. They also have other lunch options like bento boxes and noodles, which were also good."}
{"text":"I think this is a good lunch place especially for tourists going to Pacific Mall. I say this because this is one of the few places in the mall where servers have really good English. I personally prefer the bentos and sushi options here because they seem to be more standard. I don't think I would waste my time here for Korean food, since my Korean boyfriend looked at the pictures and laughed at how unauthentic that part of the menu looked. He also ended up ordering a donburi, which ironically ended up like a bibimbap minus the stone bowl, and tasted like a chinese stir fry. Didn't taste bad, but just not what was expected from a donburi nor did it look like one. So, all in all stick with the sushi or bento items, cause they are standard and popular so it's difficult for them to mess it up. A bento will probably run you about 10.99+. I've also had a birthday special here before, where with ID you get a free bento PLUS a tempura cheesecake which was actually quite heavenly, and the fact that it was free made it that much better. 

Drinks wise, you basically get the bubble tease menu, and they've always been pretty consistent with drinks, so I suppose I recommend those too. However, I would suggest ordering the drink special for the day, since I feel like the drink menu is pretty overpriced."}
{"text":"Been here a few time in the past... It's not really that great in terms of food quality, but the waiters were nice. Kind of wish it was outside Pacific mall itself in one of the small plazas."}
{"text":"This Japanese/Korean restaurant has been here for a long time. I use to come here a lot with family.

However, my favorite dish has changed through the times. Their beef bulgogi use to be the best bulgogi in town. Now the flavor is lacking and so are their portions. 

Thankfully their fried dumplings have not changed. They are by far one of the best fried dumplings I've ever had."}
{"text":"Went here to eat yesterday.   I have not been here in many years .    Some new items but lots of the old ones as well.

Had the pork bone ramen.   Flavour was decent but think the bones could have been cooked a little longer as they were not falling off.  Also only 2 pieces.  Little light for $13.   Other things like there sushi were okay, but price is fair for what you get.

Service on the other hand was phenomenal.  The staff, their courtesy and attention were great.  

Going back there brought back so many fond memories."}
{"text":"I love their crab salad roll with spicy mayo!  The food came very fast after we ordered"}
{"text":"Recently I went back to Axia Café, under the circumstances of being one of the few places open when I had arrived to PMall about 11-1130AM. Most of the mall has not even opened yet, even though Google says it opens at 11AM.

I've been to Axia Café about maybe 4-5 years ago - a very long time ago. But the food was decent and nothing bad happened so I suggested going back there to eat again. Axia Café is a restaurant joint with a bubble tea stand called \"Bubble Tease\", right off the escalator going to the 2nd floor. You can't miss it!

We got sat fairly quickly as we were the only ones there. The waitress rushed out but I could tell she was eating before and was trying to finish her food before serving us.

The restaurant is huge and slightly old school with the rustic wood tables in the middle (which was where we sat).

Their menu consisted a mixture of Chinese, Korean and Japanese-style food, along with bento boxes and sushi options too. We were craving something more soupy based, so we got the Kimchi Chiggae and Udon Soup.

These side dishes came not long after we ordered - typical in a Korean food setting, so I guess the restaurant is more Korean based. From the left is japchae, broccoli, bean sprouts, kimchi and potatoes.

Comparing it to other restaurants, they don't provide as much side dishes. But I still enjoy it. I love eating the japchae and potato side dishes from Korean places. The potatoes are usually coated with a sweet sauce and is soft on each bite, whereas japchae is glass noodles coated with a type of sauce but still has a light taste to it.

Beef Udon Soup came first and it was alright. Noodles tasted slightly soggy and beef was chewy. Broth was probably the best part but even then, it was just alright.

My Kimchi Chiggae came not long after and I was anticipating a fresh and spicy flavour but boy, was I wrong...

The soup tasted so bitter and horrid. Kimchi tasted stale and the meats tasted like leftover microwaved meat. Tofu is usually soft and chewy in these dishes but this tofu was hard and even hard to break... Everything was just horrible.

I didn't want to waste money so I tried to eat as much as I could but ended up leaving almost half unfinished. Eating the Kimchi chiggae with rice made it barely bearable..

Called for the bill as I was so unsatisfied with the food and wanted to just leave ASAP to get snacks from other places to fill my tummy up.

Our bill came with this.. (picture) You might be wondering what it is, because I was guessing so hard and was certain on not eating it. I thought it was a sour candy of some sort because usually sour stuff are coated with those white things. Either sour or a really sugary sweet... but it was a frozen grape. Never have I seen frozen grape being served with the bill before.. Usually it's some sort of candy or peppermint.

Sad to say but the side dishes and frozen grape was probably the best part of the entire meal.
 & I won't be coming back here ever..."}
{"text":"Tasty eats and friendly staff. Food is served quick and your not waiting forever to eat. Nor are you waiting forever to get a seat either. I always come back here whenever I am in Pacific Mall. The menu has a huge variety of asian food from korean, japanese, chinese, viet, etc. One stop shop for excellent food"}
{"text":"I really wanted to give 4 stars this time around. Came back at the owner's assurance that they had fixed their supply issue. So I came back recently on a saturday with 9 friends during peak dinner time at 7 pm (keep in mind they were not even near closing for the night yet). We called in beforehand at around 6:45 and asked if they had enough ayce pork bone soup for 10 ppl. The hostess asked the chef and he said yes and then she told us there was plenty of pork bone soup. So we arrive at 7pm, sit down and we tell the waitress we all want ayce pork bone soup. What does she say? \"I'm sorry we don't have enough. Only enough for one person\". My friends let me have the ayce pbs because I was the yelp elite in the group. But nevertheless, they were pissed and I am definitely not impressed by the \"fixing\" of the supply issue. The pork bone soup in terms of quality is still above avg as always but almost all of my friends made a trip to mcdonald's afterwards. One guy ordered an unagi don (because he couldn't get pbs) and felt sick afterwards. Two of the girls in my group tried some of his food and ended up feeling slightly sick later on in the night as well. Needless to say, axia you need to get your s*** together. Half of my friends concluded that the only good thing to get is pork bone soup. The other half of them want to boycott/blacklist because they got sick from the other stuff they ate. As I said, I really wanted to give 4 stars in this updated review but I've got to be honest. The supply issue did not appear to be fixed. I really hope they address this the next time I come back."}
{"text":"The servers were nice. Food was not the best, but it was worth a try. I didn't eat from the sushi menu but the korean one. We ordered pork bone soup and bibimbap, that was not in a stone pot. 

The banchan included bean sprout, cabbage, radish, potatoes, glass noodle, and broccoli. I liked that it was garlicky and not too salty. The miso soup with the bibimbap was nice. Wednesdays special-bibimbap not in a stone pot. We did not like the cold dish. The spicy pork bone soup was not spicy at all, so I was disappointed. It was just missing ingredients aside from the spiciness.  

I actually like the seating. I love booths, so that is just my preference. You can see the chefs making the sushi. There is a section of the restaurant that makes bubble tea and other drinks. That is the cafe side. I did not try it, but would not mind for next time."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for 8 years now ordering the same thing -- the garlic salted chicken. This restaurant has the most friendly and accommodating staff. Throughout all of the years I have been coming here, they put in the same amount of effort to make each of my dining experiences a great one. I have referred tons of relatives and friends to this restaurant who have become regular patrons to Axia, as well. Delicious food and amazing staff -- LOVE this place!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I come here often, we love it. The service is always fantastic and the food is delicious. I'm a vegetarian, so there aren't many options I won't lie, but their yam rolls and vegetable fried rice is my staple. So good! And hands down these guys have the best miso soup of any restaurant"}
{"text":"Was pretty disappointed in my first and last visit here. I ordered the salmon teriyaki bento box. It wasn't the typical Japanese bento box. It came with kimchi, bean sprouts and glass noodles. Was totally thrown off by this. Didn't complain, ate it and left. I did enjoy the glass noodles and the salmon was tasty. I had to wave down a waitress for water and the bill, not very attentive. I wouldn't visit here again."}
{"text":"I used to come here a lot when I was younger. Ever since coming here after so long I find that the food is ok, it's standard but good ambiance place to have a sit down dinner and relax. The service is really good. 

Overall, service + ambiance is what keeps me coming back."}
{"text":"I like this place - it's better than sitting in the crowded and less hygienic food court. The prices in this place are fair, considering it is a restaurant. The bento boxes offer good options within them, such as the unagi don bento box we got ($15). We also got the maki and sashimi appetizer for only $9. With tax and tip, everything came up to $30. The rolls and sashimi could be bigger, but they were still good. Their seafood udon soup portions look huge And their all you can eat pork bone soup for $13 doesn't look bad either. Will be back to try those :)"}
{"text":"ok so i went here today with my mom and was quite disappointed

i ordered the usual: pork bulgogi bento and my mom ordered a miso based vegetarian udon.

my order was fine but my mom's wasn't. it was rly salty (even the udon was hella salty) so we asked a waitress to make it less salty. my mom was watching the chef the whole time and she noticed that he tasted the miso soup to see whether it was still salty or not. once he was done he PUT THE EXACT SPOON BACK INTO THE SOUP (the one was his saliva) which now come on... that is pretty damn gross and not hygienic? clean? sanitary? like at least use another spoon or wash the one you used to taste. but yeah my mom refused to eat it and not even one waiter/waitress bothered to ask us why she refused to eat it or pack it to go. 

probably wouldn't rly go again anymore ..."}
{"text":"It is Korean and Japanese fusion. I've had both and the quality of food is above average. By Pmall standards that is. And the prices are reasonable. They have decent seating, a try to have a rustic decor. This place is better than eating at the food court. I had the dolsot  bibimbap and it was decently done"}
{"text":"If Chinese food and Chinese food isn't what you are craving whilst at Pacific Mall, I suppose there is Axia to break the monotony. Located in the second floor, this standalone Japanese/Korean restaurant has a menu that skews something like 80% Japanese fare (of which most of it is practically your average sushi restaurant type stuff).

I picked a fried beef ramen dish, which had some decent flavours, but tasted like the main flavouring was a dash of soy sauce and MSG. Most notably with the food I noticed served here is how oily they are. Saturated with oil, I feel like I should open an petroleum mining operation instead of eating it. Food presentation was quite strong though, even if everything is served on melamine dishware.

It is quite dark and dingy inside, with enough effort at interior work to not look like a thoughtless greasy spoon dump. Service is inattentive at most. At least they have their own washrooms."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch Saturday.  Tough to find a decent sit down place to eat with 2 little ones and a double stroller in most places, never mind in this mall.  The food court is always packed and not enough seats.  First time here, but I had been to the Axia in Missisauga few times, which I would say was average. This I guess is a slimmed down version of the Mississauga store?  The menu was a lot bigger in Mssissauga if I remembered correctly.

It was about 1pm, so it was extremely busy.  Place was packed and more coming in every few minutes.  About 3,4 servers in the place.  They were friendly but seemed too busy.  After we received our food, never saw them again until I asked for the bill.  Seemed they were too buy to check up on tables, so you would need to wave them down if you needed help. 

We ordered the combo for 2 people where you get choice of sushi, main and side.  Got the Spicy salmon, chicken fried rice, and chicken teriyaki. Was not expecting much, but all the food was actually very good.  The sushi was nice and was not stuffed with tons of rice.  Plenty of sauces in the chicken teriyaki. I like to mix rice with sauces, and this was a good mix."}
{"text":"I've been going here for over 5 years now and I have to say - it's not as much of a value as it used to be; though to be honest, I could still be bitter by the hike in prices in the last year. That being said, their kamjataang is still the best I've had uptown and all you can eat (ayce) of that glorious spicy pork bone soup is just something I begrudgingly pay additional dollars for time and time again even though I know its true price in the beginning.

Even better than the flavour of the pork bone soup is their kamjataang ramen which was added to the menu earlier this year.  It comes with a spicy flavourful broth that's similar but not exactly like the kamjataang that I've come to know and love but BETTER because it has ramen (cooked perfectly with that \"chew\" in every noodle) in it! Full disclosure: I am in LOVE with all things ramen (yes, even the packaged kind) so again, I may be slightly biased but all who have tried this dish with me agrees.  Only bad thing about this ramen is the fact that unlike its soup and rice counterpart, this is not an ayce item. I tried asking for extra noodles and they were going to charge me $5 for it!!! (Ummmm keep your noodles, thanks!) 

If you're not into spicy soups and noodles, they do offer various other dishes like sushi, maki, bibimbap, unagi don, & sashimi that are pretty decent... if you eat like me and buys 2 specialty maki rolls at a time, I suggest you go to a good ayce sushi place for lunch instead for a cheaper price and more value for your money.  But as you can tell - we come for the pork bone soup and ramen. 
 
They give free apps in the beginning of every meal and they give you either frozen sugar coated grapes or candies at the end of your meal. 

I would have rated it previously with a 4 but since everything else I buy there except for my 2 guilty pleasures makes me shake my head when thinking of value, I have to bring it down to a 3.5.

Service is great but I'm also a regular and an amazing tipper so I don't know... be kind to the people who handle your food darlings and I'm sure your service will be good too :p - thanks for reading!"}
{"text":"I went there to eat on the weekend. Last time I had the Katsu bento box, it was tasty . However, the kastu is not as good as last time. They put 
mayonnaise on the kastu this time, which cause the chicken a little bit soft and the flavor has a little more heavy.
 Pork bone soup  - flavor is good, has so many meat on the bones
Pork bulgogi bento box- includes miso soup, bean sprout, broccoli and noodles, good portions of meat and taste good"}
{"text":"This place has Korean and Japanese food, neither of which they do very well.

Their pork bone soup is only okay, if you are really really desperately craving gamjatang then get it I guess, but order it extra spicy because it is pretty bland and very very oily.

Their maki (sushi rolls) are almost as bad as T&T sushi... They have this platter where they fry one of the the sushi rolls and it's just not good. However, their raw sushi and sashimi are okay.

I've only had their ramen once and the noodles were overcooked and the soup was lukewarm and not very flavourful- think Momofuku but even worse."}
{"text":"This is my go to place to eat when I want a nice,spacious, quiet and friendly place to eat Japanese/ korean food. They have specials all day that are Very worthy in my opinion, best value for your money specially if you go for the offers.

I been 5 times here.
- service: 4/5 (super friendly and pleasant/ I do 4 stars in this category because 1 time they forgot to bring one dish but we were happy about it because the offer 2 can dinner for $ 26.99 is generous enough for 2 people, other time they forgot to charge the beers and they bring a tuna sushi roll instead of tuna sushi which I ordered/ I didn't mind those mistakes because overall everything is pretty good) 
- Food: 5/5 ( Always fresh, well crafted and succulent)
-Environment: 5/5 (Even in rush hour is pleasant to be there)

I will be back for more with friends and wife, I do recommend trying it."}
{"text":"Although I've been here a few times, this is my first review. Hmmm, I guess I haven't been here since I first started writing reviews because this place is certainly worthy of my recommendation. The food has been consistently good and tasty. The prices are reasonable, portions are good, and the service has always been very good!

Tonight, I had the Bento Box combo with Bulgogi Beef, Gyoza, Crab Salad Roll, and Crab Salad. My dining companion had the Stir-Fry Pork, Shrimp Tempura, Spicy Salmon Roll, and Crab Salad. Both meals included Miso Soup, Bean Sprouts, and some Broccoli.

Everything was perfectly prepared and tasted great! Although the portions were generous, I would have eaten more. Okay, maybe I'm just greedy. Seriously though, I would have been happy with more Bulgogi Beef and a bowl of rice.

On previous visits, I've had the Spicy Bulgogi Pork, Galbi, and the Pork Bone Soup. All were very good. That's why I keep coming back. ;)"}
{"text":"Food 2 stars.  Cleanliness, decor, services and bathroom +1 star.

You read it right.  The food we had were meh. One was too salty, while the other one was too oily, even by Korean/Chinese food standard.  I bet you can find better tasting food in the food court.  But, and this is a big one, you are really dining here for better seating, cleaner dining environment, courteous services and cleaner washroom, as opposed to food courts."}
{"text":"I haven't visited Pacific Mall in ages but I came during Chinese New Year to roam around and buy some festive items to bring home! You know, that feng shui stuff!

My friends & I decided to have lunch here. I ordered the Kam Ja Tang while my friends ordered sushi, bento box and Bibimbap. 

The sides that came with the Kam Ja Tang were delicious! We devoured the potatoes, kimchi & japchae first! My Kam Ja Tang was flavourful! I would've enjoyed an extra potato or two inside the soup instead of one... However, the bowl was full of meat which was more valuable.. If you put it that way! Overall, I throughly enjoyed my dish and so did my companions! 

Will come back to try their all you can eat Kam Ja Tang when I'm feeling super hungry for $12.99!!!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch on a weekday so there was hardly any customers.

Pork bone soup $12 - I thought the soup was a bit too salty. Very good portions of meat.

Unagi bento $14 - comes with salad, shrimp/veggie tempura, some sushi and salmon sashimi with the unagi on rice. Its a pretty decent assortment of food and everything tasted pretty good. 

Meal comes with side dish which is served on a single rectangular dish which consisted of kimchii, bean sprouts, radish, broccoli and glass noodle. 

Overall, not a bad place to eat if you want actual restaurant atmosphere in pmall."}
{"text":"Look out! My brother ordered the seafood noodle soup, and surprise- it had a zucchini (with bite marks!) in it. The server immediately offered to replace the soup, telling us it's the first time it happened. No thank you!

Gross! Stay away from this place-we don't know what goes on in the kitchen."}
{"text":"Had dinner here while visiting P-mall and I was quite satisfied with the food. I had the regular Bibimbap which was large enough for two and it also came with miso soup and side dishs. I am not an expert in Korean food but I felt it was delicious and authentic. There is also a stone pot version which is the same thing except its in a stone bowl rather than a normal porcelain bowl for $2 more, I didn't think it was necessary. My family also ordered the Tokyo Ramen. It was very... no almost way too flavorful... tasty but too much salt and msg? The ramen was hard as well.

Overall, I liked the setting of the restaurant. It's dark but the booth is well lighted and quite, which separates you from the usual noisy and crowded mall. The service is okay, it took them awhile for them to acknowledge us, take our orders and bring the bills even though the place is not busy."}
{"text":"There Bibimpop is basic but something about it keeps me coming back. It might be the perfectly made hotsauce they give you with it. The waiters are also excellent."}
{"text":"3-3.5* mainly due to friendly service.  I've never had a problem with waitstaff, they always seem smiley, tea is OCD-refilled!

This place is safe and decent if you wanna get away from the crowded food court at Pac Mall.  Sure, you'll be paying like 2Xs more than you would from a stall, but it's a slightly more humane place to dine.  For example, you can pay $5.25 for Wonton Noodle Soup from a stall OR $9.99 for a dish at Axia, plus tax/tip.

You can access their cleaner washroom, have your food brought to your table...as opposed be gettin' a number hollored at, and not hafta sit shoulder-to-shoulder beside a stranger who may smell funny.

Menu is fairly extensive with Japanese, Korean, & Chinese dishes.  I've had the sushi before and it's not bad.  If you order a Korean dish, you'll get banchans with it.  Better deals to be had during weekday lunches as per a sign posted outside the resto."}
{"text":"Reallyyy liked the service they were very attentive and sweet. 

Also, we ordered the pork bulgogi bento and the sashimi bento. And both were pretty good and very reasonably priced. The sashimi bento was only 13.99 and came with like 7-8 pieces of sashimi with tempera and salad and salmon sushi and 4 rolls!

Wanna try the ayce pork bone soup next time"}
{"text":"Hands down this is the best place to eat in Pacific Mall. Its clean, has comfortable seating and the service is very good. O.k, it may cost more than the other places in the food court but its worth it. The sushi (rolls and sashimi) here are very good and very fresh tasting. The lemon chicken is great here as well. They do have a fairly extensive Japanese and Korean menu. If you want to relax and have a nice meal after shopping, this is a great place to end your day."}
{"text":"There are so many food options in the Pacific Mall/Market Village area, I don't know how we ended up here.

We arrived around 3pm, well after the lunch rush but service was still quite slow.  Took the waitress about 15 min. before she appeared to take orders or answer questions.

I ordered the $6.99 daily special which was bim bim bap (Wednesday).  it came with a miso soup and a choice of ice tea, warm tea or coffee.  I chose the ice tea.  The drink came in a small, child size plastic tumbler and was 90% full of ice so very little to drink.

The bim bim bap was a generous portion but did not come with any side dishes like kimchee or pickled radish.  I did get a small bowl of hot sauce which did very little to help the bland flavour of the dish.  

Others at my table ordered the dynamite rolls, cucumber rolls and hand rolls, all pretty standard fare.  We also ordered the red bean drink which also came in the small tumbler cup but for the $3.99 price tag, I would expect it would be a bigger size.

For dessert, we decided to try the tempura cheesecake ($4.99).  It was a decent size and came with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Definitely an interesting dessert and great to share.  I wouldn't want to eat a whole piece by myself.

An okay late lunch but I probably wouldn't return with all the other restaurant choices in this area."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch with my boyfriend and was seated promptly.  To start off I love the service here.  They have both English and Chinese speaking workers that are efficient and very friendly.

We ordered 2 AYCE of Pork Bone Soup & a spicy salmon roll.  
The spicy salmon roll arrived first and was somewhat ... stale?  The salmon was warm and it seems like they've left fish out for a while before slicing and serving.
The sides for the PBS was average but I did notice the staple of sides ... kimchi was missing ]:

The soup arrived shortly after the appetizers and the roll.  The soup did not seem very authentic, there was not the 'base' flavour you would usually get out of a PBS.  The potato was still semi-raw and was in a huge chunk instead of little cubed squares.  The soup had the burnt flavour of where some dregs on the bottom was charred.  But there was a thick inch of meat on the bones.

Coke was also $2.50-ish for a can ):

Overall, the food here is average - you will get full from it and the prices aren't too ridiculous (besides the Coke) - but there are more authentic places surrounding the area."}
{"text":"I love coming here. Pacific Mall's food court is usually super packed and impossible to find seats. There's always a table available when we come here. I find that the prices are pretty good for what you are getting and they have plenty of different dishes to cater your taste buds. 

Axia is located on the second floor of Pacific Mall, right across the second food court. The atmosphere of the restaurant feels different than the rest of the Mall. It's quite nice and quiet aside from all the chaos and crowd in the mall. 

There's a few things on the menu that you should get. The sweet and sour chicken/pork and get the sushi! All of their sushi are so tasty and fresh. Their korean menu comes with the traditional side dishes - bean sprouts, japchap, sweet potatoe, radish, kimchi and soup. Plus they are endless! You can ask for more without any charge! Their spider rolls and spicy salmon rolls are amazing. Their soft shell crab is to die for. It's super fresh and crispy and not greasy like most sushi places that I have been to. 

Another thing you should try is there pork bone soup. So flavorful and hearty, nothing is more comforting that an endless bowl of pork bone soup for less than 15 bucks! The meat literally falls off the bones and the soup you can add more spice to it too. Such a popular dish that I see on most of the tables when I come to eat here. 

I'm not a big fan of their noodle dishes, it's pretty generic and pretty bland. You can get ramen anywhere else, just don't get it here, get the sizzling Kalbi (WHICH IS ALSO AMAZING) or the sushi. My mom always regret her decision every time she chooses the udon or ramen soup. There's nothing special about it. 

Their bubble tea are also great. I think it is made by bubbletease, the bubbletea stand connected to the restaurant. TIP: When you order your bubbletea, they usually always make it to eat in when you're in the restaurant. Just save yourself the trouble and ask for the bubbletea to make to go."}
{"text":"Pacific Mall is a fun place to be in Canada, located in Markham, Ontario, we had the chance to experience he place 3 years ago when we went to Canada to celebrate my husband & mother-in-law joint birthdays.

I love visiting my in-laws..been coming here since the 80's and they are fun to be with.  They all initially brought us here & we've been scouring the place ever-since...
There is an endless array of different fashion booths, salons, shoes, bags, movie & CD, stores, Spa, Skin Clinics, different merchandise & above, all, All kinds of food...the Food Court is located on the 2nd Floor, a whole array of different kinds of cuisines...and mind you, all very affordable ...

My favorite was the Best Shrimp Dumpling Booth but I'll talk about that in a different review...Right across from that booth is this Korean/Japanese place called Axia... they have daily specials that will blow you away...We went there for dinner and had one of their specials called Beef Bulgogi  Bento Box which includes, Seaweed Soup, Rice, Kim Chi, Salad for $9.99, (same item 6.99 for lunch)  and added extra Shrimp Tempura (2 Pcs) and California Roll(3  [Pcs) for only $3.00...now that was a great deal...

Enjoyed the food, the staff(all dressed in black) & very pleasant & the place...Will I go there again...Absolutely!!!"}
{"text":"Over the last few years I've been meaning to review this place. I come here often as  their Beef Bulgogi is quite good. Their sushi is pretty decent as well and theyve got great specials. For the price this place is awesome. 

If you're ever in Pacific Mall and want a place to sit down for a bit; this is the place i'd suggest. Its set up just like a restaurant and less a food court unlike the other food vendors within the mall. As someone who isn't Oriental Asian; I find it easier as i'm not holding up a line trying to decide what to get. 

Environment wise; its fair. Its in a mall; so I don't really expect too much. It is connected to a bubble tea shop; so you have that added to beverage choices which is awesome. Also they have a great birthday special! If its your birthday; take some ID and enjoy a free meal (which they don't cheap out on!)

The Korean condiments are lovely and the Kimchi is quite good. Overall if your at Pmall its prob the best bet to have a lovely meal and away from the hustle and bustle of the mall. Definitely recommend the beef bulgogi bento box and the salmon sashimi."}
{"text":"Nice place in Pacific Mall. I really enjoyed how they had the option of making your own bento box because a lot of the time there is always that ONE item you don't want and give it your friend lol. But yes, the staff were very friendly and food was satisfying."}
{"text":"Axia Cafe is located in the food court area inside Pacific Mall. One of the Chinese owned and runned Japanese and Korean Restaurant in the area.

I found the interior quite dark since all the furnitures and deco are dark brown in colour and the lighting is pretty dim. There are some booth sitting in the middle of the restaurant and there are tables looking outside to the food court area of the mall.

The menu is a mixture of Korean and Japanese food. There is a daily lunch special from Monday to Friday for $6.99  that includes a drink. Since today is Friday, the special is Pork Bone Soup with rice which I decided on trying.. this same dish is $9.99 regular price without a drink.

There are no complimentary appeititzers with the lunch specials. My pork bone soup arrived quickly. There were 3 pieces of bones and a big potatoes. The soup base is really bland.. definitely not spicy. The rice is not the brown rice which is offered in the Korean restaurant, just plain white rice. For $6.99 it is ok.. but if I have to pay $9.99 for it, I will NOT be happy!

The service is quite good though. The waitstaffs kept walking around checking to see if the teacups were filled. 

They accepts Visa, Mastercard and Interac."}
{"text":"One of my fave spots. Food is good and reasonably priced.  The staff is nice and they now have all u can eat Kam ja tang.   They have new Items on the menu like make your own bento box and make your own noodle soup.  =)"}
{"text":"Your enjoyment of this restaurant depends on what you're expecting. Axia is cleaner and more spacious than sitting in the food court, and since it's a restaurant, the food is pricier too. 

I've been here twice and although the food itself is quite good, everything else seems to be lackluster. I like the seating arrangements in the restaurant, and the servers are friendly, but the side dishes you receive here aren't very good in comparison to other restaurants. You get four tiny dabs of food on a single dish. It's practically one bite of food. 

Like I said though, the actual main dishes themselves are tasty. The first time I came here, I think I got the spicy pork (comes with rice and soup). The second time I ordered the bibimbap. The size was smaller than I anticipated, but it was still really big for me. I ended up bringing some of it home. I know a lot of people think the main part of bibimbap is eating the hard rice at the bottom of the stone pot, but I actually really hate that, so maybe next time I won't opt for the stone pot. 

Overall, there are no major flaws here. It's a good place to grab lunch or dinner if you're not interested in fighting to the death over a seat in the food court. 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I have been coming to Axia ever since I was a kid. What I like about this restaurant is that amount of options available to choose from. Whether it's Korean food or Japanese food, Axia will make it taste delicious. The service is also excellent. Very friendly staff. 5/5 for sure."}
