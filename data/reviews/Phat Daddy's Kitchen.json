{"text":"Excellent food and interesting menu! Chef Damon is so talented, you won't regret trying everything on the menu! Shrimp and grits were outstanding!!!"}
{"text":"What an absolute GEM I found today! My friend said we has to stop by Phat Daddy's and check out the food. She had been there once before and was raving about it. 
When we arrived, honestly, I had my doubts when we walked in the door. It looked like every local dive bar I've ever been to.....until I saw the menu. 
Never did I expect what Was offered. The taco selection alone had my eyes popping....Pork belly, boar, duck, hash and others. Seviche made with scallops and shrimp, nachos with chips fried to order.....
I debated between the duck and hash tacos and finally opted for the hash tacos and owner/chef Damon Ginnard suggested adding chorizo to it. Stellar! Layers of flavor balanced with simple, unpretentious plating made this dish absolutely slay! 
The seviche wasn't quite ready while we were there so I guess that and the duck tacos will be waiting for me the next time I'm back, and that will be much sooner than later. 
Can't say enough about the food and chef Damon's skill. Finding places like this is what food is all about! Do not waste time, check Phat Daddy's out ASAP."}

{"text":"The best food you will find in a hole in the wall Cleveland bar!!!! Such a shocker..amazing food and very friendly people!
The best french fries around, my favorite would be the meatloaf or pizza's!
A tasty treat for everyone, and great daily specials!!"}
{"text":"This place is a total gem.  Elevated bar food at a great price.  The food is sophisticated, but not to the point where people won't enjoy the food.  French Bread pizzas with homemade chorizo, yes please.  Tender grilled Mahi Mahi sandwich with habanero tartar sauce, oh my god yes.  Head chef Damon Ginnard will elevate the Camms Corners food scene in no time.  This spot will always be on my list for places to go get some grub."}
