{"text":"Decent food and got the special offer 2. The sweet and sour chicken was just right but the beef lo mein and Szechuan chicken needed more work."}
{"text":"I was very skeptic because I NEVER see anyone in here, I thought it had went out of business. I was surprised to see all these good reviews because I live nearby and always like Chinese food. I came here and then said I'd give it a try

I wanted to give 2.5 rating because food was decent, service was cool too but at that price I didn't feel the serving size was big enough smh maybe I was misled by the other reviews maybe if they were more specific on what they ordered etc. Thankfully the food was fine (ordered general tso chicken), but again it didn't blow my mind maybe my expectations are set too high the other places I frequent."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a whim after having a craving for a wonton soup and egg roll.  They did not have any wontons made for the soup which I suppose is a good sign that they make them from scratch.  I ended up ordering a lunch combo instead.  The combo came with chicken chop suey, fried noodles and an egg roll.  The egg roll was standard. Not really anything bad or fantastic about it.  Standard.  The noodles were quite tasty and were prepared fresh as was the chop suey. One thing I did like was the portion.  The container wasn't overflowing with food.  It was just the perfect amount.  Overall, I'd go again if I was in the mood for American style Chinese food in the future."}
{"text":"Great food..super hot when it was delivered which is rare in the middle of winter. Our family cooks for a living so we were disappointed in the deep fried items because we could tell the oil needed to be changed. Otherwise a great experience. Would have liked to give 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"I am a regular customer (used to be under diff name) but food is good/hot/and not over salted (no msg)!

{"text":"Fast delivery, friendly service, good food. Pricey but worth it. Will order again."}
{"text":"The food was ok the delivery was on time. The sweet and sour ribs were the worst I have tasted fat and no meat for 10$"}
{"text":"I came across rice kitchen from justeat.ca and will say that they have not disappointed yet we at least order twice a month food is hot on time and not salty or greasy which is why I keep coming back. Very happy with the food and service"}
{"text":"Staff is very friendly, professional and accommodating. The food is delicious. I love coming here. I usually always get meals from the lunch menu and then add on a couple of side dishes like chicken balls and spring rolls. Again, everything is delicious"}
