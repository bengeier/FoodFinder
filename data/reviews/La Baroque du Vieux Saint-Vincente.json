{"text":"Nice find! We found this place I. A side street in Old Montreal. We went in because we saw a sign for gluten free Poutine. We were pleasantly surprised. Good food, beer (no GF) and friendly waiter. We decided to go. Ack a few days later we were touring around again and stopped in for GF pizza and oh my deliciousness!! Again, great conversation. The waiter talked to us, made sure we had hit all the major \"attractions\" in Montreal. Don't be put off by it's outside appearance. It's a true gem."}
{"text":"If I could give this place a zero, I would. The waitress is mainly to blame. Everything was delayed, warm beers were served, she spilled one beer, then, later, she spilled a cup of water. No napkins provided on both occasions. The \"air conditioned\" \"restaurant\" was hotter than satan barbecuing in a desert. She forgot our order. Yup, forgot. The list goes on. Don't come here. Let this place fail. Capitalism will take over. Montreal will be made whole again. This place is a blemish on Canada. Dear god. Just horrible."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Server was very nice but we waited forever to order and then get our food, had to ask 3 times before getting water. They never brought my poutine, which is the reason we chose this cafe. People who came after us ordered and were gone before we got our food. The whole experience was bad"}
