{"text":"I found this place on Yelp.  It's a small place with the weirdest decor I've ever seen, like the random manikin seated in a chair that I kept thinking was a real person.  The staff could not have been friendlier.  The food was cooked fresh and simply but was good.  Two full breakfasts for less than $11!   You can't beat it.  We will definitely go back when we are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"If you had an uncle loved to cook, overstuff you and was also an art collector, I think going to Cafe Miami would be like going to his house. You are greeted by a warm hello from the owner and server when you enter the door. There's a bar to I at as we'll as dining room style table and chairs. The walls of this place are covered by an eclectic mix art collected over the years.   Now to the food:  Much of it is your standard diner fair, but what you have to come for are the hot cakes. It's a mound of delightfully three airy, rich cake. I got mine covered in a fresh cut strawberries. Some of the best pancakes around!  You could quibble with some things like the coffee, but really with the charm, great hot cakes, portions and prices it completely a 5 star stop for breakfast."}
{"text":"Larry and Sheri are both very welcoming and just very good to all their customers.  You can tell they love what they do.  Food is very good and the price can't be beat.  They don't accept credit card which is understandable considering they are a small restaurant."}
{"text":"Stopped in today after looking for breakfast near Independence Ohio. Top rated Cafe Miami was our choice on a yelp. We were surprised to find the door locked at about 8:50. Then we saw the sign saying they opened at 9:00. No sooner did we see the sign did we hear a voice saying we're open. Then we door opened and we were greeted by the owner of this lovely unique establishment. He was joking around with us as he put on the coffee and took our orders. I got the American. Two eggs, potatoes, I chose sausage, and toast for $2.50. Wow!. Of course I wanted to try the pancakes but ordering two breakfasts would be too much. I asked if I could get just one pancake and I was easily accommodated. My colleague with me got the French toast and sausage. Everything was delicious. The pancake was huge and fluffy with tasty sprinklings of powdered sugar and I think a tad of cinnamon. The bill was a $10.50 for all in. I would definitely list this as a must visit."}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING - the food is out of this world good.  It has a really cozy atmosphere and the server and owner were super friendly (bringing over extra sauce and letting us taste a bite of the flan for free)!  Try to tropi chop for sure...we're from Colorado but I wish we lived in Cleveland so I could have it every week! :)"}
{"text":"This place is great!! Found it on Yelp when passing through town, the owner is super friendly and obviously puts love and care into the food, the Tropichop with pork is out of this world and the rancheros are amazing too!! Great atmosphere too."}
{"text":"This would be a 5 star but it was our first time here so gotta leave some room for future visits.   We found this place on Yelp having just arrived in Cleveland two days earlier, for the very first time, due to a job transfer.   Artsy, eclectic, and imaginative decor was much appreciated.   The menu is diverse enough to be appealing while simple enough to not overwhelm. Prices are excellent.  The staff were wonderful! Very friendly and personable. Truly welcoming. We found the other patrons to also be the same. Very nice neighborhood feel.   The pancakes were likely the best we have had only second to my grandmothers . They were delicious fluffy and filling and served with powered sugar that made us almost forget to also try them with syrup.   The bacon was perfectly crisp, eggs done over easy as requested. My husband finished every home fry....a true rarity. (A bit too many onions in them for me but crunchy and tasty all the same)  The only minor bummers were that the coffee is a bit weak and the pancakes arrived about 10 minutes before the other food and were so good we gobbled them and had less room for everything else.   Portions are quite healthy. Come hungry. We will surely be back!"}
{"text":"If your looking for eggs with a heaping side of eccentric decor head to Cafe Miami. Sure, Larry might take a little longer to fry up your bacon but it's cooked with local Cleveland love and a story or three. It's good food with even greater people."}
{"text":"Great food! The Cuban sandwiches are the best and I also liked the ham and cheese empanadas. They have a breakfast menu too."}
{"text":"Excellent little eclectic fun foodiery where you least expect it. Goodly sized portions. Warning come hungry. Great food excellent prices good people. It's a fun time for all."}
{"text":"So this place reminds me of my grandparents house.....in a good way! it's definitely cozy. The owner is very welcoming and kind. He's a very nice guy. Now I heard about this place and didn't know if it would live up to the expectation, but it did! Big portions and tasty food. Prices are inexpensive which is good for a lot for many people in the area. They only take cash by the way which isn't too bad, I should probably carry cash anyway. Definitely recommend and will be going back!!!"}
{"text":"Last week I had the wonderful fortune of finding Cafe Miami via the internet. I would like to confirm what is written in all the previous reviews. My own contribution would be emphasizing the uniqueness, the eclectic ambiance, the 'Larry' persona of friendliness which caught me off guard, the really tasty food, the wondrous art and memorabilia collection which you can feast your eyes on. Two drawbacks: I like my coffee stronger and a more noticeable street sign may be a good idea. My overall rating: a top notch diamond. Will go as often as I can."}
{"text":"Best brunch I've had in a long while. I had the latin breakfast (not in the menu but will be made upon request). The place looks like an art gallery in New Orleans and the environment is very home like. The fried beans with the cuban toast were amazing. The owner herself made our meals and can only describe it as superb. I wish they open one in Chicago. Make sure you ask for the tamales."}
{"text":"Larry is the COOLEST. food is cheap as others have mentioned, and very good. weak coffee, but Larry's strong personality makes up for it :)"}
{"text":"Went on a Sunday late morning 7/19 because it was too hot to cook at home and we needed to refuel after a long day a festival the day before. I don't recall much of the menu from the prior owner, but I knew I wanted to come back after reading about the Cuban items. My BF and I split fried sweet plantains with black beans and a generous helping of sour cream. He had the Cubano sandwich (his only critique was that he wishes he had the sauces from Barroco!) and I had the Cuban breakfast with a huge hunk of Cuban bread. I would have finished every last bite of it if it wasn't for the coco latte I ordered. Iced latte made with coconut milk and topped with whipped cream and shredded coconut--a meal in itself. Leftovers saved me from cooking that night, too! Will totally go back.  Super friendly waitress and owner-the only thing preventing me from giving it five stars was the wait for the check and change. 4.5***"}
{"text":"First time coming here and we absolutely loved it! the food is fantastic and the pancakes are addictive! thankyou to all the other reviews out there and to yelp, cause we never wod have found it or tried it without the gleaming reccomendations. i cant wait to bring my son here!"}
{"text":"Awesome new owner. Food was very good. Came in with a cousin who's vegan and the meal she made for him was wonderful, he had seconds. My favorite is the plantain grilled with refried beans and sour cream."}
{"text":"Its changed hands since I was last here.  The breakfast is now $4.50, which for eggs, toast, meat and hashbrowns still isn't bad.  The new owner was very nice.  She even let us taste her Pineapple chai drink, which is excellent.  There is still a limited menu, but the cuban sandwiches sound delicious and the chocolate cake looked very good.  I plan on going back soon for lunch."}
{"text":"I have been here twice. The first time, on Father's Day, I ordered hot cakes with strawberries- excellent! The next time I went there I tried eggs, potatoes and toast- all for only 2.50! Again, another great breakfast. The food was hot, delivered to our table in under ten minutes from when we ordered and our waitress was attentive.   The only reason I did not give this great little place a perfect score is because both times I've been there the coffee was not fresh ( tasted as if it had been sitting on the burner for about 30min to an hour).  I would definitely recommend this place to grab some great breakfast."}
{"text":"Came on a whim due to the good reviews. Ordered the Cheese Lover's Omelette from the smallish menu. Homefries were undercooked and tasteless. Toast was literally barely toasted and soggy. The \"cheese\" in the omelette consisted of three slices of cheese placed on top of the egg that were unmelted. Server seemed as if it was her first day on the job and had to go back and forth between us and the cook upon being asked questions about the food. Seemed pretty mediocre, but you could chalk it up to the cook that day either being new or really lazy."}
{"text":"Came here early on a Sunday morning thinking after reading online, that it opened at 7 AM.  When I got there, the sign said it opened at 9 AM so I was really bummed.  It was 8 AM and I was supposed to meet a friend there at 8.  While I was sitting there, staring through the window, Larry, the owner/cook/waiter came out and opened the door and let me in the place.  Really nice guy- great place.  The decor is eclectic- Larry is also an artist and the place feels like a hole-in-the-wall, but man, the dude can cook.  Fantastic hot cakes.  I got the strawberries, but I suspect they'd be just as good w/ maple syrup.  Really enjoyed the potato hash and my eggs were done well.  Coffee was diner coffee, but it was fresh.    I enjoyed just talking to Larry- very approachable and I appreciate what he's doing to grow community in the Old Brooklyn area.  Prices were really cheap for what I got.  Will bring The Wife at some future time."}
{"text":"Interesting place!!!  Love the food & excellent service ... Larry was a great host and server ;)  I would definitely come back !"}
{"text":"Food 5/5 Price 5/5 Owner 5/5  Atmosphere 3/5 Other staff 4/5 Preparation 4/5  Let me walk through my experience.  I am greeted by their owner who is an older black man named Larry. He is a very sociable guy but doesn't lean on you too hard. Makes you feel very welcome.  I arrived with my mother and I just wanted some coffee, eggs, and bacon which they had for an extremely good price of 2.50 + coffee. I wanted sausage too and that cost an additional $3 which didn't make much sense.  The bar would be a perfect spot to sit and eat if you are there alone or just with a buddy. We go into the dining area and it is a very grandma-esque with its appearance and had a bunch of art around.  The waiter approaches and asks if I want some coffee which I agree to. He's a bit quiet to be a waiter and lacking people skills but was polite.  We received complimentary coffee cake with caramel which was really good but our food took about 20-25 minutes. In the meantime, I decided to piss / check out the bathroom. The sole small unisex bathroom could use a bit of cleaning to help solidify comfort to newbies and customers in general.  WHAT HURT THE REVIEW? Normally I think I would give this a 3/5 but the owner really has a passion for making people feel comfortable. The price of additional sausage being more than a meal (2 eggs with choice of sausage or bacon) hurts the rating. The atmosphere was pretty cool and unique but it was a bit claustrophobic as it wasn't too big.  The waiters were a bit strange in personality.  The bathroom not being taken care of."}
{"text":"Excellent wait service and really interesting decor. Food prices were inexpensive but not the greatest quality. It's a quirky spot to check out, but it won't be a regular spot for me."}
{"text":"The Cafe is under new ownership, however the same style of eating. It is like being at a friends house and you are being served in the dining room with photos of Marilyn Monroe, the Beatles and many more. The breakfast serving is good portion with a Cuban flair."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came in for breakfast and got cuban coffee, a latte and some pancakes. Everything was super fresh and delicious. The owner brought out the food herself too and takes a lot of pride in her restaurant. The wait staff is also very nice and they were all very welcoming. The decor is also very interesting and made it feel very homey. Definitely recommend. NOTE: I believe they are cash only."}
{"text":"Terrible. Guy was rude, understaffed, didn't seem to want any actual business. Busy, overstimulating decor. We didn't stay to eat. If I could give it zero stars I would."}
{"text":"I came here for the pancakes based on the recommendations I had read.  They were very good, as was the coffee.  The people were friendly and seating was comfortable.  It reminded me of my dear late mother's home, and it was just as clean!  That's important to me.  We enjoyed looking around at everything."}
{"text":"This place is an EXPERIENCE! The food is decent and the prices can't be beat! There is something to look at in every inch of the place and it feels like your in an eccentric persons dining room (best part everything is for sale). We thoroughly enjoyed our time here, the owner was charming and funny. What a great place. Totally road trip worthy!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome.  Just seriously good, hearty breakfast with exceptional pancakes.  Owner is so personable.  You will not leave hungry & you will not be bored while you're waiting.  But bring cash because they don't take credit cards!"}
{"text":"Another place I would have never visited or known existed without Yelp.   A little hard to find and the construction out front doesn't help. The owner actually greeted us at the door welcoming us in. Once in, you're kind of in a different world. I've never seen a diner (its not a cafe) with so much \"stuff\" in it.  We had 2 of the all Americans, extra bacon, 2 cups of coffee and a can of coke. $10.80! And it was good.  We'll be back.  The address one reviewer listed is incorrect!"}
{"text":"A wonderfully eclectic blend of neighborhood kitsch and old-school diner and, quite possibly, one of the best kept secrets in Cleveland. In the historic neighborhood of Old Brooklyn, the Cafe Miami is a gem. More like eating in the living room of a good friend with questionable design taste than a cafe, this place is sure to put a smile on your face and a food baby in your belly.  As soon as we walked in, Larry, the owner, cook and heart of the establishment, greeted us with a warm smile that was so genuine I had to remind myself that this was the first time we had ever met. Yeah, it's pretty small. There are about five stools at the bar up front and another 15 or so seats in the side room.   Before I go any further, I have to mention the decor. The theme is that there's no theme. Pictures of Jimi Hendrix, Bob Marley, Marilyn Monroe and somebody that looks like a black Mark Twain hang on the walls while an Indian elephant statue covered in jewels sets on the floor across from a mannequin, legs crossed, watching from beneath a blonde wig. It's at once both creepy and comforting, sort of like the way the basement of your best friend's grandma would be. Each table is decorated with some rendition of a silver platter upon which rests a pair of blue plastic cups filled with toothpicks and artificial sweeteners. You really need to see it for yourself.  The menu is a mix of breakfast and lunch dishes with the former being served from 9am until noon. Breakfast includes traditional fare like eggs, hotcakes, French toast bacon and sausage and omelets along with a few unique additions like crab cakes and gyro meat. The lunch dishes range from heartier pork chops and liver and onions to burgers and wraps of several varieties. We were there on a breakfast mission and, more than anything else, to experience the pancakes about which others have gushed so profusely.  Speaking of the pancakes, what can I say that hasn't already been said. These things could make Aunt Jemima rethink her career path. My wife is a pancake snob and the look on her face after her first bite said it all. An order consists of a trio of perfectly cooked flapjacks, 45 record in size, dusted with powdered sugar and graced with a dollop of melting butter. The caramelized edges were crispy and the insides spongy, doughy and light. If there are pancake gods this could be singular proof. If you go here for breakfast, get them.  The American breakfast is everything it should be. You get a choice of meat (bacon, ham or sausage), two eggs any way you want 'em, toast and home fries for $2.50. Yeah, that's right, I said $2.50. The eggs were cooked beautifully, the bacon crisp, as requested, and the home fries grilled crispy with pieces of onion scattered throughout.   The service we experienced was friendly and genuine from beginning to end. Our coffees were never empty, she checked back with just the right amount of frequency (Larry even stopped over to ask how things were going) and when it was time to go boxes were brought to the table promptly. Our server's friendliness was real and not forced and it reminded us that there are still folks in the service industry that care.  Places like Cafe Miami are becoming a rarity, fast being devoured by chains devoid of personality that churn out carbon copy processed pseudo-food. This place oozes honesty, pride and reality. Business owners like Larry are also on the endangered species list. Do your part and pay him a visit. Show him that local businesses do matter and while you're there give something back to your community. Maybe eating here a few times a week will make you feel a little less guilty for shopping at Wal-Mart. Just don't tell too many of your friends, I'd hate for it to get crowded."}
{"text":"I have been bitten by the move bug many times in my life. Always I have found that I cannot make it without the soft colors of winter, the ever changing Lake Erie, or the smoke from the steel mills. I also know there are places in this town I cannot duplicate elsewhere. One of these places is Cafe Miami. Breakfasts in Tampa or NYC or Puerto Vallarta may be nice but not this unique. Cafe Miami joins the West Side Market, Playhouse Square, and Edgewater Park to make Cleveland my place to be."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place in town. I love George and Larry, the place, the food, the talk, the \"world according to Reagan\" poster, and the prices. I can go there with someone else and still spend $10-$12 after a king's meal and delightful conversation about anything. From Smithsonian art, to the charter schools in Cleveland. Strongly recommend this place to anyone who wants an entertaining breakfast, especially if you seat at the bar by the kitchen, you'll be in for a treat."}
{"text":"My first Breakfast at Cafe` Miami was delicious.   After reading the other posters descriptions I had to try this local gem.  A gem indeed.  Larry, Owner / Cook, had a genuine greeting as soon as I cleared the screen door making me feel welcome and valued.  I inquired if it was OK to park on the lot to the right of the building and he said I could have parked right out front, it doesn't get much better than that.   He immediately offered me a choice of seating and took my coffee and water order.    As i sat down I absorbed the decor which made me get up and walk around the room and inspect various posters, and artifacts.  I even took a picture of a Dorothy Fuldheim portrait for those of you who know who she is.  The fans created a very comfortable atmoshphere, even though it was only 78 degrees outside, and the decor and furniture take you back to a time not too long ago which is comforting and familiar on many levels.  Clean, comfortable, and decorated in a variety of styles which peak curiosity and are entertaining and historical.  I forgot my servers name but she was highly efficient and never let my coffee cup run out, not easy to do.  She was knowledgeable about the food and very attentive with me and the other guests who came in.  The pancakes were awesome and huge, a must try!  The eggs were cooked to order, sausage was good, and I declined the toast as it would have been too much food.  I was too full to taste the hashbrowns even though they looked great, did not mean to insult but I'm not much of a hashbrown eater anyway.    They have 2, 4, and larger group seating arrangements as well as a counter which seats i believe 5.    The coffee was good but not outstanding, Larry, you may consider trying another brand or grind, when you review your suppliers.  Sometimes the coffee alone can raise the experience level, although it's already pretty high.  Just an honest recommendation in the only area of improvement I observed.   It was good to see the level of famiiarity they greet guests with indicating they are regulars and like coming back.  I suspect I will be one of those guests.   Cafe` Miami is a value at twice the price.  I am glad they are in our Great city and a part of our thriving neighborhood where they support the Cleveland experience.  Stop by and enjoy a great meal in a local establishment which makes you feel welcome!  Try it, you'll like it."}
{"text":"We went a little out of our way on our inaugural Cleveland visit to check out Cafe Miami based on the Yelp reviews. It did not disappoint. We received an incredibly warm and attentive reception from Crystal and Larry, who take great pride in their unique cafe, and had a delicious hearty breakfast in the mix. In addition to the American special, we each had 1 hot cake, which was enough by itself to feed a fire department, so be aware if you order the full stack.  The funky and eclectic decor was charming.  Wish Miami FL had a Cafe Miami!"}
{"text":"Went with an old friend and I had the special and blueberry pancakes and you know what? Didn't have to eat FOR THE REST OF THE DAY!!!!! I went all the way to lunch the next day I was so fulll!!! But there were faults... They don't take credt and that almost presented an awkward situation but I come prepared... CREDIT CARD MACHINE Please.... Tables are so freaken small! Couldn't place all plates on the really small table....I was thinking why not just pile everything on the same plate? It's going to the same place anyway... I ordered 2 dishes.... The special....DELISH! Blueberry pancakes...Overall yes...Absolutely delicious!!!! Weird thing? the plate was covered with powdered sugar and I resorted to piling the overspill to the side of the plate, I thought I was getting blueberry pancakes..You know blueberrys cooked in?  Yeah...No...TOPPED with blueberry preserves.... Maybe handmade I do not know....Again they were good but not what I was expecting....  Your call to visit and see if I missed anything.... Cheers!!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and prices.  Owner Larry cooks himself and if you stay close to the kitchen area you will get a great conversation for free!  There is on street parking in front during some hours (see signs posted) and there are two parking areas (one off Cypress).  http://www.facebook.com/pages/Cafe-Miami/114021831962196"}
{"text":"I just moved to the neighborhood and was looking for a great spot to have a special breakfast with my fiancé. I am so happy that I found this place!! The owner/cook and wait staff greet you at the door. The decor is different but it makes you feel as if you were back home or in your grandmothers dining room.   I had the All American Breakfast and my fiancé had an omelette breakfast and I have to say it was an excellent start to our morning. The coffee kept on coming and we were treated like family. Larry is also currently starting a bakery and started us off with a slice of red velvet cake on the house. OMG!!!.....it was the most deliciously moist cake I have ever had and is the reason I gave it 5 stars. The other yelp reviews depict this place very well and I must say that it will always be my breakfast spot from now on. It is cash only but my favorite spots usually are.   FYI- He plans to keep giving out free samples of his cakes so check him out soon before his bakery is completely up and running. I promise you won't regret it."}
{"text":"We came after church. They were open on Easter. Pretty amazing. The four of us ordered the American Breakfast. I got my eggs scrambled. The others got sunny side up and 2 scrambled. With this came choice of meat (me sausage patties) potatoes and toast. All for $2.50!!! Coffee a buck! Free bottled water if you chose as well. It was good I should mention. So the four of us spent a total of $12 plus tip. Unbelievable. I need to mention the service was good and the decor is something to see. Paintings, sculptures, artifacts and memorabilia from all over the country and the world.  The menu also has omelettes, waffles pancakes and other selections. The owner who does the cooking as well came over to greet us and asked how we enjoyed our breakfast.  You can't beat this place! The only downer is they accept cash only. But with these prices who cares!"}
{"text":"The people were very nice (both the server and the owner), the food was mostly average, and the wait time was extremely long even though we were pretty much the only people there.  The veggie omelet was very uninspired - a few pieces of red and green pepper.  The pork chop was fine and the corn beef for the corn beef hash seemed like it came from a can.  My toast had two big, soggy, lukewarm butter spots right in the center.  However, the topper was ice.  It's a warm day.  I order a soda.  It comes in a can and alongside it is a glass and two small chunks of ice.  \"Can I have some more ice?\" Days pass. \"Excuse me, can I have some ice?\"  Then my dining companion says, \"You know, that looks good.  Can I have a soda as well?\" Days pass. He emerges with another soda, and a glass with two pieces of ice in it. \"Can I have some more ice?\" Days pass. He emerges with a glass with 4 or 5 chunks of ice in it.  \"We're actually out of ice.\" We hear them sending someone to go buy a bag of ice. Man enters with bag of ice. Days pass. \"Excuse me, can we have some ice?\""}
{"text":"Strange and unique decor  Larry didn't stop complaining about \"Miami Cafe\" who stole his name and his pictures the whole time we were there.   We were talked into the homemade sausage biscuits and gravy and it was eh at best.   Coffee was good  One and done - won't be back"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast place around Cleveland and probably all of Ohio. I have been a few times and the owner recognizes me every time, keeps telling me I have to bring my girlfriend back because we are so cute together. But, besides how hospitable the owner and staff are the food is amazing. It reminds me of a good old fashion country family breakfast. I couldn't like the food better if I prepared it myself; I haven't tried everything, but I am working on it. Thus far every meal has been fantastic.  On top of everything, the prices are beyond reasonable. I got two American breakfasts (eggs, hash browns, and choice of meat), OJ, side of bacon, and side of pancakes (which you have to try when you go, they are amazing and a 3 stack is enough to share between two people) for like 11 bucks.   I like to plan trips up to Cleveland and make this the starting point of my day. Don't let the outside fool you, this is a one of the best places to eat in the morning. I can't rave about it enough!"}
{"text":"You could give this place three or four stars. BUT the people and company make up for it! I laugh my ass of every time I'm in this place. You sit in a strange room with crazy decor where everything is for sale. I will be going back here for years to come."}
{"text":"My son and I are from out of town. I checked reviews of places on yelp and so glad I did. This is the best breakfast I've had in a very long time. The area made me a little nervous when walking in but the owner and server pleasantly greeted us and I knew it was a wonderful place. The decor was so quirky, my 3 year old loved playing with all the toys. We ordered the all American breakfast and french toast, even though it wasn't on the menu, the owner, I believe is the cook, made it for us. Best French toast ever! I was shocked by the prices. I am very fussy with food but figured with thede prices I could settle. No worries about that here. Everything was fantastic, and so much food we couldn't finish. If we are ever in town again we will be back."}
{"text":"I am so glad I chose to go to Cafe Miami versus another place on my last day in Cleveland. The parking sits to the left of the building. Walking to Cafe Miami was interesting since I'm not a local and it seemed to be a bit odd of a location for a breakfast joint. Opening a screen door to get access to the main door reminded me of the house I grew up in. The interior was...cozy although a bit cluttered.  I ordered 3 eggs with gyros & an order of french toast. This was the best breakfast I've tasted. The owner came out and asked me how did I like my food. My look told him he did a superb job. I just wish he was in Dallas.I flew from OH to Dallas with my leftovers. Even after sitting a few hours, it was still good. Highly recommend Cafe Miami!!!"}
{"text":"The owner greeted us as soon as we walked in and was checking up on us the whole time. Plus we got to try a complimentary piece of cake to start off with! The cake was moist, fluffy, and not too sweet.  The food was perfect comfort breakfast food. You can't beat the American breakfast for $2.50!   I would recommend they have more signature dishes because overall the choices are standard breakfast choices. It tastes great but the decor is really what stands out. You feel like you're eating in your wacky grandma's living room but it's neat. The only downside was, although they were nice, the waiters seemed to be learning and thus we had to keep asking for lots of things. Definitely a gem in old Brooklyn!"}
{"text":"Mostly, I have missed this while place driving down State Rd-- but am glad I noticed it today.  After finding some positive reviews on Yelp, I thought I'd give it a try.  A very eclectic, but cozy interior... plenty to look while (quite briefly) waiting for breakfast.  Very friendly place, and quite a deal for a solid diner breakfast--an omelette and hash browns.  I could see myself as a weekend regular here."}

Since resurrecting the shuttered business, one that previous owner Larry Fields operated for close to 20 years, Paz has been adding her own Latin-inspired touches and dishes, a considerable departure from the shop's modest American-diner roots.  But while the response by customers and neighbors has been positive, the changes have not been sitting well with Fields, who says that Paz was merely a temporary steward of the business while he recovered from a stroke. The changes, he said, \"confused diners.\"  That rocky relationship ends this week, with Paz heading to a new address just a mile away. There, she will open Sabor Miami, a Latin-themed eatery that expands on what she was dabbling in over at Café Miami. Diners can look forward to creamy caramel-scented cafes con leche, Mexican-style huevos rancheros with crispy tostones, flaky fried empanadas filled with chopped ham and cheese, and pressed Cubano sandwiches filled with roast pork, thin-sliced ham, Swiss cheese, pickles and mustard. Expanded hours and a fresh interior also will be part of the package.  The new location, 4848 Broadview Rd., most recently belonged to the Salvadoran-run Katarina Pupuseria. That business relocated last year to the former Mexican Village building at 1409 Brookpark Rd.  No word yet on the future of Café Miami."}

Only complaint is they did not come back to refill coffee cup, or ask if we needed anything else's after dropping off food. I would def be going back."}
{"text":"Great place!! Decided to come here for my brother's birthday and that was a great decision! I stumbled upon this place and happy that I did because the portion sizes were huge and the price was very affordable. Everything was tasty and delicious, especially the hot cakes! The staff is very nice and welcoming and the decor's unique ^^ Left happy and stuffed. Will definitely come back! Highly recommend this place :)"}
{"text":"Jennifer Lopez was a psychiatrist who could enter people's dark recesses of the mind in the terrible film \"The Cell.\" Customers at Cafe Miami can achieve the same feeling of gaining access to one's psyche upon entering the threshold of Cafe Miami. The decor is a visual assault reminiscent of psychedelic mushroom trips during college years at Kent State. The food is a mashup of traditional breakfast and Carribean. The service and food were both excellent. The Cuban sandwich was a better value than pork torta although both were satisfying. The arroz con pollo was a solid dish as well. I am sad I did not get to meet the famous Larry who was previous owner. He sounded \"cool as a polar bear in a freezer\" as Gucci Mane says."}
{"text":"Wow, super breakfast.  At 4715 State rd, 44109 is Cafe Miami.  Don't be swayed by the name, the food is really good large portions super low price.  Owner Larry cooks everything himself.  Fresh made to order.  This is a place to relax and enjoy the atmosphere its very unique.  They have free wifi so laptops welcome.  Highly recommended.  Must go early 7 to 2pm."}
{"text":"Cafe Miami very eclectic art.  Larry the owner is an artist, along with his baking and cooking talent.   The American breakfast is great, lots of good food at super low price.  Three big eaters had a breakfast bill of $19.41 unbelieveable in 2011/12.   I highly recommend this restaurant for everyone who is not in a rush, likes good food, and feels comfortable looking around the place at all the little collected art treasures.  Larry states you may even buy some just ask him.  It reminded us of places that thrive on Coventry, Larchmere, Tremont, and Ohio City.  Please give this place a try, this area needs some artistic flair.  Hours are 7am to 2pm so breakfast and lunch..and free wi-fi too bring your laptop and relax."}
{"text":"A truly funky breakfast place. The All American was 3 eggs, bacon, potatoes and toast for 2.50. Added an amazing hotcake for a dollar. It's like eating in an antique shop. All the decor is for sale. Proprietor and staff are quite friendly. As the NYT would say, it's a \"Don't miss!\""}
{"text":"This is NOT the Sabor Miami Cafe, though the pics and many/most of the good reviews were from people who went to the Sabor Miami Cafe and posted here in error.   This place only had a very simple (boring) breakfast menu and an offer from the host that their main business is to provide counseling. \"We only offer breakfast so people come in and we get a chance to talk to them about our other businesses of counseling and selling home made soaps.\"  On a positive note, the host was quite friendly.  Just be careful not to mix these two restaurants up if you're going for the first time. Very different experiences."}
{"text":"Everything you need to know about Cafe Miami is written here because I've eaten there 804 times. This place is \"Cleveland\". There is so much to say about this charming local diner. Yes, it's a diner. Don't let the \"cafe\" part mislead you. It's definitely a local place. It's full of Old Brooklyn residents. I used to live about a block away from this place and it never let me down. It's owned by the hilareous \"Larry\" who will talk about politics or religion or the latest tv drama with you, so long as you sit at the counter. That being said, sit at the counter by yourself or with a whole mess of people. You'll be entertained. The wait staff is a rotating cast of characters I can't even been to describe... except that it's comedy.   The decor is like the best finds of a lifetime from the Cleveland area's flea market/thrift store/garage-sale line. Electic sums it up pretty nice. Make sure to check out the huge map left of the counter...it's the \"World According to Ronald Reagan\" and it always makes me laugh. The old books and glass figurines are somehow fitting in this little dive as well. While the decor is vintage, the newspapers are current and you can do the crosswords in them without having to buy them.  Coffee is diner coffee. So for coffee snobs like me, just drink it. It's okay. The pancakes make it all worth it. They are the best pancakes you'll ever have. Just get 'em straight up. Anyhow, the homefries are really what this place is known for. I'm not a homefries person, so I think it means something that I always get them here. The omelettes are good too, but if you really want to get your money's worth get the All American Breakfast for $2.50. Cafe Miami is a bargain as it is, but the $2.50 All-American breakfast (eggs, sausage/bacon, homefries, toast) is a steal for all the omnivours of the world. I never had it myself since I don't eat sausage/bacon, but when I took my cousin from California here he couldn't believe the deal he was getting. He thought it was so good and the price was \"ridiculous\" that I'm pretty sure he left a 300% tip.   The hours here are short so you better get up early before work or fight the weekend hangover to make it over before the place closes shop in the early afternoon.   Come to Cafe Miami, you won't regret it. When I was unemployed, this place kept me nourished with yummy food without going broke. After I got a job again, I started leaving much bigger tips to make up for my lame ones from before. But Larry didn't mind the late cash delivery. He's a cool cat.  SIDENOTE: Larry is also a really great baker. He baked me a lovely professional-style birthday cake. It was amazing! He experiments a lot with baking... and if you're a regular he'll oftentimes bring you a slice of whatever just came out of the oven for you to try!  *The only downside here, is that the place is cash only. However, it's so cheap that you can manage to scrounge up a five or ten (or a bunch of change)."}
{"text":"this place is weird.  I couldn't even order my food I had to make an excuse and leave. It smelled like smoke, the woman who told me she was the cook looked shocked to have a customer, the inside looked like a pawn shop I didn't want to sit down in.   I'm not stuck up... I'm not a foodie I'm a fooder, I do the damn thing. So Maaaaaaaaybe the food here is good like a secret greasy spoon spot... I wouldn't know. I couldn't stay to find out."}
{"text":"This is one of the coolest breakfast diners that I've ever been to.  The interior is completely filled with cool paintings and neat \"things\".  There are books on book shelves that you can peruse while you are waiting for your food.  The quality of the food is superb!  Larry will make you what you want exactly how you want it.  This place is also very welcoming and comfortable.  If you want to expierence the coolest breakfast diner in town, give Cafe Miami a try."}
