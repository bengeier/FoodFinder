{"text":"The church is a unique place especially for its location. Normally you find this type of venue in a larger more populated area, but I'm not complaining. I love that they have a local and neighborhood type feel with a modern and innovative touch. Every time I've gone to the church I've sat at the bar- I prefer the bar if I'm with a small group. The bartenders, owners and management have all been friendly and inviting and the food has been satisfying. The food is good, nothing too over the top, but definitely warrants a recommendation to friends and family. In this area, its hard to find a trendy spot to have a drink, apps or dinner and this definitely fills in that void. I'm happy that they took the old church and made it a little hidden gem in the area. I look forward to my next visit!"}
{"text":"What a cool spot!! In a building dating back to 1865, you'll be transported by the character of the former St. Alban's Church. It's only fitting that The Church would remain a centerpiece of Caledon's community culture.  I need to try some of their other amazing dishes. The food is terrific. Seriously, go check out the menu, which changes constantly. Caledon has a gem in The Church and if you're not nearby, it's reason alone for a visit."}
{"text":"Went there with a party of six early in the evening. Had a reservation so they were expecting us. They let us order wine to start then when it came time to order the food they told us they were out of three of the mains on their already very limited menu of five or six main courses.  Will never go back!"}
{"text":"My friends and I happened upon this place while in Caledon for a wedding weekend. It was amazing! The staff are very friendly, the food was incredible and the decor is unique and very un-church-like, haha. It's definitely a gem in the area."}
