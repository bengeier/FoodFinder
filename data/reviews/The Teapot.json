{"text":"I've lived in the area for a year, and had never been in. Whitney was so friendly and helpful, i will definitely be back so soon. The scones were easily the best i've ever had - and the atmosphere was so chill."}
{"text":"We rented the entire back garden for my daughter's 1st birthday party and it was awesome! We loved having the big open space for the kids to run and play and the big climbing area/slide was a hit! The staff was so accommodating and helpful. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Beautiful space for an event!! I held my baby shower here and couldn't have asked for a better venue. Both the adults and children had a wonderful time and all raved about how perfect The Teapot was for the party. I look forward to returning with my baby girl!"}
{"text":"This is SUCH a cute place! We hosted a baby shower there and they were so welcoming and accommodating. It is the perfect place for breakfast, brunch, a shower or really any kind of party. The food was SOOO good! I can't wait to go back one weekend and try more of their food!"}
{"text":"Such a great space! Family friendly and great owners! They bake and serve traditional English delights... such a charming business and owner!"}
{"text":"The owners, Jonathan & Raelynn, are the sweetest and make you feel welcome the moment you walk through the door. We had the pleasure of attending their Camp Teapot this past weekend and our son absolutely loved it. The Teapot truly is a family friendly establishment - from their sweet nooks filled with toys and books to the play area outdoors. {Oh, and their iced coffee and scones are to DIE for}. We know that this will be our go to coffee spot on the weekends!"}
{"text":"It's like going to a kids birthday party where no one  has to pick up after. 
They have a nice grassy area where moms and kids hangout, picnic tables on the side, and benches all around. Assorted toys all over and a play house where kids can go down a slide and a climber. 

The food is ok: small portions for the price and 3 star taste. 
They have a $2 fee per kid that's automatically added to your bill. 

We had a good time, I think the best part of that kids get to make friends as moms drink & eat! 

Btw they have mimosas!"}
{"text":"This place was perfect! We had a craving for tea and my husband and I like exploring new, non Starbucks, coffee/tea places. Try it, you may find a gem like The Teapot! This place was ADORABLE inside and out. They have brunch, mimosas, coffee and tea. I had a black iced tea the gentleman recommended, it was refreshing and delicous. Also, quite smooth for black tea, I usually find them lacking on their own. My husband had a hot chai. It was so soft and flavorful. Aaaaannnddd the big winner here  (drumroll needed, that's how good they are) the SCONES. If you can even call them that, because they are so good they should have their own pastry category. We had a pineapple caramel scone. It comes with some sweet sort of butter stuff for spread.  The texture was soft and fluffy, almost biscuit like but not quite. I've always had hard scones that are just blah and you have to dip them in coffee for them to be any good. Just try a scone, you won't regret it! Overall, this place is cozy, family friendly, and delicous!"}
{"text":"Adorable spot for coffee with a friend! Outdoor play area is a mom's dream. Enjoyed scones with fresh cream & meeting other moms. Fresh fruit was avail. & the kids devoured it. They did not have skim milk for coffee, but otherwise really enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"I love this place! I went there a few months back with some mom friends for coffee. I then decided to hold my son's first birthday party there. It was fabulous! Jonathan was incredibly helpful and super accommodating. We had about 45 people, including kids, and they all complimented us on having our party at \"the perfect venue\". This place is super cute and everyone working there is so nice. We'll definitely be back and might even throw more parties there!"}
{"text":"We just hosted our daughter's second birthday at The Teapot. From beginning to end the experience was wonderful. Jonathan was great at answering all my questions. The day of the event there was a few other birthday parties and an egg hunt going on but  we still felt like we received great service. I would highly recommend booking any event at the Teapot. It is a beautiful venue with wonderful service."}
{"text":"I always test a coffee shop by its espresso. I had a double espresso my first time, and it was delicious! Plenty of space for kiddos to run around, including babies. The down side is that they charge $2 as a play fee for the kids to play with the playground and toys. Might be worth it if you plan to stay a while, but not sure its worth it on a regular basis if you have a one year old who can only play with select toys anyway. Will be back, but not on a daily basis."}
{"text":"We recently held a baby shower at the Teapot and I have nothing but amazing things to say about this venue! Jonathan and I emailed back and forth prior to the party to which he did a great job responding quickly. Then when we arrived at the venue the day of the party I was impressed with the charm and coziness of the venue. Everything was so chic and was perfect for our event. Jonathan was very helpful setting everything up and getting the venue situated to perfectly fit our number of guests and the games we would be playing during the shower. The décor was perfect and everyone commented how cute this venue is and how impressed they were! If you are looking to have an event with 5-25 people ( for their indoor space) then this is definitely the place to go!! Helpful service, chic décor, and perfect for an event!!"}
{"text":"Jon and Rae have built such a beautiful and cozy place for moms like me to go out and find respite from our daily grind! I also love the story telling every Thursdays and the simplicity of having community! Cheers!"}
{"text":"Nothing not to love on day one! Beautiful spot, tasty treats and very friendly and funny staff!"}
{"text":"I hosted a good friends baby shower at The Teapot and everything turned out perfect! I live in Denver and coordinated everything with the owner via email. We rented three tables in the garden area and had quiche, fruit kebabs, and veggies/hummus catered. It was an adorable venue for a baby shower. I was worried with not reserving the whole space for our event that other people and kids would be a distraction but that didn't end up being a problem at all. Our group was positioned under the trellises and although it was a busy day at The Teapot we were able to converse fine and enjoy our party. Jonathan provided us with an additional table for a diaper activity we had as well as a lovely comfy chair for the mom to be. The reason I didn't give 5 stars is because the food was just average.  Even given my slight disappointment in the food I would highly recommend anyone to host a shower or children's birthday party here because it's an adorable and unique venue. My husband and I wish there was a similar place in Denver where we could take our toddler to hang out and play while we enjoy coffee and relaxing."}
{"text":"A nice option to get out of the house with your little one (0-5yrs). Haven't had their coffee yet but did try their house made peach tea and it was very refreshing. As others have mentioned, you have to pay $2 bucks per kiddo to play with the toys. The outdoor area has a nice atmosphere but is not the best place for our lovely hot summers. All in all, it is a great option to be available in the Valley of the Sun."}
{"text":"Really cute and friendly cafe in an old house in a historic area of Phoenix. Nice, simple food - perfect for a tea party!  They also are kid-friendly and can be rented out for events - this is a great setting for that."}
{"text":"Just as darling as the photos look. 

I popped in with my boo early in the morning and snagged a peach tea and a scone. The tea was refreshing without any artificial peach flavoring, and the scone was tasty with homemade whipped cream. 

The play area outdoors is adorable, and the kids at play were making fast friends, sliding down arguably the cutest slide ever. Parents can keep a fast eye on the kids from the picnic tables that line the area, underneath string lights and surrounded by succulents. 

I don't have kids, and admittedly felt like a bit of a weirdo hanging outside, so I'll probably stick to the indoors!"}
{"text":"What a wonderful place! We had fresh, delicious food (fruit and a sandwich), great drinks, and the service is very friendly. Indoors and the front porch are great for adults or the quieter set. The backyard has a fabulous play structure and is the perfect place for kids to play. I wish the Teapot had existed when my son was little. Even so, at 12, he enjoyed it and wants go back."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely wonderful. Great coffee and scones, very friendly for the kids. Extremely clean. I actually LIKE that they charge $2 to use the backyard. It's well kept, clean and it keeps it from ending up over crowded. This won't be our last visit!"}
{"text":"Amazing little place to escape your busy day! The pastries and drinks are delicious but what is really great about the Teapot is the relaxing and friendly atmosphere. I've been there twice now, most recently with my mother and son this morning. My one year old was able to crawl around the beautifully maintained back yard while we had a lovely picnic on the grass. The owner came out periodically to ask everyone there if they needed anything. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here I have such a great time - the coffee and food is fresh , delicious and the little play ground / back yard is perfect for the little ones  to play in while you'd sit and read or catch up with a friend/other Moms with small kids ...you can sit in one of the picnic benches or bring a blanket for the grass :)"}
{"text":"The Teapot was the perfect place to host my daughter's first birthday! We had kids of all ages come and they all had a blast. The outdoor playground was perfect for them and although it was a bit crowded at certain hours we still felt like we had our own space with the rented tables. 

They were so easy to communicate with and book all of the party details.  We ordered kids picnic lunch boxes which were delicious and had my kids' favorite snacks in them (fruit/cheese/goldfish). Everyone else ordered food and drinks from the cafe, all delicious.  

We had such a great time! I wouldn't have changed a thing. Thank you to The Teapot!"}
{"text":"I just threw a baby shower at The Teapot and could not be more happy with the owner, staff, and venue. We reserved two tables in the backyard and had the picnic lunches, & lemonade catered and it was a huge hit! The guests all complimented the venue & food! Jonathan & his staff were amazing and very helpful.. To say they were extremely accommodating would be an understatement. I have been to The Teapot both as a regular customer & now as a party host and I would recommend them to anyone! Five stars!!"}
{"text":"We rented out the back garden of the teapot for my sons first birthday party. It was absolutely darling and everyone loved it! We ordered coffees and honey-bear sandwiches and everything was tasty! Johnathan and the entire staff was kind and accommodating. I would recommend the teapot to anyone looking for a party venue or just a fun spot to bring your kiddos for a play date!"}
{"text":"We just had our wedding at The Teapot and we couldn't have asked for anything better. Such a fun, unique venue. The owners are amazing and everything turned out perfect! The only downside is that you cannot start setting up until the close for business that day and you must clean everything up that night. Aside from that, it was AMAZING! Thank you so much for having us!!"}
{"text":"We had a first birthday party at The Teapot and overall it was a success. The outdoor area is adorable and a great background for pictures. The playhouse was great entertainment for the kids. They were very accommodating for things like our little photo booth area and provided us with a smaller table to set that stuff on. The food that we ordered from the catering menu came out quite late. We had one salad come out and then an hour or so later the rest of it came out. I think they were a bit understaffed for hosting 2 birthday parties as well as being open for regular coffee shop business. When the food did come out, it was very good and the two young ladies working there were very friendly and polite about it. My only other constructive feedback would be that for the price of reserving a table, they should be willing to provided some water and not try to charge $25 for fruit infused water. We ended up just bringing a case of water bottles but I thought it was a little unreasonable to say no to providing plain water when that's something any restaurant you go to would do. Anyway, overall we are very happy with it and would certainly come get coffee and eat there again."}
{"text":"The Teapot is a wonderful atmosphere for all ages. Recently our family hosted a small birthday party for our 9yo daughter. The planning was very last minute, inquiring if The Teapot had available space to host our daughters birthday 7 days prior to the actual event date. With little downtime and a speedy response, Jonathan replied and immediately started coordinating space and planning. 

Upon arrival the day of our event at The Teapot, Jonathan and the staff that day were very helpful in checking if I had everything I needed, offering to help set-up the event decor, etc. The overall customer service was beyond my expectations, especially given the latency of the event planning on our part. Our guests (little humans + adults) were impressed with The Teapot location, in addition to the pastries too! Some of our guests purchase their own pastries to bring home! 

I would recommend The Teapot to anyone looking for a clean, unique, and customer centric venue. We will certainly keep The Teapot in mind for any future events our family hosts."}
{"text":"If you ever need somewhere to host a fun event this is the place to have it! We had a high school sports banquet here. With over 70 guests there was room for everyone to sit and mingle throughout the whole space, it never felt to crowded. There was plenty of space to set up our catered food. The owner was there the whole night to help serve drinks as well as making sure everything was running smoothly. I can't think of anything negative to say about this venue."}
{"text":"The Teapot is amazing!!! We recently booked the Teapot for our wedding and it was absolutely beautiful!!! Better than I could have ever imagined!!! We had the ceremony on the front porch and the reception in the backyard. Everyone had a great time, not one complaint!!! Jonathan was wonderful and answered all our questions. Definitely will be booking future events at The Teapot."}
{"text":"Cutest coffee and tea spot. Family friendly, with a play structure in the backyard. Great indoor and outdoor activities for children. Staff is wonderful and friendly. Now to the coffee... I got an iced vanilla americano which was quite strong , but delicious. Would be great to hang out with kids in the back yard."}
{"text":"I love this place. I live in the West Valley and try to make the drive once a week. It's very family friendly and my favorite mom hang out. Their coffee is really good and it nice to sit outside and watch your kids play and chat with friends. There is a large two story playhouse with a slide and a play kitchen and lots of assorted toys and they also have a little activity table with wooden train tracks. Inside they have a little reading nook with a bucket full of toys also. The staff is has always been friendly and courteous. There is a $2 charge for your kids to play which I find more than reasonable with as much as my daughter and my friends kids are entertained and how many things there are for them to play with. There really isn't anything else like it in the whole valley."}
{"text":"Cute idea. Go to place to let kids play while you have a latte/tea. Problem is that they charge you $2 per child for kids to play. There are no rides or swings. It's a tree house and slide on turf. But there are shaded tables with music to watch the kiddos play. They have simple snack foods too, but they are kinda pricey. Spotty Wi-Fi available. One restroom. Changing table available if needed. *One way street for parking."}
{"text":"If there is one demographic missing from Downtown Phoenix's big resurgence, its the kiddos.  Downtown is chalked full of 20 and 30 somethings wanting to be where the action is, and increasingly retiring baby boomers who are looking to downsize into an area of town that's more walkable than the burbs.  But the ones missing are in the middle.  The families.  Parents with kids, especially young kids.  One young family in the neighborhood is trying to work to change that.  And they're piggybacking on Downtown's robust coffee scene to do it.  Welcome to the Teapot, the most family friendly coffee shop and cafe in Downtown Phoenix.

My younger brother and his son were in the neighborhood and wanted to meet up for lunch somewhere on a Sunday midday.  I'd heard about the Teapot through a number of local publications, but didn't know much about it other than the family friendly angle, so I gambled on taking them here.  The business is actually a house with a full front and backyard on 5th Avenue about half a block south of Roosevelt Street.  The owners Jon and Raelynn Pring are themselves parents of a young son and opened this place in part because they weren't able to find enough family friendly spaces to take their son in Downtown.  The house and the grounds are absolutely gorgeous and extremely well maintained.  The front lawn is very simple with shaded seating on the porch and additional seating on the lawn.  The backyard is an artificial turf lawn with shaded seating around the perimeter.  The kiddos can entertain themselves in the backyard with a two story playhouse, various loose toys, and I think I saw building blocks in the corner.  There's even a wash station for the kids on the back patio.  The interior is probably a Pinterest board's dream come true with a mixture of restaurant style seating, love seats, as well as kid friendly books and toys in the corners.

Order your food and drinks right up front as you walk in the front door and they bring it out to you.  Coffee and tea are always available but just be aware that the food menu here does change and isn't posted on their website.  Today they had a lunch panini with chips on the menu so I grabbed one of those.  They were also very proud of their scones so I decided to grab one of the apricot ones.  Total cost including tax came to about $13.  My brother and I planted ourselves outside while my nephew went nuts with all the loose toys in the backyard.  The backyard is pretty spacious and can probably accommodate upwards of 50 people or more just on the perimeter alone.  And FYI, the Teapot does rent out their place for private evening events including birthdays, baby showers, and other family get togethers.

The panini I got had prosciutto, spinach and cheese and a side of veggie chips.  The panini was quite delicious.  Maybe could've used slightly more of that tasty prosciutto, but all in all a good treat.  And the scone was fantastic.  Warm, flaky, buttery.  Much softer than most scones I've had before and almost had the texture of a buttermilk biscuit.  We spent about an hour here which proved to be the perfect amount of time for my nephew to play with the other little tykes and wear himself out just enough for his afternoon nap (bro gave me a high five for that).

Credit to the Pring family for taking a gamble on a business model that is betting on a Downtown Phoenix where the future is filled with families and their children living nearby and hanging out at establishments like this one.  It remains to be seen whether that demographic truly is the wave of the future down here.  But the early success of Teapot will no doubt entice other entrepreneurs to look at gearing their own businesses towards a more kid friendly crowd.  And the food menu, while limited, also offers a range of items sure to please the adult and kid in all of us.  Bring the family, bring the kids, relax and enjoy.  Like me, you'll probably leave wishing you owned this gorgeous home."}
{"text":"First visit this morning. Raelyn made me feel right at home (BEAUTIFUL smile). Located across the street from my Loft. My coffee, quiche and flapjack were FRESHLY made, TASTY and just what the dr. ordered.

The final kicker for me you ask ? The Tea Pot plays soft, classical music both indoors and on their porch...PERFECT !!

Check it out...FIRST CLASS in every respect."}
{"text":"This place is darling. We went to their camp teapot event, and it was adorable. The staff was so friendly and patient with all of the kids running around. We will definitely be back. The event was $10 per kid, but with the effort they put in to make it special, it was definitely worth it. The play area is really nice, and my son was obsessed with the play house. On a normal day there is a $2 fee per kid. In my opinion, $2 is a small price to pay for a nicely kept and safe space for my son to play, while I can sit in the shade and enjoy an iced latte."}
{"text":"The Tea Pot is a hidden gem located in the heart of Downtown Phoenix! It's in a old historic home that has a cozy & cottage type feel. Very light & airy with lots of natural lighting & plants throughout! If you're a MAMA or parent in general you totally need to check this place out!!! They have indoor seating if you're looking for a more quiet setting, or a backyard space where they have a playground + lots of toys for the kiddos to play with! There is a $2 play fee for ages 1-8, but soooo worth it!!! The coffee + baked goods were super good! I got a mocha + regular scone that came with whipped cream & strawberry jam! Carmen my barista was super warm + welcoming! We did a mommy & me play date and the kiddos had a blast while the moms got to relax + enjoy our breakfast & coffee! I run a local group on Facebook called Arizona Mommies with over 17,000 of us and I'll definitely make sure every mama knows about this place! I'd love to set up an event in the future too!!! #supportlocal"}
{"text":"Such a cute little spot in downtown Phoenix for families to enjoy some time together!  We stopped in this weekend and I enjoyed an alpine berry tea on the front porch.  The place was quite busy with young families eating and drinking and watching their kids have a great time both inside and out."}
{"text":"Love this place! So cute and great staff! Super family friendly and they also serve beer and wine. Had my sons bday here and got nothing but compliments from all my guests. Only thing is, their catering menu is waaaay too pricey. $25 for lemonade and $30 for a hummus and veggie plate??!! I'll definitely be back, but won't be ordering catering :("}
{"text":"This is a cool place for adults and kids alike in phoenix.  The backyards is full of fun for kids.  From a giant 2 story play house to bikes, dolls, and cars the Teapot has something for every kid.  The backyard is locked and fenced which gives parents a sense of ease of letting their kids run around safely.  Picnic tables for parents make a great spot to hang with friends.  During our visit the back was close an hour through our visit.  We moved to the from and had just as fun running around that fenced area.  The iced coffee was great and the panini (prosciutto, havarti and spinach) was unique and delicious."}
{"text":"We just hosted a baby shower at The Teapot this last weekend and had such an amazing time doing it! The venue itself was perfect and my guests could not get over what a gorgeous little place it was! The owner Jonathan was extremely accommodating, and let us arrive a little bit early to set up decorations and food. We opted to cater most of our own food, but did elect to have them provide scones, iced tea, and lemonade which were all displayed beautifully. 

The contained backyard and treehouse were a favorite of my nieces, who spent their time zooming around the yard in complete safety and freedom. This is the perfect spot for an event if your group has a lot of younger kids to entertain."}
{"text":"The Teapot is such a cute spot! We visited while in town and wish we could come all the time! Owners and staff were so friendly, coffee was delicious, and we loved how kid friendly it was! All they need is some apparel so we can spread the love and let others know about it!"}
{"text":"We celebrated my son's 1st birthday here this past weekend and it was the perfect venue!  I was able to decorate the area and bring in my own cake while the venue provided a nice menu for us to pre-order items for my guests.  All of my party guests raved about the spinach and red onion quiche being so delicious!  Aside from the party, I absolutely love their iced vanilla lattes ^_^"}
{"text":"The Teapot was the perfect venue for our daughter's baby shower!  It was very clean and cozy!  Jonathan took excellent care of our guests!  We will not hesitate to recommend The Teapot to family and friends."}
{"text":"We chose this venue for our sons first birthday party. Despite it being a very busy Saturday, Johnathan and the staff were very attentive to our needs. I would gladly have another party there and we will be frequenting the spot regularly."}
{"text":"We checked out The Teapot today  it has only been open for three weeks, and it is just adorable! A family friendly place that serves coffee and tea with a quaint backyard that has a play area for the littles to play while us mommas get our coffee fix! Such a great idea. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This place is brilliant!! Today was our first visit to The Teapot. It is located in one of my favorite areas of downtown Phoenix. It is the perfect place to hang out with your little people. The adorable red house has lots of room for playing with a couple of spots with toys and books and a huge paper covered table to draw on. The decor is just lovely and it was so clean I had no problem putting my little crawler down to explore. We stayed in but out back they have misters, lots of picnic tables and plenty of fun things to do including get wet. I thought the play ticket was a great idea and was happy to pay it. As for the food... I had quiche with salad and we shared a blueberry scone. It was all pretty good although the salad was all kale which I personally don't care for. I had also really hoped for a local/organic centered menu. They had options for kids but a lot of them are things I don't feed my baby. She was perfectly happy with some fresh fruit though. We absolutely loved this place my only suggestion would be to consider tweaking the menu a little and perhaps putting a little of thought into the presentation of the food. We frequent downtown restaurants and this is the first time I have ever been so pleased that I left a review. So thank you!!!"}
{"text":"While I understand needing to maintain your property, paying a \"play tax\" of 2 dollars per kid seems a little silly. Pick up coffee and go to a park and you only have to pay for coffee."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this new coffee shop in downtown Phoenix! They have only been open a few days and already have it down. I had both their iced tea and an iced latte. Both were delicious. They have a good variety of drinks and snacks. What puts this place over the top is that it is somewhere for everybody! It is not only relaxing and perfect for adults, but it is family friendly! This is so unique and impossible to find, especially downtown. They have a kids corner inside and in the back they have an entire playground with toys and a beautiful grassy area with a big tree that provides lots of shade! This is a place that my husband, son, and I can all enjoy together. It is also somewhere I would go on my own or meet someone at for a business meeting. I cannot wait to go back. The staff (may have been the owners, not sure) were so friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"We recently celebrated our son's 1st Birthday here. Really enjoyed using the space and the atmosphere. The staff were incredibly helpful and everyone had a great time!"}
{"text":"I love the Tea Pot!!!  I take my little guy there a few times a week.  It's a great place to grab a small bite to eat and a cup of coffee with a friend.  My little one won't sit still at a regular coffee shop or restaurant so it's just amazing to have someplace where I can relax and he can run around.  It's always clean and friendly.  I'm also really excited that they'll be open Thursday and Friday evenings."}
{"text":"Such a creative concept! Love bringing the kiddos to play in the backyard. Everything is so cute and we always have a great time at the Teapot. I do wish there were more options food wise but it's worth it to come for a delicious cup of coffee. The mimosas are also very tasty!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little spot. We went there after reading the reviews about being kid friendly and our 16 month old son had a blast! There's a $2 fee to play in the backyard area, but well worth it. The only downside, it being end of May right now, the artificial turf they have in the back is sweltering hot to the touch. Other than that, no complaints and we will definitely be going back in the fall when the temps cool down."}
{"text":"We had my sister's baby shower here and it was the perfect location! Jonathan, the owner, was great to work with. Very friendly and responsive prior to the shower. On the day of the shower, he was very accommodating and really helped us make it a successful party. We rented the community room, but it would've been a bit too small to accommodate all our guests. Jonathan let us use part of the outdoor space to give us some extra room. Speaking of the outdoor space, it is such a cute garden! There are lots of covered tables, big trees that give more shade, a kids play house, kids toys and lots of spots to hang out. The catered food was great (the scones were delicious) and the coffee bar a nice bonus! I would recommend The Teapot to anyone thinking of renting a space for a party, or to just grab a coffee and hang out."}
{"text":"Loved this place!  Adorable inside and out.  Great area for kids to play outdoors.  Big enough for them to have fun yet small enough that you can easily keep an eye on them.  My granddaughter and I shared the waffle board.  Delicious!  Would definitely come back again!"}
{"text":"Unique and fun experience for kids to hang and parents to hang out. They offer snacks and coffee, super sweet customer service."}
{"text":"Today was my daughter's 3rd Birthday. Only one friend was available to celebrate with us so we elected not to do a party but went to the Teapot for a play date instead. We ordered mimosas by the bottle and the girls had such a good time running around! We bought two bottles of champagne and Johnathan kept such a great eye on the ice and making sure we always had enough orange juice and everything. Such a great host and such a fun venue!!"}
{"text":"Visited the The Teapot for the first time today with my son and grandson.  The owners have done a wonderful job of designing both the interior and exterior of this charming home.  They also have parking on the south side of the home. The playhouse was awesome for the little ones!  A very relaxing atmosphere for adults to have coffee/tea and watch their children/grandchildren play in the playhouse and the sand.  Lots of comfy seating inside and out.  Loved the mats they had on the grass for those who wanted to sit on the lawn.  Only wish that they had a little more extensive menu with sandwiches and salads.  Other than beverages the menu consists of only quiche, scones (which were yummy!), crumpets, and a delicious looking chocolate cake!  I might add that this would also be a wonderful place for children's parties!  One of the owners said they are considering it and also parent date nights where parents can order wine or beer while watching their children play.  Not sure how they will manage once summer is upon us though.  Overall, I found The Teapot delightful and would highly recommend it for both parents and grandparents to get to spend some relaxing time with their little ones!

{"text":"If you have small kiddos this place is a must go. We went on a Saturday and there were about 10 kids playing in the back having a great time. The drinks were good and the playground was super secure (only way in and out was through cafe) with tons of shade. 

We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Love bringing the kids here! Amazing coffee and treats:) The young guy who works up front is especially friendly and great with the kiddos. Could not ask for a better spot"}
{"text":"I've been about 6-7 times with my 3 kiddos. The play area in the back is adorable, modern and well kept. The toys are super nice! Their chai tea is the best! The owner is the nicest most friendliest guy ever, walks around and talks and jokes with the customers. It's 2 bucks per kid to play but I think that's fair. It's a really great place for families..pretty much a dream come true for moms and dads."}
{"text":"Spent a perfect Sunday morning with the kids.  It was quiet until about 9, then the people started rolling in. Ideal play space for 2-5 years, but my 7 year old stayed busy too... Everyone was ordering these fancy little belgian waffle trios that looked divine. Apparently I missed the memo, and instead had a pretty good frittata.

Opposite of other reviewers, I love that they charge the \"play\" fee. I would rather us parents pay for the upkeep and cleaning of the kiddie wonderland, than have the cost passed along to other people just looking to grab a cup of joe..."}
{"text":"Our family hosted a baby shower there and Jonathan was very accommodating and helpful. The space was a perfect setting for family and friends to gather! There is a beautiful space out back for children to play."}
{"text":"My first Yelp review... had to do it, I love this place so much! I threw a co-ed book-themed baby shower for my friend at The Teapot last weekend, and it was fantastic! The Teapot was the most darling, perfect venue for a small event (approx. 40 guests with room for more) with a great flow of inside and outside space. Location was very central as guests were coming from all areas of the Valley, with ample parking on the street. Owners Jon and Raelynn were lovely to work with, very accommodating and wonderfully welcoming to our guests. The yard and house were clean and ready for me to set up my décor upon arrival in the morning. We ordered quiche, scones with cream and jam, lemonade and iced tea to complement our book-themed menu, and everything was so tasty! Everyone kept raving about how cute the space was... the interior décor is perfection. We had the best time and the mom-to-be was happy, so I would 100% recommend The Teapot."}
{"text":"This place is great with families with young kids. The parents can relax while the kids are having a good time playing in the back yard. Adorable place!"}
{"text":"I just had my babyshower at the Teapot this past weekend and it was absolutely AMAZING!! Jonathan was an absolute pleasure to work with and a HUGE help the day of the shower setting up and moving tables and chairs and other items around for us. We did a mimosa bar & infused water jug thru the Teapot and the presentation was very nice. I'd definitely recommend this venue for birthdays, baby showers, bridal showers! It's such a fun venue and all the guests enjoyed every aspect of it! Thank you Teapot for making my baby shower one I will never forget!"}
{"text":"Such an amazing place. Let me start by saying everyone is SO friendly! I went on Saturday with my 1 year old and he loved the playground so much. There is plenty of seating for parents to sit out and relax while their little ones play. I went back today solo to grab a coffee and again I was not disappointed. I see this place becoming a weekly ritual for my family. I can't say enough great things!"}
{"text":"As those of you with kids know, how you choose a place to go revolves around what your kids can do there. This place has a sign in the front that says \"eat + play + relax\" and that is exactly what you can do here. The back has a play house with a slide, rock climbing wall and a kitchen that is very kid friendly. Staff is very nice and caters to the kid thing; when I ordered our coffee, they told me to go on back and they would bring us our drinks. Awesome!  I went to the back, ate, played and relaxed."}
{"text":"The dirty chai wasn't great and they don't even have a cold brew. Super sweet barista but terrible practices. Not dog friendly and they charge your kids to play in the play area... $2 for your kid to go down a slide maybe twice! Pretentious and ridiculous. If you're a single mother looking to catch up with an old co-worker from the mall, this place is perfect for you, anyone else just go to Lola."}
{"text":"It may be marketed for families with small kids, but I (a 22 yr old without kids) think this is a great spot. Great decor, not usually busy, perfect outdoor and indoor reading spots, and delicious coffee"}
{"text":"This place is a gem! Had to find a location for a fundraising event and after looking  around we stumbled upon The Teapot. It's hard to find a venue that is both beautiful and kid friendly - but this place finds the balance. They've got a great outdoor space/patio that made our party feel warm and inviting. They have tons of tables and seating options to accommodate our large list of invites and the existing lighting was perfect - which meant way less work on our part having to bring our own stuff in to create the space. 

The owners Jon and Rae were very responsive and accommodating. They helped us walk through some tricky logistics before hand and made the guests feel very welcome. Looking forward to hosting another party at this charming house!"}
{"text":"We had our baby shower at the teapot. We wanted a central location so family and friends wouldn't have to drive too far north or south. The baby shower was a success! The owner, Jonathan, and the other girls at the shop were very helpful and understanding. Everyone had a great time and told me later how cute they thought the venue was. Much recommended if you don't want to throw a baby shower at your house and want something central and quaint."}
{"text":"This place is super cool and great for kids.  The only reason I give it 3 stars is because we found little pieces of plastic in the hummus we ordered and the staff didn't particularly seem to care.  If you don't plan to eat and just want to play ($2.00 play tax per kid) than this place is awesome."}
{"text":"This is a great place that is very family friendly. Indoors there is a Children's corner with books and some quiet toys and puzzles, there are several tables inside, one large community table in the backroom, and some cushioned accent seats. Outdoor seating there are several (5-6) picnic tables in the backyard, a couple of cafe tables out front, different types of seating throughout the area. The outdoor area for the children, is the backyard, there is artificial grass, umbrellas for shade, a large play structure, and different types of bikes and toys for children to play with. The play area is purposed for toddler to kindergarten aged children, but all ages can have fun here. (Older children 10 years and older might not have as much fun though, this is personal opinion as i don't have a child this age to say). Most of the children playing and that are here are younger too. There are two high chairs here, first come first serve style (just fyi). They also have a changing table inside the bathroom. 

We had our daughters 1st birthday party here, actually a few hours ago, and I HAD to yelp them. Jonathan, was so hospitable to us, he really catered to all our needs while we were there. He would come out frequently to make sure everything was going well and was willing to make us as comfortable as possible. We had some sandwiches, scones, fruit skewers, and lemonade ordered (ahead of time) from them. Everything was good our family really liked the salmon and cucumber sandwiches.  Know that it is tea serving sizes and made in house so don't expect a costco platter. I enjoyed all the food that was brought out, all made in house. I loved the lemonade it wasn't overly sweetened, perfect refreshment on a warm day. The scones were massive, they were served with a spread and some chopped strawberries (also recommend this). 

Our whole experience from booking, (ahead of time), to picking our spread, to arriving and set up was a breeze. Loved the accommodations, and the play area where you can let the children play. Great family feel.

I've been here a few times for coffee prior, I would say I am more a fan of their espresso based drinks. I typically will just drink a black iced coffee on a normal basis. It wasn't my favorite here, BUT i do like their Dirty Chai (Chai latte with a shot of espresso). I would say their forte is definitely on the espresso and latte side of things. (These are the only two drinks i've had from here, so I am sure they have other good drinks). I came here for lunch one time, their panini and quiche are good. The quiche tends to be a popular seller, we were lucky to get some when we went. Good small portions, for those not of large appetites or those with portion control issues. I love to eat A LOT, but i really shouldn't the sandwich size was perfect for what i SHOULD eat. 

We will be life long customers of the teapot for sure."}
{"text":"Super cute play date place! I think they must be making a killing on scones alone! Very charming. 

Reduced a star for funky smell (old milk?) and some broken play toys such as the miniature shopping cart. Scone was delicious, but it needed lemon curd."}
{"text":"We found this place as we were looking for something to do with out twin boys on Easter Sunday and everything seemed to be booked out. This place is a house which has been converted to a coffee shop. 
They have indoor and outdoor seating. The back outdoor has a lot of options for kids to play. They have several different types of toys for kids as well. 

Food options are limited and basic. But it was fresh and cooked when ordered. 

This is a great place if you wanna take the family out for a cup of coffee. Our boys had a great time playing and were well entertained. 

Great idea and would definitely recommend it for families with small kids."}
{"text":"I knew I wanted The Teapot to be the venue for our son's first birthday the minute I step foot into the place! I attended a Flower Crown class at The Teapot in October and contacted them right after to save the date for my son's party (which would be in the April!).

Jonathan was really easy to work with.  He e-mailed promptly and gave me all the information I needed and answered a ton of questions for me along the way.  He was even willing to work some things out with me when we were expecting more guests than we originally talked about.

The party was a hit everyone complimented us about the venue choice.  It was easy for parents to relax and enjoy their time knowing that their kiddos were in a safe and fun place.  

Raelynn was on staff on the night of our event and she was so sweet and accommodating for anything I needed.  She even helped my best friend fix one of the decoration pieces I had worked on at home that had been kind of disassembled during the drive.  Thanks so much, Raelynn!

Even if you don't book it for a venue, it's definitely worth the visit with little ones!!"}
{"text":"I love this place! The Teapot is located only a couple of blocks away from where I live. I went many times the first couple of weeks after they opened, but I haven't been able to frequent it as much as I'd like lately. I work early mornings to early evenings, so I don't have a chance to visit during the week. They are typically open until 2 pm during weekdays. Jonathan (owner) said that they were thinking of doing some later hours later down the road. 

The place is absolutely beautiful! It is very kid-friendly with a kid's corner inside and playground in the backyard to keep the kids occupied. If you are a parent and love coffee and coffee shops, this is the place for you and your child(ren). They also hold events from time to time like date nights, yoga, and build-your-own cactus (for the kiddos).

Jonathan and his wife are super friendly and love to have conversations with their customers and do a great job of remembering regulars! Definitely check this place out if you are ever in the area!"}
{"text":"Such a cute coffee shop in an old house downtown. Had a beautiful sitting area not only inside, but outside as well which includes a play area for kids. My daughter and I tried quite a few drinks, but the best part of our visit were the waffles. Great service and cute relaxing atmosphere . We will definitely be back a lot."}
{"text":"I have been here quite a few times and absolutely love it!  We love it so much, we hosted our daughter's first birthday party here this past weekend.  It was wonderful!  From the food, space, and staff-it was perfect!  I highly recommend this place!  Thank you so very much, The Teapot!"}
{"text":"Happiness - 2/5
Deliciousness - 1/5

First off, this is definitely a place marketed to kids. It's a coffee house with very limited food options. The \"hook\" is that there is a small playground in back for the rugrats to run around. But they charge for it (there are free games and an infant's corner in the shop). It's not much, but there are FAR better indoor playgrounds that don't charge. 

I tried to order a beer... but they were out. I tried to order some food. Again, out. I settled for some overpriced wine. 

Overall, the place is small, it's not very exciting, and I just think there are so many better options for this kind of thing. I'd recommend passing on this one fore sure."}
{"text":"We reserved the Teapot for our wedding. Our goal was for a great atmosphere for an intimate ceremony. Mission accomplished. Johnathan and his wife(owners) were very helpful, made sure we had everything we needed, and were super friendly. I cannot say enough how enjoyable and perfect the experience was. Johnathan and his wife were both on hand during the event to ensure everything went smooth. It could not have gone better! Thank you both so much for everything!"}
{"text":"The idea of charging for kids to play in the playground is pretty odd. Regardless, this place offers coffee lovers with great coffee and a kid friendly environment. Other than the fee for kids to play, this place was an amazing find. We go at least once a month."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that I really love the teapot. The lattes are delicious, the staff is friendly, and the backyard is beautiful. It's a great place to bring my little ones to meet up with friends. We live in Surprise, so it's a bit far, but we tend to come in 2x a month.
Today, however, I noticed that some of the toys are showing extreme wear and are still left out in the yard. It's concerning because broken plastic can be unsafe for the kids. I understand toys can be expensive, but the teapot charges a $2/child fee which is supposed to go towards upkeep of the children's area and toys. At the very least, the broken toys should be REMOVED. I hope on our next visit there have been some changes or it may be our last."}
{"text":"The Teapot is a hidden gem I found online to host my baby shower this past Saturday and I am so glad I chose this place over my other options! I live in California, but the majority of my family members reside in Arizona so we decided to host my baby shower in Phoenix. 

First, I was a little worried having to plan a shower from another state, but Jonathan was very responsive and helpful with all of the questions I had regarding the space and he made the process as seamless as possible. Although I had not ever been to The Teapot myself, Jonathan was very helpful and accommodating from the time we arrived to the space. He was extremely helpful with the setup of the event from the food to the decorations, a real lifesaver. He even helped with the takedown and clean up. He allowed us to cater our own food, which I thought was fantastic since a lot of event spaces won't allow outside food or will charge you more if you don't use their services. He checked on all of the guests and made sure we were all comfortable and ok the entire event. We had access to the front of the house, the inside and backyard and it was a bit warm so he set up the inside so that we could spend most of our time indoors, which I thought was really nice. 

All of my guests loved the space and some are even planning to have their events in the future there. We plan to have a party to celebrate the birth of the baby and we will definitely be having it at The Teapot. It's the perfect space for any event! I enjoyed my experience very much and I'm extremely happy with Jonathan's service. I highly recommend The Teapot!"}
{"text":"What an amazing gem! This adorable home has been turned into perfection! From the amazing coffee and tea drinks to the English scones that you swear were made in England this morning to the back yard oasis...what's not to love?! The only con:if you don't like the sounds of kids playing while their mom's caffeinate up...this may not be the place for you."}
{"text":"We had such a perfect party for my sisters kid here!!! The staff was super, food was amazing, and kids all had a ball!! I can't wait to go back for coffee and treats soon... many thanks to the staff for everything!"}
{"text":"So I wanted something unique and beautiful for my best friends baby shower and that's when I found this amazing place! The Teapot was everything I prayed for and more for this event. My best friend had done 4 IUIs when she finally found out she was pregnant! So this shower was extremely special. We reserved the backyard of the venue where you'll find beautiful trees, and the neatest tree/play house you've ever seen! It's also super kid friendly! Jonathan was our go to and the one who helped book the shower. He went above and beyond for us! Not to mention how charming his accent is! He helped us set up in a jiff and was there for us throughout. Also, the icing on the cake was the music they play! It's phenomenal! Lots of Motown and feel good music all day! Not to mention the food...absolutely delicious and beautifully presented. Thank you Teapot for one of the most memorable days of my life!"}
{"text":"I heard about this place through a mommy friend of mine and thought it sounded so fabulous and so my mommy' group decided to have a play date here to check it out. There is a tiny pastry case with a few pricey options like $4 scones or $6 tiny pieces of quiche, but nothing really simple and kid friendly. I really liked the enclosed backyard play area for our children, however we got really turned off when one of our friends arrived late and came to greet our group in the backyard and she had only been there 10 minutes before an English male staff member approached her in front of us all and told her she needed to make a purchase of some sort if she wanted to be there with her kids. So embarrassing!!! She just wanted to say hi to us before she waited in the long line to buy some coffee. That left a bad taste in our mouths and I heard they have since added a $2 per child play tax to enter their property now!!! They even charge babies! So ridiculous. Even museums, amusement parks, and zoos don't charge babies (or kids under 2 for that matter) to enter their premises. This place had great potential, but parents aren't going to pay an arm and a leg for a cup of coffee. My friend went there after their new play fee was implemented with her 1 and 3 year old and after ordering a latte, scone, juice and paying the play fee for both her kids her total was $18. Ummmm no thank you."}
{"text":"Wonderful & Whimsical!  Today, we hosted a very special celebration at the Teapot on 5th for my daughter, Charlotte.  From the moment we arrived to the second it was sadly time to say \"goodbye\" we were catered to with smiles and service!  Jonathan and his team were kind, detail-orientated, and kept smiles on our faces!  The catering was delicious, perfectly displayed, and the space was just what we needed to enjoy an afternoon of giggles, merriment and perfect photo opportunities!  What a wonderful concept and family-friendly establishment!  Thank you SEW much!!!"}
{"text":"I had rented their space for an event that I hosted and it was one of the best event planning experiences ever. They are extremely prompt, incredibly accommodating, kind and polite. After my first email contacting them for information about their event space, the owner Jonathan sent me all the information I could have needed right away. He was always able to answer questions and I appreciated that he was very happy and enthusiastic to host our event.

While they allow outside food to be brought in for event rentals, we tried to take advantage of their catering options as much as our budget enabled us to. They had a set catering menu but it was flexible so we were able to special request some entree items as well. The catered food was amazing, and their regular menu items are excellent too. All my party guests kept telling me how much they liked the food and venue during the duration of our time there.

They have plenty of vegetarian options and some vegan ones as well."}
{"text":"Nice place to take young children, they have snacks and a warm and friendly environment."}
{"text":"scones are super perfectly baked here, very soft, delicious! the waffles are super delicious as well!!!! love this place"}
{"text":"So sadly disappointed. First, I love this concept... adults eat, kids play in an adorable renovated house.  Unfortunately the tiny menu along with overpriced food and waffles were mushy is just too much to overlook. The play area left much to be desired. The kitchen area in the house was so dirty, cobwebs all over, seemed like it hadn't been cleaned in months. There was a doll our friend's daughter was fond of that seemed like it had come from a dumpster. There were a few other toys floating around, but not much... I gave it two stars because the concept, drinks and shade offered."}
{"text":"Are there really people complaining that a place charges customers 8 quarters to use a playground on private property?  I mean, the staff is charming and so is the house and playground...$2 is too much to ask?  They give you a punchcard that allows your child to play for free when it's full...isn't that enough?  Oh wait, they ask you to buy coffee or food too?  That's an issue...wait...YOU'RE AT A RESTAURANT!

If you have an issue with any of that, keep driving to the nearest Starbucks to drink some burnt swill and leave my kids some more space on the playground."}
{"text":"We were lucky to be able to gather our kiddie friends and their families for our daughter's 2nd Birthday celebration! Jonathan was very accommodating and was available before for all questions and planning and during the event making sure we were all set!
We reserved two tables in the backyard which was the perfect space for our guests to sit and relax, eat, and drink.  Our daughter had a great time along with her friends - this is a great place where parents can socialize and their children can play with fun toys in a safe environment. 
We would love to have another event in the future! A favorite play date spot in our amazing city!"}
{"text":"After a long awaited debut... ahhh absolutely lovely. The sign sums it up quite well eat relax play. I had tea and crumpets for the first time in my life and they were delicious, mix that with a amazing selection of music coming from an awesome sound system beautiful weather and the laughter of children almost brought a tear to my eye on the cozy porch of this lovey historic building where I wrote this review. Very well done guys."}
{"text":"Umm, can I please have this backyard? And the decor here...so cute! What a cool spot for the kiddos to play and the mamas/papas to sit back, relax, and enjoy some delicious food and sip on some caffeine! 

Love this concept - a renovated house converted to a lovely, kid-friendly coffee shop and backyard with toys and a playhouse. As long as you are prepared to pay the small entry fee ($2/child) and purchase food/drinks rather than pack your own snacks (as most of us do on regular outings with our kids), I think you will enjoy this spot. They gotta make their money so I totally get it! 

The raspberry-coconut scone is the best I've ever had in my life! Make sure to eat it with the cream and preserves - it's to die for and my mouth is watering just thinking about it. Several decent-priced kids options. I opted for the kids combo which included a small sandwich, fruit or veggies, and a snack (apple sauce or goldfish) for around $7.50. I didn't get a chance to try any of their coffee/tea drinks because I already had my caffeine fix for the day - but next time I can't wait to try one. I will most definitely be ordering another raspberry-coconut scone!

Great spot for a playdate!!"}
{"text":"I've been a few times with my children since they've opened. It's a cute space with a nice garden in back for children to play. This time I was surprised by the $2.00 per child pay to play fee and the fact they don't allow you to bring your own drinks/snack crackers for the kids under two (my 16 month old sat in my lap the entire time). I see they've updated the fee on their website but not on their Facebook page and there is no mention of the no drinks etc for kids under two.) If anyone knows children, you know in that environment they aren't eating a $5.00 scone or muffin. On previous occasions the food was good but this time the scones were dry and crumbly (we purchased a blueberry scone with lemon glaze and an English scone) and I overheard the woman behind the counter say she removed them from the freezer earlier. We weren't able to eat them. A disappointing experience for $30.00. We won't be returning."}
