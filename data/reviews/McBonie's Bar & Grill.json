{"text":"I am from Charlotte and have frequented this bar numerous times before any other time I enjoy myself but tonight is very different. I have been in this bar for about an hour or so and it is only 5 patrons including myself. The music is good but I think it's falling off completely. This is not normal for mcbonies not to have crowd on a Thursday night. I hate that I chose to come here on my one day off but I know better next time.  I guess the wait staff is OK because the only have 5 people to wait on.  But you live and you learn never again. I can scratch this bar off of my list of bars to come to on my day off.  There is no heat it's freezing in the bar maybe they thought it would be a big crowd but it's not so they should keep the heat on for the little bit of people that are here if I could I would give it a negative 10000 but I can't so I'll give it a 1 star"}
{"text":"I came with my family on Sunday afternoon and it was one if the worst experiences. It was dark and silent inside, she sat us in an area with no lights on. No music or anything. She took about ten minutes to get our drinks which tasted like toilet water. And then when we ordered they had no wings or white meat, which basically took away everything we could eat. We left without drinking any of the drinks except for a sip that tasted awful. She made us pay for the drinks and we left. I heard it was really good so I was looking forward to it. But it was awful."}
{"text":"Last nite my wife and I went THIS PLACE, GOOD LAWD !! The customer service was HORRIBLE, slow and HORRIBLE. Last night the water wasnt working so you couldnt get a glass of water but our waitress would offer bottle water and a cost, so i asked for a glass of lemonade and got water ( WHAT THE HELL) . One lady asked for sweet tea and got tea that was so sweet she said \"my sugar just went up\" so she asked for some water to help dilute the tea from that ONE glass tea she made FIVE glasses of tea. The overall atmosphere was HORRIBLE , all the liquor bottles didnt have any caps. The food was OVER seasoned, MCNO-NO..."}
{"text":"I rated this place a 3 this time. I went and got the chicken dumpling the hours later I became very sick. I had food poising :(  It was good but I got sick. I hadn't been back since."}
{"text":"I'm not originally from the Charlotte area so I've been looking for a nice, laid back reggae spot. This place here is as ratchet as all get up. I mean it was okay, but not what I was looking for. They played some reggae, but definitely not my kind of crowd."}
{"text":"At the door I was greeted by signs telling me what I couldn't do relative to coupons and credit cards. It wasn't clear whether I should wait to be seated or seat myself. That was a turn off. The service left much to be desired. The atmosphere was equally disappointing. Out dated, uncomfortable seating and tables. There was a pervasive odor that I couldn't identify, but it took me back to the mid 1970s.  Despite what appeared to be ample staff and only 3 tables being occupied they were slow in taking my order. I didn't have but 45 mins to eat so I ordered dishes that should have been prepared hours before.  Still, I waited too long for my food.  The meatloaf tasted processed, the greens were too sweet, and the mac and cheese  needed salt. I got the impression that to enjoy this place you must be used to settling for less. Low rent seems to describe this place. The meal was inexpensive. That is a plus."}
{"text":"The worst place I've eaten in my life! Strike 1, the strong smell of mildew,  #2 My husband's pork chops looked like a pair of leather shoes and he said the shoes would probably taste better! #3 looked at the bread, thought it was parsley, surprise, it was MOLDED!! How this place is still in business is beyond me! Save yourself, never eat here!!"}
{"text":"I can only review McBonie's based on takeout because that is all we have gotten so far! I can only comment on atmosphere by saying that the bar tenders and security guard were very nice.  The food is TASTY! Their fried chicken is yum. And we also really like their hotdogs! They have great prices and we are about to order some for dinner :D."}
{"text":"I went to this bar just to see if there's any change since I had a bad customer service the first time I went there. It was even more worse than the first incident. The bartenders really really sucks. Very rude and nasty attitude. I tried to order and she said , please wait I got something to do. Seriously! Pls don't go there unless you want to get disappointed and ruin your night! Very very unprofessional!!!"}
{"text":"Great food especially the meatloaf and greens.   Wings are great too!   Friendly people but bare bones atmosphere.   Go for down home cooking not the surroundings . I like the food it is truly soul/southern food.  The actually place is nothing to look at but the service has always been very good.  Very nice people good food don't be scared to go in."}
{"text":"I finally decided to try this place out, despite the mix reviews I keep hearing about them.  I figured if WFNZ is promoting them, it can't be all that bad.  Now, besides all that, I had a $10 off coupon, and had just got back in town from the beach and was thinking this place had better be good because there will be no cooking in my household today.  I think this place is more of a bar than a restaurant since it's Sunday and the only 2 people here were not eating but watching football.....not a good sign but I stayed and ordered the pork chops, and hamburger steak, both came with 2 sides and a roll.  I must admit that everything was really good:  Pork chops-3.5 stars(a bit too much salt) Hamburger steak-4 stars Mac n cheese-4 stars Green beans-3.5 canned Greens-3.5 canned(very sweet) Rice-4 stars  I did hear the server say that the cook that was there today was the best cook on staff.   I would probably frequent this place if I lived closer, but I would return."}
{"text":"I had heard somuch about this place and I had also read the reviews. My best friend and I arrived about 8 PM on a Saturday night. There were only a few people in the restaurant when we got there.  We were told to sit wherever we liked, and very soon a waitress appeared to take our drink orders.  When she came back with our beers, we asked for an order of fried pickles to eat while we waited for our entrees.  My friend ordered the 2 hot dogs, which came with fries. I ordered the 3 chicken wing dineer with pintos and collards.  We were finished with our first beer(and we did not guzzle it), before we got our fried pickles. Then I was told that they did not have any chicken wings, so I switched to the fried pork chops.  We waited at least another 30 minutes before our food finally arrived. However, during the wait, the waitress and I assume some gentleman that was the owner, reassured us several times that our food would soon be there.  My friend said the hotdogs were ok and the fries were at least hot. My pintos were not good, and the collards were too sweet. No one even asked if I wanted any bread with my meal.  We also asked for a second beer when we finshed our pickles, we finally got the second one just before we finished our meal.  I live close to the restaurant, and was hoping that I had found a place close enough to call in an order and run by and pick it up on days when I don't want to cook. This won't happen now."}
{"text":"Good food, plenty of atmosphere, especially if you like a place with large airbrushed beer bottles, and martini glasses on the walls."}
{"text":"food is always good, i tried several things on the menu, the only downside is that i usually have to wait a seemingly long while to receive my food."}
{"text":"What in the entire f**k ? This was an absolute disgrace. I went to place a takeout order and their \"bouncer\" told us we couldn't go in without paying a 10 cover charge. Ladies were free at that time tho. So I asked for a takeout menu and called the order in. The prices were great I was excited to try the food. We placed the order disputes repeating ourselves several times because it is a \" nightclub\" and there was loud music and she couldn't hear us although there weren't many people there yet ( 11pm ish). We waited and figured she would call back when the food was done because we told her we were outside. After waiting 20 min, we called back to inquire about our order. Another girl answered and told us they cancelled the order because \" we hung up \" . I was so utterly confused. Even if we hung up ( which we didn't ) why not call just to confirm . We just gave our name and number. We left that night disappointed but returned the next night because we are new to town and not aware of what we could get close by. This time we were able to get the food but to much disappointment. When we went in to pick it up they tried to charge a cover again. ( I'm really outraged at them trying to take peoples money at a funky \" club \" not even in a good area and so far from uptown) . Anyway we open the box and the Mac and cheese is square as if it was leftover and they just took it from the fridge to the container the potato salad was overly mayonnaise's the corn bread was dry . The chicken was dry over cooked and greasy and with little meat. It was so over cooked that when I picked it up it completely crumbled. Everything was under seasoned . I'm being so nice. This establishment needs to be on an episode of kitchen nightmares. I'm gonna stop here because I'm getting angry all over again. Wish I could give negative 5 stars . Please don't waste your time or money."}
{"text":"A couple of weeks ago I had family down from DC visiting & they wanted to go out. Since I don't go out much & I hear of Mcbonies all the time on the radio I'd thought we'd check it out. Big Mistake!! The service & how you're treated is sooo bad we didn't even make it passed the door. First of all we walk up and the bouncer starts yelling at the top of his lungs all the \"rules\" of the place as if he were talking to a large crowd of trouble makers. Then he proceeds to tell us I (a female) can get in for $5, but my brother & cousin would have to pay $25 if they are under 26 & $25 more dollars if they want to wear a hat... That's the most ridiculous thing I have ever heard! And the man was super rude about it! I was so embarrassed for charlotte in that moment. I just told them to come on it definitely doesn't look worth it from the outside. We ended up going to another place where we spent lots of money. I have never been to a place that seemed to not want your business. I felt like that guy was doing everything in his power to make us feel unwelcome. TWO THUMBS ALLLLL THE WAY DOWN! Shame on you Mcbonies!"}
{"text":"I haven't been in the evening, but lunch is a great time to go! Sat at the bar.  The bartender was very nice.   The food was amazing!  Fried chicken looked awesome!  My fried whitefish was delicious and crispy.  Solid Mac n Cheese.  Collards... Amazing!  Great vinaigrette...not too vinegary and a slightly sweet/spice in it!!! So good.  A good neighborhood restaurant.  This is a huge space and seems like a good club space.  It could use some refurbishing."}
{"text":"*Runs to stage. Grabs Mic. Clears throat for first review* McBonie's has the best & most consistent offering of home cooking or \"soul food\" in the city. I heard the radio spots promoting the bar and \"club\" atmosphere on the weekends. It wasn't until I received the restaurants.com two for one coupon that I decided to give the food a try.  On my \"cheat\" days I go in & have myself some fried pickles, the chopped steak, mac & cheese, collard greens and I wash it down with a \"diet\" coke.  If you happen to get stuck in between dinner and the party ... there is a sense of domestic tranquility, everyone is represented from the Bougie Prince & Princess, to the young & old professionals, to your average around the way homeboy & homegirl. Next time I'll stay for the party.   *Drops Mic. Walks off stage wiping my mouth & unfastening my pants*"}
{"text":"Being a southern county girl I know real southern food. Everything here is AMAZING!! If you don't try anything else try their wings, grilled chicken breast with onions and peppers, mac&cheese, and COLLARD GREENS ARE TO DIE FOR!!!!! Oh my goodness the collards are super good. The owner is super sweet and a great cook! They offer 50 cent wings after 4pm on Tuesdays or Thursday's. Don't let the outside fool you! Please try here definitely deserves more than a 5 star rating!!!!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere good music good people friend customer service.  Definitely a spot to go to in Charlotte  to get good music and good eats.  Haven't tried the whole menu but I plan on doing that."}
{"text":"I wish there was an option for no stars... ordered chicken wings ( hot) very disgusting... chicken was mushy with no flavor, it smelled like it had been fried in old grease.. I took the chicken in and requested them to be fixed and they came out worst... never eating at this place again"}
{"text":"I have never given a review this low as I have been fortunate to have great food most places. This was a waste of time and money. After taking 30 minutes to get food I didn't order because what I wanted wasn't available ( no one told me until after the wrong food was brought out) the food was seriously A FULL MESS. If you like dry mac n cheese and barely seasoned malnourished fried fish then this is the place for you. I will not be returning for any reason."}
