{"text":"Seen the reviews and decided check it out being I'm new to Vegas.  Food was ok not the greatest or the worst. We ordered shrimp tostadas and fish tacos,  beans tasted funky though.  The micheladas were ok,  we finished full.  But once we paid and we're about to leave my husband noticed a cockroach roaming through the place.  We were both disgusted!!! We let them know and they acted like it was a ant.  So just a little heads up people!!"}
{"text":"One of my  favorite places to eat Mexican seefood. I love  the octopus tostadas and seafood cocktails:)"}
{"text":"Bad tasting food and service. I was surprised they don't serve chips and salsa to munch on while your food is prepared. If you want to hear music you have to pay for it at the iTunes box. Will never come back or recommend this place."}
{"text":"Friendly staff  The food is delicious  Everytime I'm in town it's the go to Mariscos place"}
{"text":"Came in on Mothers Day....I was expecting long lines and poor service.   Pleasantly surprised!!  Was immediately seated and the service was punctual and pleasant.   And the food was just as memorable.   The shrimp tacos were super good.  I'll be back for seconds!"}
{"text":"Wonderful mexican seafood. I come here every weekend and every time the food is really fresh. I love this place."}
{"text":"Delicious. I love every bite I take. I recommend tacos de pescado and their cocktails. BTW they close on Wednesday. I love how they have a little \"arcade\""}
{"text":"Really good service...... Food taste like it was made with no passion what so ever! I was extremely disappointed and would never go back if y'all trynna eat something bomb come through to my house I cook way better than them when I'm half asleep!"}
{"text":"Service is amazing!!! We were greeted and our drinks came out promptly. The restaurant's atmosphere is clean and inviting. We ordered several tostadas of camaron (shrimp), pescado (fish) and mixta (shrimp, fish and octopus).  My mother had fish tacos, out of sight! There are always restaurants that try to live up to \"authentic\" well this is one of them.  Can't wait to come back!!! The Chef and their staff really make you feel welcomed and valued!!!"}
{"text":"Muy bueno. This is spot is way off the strip but nothing too crazy. Its worth the 10 minute drive based on taste customer service and quality of food. I need my Ceviche and this place delivered more than enough"}
{"text":"I was looking by some good sea food and I got this  place. The food is so delicious.! The employees very friendly. I recommend the place!!!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch and they do not have a lunch menu so yr left to buy any meal at dinner prices, over $11 dollars. Service is good, food is good but pricey for Mexican, portions are no very big, should include more items for that price. They tried to make it gourmet plates at high prices and that does not work for this location. The ceviche tostadas are excellent, it's provably the only items that is worth the price, portion wise. Mexican food is know for filling u up, this isn't French, please increase the portions or lower price."}
{"text":"If you are in Vegas, and want some bomb mariscos! Definitely hit up this spot!! Its about 15-20 mins of the strip, but definitely worth it. Price on food is cheap!! Try the shrimp burrito!! Also micheladas!!"}
{"text":"First time at Mariscos Vallarta, and I'll definitely be back! Friendly service, and very high quality food.  I don't think that there's a better deal on oysters in town. A dozen for $16 - and they're large and very fresh! They were beautifully briny - like fresh sea water - but not overly salty. Personally, I missed having these East Coast style - with Tabasco and horseradish - but fresh limes made them irresistible  The Fish Tacos were simple, but done well. I would have liked a crispy batter on the fish, but it's a fine line between crisp and overcooked. The chef here errs on the quick side - which does make for a tastier fish overall.   Here's the thing. For one order of oysters and two orders of fish tacos (with sodas and 1 beer) the bill was $50.  I'm not saying that this was unreasonable for what we got, but it ain't cheap.   Looking forward to trying the Ceviche."}
{"text":"Wonderful place for AUTHENTIC, read AUTHENTIC Mexican seafood.  They have shrimp cocktail, but the shrimp swim in a combination of clam juice, lime juice, and other ingredients.  They are simply the best.  These are NOT your American 99 cent shrimp cocktails.  These are amazing.  Also recommended is the Shrimp with Butter    aka Shrimp ala Mantequilla.  It comes with rice and salad.  Tortillas, bread, and french fries are also served.  The french fries in this place are not promoted very heavily (they are on the kids menu) but they are GREAT!  I've tried a lot of stuff here and keep going back, week after week."}
{"text":"The food was good. Let me say that. We got a dozen oysters on the half shell done up with the shrimp and fish on it. We got the deep fried fish pieces. We got the shrimp cocktail. But here is where we had problems... We ordered the oysters with no onions, they came with onions. We did not send them back as we felt bad sending an expensive item back even though one of us cannot eat onions.  The shrimp cocktail. I ordered a small, even pointed to it on the menu, she brought the large. Only 4 ounces bigger so I thought maybe it was a small? I mean, how do you really know how many ounces it is. I was unsure. Just ate it. Well lo and behold, on the check was a large. So I asked her about that and she said it was a large. So she basically upcharged us there. Y The only other food item we got was the fried fish pieces. Luckily I remembered that it was $4.50 as I got it a la carte. She charged $5.50. I called her over for that as well and she says, \"oh yea. I will go change it.\" So make SURE to watch the bill, people. Maybe it was a new server, not sure. But we went Saturday about 3\"30pm. And got more than we asked for on one item and charged too much for a second item and the 3rd item made wrong. So be careful."}
{"text":"Best place in Vegas for fresh oysters for about $1 each! I come here quiet often, at least once a week and its a rarity in Vegas to find a place that doesn't try to do too much. This mom and pops joint sticks to what their good at, Mexican Seafood.  The restaurant is also very spacious and clean which is a plus for it being in a bad location away from the strip and practically surrounded by nothing else.  This place isn't just cheap, it offers some of the best seafood in town when it comes to oysters, ceviche, and shrimp cocktails."}
{"text":"Here on Yelp it states that they open at 10:30. My party & I arrived here at 1:30 only to see a \"Closed sign on their window & it's not like this place is ridiculously close to the strip. I tried calling the number listed & all I kept getting was a busy signal. Shame on them."}
{"text":"Dined in a couple of times and I'm definitely a fan!  Yummy, what-taste-authentic Mexican food!  Husband and I have had : Carne Asada Plate - grilled, marinated, whole steak - served with grilled onions & pepper, rice, refried beans, side salad and corn tortillas (lotta carbs for one protein LOL)  Fish Tacos - deep fried white fish, topped with slaw and white sauce French Fries - ordered with fish tacos, because why not ; crispy on the outside, squishy on the inside - how I like my fried potatoes! Half Dozen Oyster Vallarta - fresh oysters topped generously with a sort of ceviche, green chile mix and shrimp.  Staff are very friendly, fast, and tentative! Although the couple times we've dined-in I felt like all of them spoke very very little English and I knew very very little Spanish so there was a language barrier trying to order something specific. No biggie - still a good, small establishment conveniently close to home!"}
{"text":"This place is very good. I always get the fish tacos and a preparada. The cevich is also very good. It's a small menu but every thing on there is made just right."}
{"text":"Growing up in Southern CA I have done my fair share of road trips down the coast of Baja California. The seafood here is the closest thing I have come by that takes me back to being barefoot on the beach enjoying authentic seafood. The setting can create some hesitancy at first but once you relax and more importantly become enamoured by the deliciousness in front of you, it soon melt away. Maybe it was growing up and traveling down south, but I find some sort of comfort in the plastic utensils, and casual simplicity at times.  I knew I had made a good choice when all the people eating there were all obvious regulars/family and the steady flow of customers all knew each other. You don't get an ambiance like that from producing sub-par dishes. I cant wait to go back with some family members when they visit."}
{"text":"Mariscos are good  tasting, smallest portions I have come across here in Vegas and I tried a few also pricey very pricey for the portions you get  much rather go somewhere else"}
{"text":"Pretty good place. Tasted fresh. I wish the shrimp ceviche was a bit more limey, and spicier. They are also kinda stingy on the toastadas lol, I had to end up using crackers to eat my shrimp . Fish tacos were really good as well. Overall, I will come back again."}
{"text":"Great little hole in the wall.  I just moved here from southern california so I had yet to find a good mariscos locations.  But this spot is definitely the best Ive tried in vegas. I had the shrimp coctele, ceviche tostada, and shared some oysters.  All the food was on point, the only thing I didnt like was that their micheladas were basically just beer and clamato mix; nothing special. Other than that a great eat!"}
{"text":"I am originally from Los Angeles and was looking for a great Mexican sea food place to eat.. We ended up in this place and to my surprise the food was really delicious, however customer service was horrible. The waitress was very rude and the smell of this place is disgusting... If you plan on coming here make sure to seat by the entrance or bring nose plugs otherwise you will be smelling the smell of the restroom while eating your good!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was wonderful, husband got the fish tacos and we also ordered the tostada mixta and the dozen regular oysters. Everything was very fresh and tasted amazing. I'll definitely will be back and bring other people as well, can't believe how long it took me to try this place when I live 5 mins away! I drive by it every day. Service was also very good.   Muy rica comida, se nota que la hacen fresca. Muy rico todo. Mi esposo ordeno los tacos de pescado, la tostada mixta y yo ordene los ostiones regulares,  muy rico todo y el servicio fue excelente. Raro que no estaba mas ocupado con el tipo de comida que tienen!  Seguro que volvemos muy pronto."}
{"text":"If your looking for excellent Mexican style mariscos this is a place I would highly recommend. The fish ceviche is delicious, the prices are lower then other marisco places in Vegas. The atmosphere is more like a deli, not exactly a \"fine dinning\" type of decor, not that there's anything wrong with that I came to eat not admire the decorations anyways."}
{"text":"This place is the business. When I visit Vegas I always make sure I come here for some good seafood. Definitely recommend to try out!"}
{"text":"2/5 for service. 1/5 food. Mariscos Vallarta were suppose to be from Vallarta, not a single Vallartence working in this place. Very disappointed I suggest them to change their name and food."}
{"text":"Que rico tacos de Camerone i civiche tostada. Me gusta todo mucho.. I cant wait to go back"}
{"text":"Great food! Shrimp tacos are my favorite. They Asada  tacos are always made fresh! I typically sit at the bar so service is quick and efficient :)"}
{"text":"I posted pics of the food we had: oysters and fish tacos. The oysters were wonderful!  Very friendly, courteous service. The restaurant smelled a little funny, maybe it was the fish and bleach for cleaning mixed together that was weird but it put me off a little. It is quite a drive from the Vegas strip, about 20-30 mins b/c it's all street. Other than that, I would go back for the oysters."}
{"text":"Bright, clean space!  The servings are generous and their oyster ceviche is served with shrimp and fish with a tangy green salsa -- was delicious and affordable.  Papa Lai had a shrimp dish and he scarfed it down barely giving me a chance to try it."}
{"text":"Super fresh. Very good can't go wrong. Make sure and order a prepared beer ! And the shrimp cocktail is also good. No farm raised shrimp here like some other bunk places. As soon as you walk in it smells like the ocean always a good sign of how fresh the place is."}
{"text":"Good food. Cheap price. Only reason I'm giving a low rate is because of portions. Compared to other mariscos which is usually 4-5 dollars more. It is super ridiculous how small the portions are."}
{"text":"I loved it here ... I felt like I was in TJ ... totally the real deal ... I only had the fish tacos, which were great...I will come Back for ceviche which looked Delish  Great service warm atmosphere Ole"}
{"text":"I will be coming back soon. Everything was amazing! Service was fast and awesome. I ordered the fish ceviche and oysters and tasted fresh."}
{"text":"I had the best fish burrito I've ever had here. Good beer selection too. Definitely looking forward to coming back and trying more items."}
{"text":"I really liked this place. Super small, friendly service and the food is authentic. Growing up in Mexico, this reminded me of being near the beach. The shrimp tacos were good. We really enjoyed the oysters. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"It is not easy to find fresh mariscos anywhere. This hole on the wall seems to have some decent ceviche and shrimp coctel. The only thing that I did not like was the imitation lemon juice they add to the coctel. But other than that, it was pretty good."}
{"text":"This review is based on my boyfriends opinion. My boyfriend is from Hawaii and knows how hard it is to find a seafood place in the middle of the desert that serves FRESH seafood. There is a little girl who greeted and seated us immediately and I thought it was a cute touch to the whole experience. Very good preparadas and cocktails. I ordered the fish tacos which in my opinion were really delicious. Each taco had four pieces of fresh fish battered and fried to perfection. The spicy sauce they bring was really good. The servers and staff are very friendly and prompt to take your order and bring your food out to you. This is his 3rd time being here and my first time. He has tried a handful of items from the menu and says everything is delicious. Good Choice for Fridays during lent. Dont be afraid of the neighborhood or the bars on the window this place is the real deal for fresh seafood ."}
{"text":"This place is the BEST and we will be back any time we fly to Vegas.  It was a little far from where we were staying and we drove there on the one day of the week they're closed so we had to come back the next day.  It was totally worth the drive!   We ordered the shrimp ($14 for three tacos and a salad) and fish tacos ($13 for three and a salad) and they were DELISH!  We also ordered four fish tostadas (I think it was about $12 but it came with a lot) and those were so yummy too, especially with the house sauce and salsa.  But our very favorite thing about the place was the fresh oysters.  They were AMAZING!  AMAZING!!!  We ordered one dozen of the Vallarta oysters ($20) and they were yummy (too spicy for my kids but I really enjoyed it), along with one dozen of the plain fresh oysters ($14 served with lots of fresh lime and the house salsa) and that was the winner!!!  I was surprised that even my five year old couldn't get enough.  We kept ordering an additional dozen and ended up ordering a total of SIX DOZEN oysters.  Totally wish we could've gone back again before we left Vegas.  It was that good!  We went early and the service was impeccable.  Clean place.  Attentive waitress.  Can't say enough good things about it.  We kind of revolve our travels around good places to eat and we will most definitely go back there again."}
{"text":"I've been to this establishment multiple times in the past several years.  The seafood is always fresh and top quality, no matter what day or time I've been there. I love the cocktails and the oysters on the half shell. Service is impeccable. You are treated like a guest of honor. You will not find pricing like this for this type of quality anywhere else in LV. This place is a definite winner in my books.  It is a \"MUST HAVE\" for anyone serious about eating great seafood. Support local small businesses!!!"}
{"text":"ordered some shrimp tacos.. super yummy...        jaiva tostada... not so much... Micheladas! amazing.....        Enjoyed Nice Banda....for hours.... and good atmosphere!!! definitely will come again... Service on Point...very courteous! with a large group of people"}
{"text":"Great oysters. Fish ceviche needed more flavor, but overall, everything was great. Friendly service."}
