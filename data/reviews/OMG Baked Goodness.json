{"text":"The new OMG Baked Goods has opened in our building at The Edge Condos a couple of days ago. 

The store is very clean, and attractive, some challenge - from my point of view would be the price point for the area maybe a bit much - which i hope they change to be able to survive this area, in addition to further staff coaching on the POS system, as well as the roles of each member. 

However, the store has fresh items, and great Gelato. 

I wish them the best."}
{"text":"So over priced for what you actually get. The coffee and espresso drinks taste very watered down and the staff always seem confused when you walk up to the counter. 

Paying $3 for a disgusting drip coffee is just such a disappointment. And I've been a few times so I know it's not just a one time bad cup of coffee."}
{"text":"We went in with the intention of just browsing. The two staff on site was very friendly, offered \"Death in Venice\" gelato samples. It was SO good, we tried the strawberry one with coconut milk, it was infused with thai basil. Subtle, but definitely taste it. It was $5 for a small cup though."}
{"text":"It's a small little shop attached to a condo building that sells coffee and baked goods only they don't have any seats or tables inside.  The service is excellent, the baked goods and coffee are about average.  The price point on their croissants are tad pricey at $3.25 compared to it's competitors that sell at about $2.60-2.90, however, their product is noticeably larger in size."}
{"text":"I really love that this place is tucked into wqw and offers a variety of specialty foods. The staff working there are all very friendly and it has the vibe of a small community. 
I would say that the prices are quite steep so I end up only going for emergencies rather than necessities. Their cheeses and gelatos are highlights for me."}
{"text":"Very nice coffee place added in this neck of the woods. Brewed coffee is very bold and flavourful in taste and the sandwiches they offer to pair with he coffees are very scrumptious and filling. Owner is very kind and is great to talk to and friendly. He always gives our dog ice cream and takes the time to always say hi to us and chat when we come in. Definitely  great place to grab a coffee on the run before work or to have while sitting in lisgar park."}
{"text":"I was walking home after one very stressful day, and decided to pop in for something soothing and delicious (hey, don't judge!) 

It was 6:57 and they close at 7. Despite this, the barista welcomed me inside and made me the most amazing toasted marshmallow hot chocolate. I guess I really looked stressed because he then offered me half price cupcakes (and yes, I took him up on that too!)

I'll never forget that wonderful service in my time of need :)"}
{"text":"Very nice cafe with great coffee and superior pastries. The staff is very friendly, and they keep track of regulars in style. Nice to see that they have vegan options as well!"}
{"text":"Lovely little spot conveniently located toward the south end of Lisgar Park. They make an excellent cup of coffee for a fair price and the baristas have always been friendly and personable. I haven't tried their baked goods yet but they do look yummy! - vegan options too! They also stock essential pantry goods, a few pre-made lunch options and death in Venice gelato. There's lots of outdoor seating with a view of the park. A nice little place to have your morning coffee. I'll definitely be back! Thanks!"}
{"text":"This new location, OMG On The Park, makes my heart sing. Their usual sweet and savoury treats, along with coffee and all of the cute is a welcomed addition to the hood. Their peach bum bench sitting amongst the condos brings me so much joy. Seriously. Go to here. 

Yesterday, I cleared this OMG location clean of their great, gooey pop tarts to surprise a non-profit office with breakfast. I'm sure glad I did. Their homemade pop tarts are delicious, and always make people smile. Need a smile? Like I said... Go to here."}
