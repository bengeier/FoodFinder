{"text":"Awesome place!!! Love that they have old style beer!!! Pizza was amazing as well! Service was A+ I will be coming back for sure!:)"}
{"text":"My cousin from New York loved the pizza, we agree. It is a bit pricey (family of 5) for some of the options but very reasonable and worth it. Everyone there is very friendly and kind. We have been there 5 times and had a good experience each time."}
{"text":"Good pizza...not deep dish Chicago style, but good.. Big salads. Good gyro. Quick delivery. Zero complaints."}
{"text":"I am happy to report that we ate here twice in our recent three day visit to Scottsdale. It was just that good! My partner is a Chicago-born Italian and he loved the food here as well. I do believe it brought back fond  childhood memories for him. The staff is so genuine, kind and prompt. They treated us like one of their regulars. The thin crust pizza, hot Italian sandwiches and cannolis were out favorites!"}
{"text":"Wow..agree honey jalape√±o wings are awesome..but atmosphere is too bright & Denny's like.. So we order for home ...last four orders have been wrong...tortellni instead of ravioli..no biggie. Cold, wrong cut, burnt pizza...unacceptable... Sorry. Love the place..but someone is slacking.. Oh ya..FYI. 2 HR.delivery time after 8? Wow."}
{"text":"I love this place. the odd thing probably is that I have never had their pizza. I'll start with the lasagna which i think is absolutely great and I am not saying its the best I have ever had but still very good for the price and size. For $8.95 you get a huge piece and I think that their sauce is excellent, and in fact I usually order an extra side of their marinara. It has a slightly sweeter taste but still very well balanced. Its certainly not as sweet as Spinatos which I think is a good thing, and in my opinion love their pizza at Spinatos but their pasta dishes are too sweet. But that is another story.  Their \"Famous Eggplant parmigiana casserole\" which is awesome, but definitely not vegetarian considering it has sausage on it (but since I am not a veggie no complaints). I have also had their Italian and roast beef sandwiches which are both great and do yourself a favor and drive by subway to go to this run down strip mall to grab one. I would also suggest you get an order of 3 huge baked meatballs and add the cheese. and its only $4.75.This place is not much to look at but the quality of food is awesome!"}
{"text":"Best pizza time after time.  Excellent! Other food is good also but you can't beat there pizza.  Plus free delivery"}
{"text":"My favorite new restaurant in South Scottsdale. Great food awesome staff and ice cold beer on tap. What more do I need to say."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant!! I never liked thin crust pizza until I started eating here. The texture is perfect and it's not so hard or crunchy that it overshadows the rest of the pizza. Love the sauce, love the cheese (real mozzarella), and I love all the toppings they have available (their sausage is the best). Their Chicago Dogs are amazing; when I order them, they're consistently delivered without being soggy or wet, which can be difficult with all the toppings on it. The service is always friendly and prompt when you go in, although I will say there are one or two people there that could learn how to take orders a little better over the phone (which is how I always get LC). Delivery is quick and very inexpensive as well. Little Chicago is one of the best pizza joints I've eaten at and the service and friendly staff are awesome."}
{"text":"Couldn't be more disappointed.  Their service has been going down hill.  1st cold pizza was delivery.  Offered me a free one next time I came in.  I forgot about it.  My mom has been having breast cancer treatment and incredibly sick so I've been taking care of her.  2nd cold pizzas was pick up.  I was there at the specified time they gave me.  I even called to tell them and asked if it was safe to feed my toddler because the cheese was so glossy and old looking.  They said it had only been ready for 20 min when I picked it up.  Well that's not when I was told to be there.  He put me down for a second free pizza credit and said I had already had one and didn't use it...that to just call in and say next time and they would take care of me.  Called to use a credit and the night manager said he couldn't and to call during the day for the day time manager who took the book away.  Who remembers to call in the day for dinner time when you have a sick mom and a toddler? Not me.  Took me 3 weeks to remember to.  The morning manager was actually the owner and basically called me a liar.  She would not do anything for me and there is no book any longer to prove that I had my two credits.  I got heated after her saying people were calling in with fake credits.  I don't do well when people accuse me of lying.  When I said my mom had breast cancer, she laughed and said what does that have to do with this?  I hung up on her after some choice words.  NEVER will I ever go here again and I'm pissed because it was one of my favorite places for last minute dinners in the neighborhood.  I will also be making sure that no one I know goes there ever again. I'm a business owner and I would never treat my customers in the manner that she did.  You could tell over the phone she was lying about the book \"being gone\" by her stutter.  I don't even leave bad reviews because I call to speak with owners to tell them the situations - they can't fix anything unless they know about it.  Since I talked to the owner, I feel compelled to leave this review."}
{"text":"The service was great the prices were good. But the pizza was fabulous my wife and I could not believe how good this pizza was if you haven't tried it should get over here right away!"}
{"text":"Pizza 7/10, would've been better if it was hot. Manager was a little grouchy & not the friendliest. Also- she said she hated yelp"}
{"text":"Bad first impression = so much for welcoming them into our neighborhood  My review is not based on the food, nor will it ever be as our first attempt to order from here tonight was enough to lose us as a potential customer. We love when small businesses open in our area as we are big supporters of 'keeping our money local' vs the big chain guys.  We called tonight to order take-out after reviewing the great looking menu! We started by asking for the chicken fingers and fries dish only to be told: \"we won't have French fries until tomorrow\". We weren't really offered an alternative to the fries, so we asked if we could get a side of a dinner salad with it instead? To our surprise, we were told \"No, we can't do that\".  Ummmm okay!? We asked why since they had no French fries to offer we just couldn't substitute with a side of greens??  They told us, \"no, we can't substitute that\".  I'm not sure who handles their phone calls, but she should probably be educated in customer service.   I'm pretty sure if the 'chicken finger and French fries' menu item is missing 50% of what it calls for, a substitute of something should be made??!! Or they should just list it as 'chicken fingers'.  Without any help, side offered, substitute,etc... We instantly changed our minds. We will not be visiting this restaurant. Too bad the customer service was not helpful and uninviting!!"}
{"text":"Love the Chicago Sky pizza! This is our go-to neighborhood pizza place. Friendly staff and usually very quick service for to go orders."}
{"text":"Very good.  Not the best I have ever had but near the top for sure.  I travel alot and being a pizza hound my goal is to try them all.  Its got a original taste to it.  Think its the cheese.  Original in a good way.  Crust is unique also.  Price was good and staff was very nice.  Will be on my regular rotation when I'm in the area.  You gotta go try it."}
{"text":"We love this place, the food is great. Being from the Chicago area it's hard to find good pizza here in az, this is our new favorite place for pizza and wings. The staff is always friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"We were really excited to order from the new pizza place in our neighborhood, however, when we called tonight, the girl who answered the phone acted downright irritated that we called.  I mean, really really irritated.  Not even halfway through the call I was already tired of the attitude, so I decided to hang up.  This household doesnt support business that act like they dont want our business. MANAGER  That girl needs a serious talking to in regards to customer service."}
{"text":"Four words: Tomato, Garlic, mushroom pizza. Two more: Meat Lasagna.  Been dining and ordering delivery from here since they opened. Great delivery time and the food is always consistent. I'm not a big fan of square cut pies so I always request it be sliced. The toasted club, tuna salad sandwich, garlic cheese bread (OMG!) and crinkle cut fries are also favorites. Don't forget the made in-house ranch dressing that is the best ranch you can order out. Pick up a bottle of red wine, order the large meat lasagna to share with your sweetie and an order of garlic cheese bread - you will NOT be sorry. Delish."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. With all of the good reviews here my boyfriend and I decided we just had to try it on our night in. We got the honey jalapeno wings, fried zucchini, and the Sox pizza (12\"), which by the way is way too much food for two people but leftover pizza is never a bad thing. We ordered on a Friday night, so of course the wait time for the delivery was going to be long, but I'm so glad we went with it. They were kind enough to tell us what the wait time was before we ordered too which I really appreciate. Our delivery time was supposed to be about an hour and a half, but we ended up getting our food in about an hour!  The wings were awesome, but I wish they were just a little bit spicier. The flavor was really good though. I've never seen a honey jalapeno option for wings before but I think it's a really good option for the southwest and the combination works really well together. I hate soggy over sauced wings, but these had a nice crispy texture to them and the sauce came out as more of a glaze than a drippy mess.  Everything should be fried the way that their fried zucchinis are. HUGE slices, and a nice light crunchy breading that stayed crunchy even when delivered! I had to stop myself from eating the whole order by myself.  The pizza was fantastic. Really fresh tasting ingredients, good thin crust that (again) wasn't soggy. Their pizza sauce is really tangy too which I liked. Normally I'm a little leery of getting fresh tomato on my pizza. It normally comes out just mushy and tasting way too acidic for the pizza. These ones were nice and ripe though so they had that sweetness to tone down the acidity that tomatoes can have, and you could bite into them without pulling the rest of the toppings off.  Now I've never had Chicago style thin crust pizza before this, so I can't say how authentic it is, but I can say that I don't really care because this place is too delicious to pass up! The prices are pretty ridiculous too. All of this food for $24!"}
{"text":"Pizza is good. Usually get the veggie and like how they cut it in squares. I always get pickup since whenever I call and ask about delivery it's usually like one hour. I live close so driving there is no big deal. They're all nice people here. One time they actually lost my order and I had to wait for them to make a new pizza, but they ended up comping my order which was appreciated. This place and Defalco's are my got to for pizza in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place has great food, let me say that first off. The wings, are the best in town. The pizza is kind of shitty, But I would expect that from a mom and pop shop. If you do decide to order from there, get yourself a dinner plate or a sandwich. They have really good chicken parmigiana and GREAT lunch sandwiches. But I do want to express one of my concerns. I was there last friday, I saw one of the employees come out of the back door before i walked in and slam it with both hands. It was really childish and aggressive. I heard him yelling at people in the back of the restaurant before he came outside. He looked older so he must have been the manager or something. He walked to the other side of the restaurant and lit a cigarette up. The atmosphere seemed really stressful and angry there. I didn't even want to go inside after that... i started walking back to my car, and about 1 minute later a man walked out of his restaurant through the back door and he looked really upset....  I've seen him before... always a nice guy, he had corrected my order in front of one of the girls who served me, and I was really grateful. I know he has made pretty much 75% of my food that i've ordered there. He walked pretty fast away from the restaurant. I was pretty upset to see someone leaving that way.. who has been really nice to me everytime i have come in to sit at the bar and eat. When there was no one out front at a late night he would come out and give me the food himself and ask if everything was to my liking. Can't ask for better service than that. Anyway, I love the food, but I won't go back here. This place needs a staff change and people that don't get out of control at their work. I'd rather order burger kind than go back to this hostile environment. The food industry is all about customer service and great food. THey have 1 of those qualities, but with no customer service and blatantly shitty staff on the inside. I won't be back."}
{"text":"I can't believe I have lived near Little Chicago for over 5 years and just tried it....I was really missing out!  I have driven past it numerous times, but it is located in a run down strip mall, so I never thought to stop.  But my friends Karen & Kyle had been telling me how good it was, we even tried to order it one day with them, but it was on Memorial Day or something so they were closed.  Well last night I got it in my head that I just had to have some pizza, I hadn't ordered pizza delivery in over 2 years, but then I remembered about Little Chicago!  They not only have pizza, but also hot and cold subs and some pasta dishes.  I went with a Hawaiian style pizza and a side of friend zucchini.  Wow, I was blown away, the pizza was thin, crisp and had just the right ratio of sauce to cheese (I am a light on the sauce kind of girl).  The crust had a really nice flavor, everything melded together so well, I was hooked!  Then I tried the zucchini, and oh my goodness, some of the best fried zucchini ever!  They were cut thick and had a well seasoned coating, they were so good dunked in some of the cool ranch that came on the side.  I think my Little Chicago experience is going to be the first of many!"}
{"text":"THIS IS THE BEST PIZZA EVER!!!!!!  I am very picky about my pizza and I can honestly say this is beyond AMAZING!!  Fresh ingredients, crisp crust, and some of the best sauce I've ever tasted.  Don't change a thing and don't ever leave me!!"}
{"text":"I googled  Chicago style pizza wondering if maybe I had a misunderstanding when I ordered the pizza from here. We had ordered he \"double crust\" pizza thinking that would be a sufficient amount of crust but when the pizza came out it was nothing more than a large 16\" cracker smothered in sauce and cheese What i can say is they were very nice in response to our reaction and offered it for free, which I appreciate (thus the extra star) If I rated just customer service I would go with 5 stars"}
{"text":"Best frickin' calzones on earth...well maybe just in AZ, but you won't be disappointed!  Huge and filled with ricotta and mozzarella , and 2 toppings- add the option of it covered with sauce and mozzarella and you'll be in heaven. Yum!!  Update: History: I've been a customer of \"Little Chicagos\" pizza since 2006 or 07.  After several months of great calzones, (only tried them this past 12 months...I am saddened to say that the above calzone praise is null and void\ my previous comment is no longer the case at \"Little Chicago\" in south Scottsdale.   The quality of the entire menu has taken a nose dive. We've been regulars for order out both delivery and pick up - we were familiar with the food, but my love was the calzones. The last two times my calzones have arrived as thin as a quesadilla with a sad amount of cheese and sauce.   The food looks and tastes cheap - the calzones were once huge abs covered with sauce and melts cheese, not anymore. I positively believe that the company has taken their most popular item, realized that their price was low - and they cut the dough, fillings (were wrong more often or not and/or omitted) and the cheese to keep costs down.   Why not keep the same product quality and raise the price?   If product had stayed the same great quality and a buck or so extra as necessary to maintain calzone-awesomeness, customers like us would maintain loyalty thereby, increasing patronage and long term cost benefits.  Unfortunately after multiple orders and a well spaced amount of time spent in efforts to check if product quality was  a human error: I can confidently say that the quality of \"Little Chicago's\" pizza, calzones and pastas are changed for the worse for good. We won't be purchasing or suggesting this restaurant  again."}
{"text":"I was feeling lazy last night, so I wanted to order delivery. I looked on yelp and found this place, with a real mixed bag of reviews. I called the restaurant, asked what the minimum order on delivery is, and was told there was NO minimum, and delivery is FREE! So I decided to give it a go, and am very happy I did!  I ordered a calzone - which comes with real mozzarella, real ricotta, and your choice of 2 ingredients (I opted for artichokes and sausage, very generous and delicious) and a big cup of tasty marinara sauce for $7! I was told it'd arrive in about 40 minutes, but it was at my door in 30.   One seemingly small, yet very important thing they do - they punched a few holes in the styro container to allow the steam to vent out, so it was not soggy in the least; I love that kind of thinking ahead!  I will definitely try this place again, and cannot wait to try other options!"}
{"text":"I do not typically write reviews but I recently had the displeasure of having indirect contact with the manager (Chad) of this establishment. I observed this so called \"manager\" berating and belittling one of his server's in front of fellow employees and customers. In a time where there is zero tolerance for harassment and bullying,  I found his behavior to be both  inappropriate and extremely unprofessional.    As a business owner, I would never tolerate this type of conduct from my manager. I will not spend another cent in this establishment and I encourage others to follow suit.  If you feel that bullying and harassing behaviors are unacceptable, please do not spend any of your hard earned  money with this establishment.  At least,  until the manager in question is terminated and employees and customers are no longer subjected to his innapropriate behaviors and practices."}
{"text":"Nothing special, ordinary. Price point meets product expectations. When asking about a seasonal beer I was answered with \"that is what white girls drink\". So, on that note, don't think I will be returning.  Being a local, I will make sure my circle of friends will not be going."}
{"text":"The BEST Meatballs. Awesome Cannolli  Thin crust pizza.  It is worth it.  Great prices.  A great \"hole in the wall\" Italian restaurant."}
{"text":"Great food good prices. Pizza takes awhile to make but it's AMAZING!!!!! Great service and easy to find"}
{"text":"Little Chicago is our go-to delivery pizza in our neighborhood.  We used to live upstairs from an awesome pizza joint in Boston and I was disappointed when we moved into our south Scottsdale neighborhood that there weren't any good pizza places close by or that delivered, but then we found Little Chicago.  Their pizza is thin crust (my fave) and has just the right amount of sauce, toppings, etc.  Their wings are good too and always have just the right amount of sauce and heat.  If it's Friday night and we don't want to cook or we're having people over and want to have pizza, Little Chicago gets our business every time :)  They are very prompt with delivery and their drivers are always friendly."}
{"text":"Wow, one of the best pizzas I've had in a looooong time and their fries are amazing . I got a 14 inch pepperoni and artichoke with garlic . Delicious . Happy hour and homemade meatballs. When I lived in Phoenix I drove by so many times  and go figure I finally try it when I'm an out of Towner. Great service . This is a hole in the wall gem , doesn't look like much from the outside but it's all about the pizza. It's clean and comfortable inside."}
{"text":"I've eaten here a couple times before and while it isn't the best pizza I have ever had it brings me back home. The owner is an extremely nice guy, assuming it's still the same owner and he is from my hometown where he had a pizza place that was one of my favorites.  Tonight for the first time in months I was just craving a little bit home after a few beers at my local hang out. I decided I would just roll over and wait for my pie to cook, I wasn't in a rush.   So I leave my local hangout around 8:15 and pull up to little chicago around 8:30 maybe. What? They are closed? The website told me they were open until 10. I must say I was rather disappointed.   I'm sure this won't prevent me from coming back sometime in the future and at that time maybe I can give a more accurate review. Hopefully the owner is reading this review and can explain the early close. What a bummer."}
{"text":"I'm a thin crust pizza lover so this place is right up my alley.  I'm usually a fan of Oreganos or Grimaldi pizza but this place is better than either of those places. They have the perfect mix of crispy crust, sauce, toppings and lots of cheese on the top!! The staff is just what you want in a local joint... good service and super friendly! We usually stick to just pizza but the calzones and pasta dishes look awesome if I can ever bring myself to deviate."}
{"text":"The food is always amazing. However when a delivery is incorrect, there is no accountability or apology. Tonight's error in delivery would of cost out family to have to use a $500 Epipen since our family has a reaction to mushrooms. Called to explain incorrect  pizza was delivered and we, the customer, was questioned whether we recieved the incorrect pizza.  No apology but was told they remake pizza that was ordered and paid for. 5 minutes later delivery man made a phone call apologizing that he grabbed the wrong pizza and new one was being made- he had no idea I had already called. Management should of handled the call and trusted their customer vs. delivery man having to call and apologize. Your management should take a lesson from your delivery man. No disappointment in food but lack of acknowledgment for incorrect delivery that would of cost our family a hefty medical bill."}
{"text":"This IS the best pizza place in town. I can't imagine a negative review. My favorite pizza is the Bulls pizza, i'm completely addicted. I highly recommend Little Chicago's Pizza. You can't beat their pizza, the quality, the price, it's most definitely the best pizza place in ALL of Scottsdale, Phoenix and Arizona as far as i'm concerned!   Good job, Little Chicago's! We LOVE you!!!"}
{"text":"Short version is: STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE IF YOU WANT PIZZA! On March 29, 2014 and being new to the area I drove past Little Chicago Pizza and decided to stop in because I grew up on both thin crust and thick crust \"Chicago\" style pizza. I ordered a \"double crust\" \"extra crispy\" extra cheese XL pizza to go. I took it home without opening up the box big mistake!  What I got was a completely blackened burnt to a crisp pizza with no evidence of a \"double crust\". I took one bite and threw it in the trash as i cannot eat something that tastes like burnt cardboard and cheese with zero flavor. It was terrible, honestly. To LCP credit I called and talked to Terra who identified herself as one of the owners and she said she would reverse the CC charge but I told her I would prefer she did not because it wasn't about getting a refund it was about one entrepreneur to another alerting her to what type of product was coming out of her kitchen. I even texted her photos of the pizza top and bottom so there could be no misunderstanding as to what the issue was.  Anyway nice convivial waitresses and concerned management but this has nothing to do with the product. This is not \"Chicago\" style thin crust. My experience underscores the value of reading reviews such as YELP.  Atlas C"}
{"text":"Awesome neighborhood joint. We're from the Northeast and this place does not disappoint when it comes to pizza and subs. The hot beef and chicken Caesar pita are legit. Great beer and wine selection. Clean. Not to mention, everyone that works there just could not be more welcoming and friendly in a really genuine way. We just moved down the street a few months ago and are excited we finally found our go-to!"}
{"text":"Very sad. Used to be the best. Now morons on the phone and an idiot that delivers. They're three blocks away and still deliver a cold. The quality has deteriorated over the past few months, too. I'm over little chicago!"}
{"text":"The food is fantastic. It really isn't Chicago style in the slightest, but it is quite delicious. Calzone might be my favorite thing.  I will say delivery times are a deal inconsistent."}
{"text":"Little Chicago Pizza is the best thin-crust pizza I think I've ever had. The restaurant is small, as they probably do most of their business carry-out or delivery.  We did eat in one time, and someone came right out from the kitchen to serve us, even filling our water cups from the soda fountain that was perfectly accessible for us to do ourselves.  Anywhere else I'd have expected a snotty \"the water is right there\" rather than real service.  Everybody is very friendly, even when on the phone taking orders.  Price is comparable to any other pizza spot around, but the pizza itself, if you like thin-crust, is just awesome.  Add in the great service and you have a solid pizza place for the south Scottsdale area."}
{"text":"I am a wing connoisseur. They have the best wings hands down in Scottsdale area. Jalape√±o honey and hot. Well done. Even beats Zips which is my second favorite.   Their thin crust pizza is a gem as well, can't compare the quality and taste to any other joint around. Hard working cooks and staff. Oh and their ranch is authentic ranch, not that kraft crap.  Our go-to joint for the last 5 years. Figured I should write a review after all this time."}
{"text":"I love this place!!  It is a little too pricey for me to go too often, though.  Sometimes I will go here when I feel like I deserve a nice night out.  I have never been to Chicago, but I have had plenty of Chicago style pizza.  This is my favorite Chicago style pizza out of all I've ever had.  I also saw an employee from here wearing their work shirt out at a place I worked at.   I told them that I love their pizza, and the man looked so happy that I said that.  You can tell the workers take pride in their pizza and appreciate their customers.  :)  There's nothing like the feeling of eating somewhere that you feel appreciated at.  I highly recommend trying this sometime. :)"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood pizza place. The italian beef pizza and sandwich are delicious. Everything I have ever ordered has been fantastic wings, cheese sticks, subs, pasta dishes. They never disappoint and their delivery is fast and friendly."}
{"text":"Best thin crust pizza in scottsdale! Hands down favorite is \"Bulls\" pizza. Sausage, pepperoni, bacon, and giardiniera peppers!!!"}
{"text":"This place rocks.. The jalape√±o honey wings are awesome , Katie was a fun server... Pizza is bomb"}
{"text":"This place has so much potential. Great spot to watch games. Good layout, lots of TVs, decent bar food. It is literally all ruined by the service. We have been multiple times and every time it is pulling teeth to get anything from your server, you wait 20 mins for a simple appetizer. It is literally a joke now when we go in on how long things will take. I have friends that won't come with us anymore. New ownership could really turn this place around."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. Twice were carry out and once to dine in. I love the pizza at this restaurant. It is like the type of thin crust pizza that you would find at neighborhood \"pizza joints\" in and around Chicago-land. The ambiance of the restaurant is also pleasant and reminds me of pizza places in Chicago. A lot of places around Arizona that are Chicago themed are too over the top with decor that they basically scream Chicago. Little Chicago is subtle but familiar to someone who was raised in Chicagoland. The only thing I did not like about the restaurant was the Italian beef sandwich. While living in Chicago I NEVER ate an Italian beef sandwich that had cheese on it! To me their Italian beef sandwich is more of a Philly Cheesesteak with thinner meat. Now that I've tried that I probably wouldn't get it again. I'd rather have an Italian beef sandwich from Portillo's which is right down the street at Tempe Marketplace.   All in all I would recommend this place, especially for the pizza."}
{"text":"This was a favorite of our years ago. Now that we are back in the neighborhood this will be a favorite again. Pizza is delicious and I just had a calzone from Little Chicago for the first time - delicious.  The dough was buttery, golden brown and the inside was soft,  doughy and divine. Must try. And they deliver!!"}
{"text":"Had the pizza here several times now and really love it! I usually go with the pep and sausage or just cheese. Love the thin crust, zesty and tangy sauce. Pizza dough is fresh and the crust is crispy. Young Female Staff Members are friendly, attentive and not hard on the eyes (always a bonus).  The personal Pan Pizza probably would leave a Big Hungry guy, desiring a bit more. Keep that in mind when ordering.  Never tried delivery but hear they can be a bit slow and that they can get busy.  Looking forward to trying some of the other menu items!"}
{"text":"Great thin crust pizza!  Both delivery and dine-in.  We love the ham, onions, & ricotta thin crust pizza.  It is always excellent!  I want to try their baked ziti."}
{"text":"Little Chicago's pizza has to be my favorite pizza/Italian joint....Hands Down! Since discovering them about a year ago I find it hard pressed to have anything comparable. Price for the 16\" pizza is really cheap, and the quality of the ingredients are outstanding. Cheap + Quality = everyone's dream. I love that their pizza is thin and crispy, it has never been delivered soggy or cold. If you order pizza with pepperoni they cook the pepperoni underneath the cheese so it's not such a holy greasy hot mess..  They say their delivery time is usually 45-60, but I've never found that to be true... They are faster.  Also your food comes with very tasty Parmesan side, that even tastes fresh. I would lastly like to mention that one time I ordered their turkey sub just for kicks and same thing, it was super fresh ingredients and amazing tasting.  I hope for everyone to share this place with their family and friends!"}
{"text":"This place is a little dive-y and not very special-looking from the outside, but don't judge a book by its cover!  My boyfriend gets wings from here about twice a week (not kidding, it's a little weird how often he eats wings) and they never disappoint. The wings are hands-down the best in the city! They're juicy, the sauce is delish, and they have lots of interesting options other than your run-of-the-mill bbq wings. Try the cajun-style, they're bomb.  Also, I have to say that the service here is impeccable! If you've read any of my other reviews you know that I'm a stickler for service at restaurants. You can have the best food on the planet, but if your service sucks you have nothing for me. The girls here who answer the phone and take orders are all so sweet! They're prompt, polite, and could work at any Michelin-star restaurant in my opinion.  I have had both the Bulls pizza and the White Sox pizza, and damn it's good! I'm a huuuuge pizza fan (then again, who isn't?) and these guys don't disappoint. If you like authentic Chigago-style thin crust, do not skip the pie here, it's perfection.  P.S. Their Yelp page says this place is good for dancing... Unless you want to dance to the sounds of the a Suns game in the background in the middle of a couple families staring at you in bewilderment, I don't recommend it as your next 'girls night out' dance spot."}
{"text":"We LOVE this pizza!! I cannot believe it took us this long to find it when we have lived here so long! Love love love. They bake the ingredients into the cheese. The crust is thin and crunchy and if you are a wing sauce person, do yourself a favor and order a side of it to go along with the pizza! Delicious!"}
{"text":"This is a great little neighborhood place. If you fancy a pizza or simple Italian pasta dish, go here. So far I have only gotten take out, but the staff was super nice when I did my pick up.  I got the spaghetti with meat sauce & a thin crust pizza. Both were solid. Spaghetti & pizza are comfort foods to me, & I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Little hole-in-the-wall pizza and sandwich place that reminds me of the way Scottsdale used to be before it went completely upscale. The pizza and meatball subs are delicious and reasonably priced and the staff is friendly. Definitely a great place to go and they even deliver if you live in the area.  Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"My all time favorite go to Pizza in Scottsdale.  My son will only eat pizza from here and loves the BBQ HONEY wings.  I love the Pizza COOKIE!  it is the BOMB  Nice people, great food, happy they deliver!"}
{"text":"I'm a neighborhood guy and dine here, get carry out or delivery rather frequently! Everyone and everything about this place is top notch!  Their sandwiches and pizzas are exceptional as are their pasta choices!  I'm especially fond of the baked ziti with meat sauce, very reminiscent of My Moms!  The fried zucchini is another favorite!  You really can't go wrong with anything on the menu!  Keep up the great food and service guys!  A major winner in my book!"}
{"text":"Little Chicago is next level, bottom line. As if ed sherin and Eminem collaborated on a song that didn't suck and was delicious."}
{"text":"We love this place! We order something different every time and we haven't had a miss yet. Well staffed too so service is always excellent. Highly recommend this neighborhood joint for really good food at good prices."}
{"text":"i just forgot about this place, but somehow i ordered the same exact meal that i had four plus years ago on my only other visit. The result was just like it was four years ago - very good sandwich and crispy crinkle cut fries. They have a bar, so it is also easy to grab a few drinks while waiting for your to-go order. The staff was very friendly and one of them told me to try the $3.50 cannoli and I took her advice. It wasn't an all-time great, but it did hit the spot after the main course. The item I need to try is the mozzarella sticks, which looked huge and cheesy. See you again."}
{"text":"Decided to review this place tonight because I went to another so called Chicago joint tonight. It was horrible and I got mad at myself for not going to a place where I know the food is excellent, the service is excellent, and the prices are reasonable. I have ordered many things from the menu and I have never been disappointed. Everything I have had is good, Calzones, wings, Italian beef, pizza, it's all amazing."}
{"text":"The best delivery pizza we have ever had.  We ordered the Italian Beef pizza and the Cubs (traditional combo) pizza.  We were going to go to a local favorite that we also love.  We have to go to the other place to pick up the pizza and it is always crowded.  I liked this pizza flavor better than the \"O\"ther place but the crust may be just a little more doughy at this place and not as crispy but still good and thin.  Then since this was a first time try, we decided to add 6 wings.  We ordered hot and well done as someone else said to get them done crispier.  We travel a lot and many nights we would prefer to stay in and now we finally found a GREAT pizza delivery place.  Can't wait to try more stuff from here, really curious about the spinach artichoke garlic pizza as once in a while I like a weird pizza."}
{"text":"They moved locations a while back. I like the new location as there is more space and the ambience is perfect to relax to enjoy some great wings and beer. The pizza is not bad by any means, not my favorite though. For sure try the fried ravioli and the wings. They have  jalape√±o hot as well as regular hot wings. Parking is okay, just watch for delivery drivers flying through the parking lot. Great for all ages. They have a couple tv's to watch sports. Servers are hit and miss. If you are looking for a low key place to eat and looking for some bar food while watching a game check it out. Waaaaay better then Buffalo Wild Wings!"}
{"text":"This review is only for two items on the menu, because they're both so delicious I never order anything else.   The regular salad with Italian dressing is wonderful: cold crisp lettuce with sliced cucumbers, tomatoes and black olives, topped with shredded mozzarella cheese. There's something wonderful in their Italian dressing and it's creamy with a kick of basil.  The true feature that draws me to Little Chicago is their calzones. They're just the right size, not the usual \"football\" size, and although they're filling, they're not gigantic.  Inside, a creamy blend of ricotta and mozzarella cheeses, and I add Italian sausage and pepperoni.  They brush the top with garlic butter which adds to the perfection of the calzone. Hot marinara sauce accompanies these Italian beauties, and believe me, there's not a better calzone in the Valley!"}
{"text":"This I will say: if delivery is your thing, this is your place. The pizza is pretty damned good for delivery pizza. Especially, if you're drinking (not that you need to be drinking to enjoy it, but it tastes awesome with \"a few\" behind you....far better than Pizza Hut, Dominos, etc. I went in one afternoon for a slice...not so awesome (I wasn't drinking, either). It's hard to get a fresh, hot slice here in Phoenix in the middle of the afternoon (unlike NYC, where it's incredible), but the cheese slice I had was slightly \"cardboardish\" in nature.  Still, a great delivery choice..."}
{"text":"i've never actually been inside little chicago, but i order from there often when i'm at work.  their delivery is prompt and usually friendly. there are a couple drivers that are kind of blah, but i guess it comes with the territory. they are FAST though, except the pizza obviously...it has to be baked.  i usually get the italian cold cuts sandiwch and it's by far one of my favorite sandwiches on the planet. nice and meaty, not too much lettuce and their sub dressing is just super duper. i finally got the pizza and it was cut square! i loved it even before i took a bite just for that. i'm really glad i didn't marvel too long at the lovely 90 degree angles of my lunch because that pizza is ridiculously tasty. i want to eat it all the time. but i don't think i could shove that AND that yummy sandwich in my mouth at the same time. well, i probably could, but it wouldn't be pretty.  if you haven't been or ordered from this place, do so. it's worth it."}
{"text":"Last order was terrible. $120 wasted.  Wings and chicken fingers  were burnt and cooked in old oil.  Pizzas were ok but not the same as before.  Not returning"}
{"text":"My husband and I love to go to family owned places. So we stopped in and we were greeted right away. The staff is very friendly and attentive. The food is great so needless to say we dine her at least once a week. Food is very good nice vereity to pick from the menu and wines."}
{"text":"This place is my new favorite spot..Its a little tiny restaurant with the best pizza!!!! The pizza is thin and crispy but not burnt or gross. It has tons of flavor! Will be back!"}
{"text":"Great pizza! We had the 12 inch everything and Cajun wings. Wings came out first, fairly quickly. Crispy and really well seasoned. My husband even asked for the recipe!  Service was great, she was the only person working but was very attentive. Pizza was light, thin, crispy and the sauced tasted homemade. We will go back again. The only downfall is the location. We live right by this place and it has been three other places before that (all of which were great, especially Burgers and Bottles).  Don't worry if its not too crowded, that means you'll get your pizza faster!"}
{"text":"Always great pizza. Friendly, fast service. This is my favorite thin crust in town. They deliver and have a nice dining area too. They serve beer and wine as well. The wings are always served hot!  Who likes cold wings? Not here!  Give them a try. You'll love it!!"}
{"text":"lately i've been living a double life. I've been hanging out my friend's pad in south scottsdale with the true intention of actually chilling before an hour's worth at the gym. It's like downtime after work and before gym, and double life? well I don't go home home until after the gym so technically i've been calling my friend's pad my defacto home w/o paying rent but I must digress before I ramble on how I feel about this situation. lol.   Anywho I have learned there are advantages of living in south Scottsdale, for one if you live in south scottsdale you have the luxury of being between two commercial powerhouses which are Tempe Marketplace and Scottsdale Fashion Square. You're in close proximity to two nightlife scenes (if you're into that), and that's Mill Ave and Old Town and lastly there's delivery by the name of Little Chicago Pizza.   This pizza joint holds its own compared to the other pizza places I have frequented like Joe's and Gus' Pizza in Old Town. So, I recently ordered delivery of which I found they do not deliver south of Curry so Score 1 since my friend lives at Miller and McKellips (the invisible border of Scottsdale/Tempe), menu items are moderately priced and the third best thing about LCP (Little Chicago Pizza) is the food, it's pretty good. So, ordered some cheese fries which were yummy, a six order of honey bbq wings and a 14 inch Hawks (chicken, bacon and bbq sauce) pizza. The bill came out to around $25, had plenty of leftovers and delivery was prompt. So, what am I saying about LCP, if you're looking for delivery and you're in the area, they're worth it and a good alternative if you're expanding your delivery options. =)"}
{"text":"Best thin crust pizza in this area! Sauce is amazing and honey jalape√±o wings are to die for! Always worth the wait"}
{"text":"This pizza place was awesome! Fast delivery on a Friday night and the house white pizza with artichokes and garlic was to die for. I have been craving it since the first time I had it. Will definitely order from them again and again!"}
{"text":"I found it, I really found it!  For the past two years, I've been looking for a solid thin crust pizza with green olives, doesn't sound like a huge feat, but it's been treacherous! I've found good pizza with no green olives, and green olives with terrible pizza, neither the combination I was looking for.  Little Chicago's finally did it, Crunchy crust, tangy sauce, real salty cheese, and green olives!  The prices are also pretty reasonable, you might pay 20 % more that Papa John's, but homemade sauce and crust is well worth it!"}
{"text":"Found my new favorite pizza joint and it's right around the corner. Ryan served us and he was very attentive even though the place was packed. We ordered 6 Jalape√±o Honey wings, Garlic Bread with Cheese and Thin Crust sausage and pepperoni pizza. Was delicious! Coming back for the pizza skillet when I'm not so stuffed! Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"On our last night in Scottsdale, we wanted nothing more than to have pizza delivered to our hotel room, drink some wine, and pack our suitcases in the most leisurely manner possible. Naturally we wanted to try something local to Scottsdale, so we did a little research and ended up giving Little Chicago a shot.  You know what? It was everything we needed in a pizza. Good balance of toppings (we went with canadian bacon, pineapple, and green olive - my favorite), just greasy enough without going overboard,  a thin but still substantial crust, and generously sized for the price. We ordered a large pizza for three girls and polished it off handily, though we probably would have been fine with a medium.  Was it earth-shatteringly delicious, ground-breaking pizza? No. But it sure was tasty, and I would probably order it again."}
{"text":"My review isn't necessarily health conscious, why should it be for a pizza joint, but I have yet to taste the pizza but thought this little place that I have passed by for years until last week deserves some praise and more business. Located across from Office Max,Starbucks and Subway, I decided to give it a shot. Automatically fell in love with the quality of their cold subs (I get the turkey/provolone) and whatever secret little sauce (not overwhelming but present) that they put with it. Good bread (which is why I no longer go to Subway because it's like eating ingredients stuck between two pieces of cardboard), good quality and friendly service. I'll have to try their pizza as well but will definitely be making my lunch runs here for the coming year instead of always going to Silver Mine or other nearby sandwich shops."}
{"text":"This is a nice little place right across the street from Lowe's.  The place is roomy and has plenty of seating areas.  We got the Cubs pizza and some hot wings.  The wings were delicious - they actually season the wings before frying and they were fried perfectly.  The pizza is the non-cracker thin crust type and cut into boxes.  The sauce is more sweet than I usually prefer.  I'd say the pizza is pretty average.  We also had a cannoli which was solid dessert fare.  All in all, I was super impressed by the wings but everything else was pretty average.  Don't get your expectations too high and you will have a good time."}
{"text":"Decent pizza, good delivery time.   My housemate (incidentally she's from Chicago) LOVES this place. I'd have maybe given it 4 stars, but I want fresher, better ingredients on my pizza, and for the price of delivery pizza, I want an experience that blows frozen pizza out of the water, which this doesn't, really."}
{"text":"Read all these great reviews so I figured I'd give the place a try. Called them and ordered a pizza, they told me that it would be about 45 minutes to no more than an hour. That was fine with me. What wasn't fine was that they called back after an hour and said sorry we don't deliver to there. I live 3.8 miles away..."}
{"text":"We got some takeout after reading some great reviews. We were not disappointed. It was so good! I ordered the calzone with Italian beef and salami. The cheese just oozed from the crispy crust and the meats were so tender and flavorful. My husband ordered the lasagna and it was just as wonderful. The sauce was so tasty. To top it all off, the customer service was on point. They were all so welcoming and friendly. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Small and cozy. Everything needed to transport me back to my childhood days of Chicago. Solidly good food and off the chart service and wonderful staff. What more do you want for a neighborhood joint? Well...they have delivery, big bonus. Certainly my new spot for beer, wings, thin crust pizza and Chicago hot dogs. Yes I ate all that in one seating."}
{"text":"Little Chicago Pizza does a good job at what they do.  They have a deal that includes two slices of cheese pizza and a soda for something like 4 bucks, and its tasty.  Its a little rough around the edges - for example there's no napkin dispenser, just a stack of paper towels - but that's what makes it 'Little Chicago'.  Slices are primarily for lunch and run out early in the evening, so don't expect to get any slices for dinner... however the pie prices aren't bad.  The last time I was there, I saw the philly steak and it was a monster!  There's limited seating, and its a little grungy, so its probably not the place you want to schedule your kids birthday party, but for any native Chicagoans here in the valley - go check it out.  The walls are painted with murals of the Chi-city, and the staff was extremely friendly."}
{"text":"The Jalape√±o and Honey wings has a flavor to it. It gets better and better every bite!  The Pizza we ordered was on point! The dough and the Cheese has a buttery flavor that melts right in your mouth. The staff were friendly and the place is very cozy. Its worth every penny you paid for."}
{"text":"Ordered a pizza and was delivered cold.. Called and notified management I was informed of could either get a new pie or I could get a credit for a future pie. Chose the credit. . Called tonight to get my replacement pie . I was told they had no record of our issue.  Extremely disappointed and won't be back.  I have purchased countless pies from this establishment."}
{"text":"We LOVE Little Chicago pizza!!! My boyfriend and I live in the area, and this restaurant has the best pizza for takeout/delivery, hands down! Our favorite to order when we need some pizza/wings for a movie night at home. :) The plus is that they have awesome wings- their not 'rip off' little chicken wings, they've got the perfect amount of sauce, and are a good size. Friendly staff, tasty food, delivery time is usually 45 mins-1 hour, but it's worth the wait! Little Chicago is highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Cutest lil chi place. Such good red sauce and the wings are so good done crispy. See courtney for details, she can help you build a custom pizza tailored to your likes. Also the underage looking bartender is of age and super cute."}
{"text":"Best delivery wings around! Seriously, I've never been able to order wings for delivery and have them not be soft or soggy. That is NOT the case here! I've ordered wings twice, and both times they have been excellent! I recommend hot wings, and order them well done for that extra finishing touch!  I can't wait to actually go there and try them fresh!"}
{"text":"I have ordered pizzas from this place for a couple of years now, closest thing to Chicago style out here. They don't quite hit it but they are close. The biggest problem with this place is getting them to answer the phone. They take it off the hook if they get to busy."}
{"text":"Great take out pizza ... Enjoyed sausage and mushroom on a thin crust. Good Sauce. Better sausage. Yummy!"}
{"text":"I love this place. I really enjoy their pizza and their Italian Beef sandwich is incredible. Great service and good people work there. I definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza, if only I lived closer so they would deliver to my house. I have no idea why it's called Chicago style since it's NY style crust , but either way it's great pizza.."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza i have had since i moved here 2 yrs ago thin crust and NOT a  soggy over cheesed like so many pizza joints do. also well priced. I have had there club sandwich which is also delicious as well as a few of there pasta dishes which are good and they deliver"}
{"text":"Still waiting for our correct order after 45 minutes... they got it wrong.... never offered even a bread stick for their mistake....."}
{"text":"Great local find--FANTASTIC service!  A great lunch experience, had the chicago beef with peppers and onions, mozarella and it was delicious.  We just moved offices across the street, we will definitely make this a regular go-to lunch spot."}
{"text":"The pizza is thin and flavorful, and the sauce is really good. The salad is good, too, but the large isn't a very ample portion.  We prefer to take out rather than dine in but do frequent this location about once a month."}
{"text":"Best pizza I've had outside of my hometown of Chicago. Thin crust like all Chicago pizza was before Uno's made the world think Chicago pizza was all deep dish. Great sauce. Excellent sausage (not too spicy). Great service. Clean, bright place with very good service. It's 25 minutes from where I live, but I expect to happily make the trip often."}
{"text":"Ordered wings and a gyro a week ago. I am am from Chicago. This place is good! Had the garlic cheese bread too....good red sauce! Gonna try the pizza next time....overall a win"}
{"text":"What a delightful surprise !  We ordered take out not expecting much.  We got home and WOW--BOTH the PIZZA and the WINGS were  A+++   I was also really impressed with the ranch dressing and \"to go\" packages of Parmesan Cheese and Red Pepper Flakes (that was a value add) I cannot wait to order from here again---and feel lucky that they are not far from my townhome ---YUMMY  !"}
{"text":"Ok so once again we found ourselves at Little Chicago it is so convenient and everything so far has been great but last nights visit was exceptional not only the food but the service was great! Our server was Meghan she was fantastic explained al on the menu made our choose easy, we ordered one of each. Meghan made the whole experience! We will go back to see her soon!!"}
{"text":"Help them please!!  I should not have my hopes up for Arizona in the first place since this state has arguably the worst selection of dinning in the United States. I have been a Pizza fanatic most of my life and let me tell you that when something is wrong you can taste it! First of all I have been to chicago several times and had the pleasure of eating a real chicago style pizza. Let me break it down to all of you. I ordered a thin crust since that was all they had, but I was expecting a Deep Dish selection since that is the Chicago signature dish. Little Chicago had only one selection of pizza. I felt bad for them. The Sauce was salty (New York Style) and the difference between chicago style sauces is that the sauces are always sweet. Not Little Chicago. The thin crust dough was bland. Most Chicagoans use cornmeal in the crust. Probably on of the worst tasting paper crust that I have ever tried to eat. The cheese was burnt on top and mush underneath. I don't know who is running this place, but its a good place to go if your drunk and have no passion for flavor. Worst Pizza In Arizona next to Rosati's. I hope they change their menu or close down soon better, yet change the damn name because this is not Chicago style pizza!!!"}
{"text":"I am a native Phoenician; however, my family is from Chicago, and I have managed to venture there many, many times and enjoy many, many pizzas over there.  I don't have a negative opinion of this place, but I do see some need for improvement.    After a rehearsal, my famished bandmates and I were deliberating over what kind of food we should order to the rehearsal house.  I had lived in the vicinity of Little Chicago Pizza for 4 months but never tried it, so when one of my bandmates suggested it, I was quite interested.  We checked the website... broken link to specials, but alas the menu link worked.  When I saw that they specialized in Chi-town style thin crust pizza, I was sold.  We ordered a large cheese pizza, the measure by which all pizza can be measured.   Open first bite, I noticed the familiar flavor of Chi-town, but then that ride was over.  The sauce was rubbish of the first order, and there was too much, so I don't know what Albert H. was smoking because sweet and tangy it may be, the sauce tasted nearly identical to the sauce you get in an Oscar Mayer's Lunchable cracker pizza... no lies.  The rest of the pizza was well done, especially the cheese, so implore the owners of this place to fix that and I will give them 4 stars.    If they can make the crust a little bit thinner too, 5 stars... It was thin, but not as thin as it is in Chicago.  As of now, Spinato's and Oregano's thin crust is more legit, but these simple changes I have suggested would topple them over and give Little Chicago Pizza the crown."}
{"text":"It could be the sauce. No, maybe the crust. The cheese? The way they tuck pepperoni underneath? Whatever it is, these guys make one fantastic pie. The pizza at Little Chicago is always fresh in a way that you can almost taste each of the distinct ingredients. I've had the pepperoni and the pineapple on many various occasions and have always left happy.   The pizzas are thin crust, divided into squares. (If you're looking for deep dish, this is not the place.) I'm usually ok splitting a medium size but always want more. You know how sometimes pizza can make you TOO full? This place does it just right.  The shop is small, with a couple of tables, self service drinks and a TV. Even though we often take our orders to-go, they have great customer service and are always willing to accommodate us when we dine in. They'll refill drinks, bring out plates and everything.  All around excellent pizza in a tucked away dive in south Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Great food for very readable prices. Their calzones are amazing as their pizzas. The place attracts many locals from around and its very normal to walk in to a full house on a Tuesday Night."}
{"text":"AMAZING PIZZA!! The perfect balance of sauce and cheese plus the crust is delicious and crispy. Great service and always an enjoyable visit."}
{"text":"Ahhhh so I love little Chicago; pizza is great pasta is great but why can't you remember my ranch! We ordered delivery tonight and after the food got here and delivery guy left we opened the bags and low and behold no ranch. First thought that comes to my head, I'm doomed. What do I do, I can't eat this now cause the ranch from LC is so good. So we call them and they say, oh no biggy we can give you a credit for the ranch. Ahhhhggg I don't want that $1 credit I want my ranch. Now I'm sitting here on the couch hangry (it's a real thing and the struggle is real) still no ranch 30 minutes later."}
{"text":"Disappointed.  Cashier/host not very friendly. Went in on Friday around 7:40. Placed looked like we just missed the rush.  Ordered a large veggie pizza. Told it would take 25 min. Which was fine. Left and came back was told about another 10.  Waited about 15 more asked if it was ready and was told pizza just got put in the oven. What??? Seriously??? Finally after over an hour and 10 min. we got our pizza. Lady, possibly manager gave us a free 2 liter for the wait. Pizza was good, however due to the service and wait more than likely won't be back."}
{"text":"I do not want to under rate by putting too few stars, but if I were going to, I would give a single star.  When I first started ordering here we always had our pizza on time or in less time than stated.  The one previous time they lost my order they gave it to us for free due to the inconvenience.  Lately the phone service has suffered and pizzas getting later and later.  Last time I ordered they called me an hour later and said they had lost my order again.  They were going to give a 10% discount.  I called back a few minutes later and said to skip it in disgust.  This is the best pizza since New York Pizza on Flamingo Rd in Las Vegas back in the 80s, but the service just ruins it!  Charging extra to swap ingredients is sad and forgetting someone's order for an hour is even worse!!!"}
{"text":"I have been missing a good thin crust pizza from back home and was excited to try this place. Placed and order for pickup and wasnt expecting the lack of interaction and friendliness. The waitress was making comments about tables already having their menus and the register person should was stone faced. For a first time experience just picking up , i didnt think it would be so hard for a smile or thank you. The delivery driver who had just come back grabbed my pizza while I was paying and he was pleasant.   Moving on to the pizza... it was ok and average. The sauce is on the sweeter side. Maybe should have asked for extra cheese like some of the previous reviewers. The crust was very thin where the pizza wasnt holding up to eat with one topping. The jalapenos were nice and spicy which was awesome! There were a ton of jalapenos and very little pepperoni  on the side which didnt have jalapenos.   Totally bummed because that means still need to search for a decent thin crust worthy of a Chicago name. Tried the garlic bread and it was not exciting. Just average and small for the price. I would not recommend the bread.   I might try them again with maybe the double dough or extra cheese to see if that's better... the service though makes me hesitate"}
{"text":"Haven't had anything on the menu that we didn't like. Great with deliveries, pleasing staff, the delivery guy even knew us by name after our third order haha. Gotta try it."}
{"text":"Good attempt, the wings weren't flavorful and the pizza crust not what I like but I don't know if they have any other type of crust, ordered over the phone there website menu wasn't working, but when I went pick up not a greeting to be heard, I waited probably 5 minutes a couple of waitresses just walked on by then the person at the bar offered a drink while I waited. If I try it again I hope it is better."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place for pizza delivery. They offer a nice thin crust that's not greasy and a sauce that tastes great. The jalapeno honey wings are excellent. Don't be scared of the \"jalapeno\" part. They are not hot at all. Just sweet and sticky!"}
{"text":"After reading a Huffpost article about pizza I decided today was the day to get delivery pizza at the office.  Got a few others to go in with me and called as soon as they opened at 11am.  I ordered and was given a window of around 45 minutes for delivery.  The pizza arrived in 30 minutes, was still perfectly warm and just as delicious as I remember. Cheap, fast and delicious.  You can't find anyone better than Little Chicago."}

{"text":"What do you do when you have $9.00 chicken breasts that need to be cooked, but it's too hot to cook inside and too hot to cook outside?  Look for cheap take-out since you've already thrown $9 away.  Pizza turned into pasta, and Little Chicago fit the bill.  I had chicken parmigiana which came with a side of spaghetti and garlic bread.  The dish was nothing out of the ordinary, but it was well prepared and enjoyable.  Certainly something you could make at home if it wasn't so dang hot, but that's what I liked about it.  Pasta dishes come in two sizes.  Order the small unless your closet is well-stocked with stretchable fabrics.  It's more than enough for even a big appetite.  And at just over $23 for 2 dinners, appetizer, and 2-liter bottle of soda, I didn't feel so bad about the chicken...only that he died without realizing his potential."}
{"text":"Tastes like one of my favorite joints growing up on the south side of Chicago.  The service was great, very friendly staff.  They also have Eli's cheesecake.  One of the better Chicago pies in AZ and I've been searching for a long, long time."}
{"text":"We tried this place last week.  Not really fans of Chicago style pizza, but it's close to our house.  We were pleasantly surprised.  Our service was fast and friendly (Zoey).  We ordered the fried zucchini, it was very hot, fresh and tasty.  We also ordered a thin crust pizza.  It was quite good and we were happy with our dinner, the service, cost and taste.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Well, being from Chicago, I will have to admit that this place is pretty darn tasty.  Thin crust Chicago is the way to go here.  The sausage is perfect, reminds me from home, and the sauce is sweet, which I am a fan of.  Almost reminds me of Aurelio's.  The hod dog is decent, and the Italian beef was just OK.  Luke's is still the place to go for beef.    Anyhoo, they are really nice people, and delivery was pretty quick.  5 stars for the pizza and friendliness."}
{"text":"The food is usually good. There is no doubt about it. It's worth it. But the wait is ridiculous. I places a go order. They said 20 minutes. I was ok. I got there 25 minutes after my order was placed. They said 10 more minutes. So I waited patiently. Another 20 minutes before someone let me know they were checking on my order. I think they forgot to place it because people showed and got their food before me. It's pizza. It does not take 55 min to make one. For this reason I am not giving more than 3 stars."}
{"text":"tasty good hand tossed pizza.  Also had the chicken alfredo pasta and enjoyed it."}
{"text":"I've been looking for good pizza in Scottsdale for a long time, we finally found it.  Funny that this place is located less than a 1/2 mile from our house but we never tried it.  Toppings were great, sauce was spiced perfectly and wasn't too sweet, perfect cheese to crust/sauce ratio, and a crisp, think crust..  Cooked perfectly - we asked for well done and we got it nice and bubbly brown on the top.   Delivery was on time and super polite.  All the way around a job well done - we'll be back."}
{"text":"This place rocks. They're 10 in pizzas are delicious. Nice and crispy bottom and melty cheese. They do not skimp on the toppings. Even their house salad is a nice size. I've taken several people there and they like it too. I will continue to go to this restaurant."}
{"text":"I really like their pizza. Although, the calzone and spaghetti is very good too. It's tough to find anything wrong with the menu. Everything I've eaten here is good."}
{"text":"Tried out the Italian Beef pizza and it was delish!  Also ordered some hot wings and they are good but make sure and ask for extra crispy.  Not soggy by any means but I would prefer a bit more crunch.  All in all it was great and delivery was here in about 30 mins!"}
{"text":"Pizza and wings taste so much better after their interior remodel.  Delish!  Yep says the review is too short, here's more of the same.   Pizza and wings taste so much better after their interior remodel.  Delish!   Pizza and wings taste so much better after their interior remodel.  Delish!"}
{"text":"This place is one of the best Italian restaurants I've dined at. It's all about the food!  The first time I went there I ordered fried zucchini for an appetizer. The breading they use is so delicious! Not breaded too much and the zucchini is cut thick and has amazing fresh flavor. I also ordered the \"Chicago\" pizza. Thin crust loaded with the works. Delicious! My friend ordered fried cheese ravioli and the kids had spaghetti! I sampled both! The marinara sauce that came with the fried ravioli was very flavorful and the spaghetti sauce was divine! After that night I craved it two days later! I had my boyfriend meet me there for dinner! We ordered fried zucchini, of course, chicken parmesan, and a sausage pepperoni calzone! OMG to die for! The chicken was cooked perfectly, breaded with delicious breading, amazing sauce and came with a side of spaghetti and garlic bread! The calzone tasted so fresh and cheesy and the side of marinara topped it off perfectly! My boyfriend lived in Chicago for 4 years and said the food tasted really good and was just like Chicago! We left full and with left overs! I never eat the left overs but I definitely did this time! The ambiance of the restaurant is ok. Plenty of seating and a bar. Small flat screen TVs through out. I don't mind the ambiance though. I'm there to eat, not be entertained or distracted by decor and sports. This place also has take out! I will be back very soon!"}
{"text":"Last night, I was heading from Chandler to Scottsdale, so I decided to pick up some dinner on the way, and after looking around on Yelp, decided to give Little Chicago Pizza a try.  I ordered a large Chicago Sky (no sauce, ricotta, artichoke hearts, etc) and a large pie with gyro meat and feta.  I also ordered an antipasto salad (damn gluten intolerant sister), all to go.  And I asked for it to be ready at 6:15.  I walked in about 6:10, paid the bill and sure enough, 5 minutes later was handed a to go salad and a large pie.  Huh? I ordered 2 pizzas.  I opened the box and found that what I had gotten was a large Chicago Sky with gyro meat and feta added.  I explained the error and the staff there quickly told me they'd remake what I had ordered.  When I prepared to pay the difference, they refused, offered me a soda while I waited, and they even insisted I take the erroneous pie as well.    As much as we may wish otherwise, in the real world, mistakes happen.  But I can only wish that everyone handled mistakes as well and graciously as Little Chicago did.  About 15 minutes later, the right pies came out and I was off.  The pizza was excellent.  Thin and crispy and really garlicky which was perfect with the toppings I ordered.  Definitely not what most people will think of when they think of \"Chicago-style\" pizza, but a great example of the thin crust style.  Cut in squares as it should be.  Fortunately this place is only a couple of minutes from my work.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Please take out the Chicago in you name. Just call it little pizza. It is not good. And neither is your Italian Beef. It was not good quality, thick and dry on a not fresh roll. You are not a good representative of Chicago style foods."}
{"text":"they no longer deliver...in room dining only.  Not going to patronize until they deliver again.  Just ridiculous they don't deliver.  What are they trying to do?"}
{"text":"They recently moved and I was afraid it would change the experience... it did, it is even better now.  We had calzones, pasta and mozzarella sticks.  They were all fantastic.  The staff is very friendly and attentive.  The space is bigger now so they can serve even more people."}
{"text":"Had wings, fried pickles, and garlic bread. Everything was EXCELLENT!! can't wait to come back and try the pizza. Great prices, too!!"}
{"text":"Pizza would be okay if it wasn't for their awful sauce. Who puts a sweet marinara on pizza? Gross in my opinion.  Besides the sweet sauce this place has HORRIBLE customer service. We called 30 minutes before closing and they REFUSED to deliver. And when you do call in time to get delivery it is takes forever! Do yourself a favor and skip this place!!"}
{"text":"Wasn't really ready to be put on the spot here BUT Little Chicago's may just be the best pizza ever. The service is awesome too and our delivery driver Travis was super friendly. I think I've said enough at this point! Thanks LCP!"}
{"text":"Coming from a native Illinoisian...... Simply the BEST pizza in the Valley.... My one & only to go place for pizza!! Nuff said!!!!"}
{"text":"\"The boss is back! So I took a one-year hiatus Ain't nobody heard my latest\" - sir mix alot  That's right I am back to review pizza.  So this little Ma & Pa serves up some of the best Chicago thin crust pizza in south Scottsdale.  Oregano's should try and copy this its so good.     This place is not much to look at but you get great food served up by locals and not a chain.  If you live in south Scottsdale order a delivery and let me know what you think.  You can even get giardiniera as a topping.  mmm, mmm, good!!!  I really enjoy their eggplant parm dinners.  They have a Famous Eggplant Parmigiana Casserole that is awesome.   The owners work there and the pizza quality is reflected by their hard work.  This isn't some schmuck making your pizza.  The owner made it and he wants you to come back.  enjoy!!!"}
{"text":"Noooooo this is my nightmare!!! The delivery boy must have taken a rough turn  So sad."}
{"text":"Best. Pizza. Ever. I frequent Little Chicago's weekly. I recommend the pepperoni pizza, add ricotta if you know what's good for you. I also got the wings dry with mild sauce on the side and the small Caesar salad, all of which are tasty. Draft beer selection could be more expansive. Service is always great. Love having this place in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Very nice service, you can see the cooks doing thier job from the bar, and they did an excellent job at that!.  I had perfect hot wings and my friend ordered a thin crust bvq chicken pizza which was on point. They play football on thier flat screens making it one of my New favorite spot for beer, football and wings!"}
{"text":"I checked this place out because of the reviews, but, I really wasn't impressed with the pizza. It lacked taste and zest. Being a Chicago pizza joint I was expecting a deep dish style pizza and it was complete opposite. Wasn't the worse pizza but wasn't the best."}
{"text":"I keep coming back the pizza and jalape√±o honey wings are awesome and order the pizza cookie"}
{"text":"Little Chicago Pizza ROCKS , It's not just the best Italian in south Scottsdale it's the best in the Valley of the Sun . Pizza , Pasta , Wings Everything they do is outstanding. Super friendly staff , great service and delivery, very reasonable prices and a super clean restaurant  My family and friends eat there often. We are happy to have em in our neighborhood. They are great neighbors and a  real asset."}
{"text":"The food is good, not \"cuisine\", but good.  The staff is very friendly.  Orders are ready when they promise, and always quite hot.  Nice place to to dine in too.  Newly remodeled, and always clean and bright.  We've had quite a few of the items on the menu and have never been disappointed.  I love their antipasto!    A friend told us about this place, and we went with him and some other friends.  He loves the wings, but we haven't tried those, everyone who has seems to really like them.  He isn't a gourmet, but he told us everything on the menu is good.  So far, he's absolutely right."}
{"text":"Called to order about 15 mins before they close and was told they are closed. Unbelievable. Was told by the guy who answered the phone \"we are now closed.\" I said \"really? It's 15 mins until you are officially closed according to your website.\" Then he said \"sorry, my manager just told me we are closed now. Sorry\". I decided I will never try this place due to the untrustworthy staff. The way they handled me calling shows just how lazy they are. They could have been honest but instead they chose to lie. No thanks. Will try out another pizza place."}
{"text":"Really good authentic styled chicago thin crust pizza. Chicago is known for its deep dish but if your from chicago you know thin crust has its own following in the Chi. This is as close to a the real thing you will find outside of the windy city. Is everything going to be 100 all the time? No, there are individuals under the age of 25 working there that have never been to chicago. However they know the receipt and I haven't had a bad pizza from them yet."}
{"text":"stopped in today for the first time - new to the neighborhood and drove by several times.  I asked Dawn for some carryout/delivery menus for me and neighbors, and decided to order carryout lunch; she recommended the Italian Beef with au jus.   I took it home and everything was perfectly delicious; the sandwich was stuffed with quality beef on a good sub roll, good au jus, fries packed in a separate styrofoam box and still hot, with catsup and a very good deli dill pickle. Really looking forward to ordering a pizza delivery.  The owner is the chef, and that is always a good thing"}
{"text":"Best local pizza place! The dine in experience was great with a nice staff and quick service. The thin crust pizza was awesome and the calzones are thick and packed full of cheese. I will go there again for sure or order in sometime because with that good of pizza at lower then most prices, so worth it."}
{"text":"One of my favorite dives in all of Phx metro.   Pizza is amazing.   The homemade chees esticks could be the best I have ever had.    Also the Italian beef is solid."}
{"text":"Great pizza and sauce.  My boyfriend says they have the best cannolis on the west coast.  Wings were huge and hot when we got them, but the sauce didn't stick too well so you have to dip them in the pool at the bottom of the container.  No problem, though, since I like my wings messy.  Only a 30-40 minute wait on a busy Friday night.  Great prices, too.  Definitely the best delivery place in southern Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Like the idea of being out of Scottsdale but the food wasn't as good as I expected. Pizza was great for the first bite, then seemed to be a bit sweet with each bite. Wings felt a bit dry for my taste but giving it a try is worth the experience!"}
{"text":"I tried this place about a week ago and had a slice of pizza and an Italian beef sandwich and both were very, very good. I have been to Chicago numerous times and thought that the sandwich and pizza were spot on. Portillo's is what I measure Italian beef by and this was sooooo close. I ordered a whole pie a couple of days later and it was equally fantastic. I am worried that this place might go out of biz because of its location. I sure hope not because SoDale needs a spot like this. Definitely worth trying."}
{"text":"One of our go-to pizza places in the neighborhood.  The mushroom jalape√±o is excellent, really enjoy the Hawks with pineapple added, and love the cheese bread special on Thursday.  Not the best pizza ever but definitely a solid option, especially in South Scottsdale which lacks great pizza options."}
{"text":"Went to the new restaurant, corner of McDowell and Hayden. Had their awesome thin crust pizza with veggies and a Caesar salad, split an order of hot wings three ways. Came to $40 including a round of beers. Of course. Same great food. Great peppy polite staff. And you don't have to wrestle for one of the three tables any more. Or eat on a picnic table. Its a nice little place with ample seating. Great wings, did I say that? I would eat them in if you can because when they deliver them, the foil makes em soggy. So don't be lazy, get up and drive over there. It's a big dining room! But they do deliver on those \"bad hair days\" and everything is good, just order early they don't do that Dominoes 30 minute deal.   Did I say great wings? Cold beer? Awesome pizza? Good."}
{"text":"See my reviews on the new location."}
{"text":"Really good pizza. The cheese and sauce have that authentic Chicago flavor. Mushroom and  Black Olive pizza, would definitely order again. Thin crust, square cuts, great tasting. Have a great selection of Chicago style foods, reminds me of my childhood in Chicago."}
{"text":"This is a new found spot! Pizza was AMAZING!! Yummy little hole in the wall with kind (but not corny) service. 9.75/10 for not having subtitles on the TV, but the manager did try!"}
{"text":"This place is the best delivery pizza in Arizona, people will say well it's not Pizzeria Bianco but I also don't want to wait three fucking hours to eat a pizza. The pizza here is killer, thin crust and great topping options. On top of this their pasta, sandwiches, and appetizers are also amazing. No delivery pizza joint has good pasta choices except Little Chicago. I mean even their chicken strips and French fries are bomb, what am eight years old, but yes they too are amazing. Delivery is always prompt and service always friendly.   On a side note they do have seating and serve beer and wine, place is small and nothing fancy but it is clean and the reason I go is for the food."}
{"text":"This place is delicious and fresh. Great Customer service and will definately be back............................................."}
{"text":"I really like this place. The antipasto salad is really good. The mushroom and cheese pizza is SO flavorful. The service could be better. We called in an order for pick up, got there and our order wasn't ready, waited 30min. And was then told they hadn't started on our order yet. We ordered a medium pizza at wings. They told us our order was ready and tried given us an order of 50wings (not our order). Waited another 15min for our order. Ugh!  We haven't been back since because of that service experience. It's a bummer because the food is really good."}
{"text":"Some nights you just want a beer and a pizza, and this is the place to go then. The service was good, we could watch the game while we ate and the pizza and fries were cooked perfectly! Their marinara sauce is awesome! I didn't know they delivered but it was worth it to just go sit there and have a nice evening. Their thin crust is thick enough to taste. Totally worth it!"}
{"text":"It's all about the bread.  I work at an office building next door to this restaurant and it's become my regular pit stop for take out on Friday evenings.  I've ordered all of their hot and cold subs multiple times by now and they're all good; my favorites being Italian Cold Cuts, Meatball, and Eggplant Parmigiana. The Italian Cold Cuts has the standard variety of good quality meats and cheese, proper balance between meats and veggies, with just enough dressing that's not too strong or acidic so you can still taste the other ingredients. The hot subs, especially the Meatball, have a generous amount of the main ingredient with tomato sauce that's just the way I like it and plenty of good quality melted cheese.  After having visited here several times I began to think about why I like their sandwiches so much and I realized that, as much as anything else, it's the simple fact that they use decent sub rolls. On a side note, it's amazing to me how popular some sub sandwich franchises have become with clientele who apparently don't know what a decent sub roll should be. So, what in my opinion is a decent sub roll? It's one that's fresh, tasty its own without additional seasoning, and just chewy enough to add the right consistency and feel without being too limp and soggy or too firm to cause the meats and fixings to squish out when you bite down. This is not to say that the sub rolls at Little Chicago are necessarily the best artisan bread you've every tasted. Never the less, it's just nice to have a really good sub on a decent roll. By the way, they DO NOT ask you if you want white or wheat when you order a sandwich; thank goodness for that as well.  I expect I will continue to be quite content for a while with cycling through the list of subs on their menu and will eventually give their pasta dishes a try."}
{"text":"I just found my go-to delivery pizza! As if I didn't already love Little Chicago Pizza enough, I decided to give its Chicago Beef Pizza a try.   If you grew up near Chicago, and love Italian Beef, then this is your pizza! The thin crust pie is topped with Italian Beef, Sweet Peppers, Onions, and Giardiniera. It's literally the sandwich with cheese and tomato sauce instead of au jus. The small 12\" is just $13.25. I was only planning on having half and saving the rest for later. Instead, I ate the whole thing while watching football.   Da Bears are playing this Thursday night. If I don't go out to watch the game, I may be ordering this again."}
{"text":"All of LC food is great!  I take out more than it eat in, and it's always great tasting and prepared correctly.  The fried zucchini is quite good, as well as pizza, calzones and pasta.  Very nice and friendly staff to boot.  Bin appetito!"}
{"text":"Definitely 1 of my go to spots for pizza in the area; its delicious and restaurant has a good Chicago style to it.  Have only been there twice and both times were pick ups not dine in but they seem to have a good atmosphere and good people working there I definitely would recommend it."}
{"text":"This place is the closest I've got to Chicago style pizza! I've lived out here for almost 6 years and have not experienced Chicago style anywhere. My Dad, whom currently still lives in Chicago and comes here often, agrees!!! What a relief! Best part is they're right down the street and could even deliver. Not to mention their chicken wings are mouth watering. Staff is very friendly and professional."}
{"text":"Being from the northeast, I must admit that I'm a pizza snob, but Little Chicago Pizza did not disappoint.    Their pizza is just down right good and exceeded my expectations by all means!  The pizza had such a fresh taste to it.  The pizza sauce is super tasty and they use good quality cheese.  I also tried the wings and they were OK.  In terms of service, I ordered delivery and was quoted a delivery time of 35-40 mins but it arrived within 20 minutes.  So far, this is the best delivery pizza I've tasted in the area.  Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"I suggest 'the bears' pizza. Been ordering delivery from lcp for almost 10 years, they have never let me down. Delivery is usually faster than promised, maybe only complaint, when they are busy, dont order fries or zucchini it cools quickly! But at their best, the zucc was still deep fryer hot. Note to all.. tip your delivery person!"}
{"text":"Wow unexpectedly delicious!  Get the fried ravioli. That sh*t is no joke. Wings were delicious as well - and usually if they come from a pizza place they're not anything special.   Got the garlic artichoke spinach ricotta pizza and added red sauce. I'm from NY so I feel like I have justified pizza reviews...this was the best pizza I've had in Scottsdale. Better than Grimaldis which is over priced in my opinion. LC is super reasonable.   My only critique is as being from out of town and never having been to Chicago I thought \"this will be Chicago style and deep dish\" and they don't really explain it on the website thoroughly. They have pizzas, Chicago thin crust pizza (which sounds like an oxymoron in my opinion), and specialty pizza. I assumed specialty pizza would be deep dish. It was thin crust but hey it was still delicious so I'm not gonna knock a star off."}
{"text":"My first visit to Little Chicago. Staff is friendly and their calzones are delicious. Normally I am very good with portion control, but I couldn't help myself and I ate almost the entire thing. Great place for a casual lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"omg really good pizza the crust was thin and very tasty no soggy crust the sauce was excellent we also had the cheesy garlic bread and cannolis  very yummy i wish they delivered to Tempe but they have fast friendly service inside"}
{"text":"Great place I work across the street  I love the pizza sauce the calzones are great pizza is good what Else to say great spot"}
{"text":"After all the great reviews and it being independently operated I thought what I would get would be 5 star review worthy.  My pizza didn't arrive on time. Period. It was  actually 20 mins late precisely. I kindly brought my issue to the driver and he called to ask if I could have my pie in the house for it being late. They declined. After his quick call he nonchalantly shrugs his shoulders and says \"well it's my money anyways.\"  Excuse me? You're just the middleman.  I call little Chicago to inform them that their driver had insisted a rude tone with me. They apologized.   So now we lead up to today when I try to get my reimbursement pizza which the manager said I could have; until she spoke with her driver who says of course he wasn't rude or made a comment.   Let me just say that in the business world, especially food, you don't take the word of your grungy pizza driver over a potential usual customer, or any customer at that. The real loss is for you, little Chicago pizza. I will not spend money there, or attempt to in my case. And sorry if I offended any usuals, but what the manager said to me was outrageous. Her name is Adeena.   If you're ordering from little Chicago pizza, beware and good luck."}
{"text":"Kind of weird to say I DIDN'T really wanna like the pizza here, but I actually did (as did my family).  I guess this place isn't actually \"new,\" but used to be located someplace else and moved into this space. My parents live pretty close by so we decided to give it a shot (when this location was a teriyaki restaurant we ordered from here quite often). Even though there's a few pizza places close by (that aren't necessarily great, but reasonably priced) we wanted to see if Little Chicago should be added to the rotation.  It's a little pricier compared to Rome's, which is right around the corner (and not bad), but I think the pizza here is better. We got two 14'' pizzas (one cheese and one half mushroom/half sausage). I'm not well-versed in Chicago-style pizza, but my understanding is that it's usually deep-dish. Well, Little Chicago does thin slice, and the the slices are cut into squares, which I kind of like.   I can't really put my finger on WHY I think there pizza is a slight notch above other pizza places in the area, but it just is. The cheese and toppings tasted fresh (I like that the mushrooms were good sized chunks and not just little shriveled up pieces) and the cheese to sauce ratio was good.   We got take out and it was pretty quick (about 15 min). The place itself is kind of weird, but seems nice."}
{"text":"My fiancee is going to be EXTREMELY upset. I came here sort of by accident, but if it worked out, how can I complain?  My first Chicago-style food experience was in a small hidden place in Tucson during my undergrad years. My fiancee and I went every Wednesday for wings. Having moved away from Tucson, we have been constantly searching for similar style food.  I just found it, and my fiancee is all the way in Taiwan right now.  For me, one of the particularly unique and amazing Chicago-style dishes are their hot wings. They don't use the boring old \"Frank's Hot Sauce\", they have their own proprietary blend that seems to have the perfect blend of spicy and savoriness. While most places use 100% Frank's, which is a little too vinegary for me, this place has their own unique style. Seriously, their wings are really good.  Wings are no good without pizza, so I ordered a slice of cheese pizza too. Again, very unique pizza. The crust was extremely unorthodox, giving the pizza a \"new-car feel\" to it. The sauce was also a bit on the sweet side, but overall, everything played out in perfect harmony.  To top off some really good food, the service is really nice as well. Very helpful people over here that genuinely care if you enjoyed your meal.  I'm really excited to go back and try some of their other food. I seriously can't tell you how excited I am that I found this place. Life is going to be much better now."}
{"text":"Great thin crust pizza, we tried pepperoni with mushrooms and jalape√±os with extra cheese. Crust was thin and crispy made perfect with best pizza sauce and side of fries"}
{"text":"This place was absolutely the best! Hands down to the BEST WINGS ever!!! We got the 6 hot the sauce is just too lick the plate for. The pizza had a nice thin crust we got a 12 inch with like 5 toppings and 2 cokes it came up to 28$ it was so worth it ! I repeat best wings people!!!!!  Gota try it"}
{"text":"Love their Pizza, but really I've never had anything there that I didn't like. Hot dogs, sandwiches and even chicken tenders are good, which makes it kid friendly in my house. Decent beer selection and great staff, laid back casual atmosphere."}
{"text":"Love the thin crust pizza.  Friendly staff and fast delivery.  One of my favorite pizza delivery joints in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"I have been looking for a great chicago spot and I definitely found it here! Great food, service, and speedy delivery. Great sandwiches, especially the beefs. Definitely have to order their cookie pizza, total score!!"}
{"text":"If you're looking for a nice cheesy slab of pie look no further! Been eating on this za since January, needless to say I'm still pounding down slices as of today! Thanks Little Chicago!!!!"}
{"text":"Pizza was great, prices were completely reasonable, and delivery was free. I was told it would arrive in 45 minutes, but it got here in under 30 minutes. I would totally recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Been there 4 different times in the past 2 months and have never been disappointed. I wished I lived closer!!"}
{"text":"Ordered a large half cheese, half combination. The lady on the phone was pretty confused. Had to ask me my address several different times. She wasn't sure if they \"delivered to my area\" (I live about a mile from here). Maybe she was new? Also had to ask me my order a couple different times. I wouldn't describe her as friendly, but I wouldn't say she was rude or anything.  Finally got my order in and she said it would be delievered within the hour. I would probably say it took about 40 minutes. Pizza delivery guy was friendly.  I was disappointed with the pizza though. I didn't realize I was getting thin crust pizza, and this was seriously like pizza on a cracker. I really felt that this was over priced for what I got. I won't be coming back here."}
{"text":"Service is really good and the jalape√±o honey chicken wings are really good. Nice neighborhood place to hang out. Will be coming back for sure."}
{"text":"These reviews are awful. \"Holds its own against Gus', etc.\" Well no shit. and another review mentioned how the pizza reminded him of Straw Hut Pizza in California? What? The dude didn't even know he hadn't ordered a deep dish pizza as opposed to a thin crust.  Please people, don't take these reviews seriously.  Little Chicago Pizza is phenomenal and they offer a wide array of delicious Chicago-style offerings like red hot Vienna dogs, Italian beefs, and of course well done authentic Chicago-style THIN CRUST pizza. There is a common misconception where people think that Chicago is only known for one kind of pizza (the DEEP DISH). This is far from the truth. Chicago pizza places (the good ones anyway) can churn out of some the best thin crust pizzas ever. They are notable for their graham cracker crust and their party-style cut (the square cut).  The pizza can hold up to places back home in Chicago, much less shitty $5 places on the ASU campus. People are ridiculous. Get your taste buds in check and really TRY to understand flavors. Chicago-style pizza embodies its own attributes and a reviewer should review the pizza not in the general sense of pizza but in the sense of \"if this a good Chicago-style pizza? Did they make this authentically?\"  People grew up with different tastes for things and therefore develop bias, so the best and most fair assessment for a pizza place is to judge it on it's tier, quality, and style. LCP is top tier, great quality, and very well done Chicago-style pizza."}
{"text":"Didn't disappoint! I live in the area and enjoy eating at local places. Had the cubs pizza, Chicago dog, hot wings, and cheese sticks...yum! Delivery time was short for it being a saturday night and everything was still hot when it got here. Will definitely keep going back."}
{"text":"I don't think anyone who gave over a 2 has ever eaten Italian food in Chicago.   I struggled to give 2 stars, but figured the wings were decent .  #1) No celery salt on the Dog #2) No cucumber on the Dog #3) WORST OF ALL the GYRO, was not off a spit it was processed #4) Also, living 30 years in Chicago I have never had a gyro covered in more lettuce than there were onioins.  #5) Since when does a Gyro (not in Chicago) have Feta Cheese & almost not Tatziki #6) The PIZZA IS NOT CHICAGO STYLE ITS 100% New York #7) Wings are a 6 out of 10 #8) THERE IS NO DEEP DISH PIZZA OFFERED OR THICK CRUST??? #9) I apologize they have now gone from 2 to 1 star...   PLEASE CHANGE YOUR NAME YOU\"RE A DISGRACE TO CHICAGO!!!  Don't think I will give this place another shot no reason"}
{"text":"I love this place! They are fast and tasty. You can easily get in and out in a hour.   Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The hours say they are open until 10pm Tuesday through Thursday, but they activated their after hours answering message at 9:30pm.  Little Chicago apparently hires staff that likes to close up early; Makes me suspicious of how much care they put into their pizza."}
{"text":"Frequent customer to Little Chicago, and they'd almost always get a 5 Star rating. This evening we ordered out a pizza and it had a hair on it. We called the restaurant and spoke to the manager, and they handled it really well. We get it, this is unfortunate. Shouldn't happen, 99 times out of 100 it doesn't. But it did. So the manager put in a new order for us and said they'd have it delivered. It's been almost two hours and we still don't have our replacement pizza. We live 5 mins away. And when we called to inquire about the order about a half hour ago, we were told it'd be here any second and that they got really busy. At a bit of loss at this point.  Update: Finally arrived at 2 hours on the dot. Pizza is cold and looks like it's been sitting under a heat lamp for an hour. Not eating this. $20 down and two useless pizzas. We'll be finding a new pizza place."}
{"text":"Absolutely LOVE having Little Chicago in my neighborhood!  I usually stop 2-3 times a month for salad and pizza during off peak hours so I can catch up on business emails (or WORDS WITH FRIENDS). The thin crust pizza,  cut into squares, takes me back to when I lived in Chicago. My family and friends are hooked. The menu is diverse enough to please them all. Only downside...they are closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"I only gave Little Chicago 4 stars since I can't comment on their in-house service, only delivery. Which was pretty good. But I'm really here to review the pizza! I had a 14\" Bulls pizza and a small order of hot wings, and they were great! Nothing really unique with the wings, but a solid satisfying appetizer.  The pizza however, was great. It was delivered within the time quoted and nice and hot. Plenty of toppings and the cheese was REALLY good. I didn't think I would like thin crust pizza but I was willing to give this place a shot. The crust was really amazing! Nice and crispy, but not really flaky at all. Very solid. It was even better cold the next day... which is one of my criteria for a great pizza!  I'll definitely be ordering this for delivery more often and I'll try more of their specialty pizzas for sure since I was so impressed with the Bulls pizza. I'll change my review when I stop by for dining room service too."}
{"text":"This place was a awesome place to come and have a pizza,  the service was so friendly and attentive, I would recommend this place to anyone who wants a pizza."}
{"text":"I was disappointed in this place. The first indication that maybe we should have gone somewhere else is when we pulled up to a near empty parking lot. I thought to myself that because we went on a Sunday its going to be slower. The place was empty. We ordered the Cajun chicken wings and a cheese thin crust pizza. The chicken wings where dry. The pizza I compare to the pizza I used to get in the cafeteria in middle school. Only redeeming thing was that the staff was friendly. I have to say this would be first and last time I would visit."}
{"text":"We only come to Arizona 1-2 times a year and this is on the top of our list every time-if not the number only place! We get the bulls pizza and nothing compares to it! If you are in town and wondering where to go it's this place! No other pizza compares to the unique but great tastes this place offers!!"}
{"text":"Nice little family run spot. I really like their cold Italian combo sub. Staff are helpful and friendly. Not much atmosphere though, an inexpensive update could really improve sit down business."}
{"text":"Dined in on a Saturday night around 7 pm. Not a \"sports bar\" by any means but World Series easily on view with the 4 tvs in the dining area plus two more at the bar where I sat. So this place can be a place to watch \"the game\", as I did. I got the baked ziti with meatballs and it was very good, made pretty quickly as well. And about 8 beers on tap (plus 8-10 more in cans) so a good beer variety.  The workers were friendly enough and I think a fine-in experience would go well for anyone. The prices are decent (roughly $9 for my dinner, $4 beers on tap) so no complaints there. As others have noted it is a thin crust pizza so don't expect a \"Chicago\" style pizza despite the business name. Overall, no complaints and with the tvs got more than I expected by coming here."}
{"text":"Pizza is good but good customer service is everything to me and they just lost a long time customer. Just now I was told by a female employee that the delivery time was going to be 1 hour and 45 minutes I politely advised her that would be too long but thank you anyway and she hung up on me. RUDE!! A simple apology and thank you for your business goes a long way but I won't be spending my money at an establishment that treats customers rudely! Without us you are nothing."}
{"text":"Delicious Pizza and Wings!! Little Chicago's is my go to place to order pizza for delivery or dinning!  Great, fast service and at an affordable price."}
{"text":"Wasn't happy when they stopped delivering... But they decided to start delivering again, from the new location! Good for them for getting a larger space and branching out into a free standing building! We definitely miss their old location as it was a quick walk around the corner... They've had a friendly staff, and always great customer service between both locations. The hot Italian beef is amazing... But I always go with the Turkey and Provolone. Great place for lunch... Plenty of parking and seating. Dine in, Pick up AND delivery(again)....Specials every day!! Support local! And don't forget to tip for their hard work!"}
{"text":"Ordered 2 pizzas and 12 wings on a Thursday night to be delivered, and it took 1 hr and 45 min to arrive and all of the food was cold. Will never get food here again."}
{"text":"Whole new staff and not a fan. The best employee they had is gone. Prices are a little steep for the quality."}
{"text":"This place has the thin crust pizza on LOCKDOWN!!!!   The Jalepe√±o Honey wings are always on point... super crispy, just enough sweetness and the traditional spice of a buffalo wing on the finish.    Little independent business, located just down the block from my house. They deliver, but you owe it to yourself to eat in as that's the freshest your food is going to be. Don't order delivery and then bitch about how your wings weren't crispy... that's your own fault.    They always have dine in specials and the staff rules.    Go. Eat. Pizza."}
{"text":"I'll make this short but sweet.  LCP has awesome pizza, maybe the best thin crust around.  As good as Grimaldi's, maybe even better.  I just tried the Italian Beef with spicy peppers, and it was really really good."}
{"text":"Delish and precise!  We wanted to order pizza but wanted something different than the standard chain. Thank you yelpers for leading me in the right direction. We ordered the pepperoni and onions pizza. The crust was thin and cooked perfectly. We were also amazed on how delicious the wings tasted. I ordered them in HOT and they definitely had a good kick to them. Everyone at this location was beyond friendly and helpful. They definitely want to make sure you will enjoy your food!  I will definitely keep coming back. This is a great addition to our neighborhood!"}
{"text":"We moved to the neighborhood nearly three years ago and Little Chicago Pizza was one of our first finds. They quickly became a go to take out option for us.  The pizzas and pastas are fantastic! Their pizza crust is thin, just a touch chewy with a crisp bottom. No, the pizza is not Chicago deep dish, its not trendy wood fired, and its not NY style.  It's awesome thin crust topped with real cheese and quality toppings that have great flavor.  Our favorite pastas include the lasagna and the baked ziti with meatball.  The people working there are friendly, though sometimes they seem to be running a bit short staffed.  Delivery wait times in the evenings are always ridiculously long (usually over an hour).  We don't even bother to ask about delivery anymore.  But, that doesn't deter us, we just order to pick up or we dine in."}
{"text":"$10 minimum for delivery.  Quoted 45 minutes but it was at my door under 30.  Ordered a side salad (fresh veggies, delicious bleu cheese dressing), calzone with sausage and artichoke (dough cooked to perfection, cheesy, normally not a huge sausage fan but this was just right), and a coke.  Fast, reasonably priced, and delicious.  Couldn't ask for more!"}
{"text":"Little Chicago is a great little neighborhood pizza joint. The atmosphere is casual and there's always a game showing on the T.V.s Food and service are consistently good. I'm a fan of the wings, calzone and have even ordered a couple of the Chicago dogs along with a tasty basket of french-fries. From what I understand, Little Chicago has just installed a bar to sidle up to. Though I haven't sat there, I know there's always a few good beers on the menu."}
{"text":"So far I've only had their pizza, wings and pasta and all of them are good! Their wings have the perfect crunch to them and the flavor is good. I could eat their pizza everyday if I could. The service has been excellent the times we've been in there."}
{"text":"Wasted my time. Waited a long time for below average frozen microwave pizza. They don't have pizza by the slice at lunch time, or any time. DO NOT eat the overpriced 10\" pizza. Never been to the previous location so I don't know about that one.  The only positives are the helpful servers."}
{"text":"Great place to eat in. Good wings and pizza. Some will always complain that its not \"like back home\" or \"authentic\". But look at the reviews of the best places in Arizona and you will see these. This place offers us value for our money, good food at reasonable prices and friendly service with an immediate greeting almost every time we go. Keep up the good work please. BTW closed Mondays if you are planning a trip."}
{"text":"I live right down the street from Little Chicago and have frequented their shop with my girlfriend for over a year. Tonight, I called at 7pm to order a 12 inch (medium) thin crust pizza. I was told on the phone that it would be ready in 40-45 minutes. I arrived at the shop at 7:45 and was told that the pizza was not ready, still needing a few more minutes. \"No problem!\" I told the hostess.  I ended waiting quite a while - until 8:15, to be exact - before the pizza was ready. While I waited, barely a word was said to me by the hostess or person communicating with the cooks through the window. Not sure what you would call his position. No water was offered to me while I waited, no apologies, sympathies or explanations.  I walked out with my pizza finally, glad that I did not tip. When I got home, I opened the box to find very few jalape√±os. The pizza was tasty, but still, why did it take an hour and 15 mins to make a medium thin crust pizza??  Normally a big fan of Little Chicago, but the service was definitely lacking and disappointing this evening. Will look for other options next time I'm craving pizza."}
{"text":"Best pizza west of Chicago, great delivery - they're always quicker than they estimate, and reasonable prices- Love them!"}
{"text":"A few months ago my friend was having a raging party for his bday.  Before the festivities began Verdel recommended we go to this gem of a pizza place.    I'm a pizza guy.  Little Caesar's...trash, but it gets the job done.    But for that night it wasn't about getting the job done, it was about making memories.    The most surprising part about this joint is there was not a lot of people.  Good news for me.   Now about this place...ahem.  The scenery was on point as some of the staff members were babes (automatic star adage) .  The wait period was next to nothing as they went 0 - 100 real quick.    The pizza...ahhh the pizza.  Those square pieces were so tasty that it change my reality.   I am a better person because of this experience.    So check out.  If any of the staff members read this hit me up.  #babes #squareslicesofdelight"}
{"text":"Little Chicago is the best. They are about a 5 min drive from my house, and they have free delivery since I'm usually too lazy to make that drive. Their pizza is super tasty, and it's cut into squares so you get those 4 fun trianglie corner pieces along with the big square pieces! I like that it has a thin crust that is light and crispy with out tasting like a saltine or melba toast. Its the perfect combo of crisp and soft. The cheese they use is divine as well. they always use the perfect amount and it's just the right amount of saltiness and greasyness. I like their sausage, however I believe they make it home made? Sometimes it's too fennel-ie for me, so I don't really order it anymore. Their specialty pizzas are also very good. And their cheese sticks. Yum! I like that they are called cheese sticks, and not mozzarella sticks or fried mozzarella or other \"fancy\" names like that. They are just delicious sticks of cheese that happen to be fried and taste like heaven. I always want to try their wings, but have yet to since I am not yet sick of the cheese sticks. I haven't tried any of the pasta dishes yet, either, but would like to. My boyfriend always gets their sandwiches for lunch and I have been lucky enough to eat his left overs from time to time (I work too far away for lunch time treats from Little Chicago unfortunately). Let me tell you, they are TASTY! Tasty tasty little submarine sandwich gems. My mouth salivates just thinking of them. Anyways, eat here. It's the best."}
{"text":"Yum! I grew up in Chicago and moved to the valley 4 years ago, and have been in search of good pizza ever since. I finally found it! I love the thin crust, sweet sauce, and not too salty mozzarella cheese. Delivery service was very fast too and the pizza was still hot when delivered. This is definitely my go to pizza place from now on."}
{"text":"Love the food especially the eggplant, great service and always fast deliveries."}
{"text":"This place is so freaking delicious! The beers are nice and cold also! Definitely coming out here again!! Great customer service too!"}
{"text":"Ive been eating here for years! Its great thin crust pizza and they have daily specials. I ordered a 16 inch with Gardiner and a side of garlic bread for 15 bucks! Delivery can sometimes a bit slow but its probably because they're busy. My pizza and bread came hot and fast today and delicious!"}
{"text":"Some of the most tangy, sweet, fresh tomato sauce I've had on a pizza in a long time!  They painted the phrase \"Thin Crust Specialists\" on the front window, and that is the truth.  This thin crust is so crispy that it has a crunch similar to a cracker, especially the crust at the end of the slice.  Perfectly golden brown with a healthy amount of residual flour on the bottom makes this a memorable pizza that is very close to the thin crust examples I had in north Chicago many years ago.  But again, what makes it a homerun is the tangy sauce.  Little Chicago is pretty much a take-out and delivery place, with just a handful of tables inside and on the pato sidewalk (maybe 4 tables total).  I made an inquiry about the sauce and they were proud to let me know that it is homemade, something foreign to other pizza places that claim to make Chicago style crusts (ahem... Oreganos?).  Parking is plentiful and service was friendly.  Prices are very reasonable.  It's in an older strip mall on the east side of Hayden, just north of Thomas."}
{"text":"I live quite literally a 3 minute walk from Little Chicago Pizza.  I really thought this was going to be Chicago Deep Dish Pizza.  I opened up the pizza and saw that it was thin crust.  I asked what was going on, and they told me all their pizzas were thin crust.  I was quite disappointed, but I told myself that I will give it a chance.  It tastes very much like the first pizza slice I ever had from a Straw Hut Pizza in California.  It has the right balance of sauce, cheese, and plenty of toppings.  The sauce had a sweeter taste and the cheese was real mozzarella. The large pizza was devoured by visiting parents and myself.    I support small businesses that are mom and pop shop like, and the food is excellent too!"}
