{"text":"*Called to order pizzas for my annual Holiday party and was told that I couldn't pick up multiple Walk-In specials. (Something they've done for me in years past.) Joe got on the phone and was down right rude- raising his voice and told me he didn't need the buisness. It's one thing to get a sub par pizza, but another thing to get treated like garbage also. Save your money and go to Veltre's or Felinnis if you want a great pizza in this area*

When I first moved to the area (2 years ago) I was getting Fortino's quite often. My wife and I really enjoyed their Walk In Special- A large 1 topping pizza and a 2-litter for under $10.
When they say large, they mean mamoth! It's a huge pie. 
 The place has a pretty cool family owned vibe. Joe, the owner, is a really nice guy. He like to shoot the bull with anyone that walks into his shop.

Sadly, the quality has diminished a bit over the past few months... I'm not sure if they're using inferior products than what they were using- but something is different. Also, the prices have gone up a touch. I can take a little inflation, but the last time I was in, I was charged extra for my standard 1 topping of extra cheese. Again- no biggie, but when I asked why my total was more than normal, the woman working snapped at me saying extra cheese is charged as 2 toppings and pointed to a hand drawn sign on the wall. - (I think she's dating or married to Joe, not sure.. but WOW was she rude; which is in complete contrast to how Joe is!)

I can't say it's my favorite pizza in the city (Aielo's if you cared) - but it's a decent pie for a decent price... check it out, but only if Joe or his mom are working!"}
{"text":"I like the pizza...nothing special just good food... reasonably priced. The pizza sauce is not sweet which makes me happy. The crust is average...not always consistent.   Wings are good tasting but because of delivery (I suppose) they are a bit wet and texture is not to my liking. Overall i cannot complain and encourage patronage."}
{"text":"Always a good solid pizza, can't beat their antipasto salad it's loaded. Here's the bonus: family owned and operated. Joe the owner is very friendly and remembers his clients. Even his mom works there. I highly recommend them - good wings too their big the whole wing and their sauce is good, seasoned wings are good too."}
{"text":"The Spinach and Ricotta pizza is great. Their Stromboli's are huge and delicious! The service is very friendly. My favorite pizza place in Oakmont."}
{"text":"I went here with my neighbor, Tate, who is a good friend of the owner, Joe. The place is a bare bones pizza joint and has an un-pretentious atmosphere that is hard to come by in this day and age.

Joe, his wife, and his little kid were all behind the counter working. Brandon, a regular and a mail man was at their single table taking his daily one and a half hour lunch break over a burger and fries.

I had the Italian sub and Tate had the jumbo wings and a large loaded fry. The fries came out hot and fresh and there was about 5 pounds of them, maybe more. Tate's wings were fried and covered in hot sauce. They were the whole wing, not sectioned and cut and were full of meat.

My Italian sub was baked and had a perfect amount of meat. The lettuce was fresh and not wilted and the mozzarella cheese was melted perfectly. The roll was crisp on the outside and chewy inside; perfect.

I had a great lunch shooting the shit with my neighbor and his friends as we ate good food. The kind of people that staff and eat at Fortino's are the kind of people that give you respect and appreciate your business. I'll definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The Best PIZZA, My fav; med pizza with ground meat, green peppers, onion, and pepperoni
 Absolutely HANDS down best steak salad COMPLETE WITH GREAT buttered bread yummy
Huge cheeseburger omg! Just like home backyard grilling!!!
Those are a few of my fav to order , I never forget a side,"}
{"text":"Got pizza here before for my first time, just a standard large cheese and pepperoni.  While the pizza was excellent, their billing practice needs tweaked.  When I saw the total on the register, I pulled out my debit card and suddenly the total went a little higher after the guy saw my card... Much higher than just tax.  There was an unadvertised fee for using a card that they try to slip in when you aren't looking.  Not a good thing to pull on your customers, haven't been back since."}
