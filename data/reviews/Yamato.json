{"text":"This place brings a nice taste of something different to our little old town. Don't let it's odd location fool you; It's definitely a diamond in the rough here. I've received excellent service from whom I believe to be the restaurant manager every time I've been here. Portions are large for a fair price and everything is absolutely delicious. There are almost always specials available as well."}
{"text":"This place is great. Well rolled sushi not to much rice. Great flavours with everything we had and then stayed open for us."}
{"text":"This is my favorite spot in town, amazing fried rice, sushi rolls, bento box ( you can't beat the prices) and good atmosphere. And everything is amazing with the yum yum sauce!!"}
{"text":"Some of the best sushi ever... their tofu is awesome and extremely reasonably priced   The bento box's and sushi rolls are very fresh and taste great..   Exceptional value and quality!!"}
{"text":"We tried 3 sushi rolls. They were all 3 decent. Our dinner combinations were disappointing. The service was even worse. Our waitress took our order and did not return until our meal was over."}
{"text":"Not usually a complainer, but this was a terrible experience and ashamed to have them in my hometown.  Server was uninformed about the menu, all the sushi was the the same room temp.  Place was empty on a Sat eve and couldn't get the server to check in regularly.  Cashier didn't know how to run credit card machine.  Only item I felt was cooked well was the spicy shrimp appetizer and the decor was nice.  Will not return though."}
{"text":"Great place! Food is wonderful and the servers are so sweet! Always helping me decide on the right thing to get! The sushi is always so yummy! A definite must."}
{"text":"Tasha was great she brought our food out n a timely fashion and gave great service! Even though it wasn't cooked in front of us the experience was pleasant."}
{"text":"Yamato is my absolute favorite restaurant!! I've NEVER had a bad meal, the staff is wonderful and prices are reasonable!!"}
{"text":"had yaki soba. wife got a bento box. food was good. well prepared. also tried the sushi. i wasnt that impressed. service friendly. no booze."}
{"text":"Overpriced, mediocre sushi. Sadly this is the only sushi place in Madison, and with that they feel the need to have very high prices and small portions. The sushi was okay, I recommend making the drive and going to Rikishi in Crestwood, so worth it! I got two rolls and it ended up costing me like 18$. No, thank you!"}
{"text":"With Madison being a small town, it is refreshing to see a place like Yamato. You would not guess based on the outside that the inside is a nice, rather sophisticated dec√≥r.  A friend goes there frequently for lunch and suggested I try it. While the menu may not be as robust as what you would find in larger markets/cities, what you do get are ample size portions, well made, and nicely displayed on the served dishes.   I most recently tried a crunch munch roll...delicious, and a spicy tuna roll, which was just the right amount of heat. Prices are comparable to places in Louisville. I've been a handful of times now and each time the staff have been friendly, attentive and knowledgeable about items on the menu."}
