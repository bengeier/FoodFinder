{"text":"Food was excellent, as were the mariachis, service was quick, kind and comprehensive. We had people dancing in the middle of the alley and the waiters just went along with it. The owner is one of the mariachis and has great energy, highlights special occasions of the guests (mariage anniversary, birthdays, etc)   Great price, great drinks, authentic food, music isn't too loud, the decor is simple but detailed. This is a restaurant that feels like eating at home, the tables and chairs will very, if a lot of people are coming they will get the folding chairs out to accommodate the unexpected number of guests.   On the table are Mexico themed tablecloths and they use real doilies instead of paper ones to put your food on.   I will come back.   P. S. I'm dating a Mexican and am often surrounded by Mexicans and I can tell the difference."}
{"text":"SO FRIENDLY. All the staff, musicians treat you as one of the family. Servings were generous, drinks were great, music was charming. If doing shots of delicious Tequila with the owner (an adorably moustached mariachi crooner) is your kind of thing, dinner here will probably make your week. Take a date, take your wife, take your friends. The live band plays Friday through Sunday nights I think, but I'd call ahead of time."}
{"text":"After some strong suggestion from a Latino friend and reading the good reviews over here about this place, it stayed in the back of my mind to discover for some time now until about three weeks ago where I finally decided to give it a try.  I called on a Wednesday to reserve for Saturday of the same week for six for my wife's BD but the girl said they were booked solid. Hmmm, Harry thinks wow, this is a good sign and one more reason to go there.   As one of my meme profile pictures here, what you see and read online and what you get in real life, are like McDonald's ads vs reality. This place happened to fall in that category unfortunately. Not looks wise anyway but others. I say unfortunately bcs after all I was the one to convince my small group to come here hoping to see them leaving satisfied and also I'm not trying hard to discredit or disrespect anyone over there. But I happened to be a straight shooter. Here are my three paragraphs on why it didn't sit well with me:  - Mariachi playing good music but man was it long and loud! Way too loud for a fairly small place. We couldn't hear each other talk so we gave up on that after feeling our throats hurt from screaming. Not only that, when after receiving our order, we noticed we were short by two items. After some time of waiting we had to call the waitress over and of course she apologizes saying she didn't hear. Duh, with that level of noise, I don't blame the poor lady.   - Although food presentation looked authentic and neat for a Mexican cuisine, the taste satisfaction landed somewhere far away from it. Tortilla soup, one of my favourite, missing lime? After asking for lime slices and adding it there, it came close but still far by a mile and half from the one we had in Mexico. The guac entre missing lime and salt? Man it felt like some smashed avocados with bits of tomatoes. That's it. Bland at the best. We had to pimp the ride for that also with lime and salt and a bit of hot sauce we asked for. The beef strips for the fajita, chewy. I had to take the unmelted pieces discreetly out of my mouth into a napkin.... a good 4-5 times at least out of the two fajitas I had. The chicken and the shrimps were ok tho. In general, everything on the table was mild, not your typical spicy Mexican grub here, it's \"Canadianized\" IMO. One more, 6 tortillas for order of fajita for two for $35 is NOT enough! We had extra meat left on the plate but no tortilla and didn't ask for more bcs we knew they'd charge extra.   - Margaritas are prepared from that slush machine you see at the back of the store. I had a sip and tasted liked a cough medication. No thanks, I'll stick with my beer for the night.   Conclusion: The price and value you get here are not a match and don't think I'll be returning. Having said that, believe it or not, a couple of people on my table were satisfied with their meal. These people are my family, my family people! I think my theory is right about Taste. It IS a funny thing indeed.  Go and find out for yourself. This is the opinion of one person. What can I say."}
{"text":"This restaurant is a gem ! The food was delicious, the service...impeccable, and the Mariachi band was the icing on the cake!  You can easily drive in front of the restaurant and miss it, but the warmth of the ambiance is noticeable as soon as you walk in. I absolutely recommend this restaurant to all customers who want to experience a fantastic, reasonably priced , family owned restaurant with delicious, freshly prepared Mexican cuisine....I will certainly go back and tell all my friends about it !!"}
{"text":"While the food was not exceptional, what I remember most is how great the service was.  Not in the fake as we're being forced by our corporate HQ but really kind and friendly. This is a family run establishment and it shows in the ambiance.  There was also a live mariachi show, and the owner came to greet us afterwards.   As for the food, it was acceptable but I wish it could be fresher, the pork loin steak was the best item despite being a bit tough. The tacos were what you would make at home and the cactus salad seemed to come out of a can.  The crepe deserts with caramel and panna cotta were pretty good though.  The location is a bit out of the way if you live downtown, but it's a place that fits in for the neighborhood."}
{"text":"It is not the first time that I have been to thiis restaurant and usually the service is very good however today I have never been insulted this much in a restaurant. It was my mom's wedding so we made a reservation at 5h30. We were about 15 people and sonce we were in a very special celebration we were ordering a lot of alcohol and food. At 7h20 they announce us that we need to leave since they have another mayor reservation at 7h30.  The owner came with a very rude attitude that it was our fault since she 'mentioned' that prior to our reservation which is not true. We were celebrating my mom's wedding and is so disrespectful to kick us out of the restaurant when we were still consumming and some of us were not even finish with our meal."}
