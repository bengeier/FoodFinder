{"text":"Let me start off by saying I've been to this Quiznos over 20 times, and that's a conservative estimate.  Last year they had probably a 25% failure to make the right sandwich rate.  But they have Improved this year to about 10% though.  It can be a good place to eat if you follow a couple guidelines.  First off,  never tell them what you don't want on sandwich.  Even though the ingredients are clearly listed behind them they will look at you like your speaking another language.  Tell them \" I want an x with just the y and z\".   Next,  don't tell them what veggies you want before theyve cooked it.  They will forget it or look at you weird.  It's kind of a hassle because you have to keep track of your sub through the cooking process but that's just the way they do it.  Follow those rules if you wanna have a good meal.

Also if the manager is reading this yelp review like any good manager should then Know this:  every single time anyone orders a sub at your quiznos they are asked if they want it for here to go twice? Is the first one just for fun?  That's a lack of communication that reflects poorly on every single customer that comes through."}
{"text":"Service was poor--the guy at the counter was rude and did not pay attention to our orders. The sandwich itself was cold and although I did like the fact it had fresh mushrooms."}
{"text":"As a CMU student, I go to this quiznos a lot. The employees are always super nice. Always come for the happy hour deal in the evening. Much better than the subway nearby. Pesto Chicken Cesar is consistently superb."}
{"text":"Disgusting. It's a franchise and they can't care less about the quality, appearance of food.. Brrr. Fountain drink was cold, therefore at least 1 star"}
{"text":"Can't really see toppings available.  Operator will actually suggest the 3 toppings he thinks you want, and then you have to correct him.  He added a sauce that I did not like and it kind of ruined the meal.  Seems like he just wants to serve you as quickly as possible."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. Very clean inside and decorated with lots of fresh flowers. The food was excellent quality and served quickly.  Loved the condiment bar.  Sooo much better than Subway.  We will be back."}
{"text":"Good, fast food.

I stop here every so often when I'm walking on Craig for an inexpensive, but filling meal. Go for the sub combos, easily the best deal on the menu and make sure you ask them to toast it!"}
{"text":"This Quiznos is similar to most others and is well maintained.

The reason I am writing this review however is to applaud the staff that work here.  I think this is probably the only fast food place I've ever been to where the staff are friendly, make your food quickly and correctly, and seem to actually care about your presence.  I've even been offered discounts by the gentlemen at the register a few times without even knowing that my meal qualified for them."}
{"text":"Super friendly staff and my Quiznos was stuffed! Very clean and helped me rewrap my sandwich when I couldn't finish."}
{"text":"We have been twice in this place . The food is amazing . The staff are so nice and helpful . I will be back there whenever I pass by ,,"}
{"text":"I get lunch often here before going to a weekly seminar at CMU. The sandwiches are tasty. Restaurant and bathrooms are clean. The staff is friendly. It seems to take quite a while to put together a sub, but I think most of that is due to the speed of the toaster. Not a bad option for S. Craig Street takeout.  CMU wifi seems to work here."}
{"text":"I like this Quiznos location. The staff is always friendly, kind of like a family owned business. Typical Quiznos menu and pricing but the service sets this location apart. Only downside is parking can be difficult when this strip mall is busy. Also love the pickles and hot peppers station.

{"text":"Sandwiches are fresh and the place is clean. Always stop here when buying marine fish close by."}
{"text":"Tried their pizza, the thin base is so crispy and the toppings are so juicy. Yummy Yummy, they make great pizza as well as the subs too."}
{"text":"So, generally, I don't go to Quiznos because I just don't think it's that good. (Disclaimer: I'm a pescatarian so I have limited options. I assume that some of the dishes with meat are at least decent). I've visited Quiznos recently due to multiple coupons being offered.

I always get the same veggie sandwich and although it was made just as I asked, it's just not that good. I don't entirely know what it is, but even Subway sandwiches just seem to taste better. The avocado was my favorite part, but the pretzel bread was a close second. The sandwich itself isn't *bad*, and I always eat the entire thing (which says something), but at the end of every meal I'm always wondering why I chose to go to Quiznos again. 

This specific Quiznos actually has pretty good service. They're generally friendly, prompt, and make my sandwiches right. 

If you actually enjoy Quiznos, this is probably the location for you."}
{"text":"Whoever is working this shift (6/3/2017 @ 2:00p) is the best server I've ever met! I am a pretty shy person when it comes to ordering sandwiches in this style, but this server was so friendly. I didn't feel at all intimidated. She made me feel like I was a friend or family member coming to visit - extremely good natured and helpful. No matter how dumb my questions were, she made me feel well supported and as if all my questions were legit to ask! 

It's weird that I had such a great experience at a fast food sandwich shop, I know! But this person really made an impression. :) thank you, Quiznos lady!!!"}
{"text":"I used to be addicted to Quizno's during college but haven't had a sandwich from them for over 5 years since a few of the locations near my area closed down.  I've been wanting to try this location near my house for the longest time.  Finally made the effort with my husband and went there.  I had the 9-inch classic club, italian herbs & cheese bread, lettuce, tomato, extra onions and honey mustard sauce.  My husband had some steak sub and was very pleased with his sandwich.

It tasted soooooo good and satisfied my cravings.  I added so much japalenos and pickles and squeezed extra honey mustard sauce.  The location was very clean, service was very friendly and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"A decent Quiznos location - no different from most of the other ones."}
{"text":"The dining environment here is good, not too noisy, and the staff are very friendly to customers. I ordered Angus Black Beef with some topings, although the size is just regular I think it is enough for my lunch. One thing they may improve is to grill the beef before rolling them with the breads, because the beef could taste better when heated. Overall given the price tag here I think it is one of the best place for students to eat in noons."}
{"text":"Pretty average sub shop though doesn't add too much to the Craig St food scene, which is average at best but caters perfectly to the college crowd. Standard sub options all around to be found, they divide up the menu by meats, specialties, sides, and the like. Sizes here are either 4, 8, or foot-long in terms of how big sandwiches come. I will say that customer service here is pretty stellar, but the star rating is reflective of food quality, which I will say isn't so bad that it's not edible, but it's also not anything to rave about either. All in all right in the middle in terms of food quality. Good for a quick stop or bite if you don't have the time to wait for takeout at surrounding nearby restaurants."}
{"text":"Disgusting and unhygienic--strong smell and even taste of cigarette smoke in my sandwich. I had people comment they could smell it on my breath even 5 hours later. Won't be back."}
{"text":"Friendly staff, clean restaurant. Although there was a distinct smell of curry. they had a busy store but felt with it well."}
{"text":"BBQ pork sub rocks! I prefer it to Subway."}
{"text":"While the food was acceptable for quiznos, meaning it did in fact cease the hunger, while still remaining completely average, the fascists that work there denied my special requests. Not once, but twice. Laughing at their lack of follow through and ability to follow directions. Utterly and completely smashing my hopes and dreams in a way only previously accomplished by several ex girlfriends. HOW HARD IS IT TO DRAW A BEAR WITH TWO GUNS?! YOU WORK AT QUIZNOS,YOURE GONNA TELL ME YOU DIDNT DOODLE IN HIGH SCHOOL!? Get it together people of quiznos on Lake Mead, you're just embarassing yourself now."}
{"text":"Not a guy into fast foods but the lobster series is good actually. Recommend. Haven't tried other stuff yet."}
{"text":"Franchise by Chinese people. How much of a coincidence is that!? I know my race too well I think.

Yes they r busy becuz it's a Quiznos only. My sandwich is not even warm after it came out from the toaster.

Ordered a mesquite chicken, I can count how many pieces becuz it's so little. Alot of condiments, condiments r cheap oh pls.

Is it me or is it just this Quiznos? I've been to other which I have experienced much better. 

I was jus craving for a sub and stumbled upon this place. 

Dedicated to higher quality? Hmmm....think again!"}
{"text":"When I lived in Virginia years ago, I ate at Quiznos many times. Since I moved to Pittsburgh, however, I have had limited access to Quiznos locations. I ordered four subs from this store in Oakland. Three of the subs tasted very good. My husband said that the fourth sub looked \"disgusting\" and tasted just \"OK.\""}
{"text":"Sub was delicious staff was super rude !"}
{"text":"This place is alright. The place itself is small and crowded with tables and chairs. During lunch time it's hectic as people want to sit down and eat and there's literally no space at all. I got the 6inch veggie guac and the lady who made my sandwich was SUPER SWEET! She did everything that I asked for on my sub and was kind! The sub tasted good as well! However, the place itself is messy and not clean. It's alright- not great and not too bad."}
{"text":"Usually I like Quiznos. I think this particular day that I went, the guy working there,Enzo I believe his name is, was really off.... he was rushing everyone for some reason and he wasn't closing the store until 10pm and it was only 6pm so I didn't understand why he was rushing everyone. He was so rude about the items were we're ordering and sounded like he didn't give a crap to be honest. I asked him I could add extra toppings he answered with \"get whatever you want it's your sub you don't need to ask me this stuff.\" My friend likes a lot of ice in her drink so she kept hitting the ice button at the drink fountain and he said \"is that not enough ice?\" He was simply rude. Honestly there just a nicer way of saying things, maybe he was having a bad day I have no idea. But the sub itself was good! I got the 12 inch veggie guacamole which came out to $9.59. A little expensive for a sub but makes sense cause of the guacamole. The place itself is clean and spacious. The place has extra toppings station and sauces we could serve ourselves with!!"}
{"text":"Quiznos, it reminds me of high school lol..... I haven't been to a Quiznos in the longest time, probably over 7 years to be honest. As I walked in, what didn't impress me too much was the tall crowded sitting but what can I expect lol.... there were two people working during the noon shift, both very polite and diligent and helped me right away. Excellent service for fast food. It seems to me their menu has lessen? Either Canada have a less selection or something because in the US, their menu seems more extensive. Price is your typical average sammish price, I ordered myself the Italian, ingredients were really fresh so that's good, additionally I ordered a broccoli and cheese soup, a bit salty for my taste but not too bad. My overall experience was great, if your tired of subway, mr. sub then go to Quiznos. I for sure Like Quiznos over mr. sub whole lot more! Oh, just my observation, I see more man walk in here than ladies lol."}
{"text":"These Sammies are no sweat-heart!!!

Dear Quiznos,
   It's been over 4 years. Yes, that long since I've been to a Quiznos.  Driving up and down Lake Mead looking for something for lunch. If you driven on this road, you know there is a plethora of eats on Lake Mead.  I had my choice of any chicken grill, burger joint, sushi restaurant, Mexican, and even a handful of bookmarks.  But I chose Quiznos.  Why you ask???  My mind was telling me Sammies from Quinoz and my belly was telling me go somewhere better.  

I made up my mind and here we are.  Just a heads up, they don't carry Sammies anymore.  They are now just called Flatbread Sandwiches.  Just a name change.  I got their Turkey Sammie, Chicken Sammie, and a bowl of chili.  Decently priced at $5.99 for both Sammies, I was immediately thinking \"Score!\".  One big difference was the size of the Sammie. They use to be the size of your fist.  Now they're significantly bigger.  However, bigger didn't necessarily mean that it tasted better.  I don't know if my opinion on food has changed or if it's their quality that changed. But the chili and both sammies didn't taste that great.  If fact, I felt like I was eating cardboard.  Even though their meats were seasoned and covered with sauce, I only tasted the flatbread.  The chili also tasted like it came out of a can or even worse, a bag.  The food looked good, but looks were definitely deceiving. 

Tough for me to ever give a fast food restaurant less than 3 stars or more than 4 stars because it's fast food.  You can't enter a FF Joint expect 5 Star food.  Service is the equalizer.  I admit, service was great. Just poor food quality.  

It's been over 4 years since my last visit to Quiznos.  Now I remember why.  The next time I'm hungry and driving down Lake Mead, I'm going to trust my gut.  Literally!!!"}
{"text":"Used to be great, but the past 3 times I've picked up subs there they have been smashed to the point where the bread is soggy and torn, and veggies are falling off.  It's hard to eat these subs because they are smashed so bad they fall apart.  The owner should tell the Wreck-It Ralph at the finishing station to ease up on the smash."}
{"text":"Great food, prices are more reasonable when you use their Q club coupons!"}
{"text":"Good Quiznos location. Takes national coupons unlike the Pitt location.

Fast courteous service. Had the lobster and seafood sub yesterday for dinner. Great value for the money and really tasty."}
{"text":"Gah, I am officially done with Craig St. sandwich places. Stopped in for a quick sandwich en route to school, and requested that my sandwich be made without cheese. Lady calls it out (correctly, without cheese), then the sandwich (which she made) proceeds to come through the toaster with cheese on it. The girl wrapping sandwiches points this out, and the lady ignores her. I ask her if she can take the cheese off of it, and she says that this one won't be mine and that they'll remake it (yay! or so I thought...). The lady making the sandwiches disagrees and tells her to just scrape it off. The girl obliges her, without making any eye contact with me, and I am told to pay for my sandwich without apology from anyone. At the point at which I'm paying $6 for a tiny sandwich, I expect some courtesy and straightforwardness along with it."}
{"text":"As far as fast food subs go... this place is pretty good.  So far everything I've had from here was fresh and tasty.  It's a very busy location, but the line moves through pretty quickly.  If they'd just put pickles on my sandwiches without a hassle,  instead of referring me to the pepper bar, I'd give them 5 stars.  But they have pickles right in front of them for sandwiches that come with pickles, I don't know why it seems to be such a big deal to add them to my to-go sandwich so I don't have to open it up to add them.  Other than that... I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"I have to disagree with the previous reviewer; this Quiznos is actually REALLY different from all other Quiznos establishments! The owner, Mr. Dille takes a lot of pride in running his business, and it really shows. Not only is this one of the cleanest and quickest Quiznos I've ever been to, but it's also apparently one of the more successful in the region, so they get to try out fancy new stuff from HQ.

The staff are always friendly and welcoming, and they know their regulars which is nice. My boyfriend and I have very differing tastes on vegetables/condiments so when we share a sub the order can be quite tricky but they almost always get it right. The one time one of my orders took a little long (like... 4 minutes?) they even gave me a free sub coupon! This is definitely my go-to sandwich/sub place, although sadly since I only eat fish now I cannot go there as much as I used to.

Oh yes - and to prove my first point, I went to a Quizno's in New York this summer and they totally failed at wrapping my torpedo. They also didn't go \"whoo torpedoooo!\" when they packaged it."}
{"text":"This is the best experience I've had my a sub shop in a while. Stuffs your subs. Great service. Friendly staff. Would come again 8/8."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times when I feel like something different from subway (I don't bother with Mr Sub, their meat is too fatty) but I digress. Most of the time it is great but the last time I was there, they burnt my sub and didn't seem to care. It was quite obviously burnt but they gave it to me anyway without a second thought. Not good. But that was one bad encounter over several good ones that I have had there."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Quiznos, love it a hell of a lot more than subway, but this particular location is one I will be avoiding. I ordered a ultimate turkey club on rosemary. I asked that they toast the tomatoes and onion as they used to, but now you have to request this. The young man making my sandwich and my daughters oh so basic ham and cheese seemed to be in a state of confusion. Not sure if he was new, but he would pause from making the sandwiches and walk over to his co-worker and I can only assume ask him what to do next. I can forgive this, I understand if your new, so I gave him a pass. The problem was the guy he was asking for help came over to take charge and he forgot to toast my tomatoes and onions even though I made sure he knew that's what I wanted. The new guy had no idea how to work the register, so he left it for the more experienced that was working on my sandwich. I told him we were eating there and as he's putting my pepporcinis and lettuce on my sandwich then realizes he did not toast my onions or tomatoes......now I'm irritated. So he puts some on a tray and runs them thru, still didn't taste the same, they were still cold. He starts wrapping my sandwich then realized I said it was to eat in. Unwraps the sandwich and transfers it to another piece of paper, all of my pepporcinis, some tomatoes and a good majority of my onions spill out onto the paper he's removing from. He then proceeds to apologize as he was still recovering from a wild night out. I have to be honest I didn't care for his excuse, your just listening to your customers request and making a pretty basic sandwich. The sandwich was not good was missing my pepporcinis and my toasted onions and tomatoes. Oh and they don't honor the groupon at this location, so that was another ding. I'll just head over to the location on Ann rd where they seem to have their shit together and DO honor groupon."}
{"text":"Bad food with even worse attitude by the person who works there. I went there with my friend and he paid for me food. Even when it's free there is now way I'm coming back there."}
{"text":"Bought a veggie sub before a Jays game and when I got into the stadium I discovered they gave me chicken. Pretty pathetic getting an order that wrong. I wouldn't trust buying from them again."}
{"text":"Another chain review. But I chose to do this one to give a shout out to the employees at this location. They are so nice every single time I'm in there. I do a lot of special ordering with their sandwiches ie add this, take that off and so on. The sandwiches  come as ordered and with patience because sometimes I'm a tough customer. Thanks, gang!"}
{"text":"I use to come here all the time, when the location was new. But more recently, I had not been for a while. I was craving a nice hot sandwich so I decided to grab a meatball, my memory of them was that they were delicious. 

This time though, it was meh. Honestly the meatball sub sucked. Tasteless, barely toasted. Luckily they had this special, download their app, you get a free small sandwich! So I got a chicken sandwich and it was much better, can't remember the name though. 

Anyways, the location is beginning to show its age. If it doesn't close down, I'm sure they will renovate it sometime soon. It's stuck in 2002 lol. 

The staff are friendly though. family run for sure. I'll be back, but I think the meatball sub will be a no go from now on !"}
