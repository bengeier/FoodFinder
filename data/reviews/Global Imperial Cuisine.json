{"text":"This week we had to try a new dim sum place out because our regular favourite (Very Fair Seafood Cuisine) is out of commission for renovations. Fair enough - restaurants need a face lift every once in a while, and we're always game to try a new place out.  The place we went to is another oddly name place (you know it's legit!) Global Imperial Cuisine (???) The first two characters, ??, mean \"National Treasure\". While I can only assume that Nicholas Cage did not invest in this restaurant, I can never be completely sure. But in this context National Treasure is meant more to give an aura of widespread national fame.  Fame can be a good thing - for the right reasons. I'm not sure this place is going to get the fame it wants. We walk into this place at our regular 945am and we find a total of 12 tables are taken, out of a possible 30. The place is eerily quiet. There are no dim sum carts - something that is a strong contributor to the din and atmosphere of yum cha.  Ordering a la carte (but ironically with no dim sum carts) I assume that all food should come out absolutely steaming hot. Most dishes came out fairly hot, but the Zongzi (??) came out without the leaves on and was nearly cold on the outside!  Dishes in general were similar flavours, with enjoyable exception being the beef tendon, which is instead done with a five spice type sauce instead of a chili based sauce. Very interesting but definitely doesn't have the same level of saucy flavour that I'm used to. I assume that this method is actually a bit more traditional than the red chili sauce version.  While the atmosphere is subdued and quiet (and some like this), the overall venue is very relaxed and quiet. My biggest issue overall is how small the portions were compared to other dim sum places I've been to. Given the prices are slightly lower, but the portions are quite tiny! We ordered curry cuttlefish and it came with 5 pieces!"}
{"text":"Didn't think it was worth the time to post a review of the restaurant, but probably one of the worst experience I've had dining out.   What a disappointing experience at the restaurant.  Was expecting it to be a better experience with how much long time customers talked about the place. Completely missed the mark with mediocre food for the price they were selling it for. They weren't able to deliver.   If it was just the subpar food, the experience would have been fine, just like the usual restaurants where you drop by expecting much more but come out slightly disappointed. But nope, it doesn't stop there. A big difference between those experience and our time at this restaurant here is the attitude of the staff.  We're expecting to be greeted with kind staff (not over the top nice, but tolerable) like we usually experience at typical restaurants. Completely missed the memo that in order to communicate with the staff at the restaurant, one would have to prepare for snarky remarks and demeaning attitude from the staff.  We came here with long time customers who introduced us to this restaurant, and they observed that there are less patrons compared to the past. This was a Saturday during the holiday, mind you, very quiet for a Dim Sum restaurant on the weekend.  We were wondering why that is, I think we found the answer.   Would come back for mediocre food if it was one of the only restaurants choices I had, but the attitude of the staff was terrible and do not want to experience this again.   What a way to close out the year, what a way to lose long time customers and a new customer.    Cheers."}
{"text":"I normally enjoy going to this restaurant for dim sum. One of my favorite items is this baked BBQ pork pineapple bun. I ordered two of them but got very different ones. It seemed like two different dim sum chefs. After complaining to the staff, they exchanged the smaller sized dish. What they exchanged was still the same.   I  wanted to upload proof of this but don't know how"}
{"text":"My family has known the owners for quite some time now so when they told us they were opening a dim sum place, we had to go and try it out! My first impression on the place was now the best. It's in somewhat of a sketchy plaza that's hidden and they restaurant itself looked a little run down and unfinished. On the other hand, I thought the food was absolutely amazing and whenever my family goes, we get great service so unfortunately I'm not sure how their service really is to other people. I would've totally given this place 5 stars if it wasn't for the location and decor of the place. Overall though, I would recommend this place to everyone who loves dimsum/Chinese food and who wants to try out a new place."}
{"text":"Global Imperial Cuisine suffers badly and routinely from poor, slow service and very obviously stingy practices when it comes to portioning and presentation. Entrees often get sent out a few at a time, more than twenty minutes apart, if they show up at all. The food varies from okay to pretty good, but the above issues plus a pretty stark, unappealing environment don't flatter it well.  Come here for cheap dimsum; avoid for dinner."}
{"text":"I loved this place when it first opened and really hoped it would continue and stay. While it's still around...the quality has dropped.   Food is still decent and service is pretty good.   Unfortunately, the bbq pork pineapple buns which use to be amazing are now small and often over cooked. And the shrimp dumpling which is using large at most other dim sum places is an xlarge here because they claim they use fresh wild catch shrimps...our buns did not taste different than others. Also, their minced pork steam rice roll used to be full of pork...now there is a countable number of minced pork pieces and to make up for the lack of pork they're added more chopped green onion.   It is still one of the better dim sum places in Scarborough nonetheless."}
{"text":"We came to G.I.C for a late dinner.  Very disappointed.  The previous restaurant that occupied that same location was much better.  Slow service at night, semi-friendly staff.    We ordered minced chicken and corn soup, there was no chicken in the soup at all and that was $8.50.   Along with the soup we ordered Har Gow, pork and shrimp sui mai, chicken/mushroom/corn/ham/taro bean curd roll, and calamari tentacles.  The soup was not up to par (missing the minced chicken).  No major problems with the dim sum we ordered, except we didn't have access to the entire available dim sum menu.  Also, there were no available condiments on the tables.  In my honest opinion, if you happen to be a lower budget family, stick with the dim sum items only (small, medium and large for $2.60 each).  Their regular menu dishes are too expensive.  Some dishes hitting $14.00-$16.00 each.  Guessing those are the dishes that are with out rice.  The only bonus is for us is they are more affordable than Perfect Chinese for late evening dim sum.  For 2 people dining if we didn't order the dim sum, we could have hit about $50 or more.  As for settling your bill, this is where I deducted stars.  They ONLY accept debit cards or credit cards from MAJOR BANKS.  If you have a PC Financial or MBNA or Capital One Mastercard those will be rejected.  Same goes for a Tangerine Debit card, PC Financial Debit and Meridian Debit, those will also be declined.  I'm glad my wife carries emergency cash, or else we would have been at a loss as to how to settle our bill.  Likely not to return here."}
{"text":"My experience here has not been great. I have came here more than one occasion to give them more chances to redeemed themselves and each time it's  just another disappointing experience. It's mostly with the food, not how it tastes but the amount of time it takes for it to come. For example, the beef tripe would take longer than half an hour, I'm saying longer only because we never got it after reminding them, so we decided to not have it and pay the bill.   From my experience each dish comes in an average 10 minute interval, I wish I was lying. I think it's simple knowledge with every Chinese person that dim sum restaurants mass produce each dish so why does every customer have to wait for an unreasonable time for their food? In fact if they are making it on the spot why are they?   Honestly, you get what you pay for, it's cheap for a reason. I rather pay more so I can actually get some food and leave satisfied. Bottom line I would not come back."}
{"text":"This place is pretty awesome for \"yum cha\" (what Chinese people call a dimsum meal). The food is fairly tasty and cheap, starting at $2.60 per dish on weekdays and $2.90 on weekends, regardless of the dish size. There's a wide selection of items to order from and I would definitely recommend you try the bbq pork pineapple bun!   However, an issue that I came across was that the food took a while to come. As well, there was this employee who kept running around hectically and knocking into my mom's chair without apologizing. He seemed very frantic and made me have an uncomfortable eating experience as I watched him sprint down the aisles.."}
{"text":"Came here with my family for dinner and because my aunt knew the chef personally, he decided to whip up some main dishes for us so we did not need to use the menu. Most of the food is your typical Chinese restaurant food, we received a steamed fish with tofu, chicken with veggies, sweet and sour pork and some veggie dishes. Although Chinese food isn't my preference (as a Chinese person, I eat it enough as it is), I admit it did taste good and the food came quickly. Service was great, very friendly but it could also because of we had a network with the staff so w were served well. Also when you walk into the place, everything looks a bit run down and ghetto, but it's quite nice inside. I've never tried the dimsum here so I can't speak to that, but I'd be down to try dimsum here as I've heard good things from friends."}
{"text":"Not exactly expecting to be blown away. That was exactly what happened. I ended up over endulging - a good thing! The dishes were exceptional good, service above average and pricing was just right."}
{"text":"Overall rating is 'mediocre' for the reasons below:  Cleanliness - seems clean but noticed slight yellow stains (cup ring stains) on table clothes before we started.  But everything else seems quite clean.  Food - Okay.  The steamed seafood dumpling in soup was very tough.  Not good.  The baked BBQ pineapple mini buns were quite good.  Service - Depends when you go.  We went from 9:30am to 11am.  Service was good during this time.  Other time we went was at 11am.  Don't expect God service during this time.  Notes:  Free Sing Tao newspaper after 11am.  Free tea before 11am  Sometimes they give you a discount :)"}
{"text":"I hardly come to Scarborough for dim sum at all. Since its Chinese New a year and my friend want to meet up so I came here. The service is good except they don't have enough waitress. They really need to hired more people. The food is below average but for $2.99 I can't complain too. Overall I couldn't come again since its not my type of restaurant. If you are looking for great price then this is it."}
{"text":"Hm. Not bad! Definitely not bad.  I'll second Jennifer K on the prices. What is odd though, is that they don't tell you which sizes the items are until they come to the table. When they tick off your item as having been served, they write the dish size, and not a check mark. Doesn't really matter, though. All the same price. They have other items that are specialty dim sum ($3.99) and then other dishes ($4.99 and up).  That being said, their standards are quite good.  Had (and thought were good): Glutinous sticky rice with minced meat - good ratio of filling to rice. Liked the addition of some salted egg yolk and some Chinese dried shitake mushroom slivers. Snow Pea Shoot and King Oyster Mushroom Rice Roll - Snow pea shoots were tender. They offered to help us cut it before we asked them to. Soup dumplings aka Little Dragon Buns - 5 per serving. For $2.60 (we came on a weekday), not bad. Actually had soup in them. Good flavor. Wished the skin was a little bit thinner. Leek steamed dumplings - I like these cuz they're filled with green stuff in a menu that's otherwise fairly devoid of green stuff. I also like how there's a shrimp in  each one.  Had (and thought were okay): Beef tripe with turnip - Size small. Serving was really small. Wished it was bigger and that it had a little longer to stew. Duck feet with taro - not much taro. Duck feet were a tad salty. Curry baby cuttlefish - Good curry taste. Cuttlefish were tender, but could have been cut into smaller pieces. Also not a fan of them filling the base with potato pieces.  Had (special prices): Bitter melon and pumpkin fried with salted egg yolk ($4.99) - portion was great. Also very tasty. Probably my new favorite place to get this dish. Boiled seasonal veggie ($4.99) - veggies were a tad old. Not a vibrant green. Not particularly crisp. Okay though, for the price.  Side note: They have their air conditioning on at full blast. Bring a light jacket.  I'll be back again. It's oddly peaceful, having dim sum on weekdays."}
{"text":"I really don't know what happened to this place, perhaps the way it is ran is starting to take effect on the business.  As I mentioned in my previous review, this is a family ran business, and when you have your whole family working there, people fight for power and thus, staff and customers will be impacted.  My last few visits here were disappointing.  Food quality declined tremendously, service became unbearable, and the worst out of all, the owners will try to rip you off.  To give you an example, we have a VIP card which grant us 10% automatically for lunch and dinner, we already heard stories from our family friends where they will take your 10% VIP card back, do not give you the 10% and give you the bill without the VIP Card.  We just got the same treatment over the weekend, and the fact they tried to hide it and making lame excuses was unacceptable.  This really puts the nail on the coffin, we will NOT be returning anymore.  Good luck Global Imperial Cuisine!"}
{"text":"Price is inexpensive and dim sum was average. The taro croquettes were nicely fried. It was unfortunate they forgot our main order aside from dim sum (Singaporean fried noodles), so we left unsatisfied."}
{"text":"This is probably one of my favourite Cantonese restaurants in Toronto. The dim sum is much better than what you get in downtown Toronto or down the street (Perfect Chinese Restaurant). Given that it's not as cheap of the Perfect Chinese Restaurant, the taste and freshest is miles better here. During the weekday, dinner service is a bit empty but the seafood is always fresh. The restaurant is clean and really spacious with high ceilings and a relatively modern interior.  As for mall, Dragon Centre, it's definitely changed from being one of the busiest Chinese malls in Scarborough during its high time when it was one of the first Chinese malls to being pretty run down and back to getting its charm again. The area is being in the process of being developed to a office complex - so I'd recommend stopping soon before things start rolling with development.   It's a family run place, which I like because it means the owner is pretty hands on (you won't miss him) looking after the food.   Some of my favourite dishes are the Hong Kong style Lobster, the roast chicken with sticky rice, and the mango sticky balls with whipped cream and fruit stuffing."}
{"text":"So a couple of friends wanted to try a new dimsum place, because their friend recommended it. The place was a little hard to find. It was located inside the Dragon Centre. Once we got in there was a host that didn't even look like she worked there and she was seating people. We got to our table and things looked like any other Chinese restaurant. Food was good, service was ok. They had a good variety of dimsum dishes that came up to $2.90 per dish. We ordered dishes like Chinese Shrimp Dumpling (har gow), Pork and Shrimp Dumpling (siu mai), Chicken Feet, Squid Tenticles, Tripe, and other various dishes. On the down side, the tea was not hot, and that's one thing that I found that brought the rating of this place down. Also we were not quite done yet and one of the waitresses took the hot sauce/mustard sauce away. You never touch an Asian Man's Hot Sauce!!! That's a nono... Overall seemed like a mediocre dimsum place. Jimstar Out!!"}
{"text":"I really like this yumcha place, it has been a favourite of my family for many years now.. from early yumcha to dinner reservations for a special event. It is pretty quiet in the morning, but quite busy close to dinnertime.  My most recent visit was for an early yumcha with family. The bill came up to $21CAD something for four people, including taxes but not gratuities yet. We had nine dishes in total- one bowl of congee which was decently-sized, two plates of cherng fun and the rest were dimsum. What a deal, eh? That's if you visit on a weekday and get the bill before 11:00AM, so you must be early. We weren't even in a rush or anything, but yumcha is also nice early in the morning like that so we took our time. The deal is 20% off your total bill and the tea cost for each person of the table is waived. So you could bring a lot of people and there won't be a charge for tea, as long as you get the check before 11:00AM.  They also have quite a variety of dimsum. I was adventurous and ordered two of the cherng fun that I've never tried before nor heard of. It wasn't bad, I liked one more than the other.. the beef with enoki mushrooms was good, but I don't really recommend the oyster mushroom one. The flavour of the enoki mushrooms in the cherng fun wasn't very strong and was covered mostly by the beef.  Had no problem with the service. They were polite and would answer your questions as to what was the name of the dish that they just brought out to you. I've noticed a lot of servers in yumcha restaurants are not always very nice, but I had no issues here. I would definitely return, looking forward to trying more dimsum on an early weekday again with family."}
{"text":"This review is only for the dim sum. I came here for tea in the morning, and it was alright. The venue looked okay, the service was average for a dim sum restaurant, the dishes were clean enough, and the portions of food were okay. The dim sum (like siu mai) was normal sized;  nothing memorable but nice to eat when you're missing some dim sum. The rice noodle rolls, I find, are a hit or miss. Sometimes, they're undercooked, but sometimes they're okay. For this price, there are better options. Considering my love for dim sum, I don't think I'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Came here at one of their busier times, on a Sunday afternoon for dim sum with my mother and boyfriend. The restaurant was packed but we were acknowledged promptly and seated within 10 minutes. The food came quickly and tasted pretty good.   Another tables orders kept coming to our table after all our food had arrived but the staff were quick to rectify the situation. The service could have been faster but for such a high volume time of the day, the service was still pretty good.   6 plates of dim sum and 3 plates off the chef's special came up to about $55. We left with our bellies satisfied.  The owners also own a grocery store in the same plaza."}
{"text":"Very spacious place. Good quality food and good price.  Friendly and efficient service. Old style Chinese cuisine.  Not a grandiose looking place.  Must try the Hainan chicken rice, and the stuffed chicken. These two dishes need to be ordered in advance. They have soup in a called out winter melon in the summer.  They have seafood as well.  This plaza will be torn down in a year or so. Come here before they move."}
{"text":"Ordered dim sum here. Steamed items in the bamboo containers come out smelling like chlorine. I inform the management they just make excuses and run away. This place needs to be reported to health and safety because they are basically serving food laced with chlorine."}
{"text":"First time here. Place is renovated. Looks nice, people here are very nice and friendly. Food has arrived and eating it and I like it. Food is good for sure. I like this place. Atmosphere is phenomenal!  Will come back again!! :)"}
{"text":"Had yum cha a few times at this place because it's close by, but honestly there are many better options out there. This place is in an old run down plaza hidden in a small street so it's not easy to spot. For $2.60 and $2.90 on a weekend/holiday, dim sum quality is cheap and food is oily and messy. Definitely not worth the price as it's on the higher end. Plates are dirty and service is quite slow. Usually you don't have to wait for seating though because the place is quite big and not many people come here. Do not recommend unless you just want a quick dim sum fix."}
{"text":"Far the best Chinese seafood restaurant I've ever been to! The pepper shrimp particularly was the best dish I tried, the lobster was also quite tasty. The service was excellent, really attentive and friendly, they were frank enough that when we ordered congee soup a waiter approached us to tell us that the congee wasn't \"quite fresh\" so the taste wouldn't be as good as other dishes. When we finished the lady(id say the owners wife) brought us wet towels and asked us if we wanted desserts.   The price was quite reasonable and the food quality was excellent. No complain. I live quite far from this restaurant but I would definitely come back."}
{"text":"This restaurant is located inside a small hidden mall plaza...has a bit of a ghetto vibe but the interior of the restaurant is quite spacious and nice!   My family and I went for dinner and a set meal of 6-7 dishes only cost about $150 (tax and tip included). Portion sizes were decent and the food was quite tasty. The lobster e-fu noodles were a little bland but the lobster itself was alright. I like how crispy the sweet and sour pork was and the Peking duck was very delicious. Oyster pancake was a little on the small side but had quite a few little oysters in there and the egg wasn't overcooked. Mask came with green bean soup as dessert and it's good that it wasn't overly sweet.   Overall, a good, budget-friendly restaurant :)"}
{"text":"A friend of mine invited us for Chinese new year dinner. She ordered a set meals for $268. On top of that she ordered crispy pork. Love the peking duck. Shrimp and chicken was tasty. Minced duck meat on lettuce is a bomb. Lobster rice and fish was good. Instead of boiled chicken, we have fried chicken. Of the set meals i didn't like the soup and noodles. Too bland for me. We were stuffed at the end of the meal. I enjoyed it. Our server speaks very good english and was explaining to us every dish. We were tucked in a nice corner. Would love to come back for their set meals."}
{"text":"2.5 Star  This review is based on my dim sum experience at Global Imperial Cuisine.   The interior though newly renovated and look and feel nice. But I suggest please double check and make sure your tea cup and chopsticks are clean as mine has food stuck to it and was gross.  $2.60 for all Sizes on Weekday and $2.90 on Weekend. They also has an Early Bird Special before 11 am.  We tried a few items and most of them were quite standard aside from the Mango Sticky Bun and Har Gow Shrimp Dumplings which were the best out of the items we ordered. The steamed rice roll tasted stale and old.   I still a little gross out with my experience with dirty cups and plates.......   So a 2 star...."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time on a Wednesday night with my family. It was pretty dead when we got there around 7:30 PM, there were probably only about 4 tables filled in total, and the place is pretty big so it felt kind of empty.  The highlight of the entire meal was the service I guess, since the staff were all super friendly and chatting with us, and kept checking up on us to help us take our order and ask if we were enjoying the food. It seems like this place might be a family-run establishment? Not sure, but I mean, the people were nice enough.  I wasn't too impressed with the food though. We ordered a scallop dish and for some reason the scallops seemed a little bit funky... they had a very faint sour taste, and the texture was harder for scallops than I was used to. Didn't seem like they were super fresh. We also got some tofu, and I felt a little bit uncomfortable eating it as well... also thought there was a slight sour flavour, and then for some reason the texture inside the tofu seemed a little bit chalky...? Other complaints my family had were that the broccoli wasn't washed thoroughly enough and my grandma said it was gritty and she tasted sand. Also some of the broccoli had like dark spots on them.   For dessert, they gave us a sweet papaya soup which I really enjoyed, as well as almond biscuits which I thought was a cute touch.   Unfortunately I wasn't a fan of this place, mostly because the experience with the food made me kind of uncomfortable and skeptical about eating everything. I probably would not return to this place again."}
{"text":"Extremely impolite servers. Charged extra for items we did not order. Totally scammed us. Also, kicked us out after 45 mins... absolutely ridiculous.   I would've gave it 0 star if I can."}
