{"text":"The place is AWESOME!! I love it more than any place in Montreal. I feel comfortable and relaxed whenever I am at Cafe Aunja. The owners are so friendly, when you enter the place they smile at you and during their service they behave as if you are at one of your best friend's place. They have a creative choice of mix and match that you can mix any kind of tea with additives of your choice! I love to seat there for hours and hours and read books or talk to a friend in a cozy environment. I love this place and it's my first choice whenever I want to feel home while not going home!"}
{"text":"A beautifully decorated Iranian tea place in downtown Montreal, near Concordia campus.  Decor:  The high point of this place is its beautiful inviting decor. Warm string lights and wooden floors, chalkboard menu and vintage furniture. Bookshelves.  Drinks and food: I've only tried the special tea drinks: ginger & thyme and a mint tea. They come in mason jars and are very tasty.  Hours: open til 10 p.m. Yay! :)  Work-friendly: There are a few plugs for laptops, wifi is good. The chairs are mostly wooden. During the day, the atmosphere is quiet and work-friendly. There can sometimes be events at night.   Staff and service: I've had mixed experiences with staff. One time service was super slow and they forgot to bring our order. But other times it was prompt. Again, one time the cashier was pretty unfriendly, but other times staff have been chatty and friendly.  The owner is friendly and involved in the community and likes to host events (ex. readings, Nuit Blanche activities).  You order at the counter, then pay at the end as you leave."}
{"text":"Awful Place, Awful Service! Rude hosts, bad service, aggressive and unprofessional staff. The staff are untrained and have no idea about running a business. The staff are so aggressive they don't welcome costumers and while taking orders give attitude to the costumers. Their service is so bad it takes 45 mins to 1 h to have your order taken and another hour to receive your order wrong. They host private events during the public openings which makes the costumers so uncomfortable. The food quality is very low to be said and heavily competes with their service level. I strongly not recommend this place if you want a good food, good service and fun as these people are totally against all."}
{"text":"I came with a friend to study here.  However, the waitress forgot my order a couple times. In between, she came and asked if I had ordered anything (she forgot my order). I had to remind the other waiter for my soup. We were asked to move tables, quite coldly. Overall, not an enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Very nice selection of teas.  The ambience is very warm. Perfect place to grab a hot cup of tea and sit back relax or read on a cold winter day.  Love the fact that they hive the option to mix and match their teas."}
{"text":"Nice cozy place , good place to chill and hang out , good music  many choices for tea and Tisanes"}
{"text":"TRULY ADORABLE, FUN AND UNIQUE. This cafe offers a wide variety of hot/iced drinks you won't find anywhere else. Everyone in my party was incredibly impressed by everything in the cafe. Although the floating herbs in my Persian fragrance were at times distracting, the beautiful artwork and super cute (and jazzy!) atmosphere definitely made up for it. Absolutely check out this cafe after a day at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, or any other time!"}
{"text":"Very warm and welcoming atmosphere. I had a short stay in Montreal and I visited this place. I really loved it. Get some herbal tea. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Lots of tea selection here, and lovely decor as well. One or my favorite study spots - good wifi (passwords gingertea), outlets available, and they have both savoury food (sandwiches or soup) and great pastries as well! Also a great spot for catching up with friends."}
{"text":"Cute and cosy. Studious and quiet ambiance on a Tuesday evening. Try the big pot of tea where you can create your own tea blend and get a free biscotti! Great quality full leaves herbal teas available. Persian Rose flower, verbena, mountain tea, Lilly, magnolia, peach flower...wehewww, my head is spinning. Delicious homemade cakes. Will be back to play chess. That's all you need to know!"}
{"text":"I live in Cafe Aunja basically . I have been going to this place for years. I love their chai with freshly backed in Cafe Aunja . Very nice and warm environment with tradition classic design makes you feel relax and enjoy ."}
{"text":"Great little spot tucked away in the Concordia village. You could walk by this busy stretch of Sherbrooke many times and never notice this cafe. But what a find when you finally do!   I first dropped in this summer during Grand Prix. It was like finding an oasis in the desert - although in this case it was more like finding a quiet and relaxing spot amidst chaos, booth babes and the smell of gasoline. It has now become my ritual, every time I stop in at Concordia, I get a latte here. And it never disappoints.   The cafe is run by Iranians, which offer excellent coffees and teas as well as pastries. It is also a great spot to do some reading or studying."}
{"text":"Loved it here. I just had a pudding, but the atmosphere is great, the service is awesome, and there's a great selection of tea."}
{"text":"had relaxing tea time for an hour and more. just looking from outside, you can know that this is a right cafe to try.   all you can blend tea to share for 2-3per (7.50$), delicious fresh cake, cute cups, comfortable sofa, relaxing but fashionable atmosphere, lots tables, artistic website.  i totally felt in love with this Iranian style tea service. you choose your pot, then mix your favourite herbs, dry flowers, fruits, teas, by yourself. all stuffs are so neatly and so beautifully presented in glass jars that you feel like you wanna try them all.   i will definitely come back, for coffee next time:)"}
{"text":"You'd love the ambiance, the cute furniture and the pretty tea sets. The price is only decent. We ordered a big tea pot which came with some biscuits. A variety of teas to choose from. After consuming our big pot of tea, we asked to add boiled water to the remaining mix of teas and herbs! Cool, wasn't it?! So we had more tea (well a bit less tasty but fine) to sip while enjoying the company."}
{"text":"I didn't focus too much on their drinks in my last review and mostly talked about their ambience. Even though the ambience is still really nice, I disagree about the competitive pricing. Their drinks are definitely more expensive than elsewhere in downtown or plateau. I had their latte last time which tasted fair but I took their cappuccino this time which was super disappointing. It was served in a mug so I thought wow they are definitely serving coffee worth $4.00 but then I realized that 3/4th of the mug was literally foam. I know capuccino is supposed to be foamy but this was too frothy for me, I didn't get any real taste of the coffee. Actually I don't even know what I tasted, it wasn't coffee or milk or water. It didnt even smell that great and I added like four spoons of sugar to try and make it taste better. My brother took home made iced tea and couldn't finish it because the drink lacked flavour. My mother took homemade lemonade and I think they used lime instead of lemon because her drink was quite sour. They also don't have splenda.   Still a great looking place but never returning back after this experience, sorry."}
{"text":"Very nice and cozy place to hang out with your friends, delicious coffee n tasty tea !!"}
{"text":"The place has a cute ambiance and you'd think they'd have a samovar if they were Persian but I think the place kind of does its own thing. Although the place does have Persian culture events, which is good.  Other than that it is a rather overpriced, I spent 6.33 with tax on a \"tea\" that was literally some dried spices with a splash of rose water in a jar.  I guess it's okay if you're in the area and looking for something different, I just wouldn't want to spend that much on a drink, but they have cheaper options."}
{"text":"Great rustic, cozy, kind of bohemian vibe. Perfect if you're looking for a small, familiar place to study or get some peace. Not loud, but not completely quiet because it's a small space, but the comfort of the space makes up for that very easily.   The food is great, not to mention their different pleasant drinks they offer. Nothing like any other café you've seen. They offer water and syrup based beverages, a couple being saffron syrup, hibiscus syrup, and rose as well, which are all super refreshing and tasty. Most importantly the ambiance is super unique as it has a home-y feel to it, with cozy couches and comfortable seats. If I could describe the setting in a more understandable way I'd say it's sort of bohemian, with a natural and earthy feel (no earthy scent though don't worry lol), and also extremely student friendly with many books displayed on the shelves all around the café. There is also free wifi. Regular coffee options are of course offered as well, for the less daring of the traditional Persian drinks. Again, they offer very good sandwiches and pastries, as well as ethnically different desserts as to what would be expected in other cafés, which is greatly appreciated.   Great for after a long day at school, at the Museum of Fine Arts as it's only a short walk away, or simply a big day of walking around in the city. Would definitely recommend, and I come every time I come downtown :)"}
{"text":"Cafe Aunja is one of the most beautiful cafes in Montreal, and you know there is no shortage of cafes in Montreal!! There are plants, hanging lights, communal tables, comfy chairs, art work on display, antique looking chairs & tables, bookshelves, persian pottery & tiles, exposed brick, and more! Even their dishes are cute! I've come here to work or study and despite being a popular spot, it's pretty quiet & cozy!  Their prices are slightly higher than the average independent cafe in Montreal but it's honestly marginal.  They have tons of different types of tea so definitely check it out if you're a tea snob. I really like their tea latte.  Good service, too!  Cafe Aunja also hosts many events and they set up a hafseen in March for Persian new year.  If you're visiting Montreal and staying downtown or visiting the Montreal Fine Arts Museum (Musee de Beaux Arts), I definitely recommend checking out Cafe Aunja.  It's also a good place to study!"}
{"text":"A quaint and cozy neighbourhood cafe tucked under a few steps off of Sherbrooke. You can easily lose track of time here with a friend, your favourite book, or some work.   They serve food, coffee, and have a variety of teas to choose from, many of which will keep you warm this winter!"}
{"text":"A quaint coffee shop with a warm atmosphere. It is decorated with random pieces of furniture that contribute to its cozy/warm vibes. Personally, I ordered a latte (which was delicious) but it seems that the tea is what you must get here. The tea is served in mason jar-like containers that hold various tea leaves and whatever else will make the tea (fresh ginger, lemon wedges, honey etc). There was a Persian tea of some sort that looked particularly enticing.   The sandwiches here look amazing as well. Evidently made with fresh ingredients, they appeared generous in size and fulfilling in content.   Beware that the spot is busy, and thus quite noisy with the chatter of patrons within. The place seems short-staffed, so I think it was hard to keep up with the number of orders. Consequently, it took longer for tables and spaces to be cleared out if customers didn't do it themselves.   For those unfamiliar with the shop, it's worth noting the unusual payment system. You wait in line to place your order, and once you're ready to pay, you get back in line to pay. A bit inefficient to the American consumer (such as myself) but it works, I guess!"}
{"text":"2.5 stars. The place is really cute and cozy but the prices are a bit too high in my opinion. I got the hot chocolate which tasted good. It had a bit of a twist since I think they put cardamom in it. Maybe that's why they charge over 4 dollars for it, I don't know, but it was a good experience overall."}
{"text":"If you're a big tea fan, you'd love this one, especially if you're a Concordia student (it's literally down the road from the HB). The prices are not super cheap, but they are well worth the price. The first time I was there, I got to sit at the window seat with really cute plants next to me, with this beautiful cup of tea. It was so nice! And the service was really great too, the cashier kindly explain the menu and recommended according to what I wanted that day. It's probably a great place to bring a date if you want it to be cutesy. I know I'd be swooning if you brought me there (especially if we get the window seat)."}
{"text":"Nice little cafe. Ordered a latte which was very good and half an avocado sandwich which was pretty healthy but a little bland. A sprinkle of salt would have helped. Wanted to order soup but they don't start serving it until 12"}
{"text":"I used to come study here a lot, very quiet and cozy little coffee shop tucked in on Sherbrooke. Their tea mixes are absolutely delectable, i love their ginger tea that come with honey as well as the persian summer drink with cucumbers (I forget the name) and the jujube tea! The warm teas are a tad too sweet so I just keep asking them for more and more hot water and it still tastes good after the third cup!  They have amazing pastries as well, my favourite is definitely the almond pear cake, just the right amount of sweetness. I've tried their brunch as well, very very good, it comes with many side dishes (baked grapefruit, cheese) but it is quite pricy ($20).  Overall very cute place to study, do work, meet friends, date, etc."}
{"text":"Cafes like this are just one of the many reasons I miss Montreal so much. This places manages to hit a perfect checklist of things I want in a coffee shop, and I'll run through some of them.  A: Good working environment. Despite being in a fairly small place, there is a lot of seating, it is fully economized (no wasted space here), and it still doesn't feel like everybody's elbow to elbow. There's also wifi.  B: Solid tea and coffee options. The tea latte was a favorite of mine, and you get a shocking amount of beverage out of that little teapot. But some of their non-caffeinated options are just as good: water flavored with lemon and a variety of spices is surprisingly good at waking you up without leaving you jittery.  C: The orienting theme is Persian, which comes across in the decor. It's not overly stylized, but it doesn't feel sterile like so many other cafes.  D: The baked goods are seriously on point. I had a rosewater and saffron cake that was perfectly balanced in terms of flavor, with nothing too overwhelming or at risk of smothering the other flavors, and that is a difficult combination to pull off.  E: Having sandwiches available for purchase. Much as I love baked goods and coffee, eventually the human body needs something more substantial to function. And the sandwiches aren't like the bland crap you find in so many other places, but are actually well-made, with appropriate levels of condiments. Even the bread is good.  Maybe I'll move back here."}
{"text":"I really love the laid back atmosphere at Aunja, and everything I've gotten there has been spectacular."}
{"text":"Nice spot in the city center of Montreal on Sherbrooke St near Metro Peel.  Had a cortado, was pretty good and the place is nice. Big even if full of customers on a rainy Sunday afternoon, I would go back there and try different drinks and food for the next time.  Price range is normal for a nice coffee shop in Montreal."}
{"text":"Cute persian hippy cafe with great pastries.  Very nice ambiance with wooden tables and books everywhere.  Great teas, coffees and pastries"}
{"text":"This place is great! I've only been here once but the atmosphere is perfect. It really charming and cozy. It wasn't noisy at all and it was the perfect place to talk. There was plenty of space when I went and the tables weren't cramped. They had a wide selection of teas as well as espresso and coffee. I would highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Great little place to grab a bite, hang out with a good book, or come and chill with friends."}
{"text":"This place has a chill and comfy vibe of a local cafe but still nails their decorations with globe lights, paintings and antique wooden furniture.  It feels very relaxing to be there, especially because they specialize in teas in mason jars. Although a little overpriced, it's nothing too different from other overpriced cafes and their drinks are very unique so I say it's worth it.   I love their London Fog because they serve it with dried lavender on top, which adds a nice touch."}
{"text":"Had a nice tea latte here with my friend. I loved that our drinks came in their own individual teapots, but I thought the tea itself was a little bland. Pricey, too. Still, it was a great place to escape from the cold in for an hour."}
{"text":"The place in itself feels very special! The wooden tables, the brick walls, the jazz music playing in the background, the book shelves, the sweet smell, and the fairy lights adding a factory vibe to this cosy place. Staff is very welcoming, and its easy to get some work done. Their limonade is delicious!"}
{"text":"I'd actually give this place 3.5 stars but that's not an option.  I came here to do work and upon entering was immediately charmed by the atmosphere and decor. I ordered the Persian fragrance tea because I thought it sounded interesting. It ended up being hot water with a bunch of floating flowers and loose leaf tea. To be honest, it was quite overpriced and not worth it.  Food wise I was a bit more impressed- I ordered the lentil soup and a roast beef sandwich. The soup was definitely home made and delicious. I just wish there was more of it. The roast beef sandwich was really rich and was quite a generous portion. It did leave me with a bit of a stomach ache though because it was so rich.  In terms of a place to study, I don't think I'll be coming back here. The other customers were really load and kept bumping into my chair. Also I found it overpriced for what I got.   Definitely a cute place for a coffee date though!"}
{"text":"Got horrible food poisoning from the half cheese sandwich and salad trio. Shared tea and no one else got sick. Had not eaten before this so positive it was from Aunja. Shame because it's a neat place and I want to support local business!"}
{"text":"In the concrete jungle that is downtown - this place is tops for lovely vibes, pretty decor and fancy Persian tea. Love!"}
{"text":"I'm not a tea lover but thanks to this sweet little coffee shop, because I can say that I changed my mind for ever. Like first impression, the place is cozy, very well decorated and warm.  They offer coffee, tea, sandwiches and desert. In the begging I was confused between the tutti frutti tea & the persian tea and finally I opted for the last one !! the mixe of persian rose, orange blossom, lemon and honey is just perfect.  I'm happy that a friend of mine invited me to discover this place and I'll definitley return for another cup of tea and sure I'll recommand it to my friends."}
{"text":"I was visiting Montreal and a friend took me to Cafe Aunja for a tea. What a charming little place. It's definitely unique in its own way. If you like to have a tea or coffee and enjoy a comforting environment while reading a book or doing some work this is the place."}
{"text":"This cafe is absolutely beautiful. Once walks into the incredible warm atmosphere and a delicious soothing smell. The furniture is charming and makes me want to go back and try out all the different nooks and crannies so I can claim a favourite spot!  The staff are very friendly and were kind enough to help me choose something. I tried the snowman's surprise which was different to anything i've ever had before. Perhaps it's an acquired taste but in the hot winter it's absolutely refreshing.   This is the perfect place for a sweet afternoon conversation with friends or a date. Definitely going back and would recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"Just had the worst pasta ever in my life here...worst presentation, knew the taste won't be good already.I should say the interior design is nice, and the vibe is pretty good for a weekend chill. But food is over priced. The tasteless pasta + lemonade cost me $14+. I will attach a picture"}
{"text":"Es ist eingerichtet wie ein Wohnzimmer. Es gibt ein Bücherregal und (hoffentlich) wechselnde Bilderausstellungen (diese zerstören nämlich momentan das Ambiente. Kuchenauswahl ist bescheiden, sieht aber gut aus. Es gibt Wlan und guten Americano."}
{"text":"This is it. I just discovered my favourite coffee shop in Montreal. This place is located on Sherbrooke street but it's nothing like crazy hustle in downtown. I really like the ambiance, decor, and quietness. The tea latte and orange and coconut cake that I ordered were also wonderful."}
{"text":"We came here after touring the museum of fine arts, as it's only a block away. Great service, tasty food, and cute ambiance! Their sandwiches are delicious and the summer tea drinks are unique and refreshing. The waiter even gave us a few smaller drinks to try on the house. A little on the pricy side but well worth checking out if you're in the area."}
{"text":"From teas to coffees, their drinks here are so well thought out and put together. The ambiance is warm and young, there's even a piano if you want to be obnoxious!!"}
{"text":"Downtown Gem tucked away with simplicity, charm, and a wholesome menu. I had a warm & fresh brie baguette sandwich,  with light lentil soup, flavourful with fresh herbs, and a lemonade prettied with fresh mint. Cozy, fresh, peaceful. A welcome change from the bustling downtown vibe.  As someone else mentioned, its ambience is nicely paired with a visit to the Musée des Beaux Arts."}
{"text":"This Persian cafe is a delight to visit and get some work done (if required). With gentle music, good food, and fantastic tea; Cafe Aunja left little to be desired. The ambiance was great, but the food was pricy considering my vegetable sandwich was mediocre. However, with all factors accounted for, (free and quick WiFi), I recommend visiting for their tea and coffee."}
{"text":"My friend introduced me to this café near Concordia on the Sherbrooke street. A very casual ambience, filled with students mostly. It has very interesting coffee and tea options. In addition, they have soups and salads if you feel hungry while studying there. They have home-made kind cakes, which I loved. In addition, the internet is fast enough to get some real work done while you are there :)"}
{"text":"Aunja is a cafe which has a cozy, inviting atmosphere and great food and drink.  They have a vast tea selection some very high quality baked goods.  My raisin roll was very fresh and the Tutti Frutti tea that I had was loaded with chunks of fresh fruit.  So why three stars?  The pricing which was a bit excessive.  That Tutti Frutti tea and raisin roll were $10.  The tea alone was $5 and yes I enjoyed it but that is quite steep."}
{"text":"I came here twice, once for a show my friend was playing in and another time to do some studying with a friend The food here is relatively expensive, the hot chocolate was like 6$ but it was delicious and pretty big It has a really cozy atmosphere, pretty hipster and the type of place that's good for a lunch date or something When I came for my friend's show my ears were bleeding tho so turn down volume maybe Nice friendly staff, my friend got the sandwich and said it was good Great location on Sherbrooke, very easy to find and a in a nice neighbourhood"}
{"text":"I am a fan because this café is really heart-warming. The place has a nice decoration and a enjoyable atmosphere. You can find books, a lot of tea boxes, chess (not sure) games, a couch and an old keyboard. Also, it is so close to Concordia  I have been there 3 times, and I must say, my heart likes the place better than my wallet does... Indeed, the latte and the home-made lemonade were actually good (although I am usually not a huge fan of lemon things).  The tea I tasted was ok but could have been better if I had received good advice from the waiter (who did not look like he was passionate). Still, I will try not to go too often, as the prices are not the cheapest, but, well, I guess you also pay for the atmosphere and the cute little tea set they serve you in."}
{"text":"Lovely café close to Concordia and Museum of fine arts, very artsy decor and cute menu, the price is a bit high but worth it, their blend of tea is really original and colourful! I like the Persian colours one very much!"}
{"text":"It is a nice little place. I am a person who does not take caffeine. I loved there teas. It is a little expensive though."}
{"text":"Very nice place for an afternoon tea or coffee, or for a pick-up after visiting the museum! It is beautifully decorated and has a nice vibe to it. The menu is good and the teas/coffees themselves are also good. A bit pricey, but worth it!"}
{"text":"So the environment is really good and I guess if you stop here you should really conceptualize it as paying for that as well. Cuz holy moly, a small pot of herbal tea for 5 dollars? It was just chamomile! But I did spend two hours here reading and it was quiet and there are lots of outlets."}
{"text":"I come here again and again. An awesome place to spend a couple of hours in. You can find a variety of tables and chairs around. Quiet place in general (except some weekends when there is an event going on). You can even throw your birthday here.  They have a very nice collection of teas from which you can select any mix & match that you like, AND it is called the \"Mix & Match\" Shelf! The environment is quite cosy and nice. You will find its walls full of pictures, mostly head shots of anonymous people by Hamed, one of the owners of this place who is a professional photographer as well. Their coffee is nice, very delicious sweets and newly awesome croissants. They even have some warm food like paninis and soup. I have tried their Mushroom soup. It is served in a bread! YES! They pour the soup in the bread and serve it for you. It is really great. You can taste the mushrooms. It is really delicious."}
{"text":"lovely atmosphere, basic good food, like sandwiches and salads. A good variety of tea, and coffee too. I was a bit disappointed in their mint lemonade, I expected it to be blended together, but it was just a lemonade with mint leaves in it (which is good too, but not what I expected)."}
{"text":"What a lovely find!  A charming Iranian cafe Witt excellent cappuccino tasty cakes and breakfasts. The staff are warm and friendly. The ambiance is very zen. Soft Iranian music mixed with jazz. A library, a wall of Middle Eastern knickknacks and beautiful tiles add to the welcoming feeling.  I had a house special tea Persian Fog - layers of saffron syrup, Iranian tea, foamy milk and sprinkles of crushed pistachios.  So good!!!"}
{"text":"J'aime vraiment la deco de grand mere, des plantes, porcelaine, vieux meubles et fleurs. Bon service. Le thé au gingembre delicieux."}
