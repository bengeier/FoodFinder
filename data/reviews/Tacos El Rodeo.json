{"text":"Best barcacoa in town!!!, hand made tortillas, beans are delicious!!! Totally recomended, don't get fooled by the outside."}
{"text":"Saw a write up on a Vegas website with great review so I put it on my to do list. Apparently this place has been here for 9 years, that's a certainly a good sign.  Great service.  I had the 4 taco plate; 2 barbacoas y 2 asadas.  Asada was very good, barbacoa was also good but a little fatty, it's goat meat BTW.  They have Mexican Coke which I much prefer.  Wife had Pastor and chicken tacos.  She liked this place better than Tacos El Gordo and she's Mexican."}
{"text":"Located in a small and unassuming old strip mall on North Decatur is the kind of gem that can easily be overlooked, yet has stood the test of time (now in their second decade). Although the \"tripa\" has really been a standout, so far we have not found a taco that would not be ordered again, with each being well thought out in preparation, and generous in the meat portions. A four taco \"combination\" comes with a basket of chips while you are waiting, which can be used to try the different concoctions from their salsa bar. Have not gone beyond the tacos yet, because they simply are so damn good.  You can see in the presentation, and taste on the palate, just how much these folks care about their product."}
{"text":"We tasted the barbacoa and carne asada tacos.  The tortillas were really good!  The varieties of hot salsas in the bar were spicy!  The barbacoa is not your Texmex style barbacoa but it was good.  A little greasy but tasty.  The carne asada taco didn't have too much meat in the taco but overall tasted good.  We tasted a consom√© that had an acquired taste.  Not a common plate from where we are from."}
{"text":"This place looked good from outside and walking in left i was transported to Jalisco and with the Ambience felt I was about to enjoy an authentic meal but quite the contrary.... Service was the worst and food completely sucked!!!! Absolutely no flavor I could have made better chilaquiles and better Barbacoa   Only one guy working and it was the worst service waited 20 minutes for coffee and the place wasn't busy.   It's a great concept and feels and looks like one will enjoy a great meal but false advertisement   You've been warned!"}
{"text":"Omg I've lived across the street from this place and am so upset that I never stopped by. Best tacos I've had in town so far.... Everything we ordered was great... Even my kids (who can be picky) loved it here. This is a hole in the wall place you can't go without trying... You won't be disappointed. Handmade tortillas..... And great service"}
{"text":"Stopped in on a whim because the restaurant I initially intended on going to was on a 30 min wait. I was beyond impressed with this place. Easily the best bang for your buck. I ordered a chicken burrito with green salsa in addition to the limeade (my god that was good). The people who run the place are very friendly too. Will certainly go back to try their tacos next!"}
{"text":"Missed the mark. Their specialty is suppose to be shredded beef. Everything was very bland. The Tortillas were amazing (Seemed to be hand made). They had football on that was good."}
{"text":"Well where do I start? I live pretty much directly across the street from barbacoa...I go here quite often because of this. I would definitely recommend the Taquiza combination plate you get 4 tacos which you can choose every taco to be 4 different types of meat  . I have loved everything I have ever tried from the tacos ( I LOVE THE carne asada, shrimp & al pastor as my combination), burritos very nice size always delicious,  enchiladas and of course the shrimp cocktail.  I'm a regular so they know my face and the love they put into the food only makes it better. I have never left disappointed ever!  The fresh homemade tortillas are so great I might add to. See you again next week :)"}
{"text":"Ordered from here after not ordering out for awhile. Originally I was going to give them a three, but after everything I decided on a two. We ordered a chicken enchilada meal (with rice and beans $11.50), a quesadilla con carne plato ($6.50), an order of taquiza (four of their tacos with rice and beans $10.00), an order of queso ($2.00), and then two sides of sour cream ($2.00).     The quesadilla was pretty good and for the price great, the enchiladas were dry, almost no sauce and drenched in sour cream which I'm normally all for, but it was a lot and I was sharing with someone who hates sour cream. The description on the third party website did not say in included sour cream.      The tacos were hit and miss. The chicken and the shrimp were tasty, but the other two, the carnitas and asada were bland and quite frankly tasted the same. I think they messed up the order? Anyway, they also forgot my queso. It's only $2.00, but we were really looking forward to that. Also, for a $1.00 charge for each extra side of sour cream is crazy high because it is a tiny amount, so I'd watch out for that.     On a more positive note, the tortillas were delicious, same with the rice and beans. And they also made sure we had utensils, napkins and gave us a huge amount of limes and cotija cheese on the side."}
{"text":"All I can say is...  I love you for existing and hate you at the same time. Sigh, I miss my skinny jeans ;)"}
{"text":"I been coming here for year and I haven't been disappointed. Food is consistently good! Super family friendly. I drive from Henderson for this hidden authentic Mexican food gem."}
