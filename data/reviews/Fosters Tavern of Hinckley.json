{"text":"New to the area and stopped in for lunch.  Met the new owner and she was very friendly. My husband tried the fried bologna and it was tasty.  I had crab stuffed shrimp and they we excellent.  The service was great and we enjoyed our lunch.   We will be going back."}
{"text":"The food took forever and there were only 2 other couples there. The service was awful, no explanation as to where our food was and most of the time the staff was in the back. No flavor to the food...awful. Completely overpriced, not worth trying."}
{"text":"This is the most ignorant bar I have ever been in. If your not a regular they must want nothing to do with you. I went in with my parents and I today and we were looking to have a cocktail and maybe some appetizers on the way home from a family outing. We ordered our drinks and the first thing the barmaid was worried about was checking my id, I'm 35. Lol she poured our drink and I asked if she had a appetizer platter. The barmaid said \"no\" and walked away. She never offered a recommendation or something to order, she just walked away. She then handed me my tab. It was 10 dollars and I left a 2 dollar tip. My mother then made a comment to her about how tight the bar was and the \"highly intelligent\" barmaid, who is obviously good with small talk, just shrugged her shoulders. I decided to walk out. I was willing to spend possibly 60 to 80 dollars worth of money to drinks and appetizers to this bar, but we decided to walk out with 12 dollars paid. Come here with your own risk!"}
{"text":"Our first visit and we were worried because of other reviews, however it was a great time.   Service was excellent and friendly and the food was good.  This is a nice causal bar/restaurant.   Don't expect fine dining food but a nice time at your local pub/eatery.  They cook a 1 pound burger perfectly. Great service, food brought to the table at the right time, no rush, drinks promptly refilled, we will go again!"}
{"text":"The service was terrible and the food was mediocre at best.  You could go somewhere much nicer for the price."}
{"text":"Tried this place a couple of times, each time trying different food.... just nothing great. The entrance is a little weird, staff not overly excited to see customers each time."}
{"text":"This is a great local bar/restaurant. Everyone is so nice and the food is incredible. The only thing that stinks is IT IS SMALL, but Honestly the atmosphere is pretty cool, as long as you don't mind your neighbors."}
{"text":"Tried to go here but place was closed on a Monday evening at 7:30 no hours posted all signs on doors locked. Nobody answered the phone so we left"}
{"text":"Fosters is a Hinckley staple with very hearty food at reasonable prices. I consider their burger and fries to be on par with any in the area. Their fried bologna sandwich is a staple and their fish fries are definitely worth it."}
{"text":"Fosters has that corner bar familiarity but the food is much better than virtually any bar you find.  The burgers are better than BSpot (sorry Michael).  The boys love the pizza and most of the food is home made.  The staff are friendly and goove good basic service.  There are a decent number of tables so it is fine to bring the kids."}
{"text":"Great pizza, good burgers. Waitress was helpful. Sat us in the basement next to the bathrooms. Not a great spot but the upstairs was full. Noisy pinball machines down there so it's a little annoying, but I can imagine it would be fine when there are more people and they had the music on down there. A little on the pricey side, but not too bad.  I'd go back."}
{"text":"this bar is right down the street from my parents' house in hinckley and it's where we meet up when the whole fam is back in town. drinks are strong and reasonably priced, dece beer selection (especially in bottles) and their pierogis are realllllllllllllyyy good. and i'm a polish catholic from cleveland so i know a thing or two bout pierogis, son.   i don't get the hate for this place. well ok one time my husband (who is from maine) got denied service ostensibly because of his out of state ID but we were drunk 22 year olds and i wouldn't want to serve us at midnight either haha so i won't hold that against them. goooo fosters! keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"I don't get all the bad reviews. I have been here a few times and the food was always fantastic. Their burgers are amazing."}
{"text":"This place was very cute and quaint. Love that it is family owned. More of a pub typed place, not very kid friendly. There isn't a kid's menu, or cups with lids for children. We were a little disappointed in the mini taco appetizer that was $7 for 10 soggy tortilla chips wrapped around beef that was microwaved, however, the pizza was absolutely fabulous, and we would definitely come back to order the pizza.  If Foster's was more child-friendly I would have given a better rating!"}
{"text":"We were just passing through going back to Columbus from my high school reunion and stopped for lunch. We were so-o-o pleased.The waitress was very accommodating. The pirogues were wonderful and the fish sandwich huge! A real find for us."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick bite to eat on a Saturday night. My husband and I were seated quickly and the food was delicious! Everything is homemade and priced reasonably. Kind and helpful staff! We had Dawn as our waitress, who was outstanding :) We'll be back!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful, laid back atmosphere.   Great service, very friendly staff.  Fried bologna and French fries were delicious.  Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I went here for the first time with my boyfriends family. When we walked in needless to say I was hit in the face with a odd smell that was a mix of mildew and possibly pee. I didn't want to insult my boyfriends family so I just went with it and had dinner. Fruit flies were everywhere so I decided to take my food \"to go\" aka threw it in the dumpster. The only reason this place got 2 stars was because the staff was nice. Save yourself the trip."}
{"text":"We popped in on a Saturday after hiking at Hinckley Reservation (12:30ish) and the bar tender was on his own. He was very apologetic about delays, even though there weren't any. We were fine with just having a relaxing lunch.  The boys LOVED their meals! Youngest had his heart set on BBQ chicken pizza despite it not being on the menu. But they accommodated his request.  I had the Bacon jam burger and it tasted scrumptious! Nice and juicy, but not too messy."}
{"text":"Fantastic, mouth-watering burgers!  Angus beef that melts in your mouth.  Mmm, Mmm, great!  First time we have been here, will definitely return and recommended to others.  Thank you Foster's Tavern for a great dining experience.  Atmosphere is great also...but the burgers are FANTASTIC!!! Ask for June, she is a great waitress! They also take call ahead reservations!!!"}
{"text":"This place is terrible. We gave it 2 chances, no better the second time.  We went on a Tuesday night - around 515pm.  There were multiple people at the bar, but only one other table getting food.  It took over 40 minutes for a burger, 2 grill cheeses and a quesadilla.  Unfortunately, we had to be somewhere - so we asked them to box it up.  Unfortunately, they got that wrong too.  One of the grill cheeses was DOUSED in garlic butter and came with fries - while the other one was correct with the tomato soup.  Also are bill was OVER $50 which is ridiculous for that amount of food.  There were limited apologizes and no bill adjustment for the length of time that it took.  Also, they do not have a kids menu, thus, you end up paying a ton for a kids meal.  I will be driving elsewhere for our food."}
