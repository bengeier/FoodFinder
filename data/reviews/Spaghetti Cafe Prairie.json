{"text":"One of a kind cafe restaurant. They are serving all pasta. Every dish was executed with finesse . Flavor is on the spot. If you want to experience a different kind of pasta or comfort food, this is the perfect place to go!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch today after reading a review. Looked interesting but wasn't sure what to expect.  It turns out it's much like what I've seen various travel episodes. Order from a short menu on the wall & pay up front. Not licensed.  That being said, service was quick and courteous. We ordered Gringo \"safe\" dishes (tomato for Di, Japanese Chicken for me). The portions were plentiful and the flavours were fresh and delicious.  Would I go again; you bet. Well worth the trip. Next time I won't be so timid and will be more adventurous in ordering. A delicious change from Pho & Bun."}
{"text":"Takeshi makes the best spaghetti EVER!! As a smaller business it can sometimes be a little slow to receive your meal, but it's absolutely worth it. The prairie spaghetti is my favourite. Go with the garlic toast."}
{"text":"I got a menu and a coupon for this place and decided to try it out. I really liked it. The place was very clean and had a good atmosphere, the staff were extremely nice. ive now been twice and really liked the dishes I had and the portions are huge. Great place"}
{"text":"First time here after reading an article on CBC about the owner. The restaurant itself is very small (up to 5-7 tables). I would suggest bringing no more than four people as the kitchen is tiny and there is only 1 server (she was a very nice lady). I really like the concept though as the restaurant specializes in one thing and one thing only....spaghetti! We need more of this type of specialized restaurants!!  Now I rank my food based on the price I pay. With an economical price of $12 (include garlic toast and drink), I would say the quality is really good. I can't think of anywhere else that's better within the same price range. Some restaurants try to get away with the overcooked pasta by heavily dousing the sauce hoping the customer wouldn't notice (*sigh*). At Spaghetti Cafe, you can actually taste the pasta and it compliments the sauce well. The only problem I had was that it was slightly thin on the pasta. My friends had no problem so might have been just me. I would recommend this restaurant and hope it   catches more attention because it deserves it! RL"}
{"text":"I really think that Japaghetti should be the next big thing. I've been here a couple times now and am really impressed with this restaurant for a few reasons.   This place is a simple, no-frills restaurant. There are a good number of pasta dishes, soups, and some rotating specials. I know that pasta is pretty basic, but Spaghetti Cafe Prairie does it well! They have unique combinations (bacon and egg? Japanese chicken?!) and the pasta is consistently cooked. Their garlic bread is also fantastic, and making your meal a combo with bread and a drink costs next to nothing! I also have to give them kudos for the great and prompt service, they remember each customer and are always aiming to please.   I'm also a sucker for general quaintness. These guys have it down pat, and they also love wrestling! Had to give a star for that too. And they're on Skip The Dishes! Double bonus."}
{"text":"I'm Japanese myself  and I went here Thursday to try it out ...and out the door  I went ,had the Japanese spaghetti and sorry Japanese need to make Sushi pasta I  an art to itself and cannot keep on getting changed by whom ever gets up in the morning."}
{"text":"If you don't feel like cooking this is a good place to go right on 16th in the Bowness area. I went because I saw the 4 & 5 star reviews and was intrigued by Italian/Japanese inspired cuisine. Overall this place is just too simple for my taste and entertainment dollars so I won't be going back.  To be fair though I will give it a full review for others who may be interested...The decor is basic. It seats about 25-30 ppl, there is no table service and canned or bottled beverages. There is no liquor licence, one gender neutral bathroom and paper napkins. The menu includes minestrone soup, green salad, garlic toast (3 slices/order) and the option to have a lot of extra add-ons. The 10 or more pasta dishes look good and all have pictures up on the wall.   I tried the Japanese Spaghetti (pasta, soy sauce, green onions & chicken) because all the reviews had given it 5 Stars. I'd give it 2/4 but my son's Meatball Spaghetti was much better! The meatballs were homemade, the sauce was a bit oily on the plate but good flavour. The pasta on all three dishes was very good and cooked a perfect al dente. The salad was crisp and didn't have too much dressing. The garlic bread was really good and I ordered a second side which I probably shouldn't have but I just loved the flavour!   The service was polite, welcoming and fast. She never really asked us how things were or cleared our table. This is a true cafeteria type place where you refill your own water and coffee. She was also filling a few Skip the Dishes take out orders and seemed to keep quite busy."}
{"text":"I came back!!this time I ordered large bowl of Minestrone and Salmon Spaghetti. I really recommend this Minestrone soup that has a lots of veggies, thick tomato base and bacon!! And the salmon spaghetti has lemon flavor?it was a little bit strong for me but salmon was tasty so I will ask next time less lemon."}
{"text":"I wanted to try something different and I heard about Spaghetti Cafe Prairie in Montgomery. It's a small utilitarian spot that does take-out and a few tables to eat in. Take-out here seemed popular with other customers.  The owner is Japanese, and specializes in Japanese style spaghetti. He mentioned he doesn't use water in any of the sauces, but chicken, vegetarian or seafood stock. Everything but the noodles are homemade by him at his restaurant. Most dishes range from $8 to $11.50.   You order and pay at the front, and someone brings the food out to you when it's ready. Food arrived quickly and it was steaming hot. The portion was filling enough. The creamy nut spaghetti was like a cross between pad thai and dan dan noodles. The Japanese chicken pasta was light, refreshing and had notes of soy sauce.    Lunch time has a special - spaghetti and meatballs for $9.50. At dinner, if you tell them you saw their ad in the community newsletter, you get free garlic bread :-)"}
{"text":"Food is great.  The dining area is spotless.  The service is beyond fantastic. Support small family business!!"}
{"text":"I ordered from Skip the Dishes and am so impressed. We had the carbonara and Aglio Olio Peperoncino and both were excellent. They were very freshly made, hot and the carbonara had tons of bacon. Will definitely continue to order!"}
{"text":"Great hidden gem. Anyone who's been to Japan knows spaghetti is popular there. Except they put their own spin on the dish. This tastes authentic. Very umame! Thank you for opening in Calgary!"}
{"text":"Wow stopped here on the spur of the moment having the Japanese chicken and wife is having the shrimp and. cilantro.no the are perfectly a ldenti and the flavor  combinations are so fresh and new. not your typical he olde spaghetti factory . we are coming back to try the salmon spaghetti next week."}
{"text":"Excellent little Japanese style pasta shop! Good prices and tasty food. We had the carbonara and the spaghetti with meatballs, both were great. Will definitely return when I get the craving for pasta - much better value than many Italian places, and the food is great."}
{"text":"The restaurant was ok. The menu had a good variety of items and the spaghetti was good, crossing slightly over to a type of gourmet spaghetti (the way they have gourmet hot dogs and tacos nowadays). The few of us ordered different dishes and tried each other's food. They were all good.  However, the restaurant is a far/isolated location. But they do have parking right outside the restaurant. Although it is shared with other businesses, so if it's full, there is probably street parking.  It feels like you are sitting in a cafeteria/food court looking up at the (overly large) menu above the counter where you have to go up to order and then go back to your table. They do serve you your food, so you don't have to pick it up from the counter. However, if you want water, you do have to go up and get it yourself from the self-serve station. I believe they also have self-serve coffee, but I think you have to pay for it separately. But I suggest you don't get the coffee at all. It tastes like instant coffee from a can. It's weak and bland. They should just get a Keurig if that's the kind of coffee they plan to serve.  Back to the menu...I remember how large it was that it took away from the whole look of the restaurant. It was distracting and I kept looking up at it throughout my meal wondering if I should have ordered a different item instead. I guess that's a good and a bad thing because the food was good, but I couldn't help wondering if I could have gotten a better item. Hmm. I just think they need to get rid of the billboard menu and stick with personal menus to bring to guests at their table and take our orders at our table. Especially with the far location, it's not like a grab-and-go experience. You want to feel like you are there to dine and not to eat quickly after driving all that way to get there.  I probably won't return again unless I go with friends who want to go to check it out."}
{"text":"Found this gem  hidden off 16th Avenue by Bowness and recently dropped in for lunch.. It was quiet when I was there so after owner Takeshi cooked my spaghetti, he came out to chat and sit with me for a few minutes to tell me about his cafe.  The concept of a Japanese Spaghetti Cafe started in Japan in the 90's. Before that they ate their spaghetti with ketchup. Then people became wealthier and decide to focus on an Italian favourite, spaghetti but with their own spin.  The Spaghetti Cafe is the only one of it's kind in Calgary and offers up over 15 different kinds of spaghetti including a few classics like the aglio oilo which he says is the base to every spaghetti dish he makes.   I ventured into the unknown and tried the Japanese Chicken Spaghetti made with a little soya sauce, chicken broth, sesame seeds, green onions and more ingredients I'm sure he didn't tell me about. It was good. Simple but flavourful. And a decent sized plate for a great price I might add. I couldn't eat it all so I took half of it home.  My experience was great as was the food. It's a little cafe that doesn't seat many at once, but worth the wait. Going to bring the kidlets back for a plate of spaghetti the next time we have a free moment."}
{"text":"Wow!  I must say I totally agree with John Gilchrist.  Spaghetti Café Prairie is a very good restaurant which showcases their spaghetti in different ways with a Japanese/Italian touch.  The chef is Japanese but prepares these wonderful spaghetti dishes: Tomato Sauce Spaghetti Prairie Spaghetti (Bacon & Egg on Tomato Sauce) Spaghetti Meatballs Chilli Spaghetti Spaghetti Melanzane Aglio Olio Peperoncino Grilled Veggie Spaghetti Shrimp & Cilantro ***** Salmon Spaghetti Japanese Chicken (Soy Sauce Infused) ***** Cream Bacon Asparagus Spaghetti Carbonara ***** Tomato Cream Shrimp Creamy Nuts Spaghetti (with extra add-on Chicken) ***** (I had the chicken add-on) Those denoted with ***** are the ones we ordered.  All so deliciously prepared with lots of TLC!   The spaghetti was perfectly cooked al dente.    Sides - Garlic Toast, Green Salad and Soup  The restaurant is located right beside the Esso gas station on 16 Ave NW going west and 46 St NW in a strip mall.  There's a liquor store on the corner and an Indian restaurant on the other corner.    We'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Ordered takeout tonight, as the family wanted pasta but, wasn't feeling like Chianti's. Best decision of the week! The food is amazing. I had heard of Japanese spaghetti restaurants in Vancouver and Toronto. We're lucky to have this one, here. We ordered a ton. Everything was great. My favourites were the \"Prairie\" with bacon and eggs and tomato sauce, and the Japanese chicken. Great flavours in all that we ordered. Meatballs were really good, along with the Carbonara. Can't recommend this place highly enough. I'm excited for leftovers for lunch"}
