{"text":"Great local place with fresh cooked food at a fantastic price. I left fed, happy and ready for my day long convention. Nice guys, too!"}
{"text":"Excellent food , big serving , great priced , would come here again, got the egg sandwich with hash browns , was delicious, had to save part as too much to eat"}
{"text":"Great food, reasonable pricing, and great service!    This is a hidden gem waiting to be discovered!  Had the grilled turkey sandwich.  It was fantastic.  French fries are very good!"}
{"text":"So this place is like a little gold mind.  A hidden away building that there is no way you'd find it even on accident, has orders all day long.  The owner has to be doing well for this tiny little joint.  So from the top, the outside of it kinda looks shady.  Meaning, I'd keep driving if I haven't eaten there before.  But inside is a small dining area, more of a quick stop and eat place.  But there to go orders is what does it.  

Sit down and eat for 15 minutes, and you will see them shuffle out more food to their 10 delivery drivers than you could eat in a month.  They obviously are doing something right.  Their deliveries are free too.  Just tip the driver if you want.  

I give it 3 stars mainly for presentation.  If you call to make an order over the phone, it sounds like there are 15 people running around in the background working.  They talk to you on the phone like they are busy.  Same in person, just shuffle in, and shuffle out.  

But they have virtually anything you want to eat.  And the food is mostly all good.  Yeah I have eaten there several times and there have been some things I liked more than others, but mostly it's all good food.  Normal prices.  When you are just looking for some food at lunch time in your work day, this is much more worth it than your normal fast food joint you do every other day.  Good food, the rest of it, ehhhh."}
{"text":"Excellent food & service. All five members of our party felt the same. Best breakfast we've had in the four days. Better than all those big name \"highly recommended\" places."}
{"text":"Awesome food I had the fiesta omelet my wife had the Steak N eggs both classic dishes were amazing 
We will be back definitely"}
{"text":"This breakfast place was close to our hotel so I thought I give it a try. Order two breakfast plate. It has hashbrown, eggs , bacon , sausage and French toast. I myself, my cousin and my brother ate it. Food taste alright. Not the best breakfast but it was cheap. Mid way eating, the French toast tasted sour . I didn't mind much. 

30 min after all of us finish eating, we get extreme bad stomach ache and had the D. We all didn't eat anything other than the breakfast. So if the food is bad, the stomach reacts right away. First time coming and I won't ever visit again. I'll just go get a bit more expensive food that I can feel safe with in my stomach."}
{"text":"I been here about 4 or 5 times already and all I gotta say is that if you are looking for great breakfast along with great service then you should definitely give Polaris Street Cafe a try. I agree with the user who said that this place is a hidden gem! I actually ordered food to go today and everything was great, they even gave me ketchup, jam, napkins and plastic silverware without me asking for it! Deserves all five stars!"}
{"text":"Was getting car serviced around the corner. Had some time to kill and short on cash. $5 for a full breakfast and good quality food. Would definitely come back here when I am in the area. Will definitely recommend this place to people on a budget and people in the spring mountain area of Vegas."}
{"text":"Good food, service, price, and portions. It's walking distance from RIO. We would recommend."}
{"text":"A great just off the strip treat. Excellent food. Very courteous staff of true gentlemen. We enjoyed a breakfast. Would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"If you like off the strip local places to eat, you'll like this place. We ordered a meat skillet and it was very good . It was enough for 2 of us to share. The coffee and service were excellent."}
{"text":"This place was so easy to get to from The Rio. Quick service. We were seated almost immediately and our drink order was delivered promptly. The food was so delicious. And for four people we only paid $36. Great service, and amazing home cooked food at a great price."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. Seriously YOU need to check it out. Located in the industrial area of Twain and Polaris it is a diamond in the rough. Breakfast or lunch you will not be disappointed! We have been here multiple times and never left hungry. The pancakes are fluffy,fantastic,and just the right size. Supreme breakfast sandwich is BOMB. Best described as an over the top grilled cheese with eggs and ham added. Perfect ratio of butter to bread create that golden crunch in each bite. The ambiance  is nostalgic with traditional diner table clothes of red and white check and throwback artwork on the walls. New ownership has put in New booths and is continually working on additional upgrades. If you can't make it to the restaurant they also deliver!"}
{"text":"So let's put it this way. I went in with my co-worker for something quick to kill time. We ordered and waited for about 40 minutes for our food, the crazy part is that there was only one other person there. I got my food to go and ate it on the way to where I had to go. I instantly felt bad, I told my co-worker that the meat  tasted funny. Not even 15 minutes from eating I started to throw up. I will stay away from this place and tell people not to go."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Friendy people.
What more do you want. Looking forward to coming back and trying other menu items. Skillets are awesome."}
{"text":"This place is a sleeper! Been here for breakfast over 5 times and never had a bad meal. Hidden gem!"}
{"text":"We didn't order anything fancy but what we did order was really good. It's located off the beaten path but worth a try. Next time we come we will order something more Authentic."}
{"text":"Polaris Street Caf√© got to be one of Las Vegas secretes, Just happen to ride by one day while heading to the freeway entrance on Spring Mountain. 
The food was prepared well and the portion was to much and the service is great. I can't believe this place has been here since 1993. I will return."}
{"text":"Worth the drive! Delicious food, great service. Home-made Mexican breakfast. My husband had a traditional breakfast. All fresh ingredients. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Simple breakfast/lunch place.  Out of the way location, but not far off the Strip.  Delicious variety of items like sizzles.  Too much food, but that's hard to complain about.  Excellent breakfasts of all sorts.  Owner and staff very friendly.  Service fast.  A real find."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast find! 6 minutes from strip. Warm friendly place. Avocado skillet a must! Homemade chips and salsa delicious!"}
{"text":"this is the definition of a hole in a wall place and its amazing. it's pretty decent diner/american food, portion sizes are nice and if you come on a day where they do tacos, get them.

the only downside to this place would be their hours. im naturally a night owl/usually eat towards night time, so its hard for me to go here.

but definitely try this place!"}
{"text":"Scary looking outside but wonderful diner food inside."}
{"text":"I absolutely love Polaris! They are really fast on their deliveries! I have literally ordered everything on their menu and have never been disappointed! Great price as well! I really do recommend them they are amazing!"}
{"text":"We stayed at the Rio this past week for the WSOP and ate breakfast there the first two days.   Food at Hash House a Go Go was just fair and very overpriced.   We saw this little gem on Yelp and decided to give it a try.  Needless to say, we went back every morning after.    It is a short walk(if you cut through the employee parking lot of Rio)   The area is not much to write home about (industrial) but the cafe serves fabulous breakfasts at reasonable prices.   Our group tried many different menu items and each one was delicious.   The serving sizes are very generous and kept us satisfied until dinner.    The staff was always friendly , efficient and attentive.   Basic decor but always clean.    This place is a great alternative to the higher priced options at the Rio."}
{"text":"To start, I had the 2 egg breakfast with bacon and sourdough toast and hash browns. It was awesome, also the food is in large portions and for a low price! The servers, are helpful and check in on you a lot. In conclusion, you need to go to this if you are looking for a good breakfast."}
{"text":"This is one of my regular breakfast spots when I'm in LAS.  They are consistent every time I visit. It's a little hole in the wall off the beaten path of the strip. The coffee is always fresh and piping hot.  The staff is friendly and service is quick.  You can't beat the prices either.  They are easy on the wallet/purse. The skillet dishes are typically my go to selection. They have quite an assortment of. lunch options as well."}
{"text":"Nice local gem!!! We had the dues wild which was a huge order - pancakes, eggs, bacon and sausage - so much food that you definitely aren't hungry afterwards. 

Scram connection - on point with a lot of onions, peppers, tomatoes and mushrooms with sausage and bacon and hash browns.  

This place is purely local and has great service.  All of the servers were very friendly and the food came fast.  So good!!!"}
{"text":"Nope. Not a great place for my visit. Salad dressing in to go containers if not in a tear off pouch. Burger skinney and blah. Cheese was pre shredded chedder/jack and not melted on burger. Show string fries lukewarm. Wint be a repeat for me."}
{"text":"Great mom and pop breakfast/lunch place."}
{"text":"This place is my go to breakfast place when I order from work. We have a breakfast place right across the street from me that I never order from because of Polaris. Their food is very tasty, you get quite a bit, and the price is super reasonable. I've tried their lunch items, and they are good too. But the breakfast is my favorite there. Highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"While in Vegas, my sisters and I inquired about a good place to have breakfast.  Polaris Street Caf√© was suggested to us.  What a treat!  The first thing you notice is the owner turning around to greet you as you come through the door.  Then, as we were seated,  you notice the cleanliness.  Wow! Not one speck of dust in sight. There were none of the common worries like dirty silverware or bathrooms.  This was like eating at home with a personal cook!  The food was comfort foods finest and the staff was kind and courteous.  If you are in the area,  I suggest you try them for yourself!"}
{"text":"The yelp reviews are spot-on; quick, friendly service, low prices and really really good food. My son was thrilled with the huevos rancheros -almost as good as Nan's! The chorizo con huevos was also exceptional, can't find chorizo quite this good in Montana! Huge glasses of juice for the kids & endless refills on good coffee, plus really big servings of food."}
{"text":"Great food.  We were looking to get off the high price fancy strip and just eat a good filling breakfast.  This place hit the mark.  It is the opposite of fancy, but food was great and the people friendly."}
{"text":"Good caf√© food at a super reasonable price."}
{"text":"This was the first food poisoning in my life. Since Lunch Stop closed, our options for lunch at work decreased significantly. I don't always have the luxury of leaving work for lunch, and often times just order food and eat in my office while I work. I figured Polaris Street cafe was nearby and they delivered without an order minimum. That was a plus. What was not a plus was me hurling all afternoon and into the evening. I kept burping and tasting that awful burger until I finally could no longer stand it and threw up every last bit of it. It was pretty agonizing 24 hours -- lots of trips to the bathroom and copious consumptions of pepto bismol. It may have been a one time fluke, I don't know, but I will NEVER order from this place again."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic. Friendly staff, very inexpensive, and the food is wonderful. Got the breakfast skillet and let me just say... the half portion would have been more than enough. Don't let the lack of curb appeal dissuade you-- this place is a gem."}
{"text":"Had delivery of the Super Bird sandwich lunch combo today ($8.65 with fries and drink). Buttered texas toast was good, decent amount of turkey and bacon. But you know what would make this sandwich better? Jam, like a monte cristo. Delivery was fairly quick. Fries were cold and hard upon arrival, but I think they might have been good at one point in time. 2 little packets of catsup is not enough, and again with the evil, evil styrofoam. What's up with that, Vegas? 

http://www.green-4-u.com/2008/05/22/why-styrofoam-is-bad/"}
{"text":"This cafe is definitely a hole in the wall but it's well worth it! I got the half size meat lovers skillet and it was awesome!! The potatoes were so seasoned and crisp OMG! The service was amazing, it was quiet and the food was delicious! Please don't sleep on this quiet cafe. It's definitely a hit!"}
{"text":"Coffee was good and repoured often. The breakfast was great for the price. We opted to grab a meal outside the casino as the restaurant there are very expensive. I had a simple 2 egg breakfast and it came quickly and tasted good. Worth the 5$ uber to get here. Looks like a pawn shop from the outside but once entered looks like classic diner. Not fancy but a good greasy spoon, clean and efficient."}
{"text":"Good food. Friendly.  Cheap.  If you're staying at the rio it's definitely worth the 10 min walk (most of that is getting off rio property)."}
{"text":"We visited here ages ago once with my parents and remembered having a good meal. We were down the street waiting for Hubs' car to get some work done so we decided to grab some breakfast while we waited. 

We arrived just before a small rush. The front half og the place wasnpretty full, but the back half was empty with just one other table. We were seated quickly and provided a menu right away. It did not take long for our water to arrive and we placed our order. 

We waited a bit and noticed the room was starting to fill up. One table had to wait a while to even get menus at this point. We saw some food coming out to a table across th room (that arrived after us) and the Hubs thought the order looked an awful lot like ours. 

Well, he was right. Our food was delivered to the other table and before the guys could say it wasnt what they ordered, the guy who dropped thebfood off had disappeared. Eventually one of the guys got up and told the staff of the mixup. 

The other table still got their food (the correct order) before our meal came out.  

I ordered the biscuits and gravy with hashbrowns. Hubs ordered french toast with eggs, bacon and sausage.

We had to ask for syrup as that did not come out with the meal. We also had to ask for water refills. 

The french toast, according to Hubs, was good. \"The eggs were eggs\". The sausage (links) had good flavor and were decent sized. The bacon was really thin, but had ok flavor. 

The biscuits and gravy. *sigh* disappointed. Sad panda, as I was really looking forward to it. The biscuits were soft and tasted ok, but the gravy was SO bland. The hashbrowns were done well and had a good amount of crisp to them.  

All in all, the server was good, food runner was not. It's not a place that will be on the top of my list to return to, though. 

We thought about this place as my mom swears they have the best chicken fried steak in town, but with how bland the gravy was I find that hard to believe. I'm wondering if something has changed since the last time we've been there."}
{"text":"Great breakfast experience.  Large portions, excellent flavours.  Super friendly staff as well.  Loved it."}
{"text":"I like this place.  For a hole in a wall, it gets the job done- satisfies hunger.  The location and place itself is questionable at first, but the food is good and they do free deliveries."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to dine at whenever in Lad Vegas. A divey little place a block north of the Rio, the food is great, the atmosphere is funky, service is quick, and the prices are great.

I've been eating here since 2009. I highly recommend that you check it out!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Great food, family friendly, and awesome food that won't break the bank. I would highly recommend this place to anyone that wants good food in Las Vegas off of the strip. It's within walking distance of Wyndham Desert Blue resort for those that stay there and not far at all from the Rio resort. The owners make sure the customers needs are met here and they are great people! Make sure to check it out when in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"I located this place on Yelp as my coworkers and I were in the area that morning. It received great reviews and the photos looked good so I dragged my crew along. Went on a Friday morning with a group of co-workers. The place is pretty small and probably holds around 40 people. The group next to us had about 15 and we had around 10. I'm pretty sure they weren't expecting to have this many people in at 0730 on a random Friday and it was evident because they weren't really prepared service wise. With that said, the service was on the slow side. The food, on the other hand, was phenomenal. I got one of their special plates with chicken breast, potatoes, peppers, and more. It was supposed to be topped with cheese but I don't eat cheese so I got it without. The dish was super flavorful and I really feel like I got my money's worth. They were understaffed but the people that were there were working hard to take care of everyone in the restaurant. Mom and Pop style place and I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"We found this place through Google Maps \"Cheap Breakfast\" and it was awesome! The prices are great, food is delicious, portions and food and the staff is all very friendly! Whenever I'm in town I'll definitely stop here again :)"}
{"text":"Clean, friendly staff, good prices and tasty food. And it's not too far from the strip. Not a bad place to grab a quick bite."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Vegas. If you can find it you will enjoy. Yelp thinks my review was too short. 
What can I add to BEST BREAKFAST IN VEGAS!!
Yelp people"}
{"text":"Good quality Mexican-inspired breakfast.  I had the burrito (ranchero?) and it met expectations.  Half the price of breakfast at your hotel, but better. Good service."}
{"text":"All of reviews are spot on. Food was excellent.  My wife loved the juevos rancheros. When in Las Vegas, it's a must do for breakfast. Did I mention 24 hour breakfast?"}
{"text":"My secret hideaway Restaurant. This place is iso awesome. The food is amazing and the family feel makes it even more enjoyable."}
{"text":"I had eggs and country fried steak, plus biscuits and gravy and it was great! Everything cooked fresh and in big portions. It's only open for breakfast and lunch but worth it"}
{"text":"We were in Vegas for 3 days and ate breakfast here twice. The staff is amazing. The food is fantastic (do not miss the country fried potatoes!) and the prices can't be beat. If you are looking for something affordable that will fill you up, do not be deceived by the exterior."}
{"text":"Went there for Lunch and there fries were amazing! We had two burgers that were really good. I recommend this place!"}
{"text":"From a guy used to the 5 Star Omelette House, this place is so much more than good. Especially when the price is factored in. (1/3rd the price). It's clean, fast, the service is excellent and the food is good and plentiful (1 meal fed both of us). The coffee, hash browns, pancakes and eggs were ok. The bacon, ham and sausage were excellent. My only complaints were that the pancakes could be tweaked to add some flavor and the sugar container design was bad. :)"}
{"text":"Like everyone says, don't judge a book by its cover. 
This place has great food at great prices. 
The owners are real nice people and love their restaurant."}
{"text":"Ordered a burger from here a week ago. It was pretty good and for someone like me who doesnt wasnt a huge beef patty - the 1/4 lb was perfect. The bun was good - not some crappy McDonalds style bun like some place. I love that they deliver for free - thats what made me order in the first place. I will be ordering the biscutsand gravy next time :)"}
{"text":"My son & I went here for brunch this morning because it is close to work. The food was fresh and very good, reasonably priced and the restaurant is very clean."}
{"text":"I have been here three times this week. I have gotten their chicken wings (stingers), fries, onion rings, 1/4 lb avocado bacon burger, mozzarella sticks, and todat got their one egg breakfast with country potatoes. They are absolutely amazing. Their customer service is stellar. The food is always fresh, hot, and delicious. And I'm a French fry whore Their fries are crunchy on the outside soft on the inside and taste buttery. They even taste good when you save them later in the fridge. This place is a hidden gem and I will always come here when I want good home cooked food."}
{"text":"Good reviews here on Yelp. Nice pictures of the chow here on Yelp. I'm a little torn about this place because it had such a high star rating here and I'm not sure if the bar was set too high or if the whole experience fell below the bar I had put in place? First thing I noticed was that it was an all Hispanic male crew, from the greeter to the server and cooks. The service was outstanding. Friendly, fast, efficient, my coffee cup never emptied. The chow on the other hand is where it gets a little tricky for me.

My son ordered a breakfast sandwich, and that was definetly the best thing that we had for breakfast. Plain and simple sandwich of eggs, ham and cheese on sourdough, 10x better than the Moons over My Hammy from Danny's. Bread was buttered, toasty and tasty! I had a sausage scramble with pepper jack cheese, but was a little disappointed that it was a slice of pepper jack melted on right in the middle of the scramble. I would have liked it to be shredded, spreaded and melted all over my eggs. Pancakes that came with it were delicious! Hash browns, not so much. Nicely shredded, but not crispy enough for my preference. The bacon and sausage on the side were perfectly executed though! : ) 

My daughter had French toast and it was French toast. The \"worst\" part of what we all ordered was my wife's juevos rancheros. I didn't get to taste them so I can't really say anything other than what she told me. Most of the time, juevos rancheros will come with pork chile verde, but these did not. According to my wife, the sauce over the juevos rancheros tasted canned, and the cheese tasted like imitation cheese. I can never confirm nor deny this to be true, BUT, I noticed that the ketchup had an odd flavor, and perhaps this is because it was of a not so great off brand. I think that that saving grace of this place, was the breakfast sandwich. I know there has to be other things that are better, so for this reason, plus the kick ass service, I'd come back again to try something different."}
{"text":"OMG just ordered from this place through yelp and it's so good i ordered the bacon cheeseburger, onion rings and macaroni salad. All of them 5 stars, really good food  and fair price. I decided to leave a review because it deserves it. I looked for it online and when I saw how the place looks I would've never imagined that the food came from such a cool place like this. I love how the outside looks. I will definitely be coming here soon. Online when ordering they have FREE delivery and no crazy minimum orders only $10 which you will end up getting a lot of delicious food for so its worth it. I hope they stay like this. New spot for me :)"}
{"text":"I can not say enough good things!!!! I love the \"small town \" feel!!! Wait staff is AMAZING! And the food, O M G!!!! I will be pack in August with my wedding party!!"}
{"text":"My first time trying this place and it's so yummy. Huge portions, and great food. You get more than your money's worth. I definitely will be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"Local hole-in-the-wall well off the beaten path.  First the basics:  A big \"A\" grade seal of approval from the health department, clean restrooms with hot water, clean furnish and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I've lived here for about 17 years and have been going to Polaris Street  Cafe for about that long an I never had any food that was bad it's always been to my liking. When I have people in from out-of-town always taking them for breakfast and we have never been disappointed with the service nor the food."}
{"text":"We just ordered our food for delivery, it took over an hour to deliver and the food was cold. I will never again order here. I will be speaking with the manager tomorrow to get our money back!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast joint off the strip. No frills and worth the buck. Ordered the mushroom omelette and it was cooked to perfection. They were a bit busy so my sourdough toast came late but it was ridiculously good. Perhaps home made?? 

Looked like a lot of locals were there, which is a sign of a solid food joint."}
{"text":"Wow! Bang for you buck. This looks like a family-owned business. Everyone is sooooo friendly and attentive. And The food was delicious!! The skillets are a must-try! I think what did it for me is that I asked for spicy salsa, but they only had not-so-spicy salsa. BUT they came out shortly after and said that they had made me some!! Wow!!"}
{"text":"Ordered delivery to the Rio Hotel where were staying. First things first i want to thank yelp for making it easy and confirming order fairly quickly! The restaurant itself took care of us like gold. Delivery was about 45-50 minutes, order was brought to the front where i met the delivery guy who was very sweet and patient. I ordered two steak and egg burritos w/ potatoes and a 2 egg combo w/ pancakes. The burritos were overall good not great, i wish the meat and sides had a little more seasoning, size was great though. Potatoes on the side were tasty and plenty in portion! 2 egg breakfast combo was delicious, pancakes were fluffy and warm! The portion size of all three plates were great, and the fact that i asked to add avocado in one if the burritos (placed on the side) and they didn't charge me extra was very sweet! The overall experience was very good! I'd choose this over the overpriced menu items at the hash house a go go anyday and any other time i visit! Thanks very much!! Keep up the good work!

P.S. Add a little more seasoning to the insides of the burrito and some spicy salsa and you guys will be a perfect 5 star restaurant! (5 stars for your service)"}
{"text":"Value off the Strip!

This place had good breakfast food for an amazing price.

The family had breakfast here on Monday and we were please with the food, service, and cleanliness (but cheap) decor. 

2 eggs, hash browns, toast, and bacon/sausage for under $6 is good.  Add in I don't have to pollute my lungs by walking through a casino. BONUS.

The place is located in an industrial area and looks like a strip bar from the outside, but don't let that scare you. Inside you are greater with a smile and some good food. 

In the city of Sin, this place is a good value to start your day."}
{"text":"Everything one wants in a diner...well that my husband and I want, at least!  I had the ranchero omelette, which was perfectly cooked, loaded with avocado, plenty of sausage and accented with olives and green chiles. Their homemade ranchera sauce on top stepped it up even further, so I asked for a little extra. Since my hubby had the hash browns with his perfectly cooked eggs over easy, I went with the seasoned country potatoes--hot and uniformly crunchy. Yum! His breakfast including bacon was $6.99, mine $8.20 so super value for the amount of excellent breakfast. Our servers were really friendly and attentive. Our thanks to other Yelpers, since we would never have found this on our own."}
{"text":"Wow scary. Open since 1993 without ever getting remodeled. Unreal. 

Anyone leaving 5 stars are friends of the family or crazy. A 2 star is being very nice and only that high because the food was 'decent' and cooked well, and it's a family business which I try to support. 

I couldn't believe I hadn't heard of this place until today because I live within walking distance. It's in an odd industrial location behind Rio casino, close to Wyndham off Polaris street. Easy walk from Rio, Gold Coast or even Palms. 

I was bug eyed and scared pulling up. Parking lot was dirty and damaged, homeless making camp on property, the place just looked really run down and unappealing. All the table cloths were stained and faded. Seems like a lot of cheap fixes are years overdue. (see pics)

My worries didn't end after entering. It was basically empty with only few rough looking construction workers, and one to go order a lady was waiting for. After they left I was only one in the place but service was very lacking. 

Wasn't greeted walking in. I sat myself in the corner booth which I regret because the tv was loud playing commercials and news. So annoying as that tv was the sound for all 4 tv's and loud enough to here from the kitchen (on purpose I'm sure). Took several awkward minutes to be given a menu, no smiles or dialog, didn't get a 'good morning have you been here or have any questions' greeting that you'd expect from a mom and pop shop. 

After ordering my food came quick on plastic plates but didn't stay warm very long. Biscuits and gravy were not hot, not toasted, bland 2 star. Ice tea was fresh brewed maybe but the water must of been bad tap because it didn't taste very good, 2 star. Eggs were cooked right and decent 3.5-4 star, chicken fried steak was the highlight but little thin and extra dark looking meat, enjoyed it 4.2 star. Bacon about right, could be thicker better but cooked well and 3.5-4 star or so. 

There was no check-in or 'how was everything'at the end. I ate my whole meal without a refill. I wanted to add a soup and ask the volume to get turned down a tad but didn't get a chance.

What blew me away and know makes me change to a 1 star is the owners came in and didn't care to help. I clearly had an empty ice tea left on edge of the table, 2 dirty empty plates, and was staring over at all 3 of them obviously needing attention. They couple who looked like the owners and I'm guessing there son why does the waiting chatted the whole time ignoring me. They were saying something about cops coming last night blah blah, was already scared enough so didn't listen in much. 

Overall recap is just avoid, so many better options. Food is just okay, location and service are jaw dropping and sad. Biggest thing is they could easily make it better but just don't care and collect a modest income and go home. Won't be back soon but will likely try again later since its so close and hate giving 1 star reviews to family owned and operated businesses. 

Good luck if you gamble."}
{"text":"Excellent place to eat. A friend and I checked this spot out just out of the blue looking for a place at 7am. Everything from the service to the location to the food was top notch. This is a hidden treasure in the Vegas area. Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"Very impressed with the quality of food, the fast and friendly service, very delicious, everything was hot and this was much better than I could have expected for a random off the strip diner. Go here for breakfast.  You'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"recently started to work in the area and heard this joint had quick delivery. Yes, the delivery was quick, however the food was just ok. I ordered the superbird lunch special which is turkey swiss bacon and tomato on sourdough with fries and I had them add avacado. My interpretation was that this would be a cold sammy. It was hot, very hot which kind of grossed me out. At least the fries were really awesome. I think I will probably order from here again but something else or ask more questions."}
{"text":"While waiting for my wife to go to breakfast, I struck up a conversation with a casino security guard. We chuckled about how breakfast can sometimes change into lunch because of these \"beautification delays\".  He suggested the Polaris Caf√© as one of his favorites. It is located in an out-of-the-way industrial area and is almost exclusively a locals eatery. Our meal turned out to be reasonably priced in a friendly, busy, hole in the wallish facility. Most importantly, the food was very, very good. My wife's half Chicken Fried Steak Skillet Breakfast was exceptional and proved to be more than she could eat. This place is proof of the \"off the strip, talk to locals\" approach to eating in Vegas. I am still looking for the security guard to thank him for the heads-up. Recommend"}
{"text":"I have ordered from here once before for delivery and it was good. Well today I ordered their 2 egg breakfast for delivery with country potatoes and they sent potato wedges. Then when I called they said they don't serve country potatoes anymore (as of 2 months ago) although two days ago my coworker got country potatoes with her delivery meal. The gentlemen I spoke to said they could bring me hash browns instead I said okay. The hash browns showed up Luke warm and tasted stale. I will not order from here again and am very displeased with the quality of their food. Very mediocre at best and Not worth the money."}
{"text":"Tasty breakfast in an odd location. Short walk over from the Rio when not liking the hotel options."}
{"text":"Coffee was great, our waitress was super friendly, and the portions are HUGE. Come hungry!"}
{"text":"What you see on the outside is NOT what you get on the inside! This little old barred-windowed drive in has a fun Taqueria style atmosphere inside, a HUGE menu, a friendly staff and great food! Off the beaten path and well worth coming to!"}
{"text":"Ordered lunch for 4 people (delivered)... every order was mediocre at BEST. I ordered the grilled ham & cheese, but I don't consider processed cheese slices \"cheese\" + 2 skimpy slices of ham & soggy fries. Definitely NOT worth the $8.55 it cost. Needless to say their menu is now in our recycle bin."}
{"text":"Food is good if your looking for a small dinner that is not too expensive. The outside does not look so appealing but trust me the best places are hole in the walls. Definitely do try it."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! Cheap...and very friendly service! Very clean bathrooms clean quick! Serves breakfast all day...portions are big. We shared a breakfast."}
{"text":"This place definitely looks like a dive from the outside.  The lack luster exterior, though, is hiding a total gem!   The service was excellent.  Everyone was very attentive and smiling.  The portions are MASSIVE.  No one in our party of four was able to finish their meal.  The sourdough toast was ON POINT!   Yum!   And their country seasoned potatoes were some of the best!"}
{"text":"Food was amazing & not to mention so was the prices. Quick & good :) great people that work there too."}
{"text":"Worthy of the Lyft ride if you're staying on the strip and want an escape to a place with a great non-tourist vibe. The menu is extensive; hearty breakfast and diner foods with a Mexican twist. They offer generous portions of well-made food for a great price. Friendly and funny wait staff are eager to provide you with all the classic hot sauce varieties and a truly excellent cup of diner coffee. Seriously though, the coffee. Funky truck stop feel with checkered tablecloths and a quiet atmosphere."}
{"text":"Don't let exterior fool you. This uninviting looking cafe located behind Wyndham hotel has everything you need for an amazing (and very filling) breakfast. 
Once you open the door, this cafe has pretty cute decorated diner/cantina thyme. And very welcoming atmosphere from the friendly staff and owner. Mexican style breakfast has good portions and very delicious. My philly steak with egg skillet breakfast has full flavour and breakfast omelette with avocado has very generous portion of fresh avocado."}
{"text":"You want good \"AMERICAN\" hearty breakfast at an affordable prices with great service.   

This \"hole in the wall\" place is off the beaten path over on Polaris, between Spring Mtn and Twain.   Check it out. Great skillets for $9.99.  You leave full!"}
{"text":"Sometimes a great hot breakfast is hiding away in an unsuspecting spot. I took everyone's word for it and didn't judge the place by the exterior. Even my Uber driver double-checked before dropping me off - \"you sure this is the place?\"

Definitely was and certainly worth the $10 uber from the Strip. I ordered an omelette that had sliced sausage, avocado, black olives, cheese and salsa. It came with a generous side of breakfast potatoes and wheat toast. I skipped coffee today so my total was $8.86. A deal, if you ask me. 

Wait staff is attentive and friendly. It's got that diner atmosphere where you get a sense that everyone really does want you to feel at home and have a nice meal. 

There appear to be a number of good breakfast burritos and lunch sandwiches if that's what you're looking for. Only drawback for me in the future would be that the salsa is sort of generic tasting. Good for a breakfast omelette but not ideal for something like huevos rancheros, in my opinion anyway."}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast in town.  My favorite is the Country Omelet with no peppers or onions.  Their prices are good, food is great, service is a good or better than any other breakfast place in town.  The Hash Browns are real and fresh - not like a lot of other Egg places in this town  - Yeah this is as good as it gets.  I left town for a year and Polaris Street Cafe was the only thing I missed"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Don't let the curb appeal detour you. A gem with great service, yummy food and excellent service."}
{"text":"Wow! You fellow Yelpers were right. So glad we came and checked this place out. I am sitting in this place right now, stuffed. We came here for breakfast and the food was wonderful. It's not fancy, and not meant to be. If you are hungry and want good food to fill your belly, for a GREAT price, this is the place to come. DO NOT be decieved by the look of the place from the outside or it's location. We almost didn't come here based on it's location looking at Google Maps, but sooo glad we did. We will most likely come back again tomorrow for breakfast before we head home.

**UPDATE**
We came back the next day, and again, they did not disappoint. The owner came over and talked with me for a bit and said he read my review on Yelp. He thanked me for the kind words and we had a nice conversation. SUPER nice guy. All of the staff are hard working and they strive for great customer service. Thank you so much for the wonderful hospitality. This is definitely a stop next time we return."}
{"text":"Went for breakfast and everything was excellent! About a 15 minute walk from the strip but very cheap prices, especially for the amount of food."}
{"text":"I used to order take out from here a couple times a month and grab breakfast on the weekends. Over the last few visits things have really gone downhill. They have been taking longer to prepare food and then new owner has a terrible attitude. She questioned if I was local and if I was a regular when I told her the truth about my recent visit today. The sausage I had was the ones you buy precooked and can microwave (I'm fat, I know the difference) and when I old her, she was shocked and quickly defended they don't use microwaveable items when anger. Just beware. The dudes who work there are still choice and great guys. Hope the new owner learns how to talk to people a little better."}
{"text":"Thanks to a friend's recommendation, I went to the Polaris Street Cafe for breakfast this morning.  Never judge a book by its cover!  From the outside you think, \"This is the place Ben recommended?\"  Once inside, it's a totally different world.  Red and white checked tablecloths on the tables, movie posters, and photos of old actors and actresses on the walls, and a very friendly staff.

I took a seat and a server brought me a menu and asked about something to drink.  I ordered coffee and he brought me both coffee and a glass of ice water.  The coffee was promptly refilled while I was there.

I had seen the menu online and I knew they had a good breakfast selection.  I ordered the Ranchero omelette which is a 3 egg omelette with pieces of sausage, green chilies, avocado,  cheddar cheese, and topped with a ranchero sauce.  It comes with fried potatoes and toast or biscuit.  In my case, I ordered rye toast and they asked if I wanted it buttered or not.

While waiting, I was surprised by the number of calls they got for delivery.  It seemed like someone was always on the phone taking an order.  In a short time, a server brought my breakfast and asked if I wanted any hot sauce.  Cholula, of course.  I was all set.

The breakfast was excellent.  Hearty and really more than I should have eaten even letting the plates go with some of the toast and potatoes unfinished.  

The restaurant has three rooms.  Two larger rooms and one small room off to the north of the building.  

This is a warehouse, business section of town so there are bars over the windows and on the door.  Don't be fooled by the cover.  The book is great!  Thanks Ben!  I owe you.  Maybe breakfast at the Polaris?"}
{"text":"Mmm breakfast. I love it, but I seem to skip it so often... Probably because I also love to sleep!

Every so often my boss skips breakfast as well, and from time to time he will treat the office ladies to something from one of the nearby eateries that deliver breakfasts. It just so happened that the same morning someone from Polaris Street Cafe dropped off menus to our office, my boss wanted to order breakfast. So we decided to give them PSC a try.

Breakfast for 6 people was $30 (no drinks, and not including the delivery driver's tip). I personally didn't care that much for the Mexican Burrito I ordered, I don't think Mexican flavors is their specialty. My coworkers that ordered more basic breakfast items, like the breakfast sandwiches, enjoyed their meals. My boss had a breakfast skillet which was HUGE, they do offer half skillets which would probably be better if you are not a big eater. 

For the time being, I think Polaris Street Cafe is A-OK... I definitely think my first experience will not be my last and when I order something else off the menu there is a good chance I'd be a fan..."}
{"text":"The Polaris far surpassed my expectations! 

We were staying at the RIO on our recent visit to Vegas and wanted to find a nice little hole-in-the-wall diner for some breakfast. As a person that loves dive bars and the 'ma and pa' restaurants, this appeared to be right up my alley. It is in a slightly sketchy area, and from the outside, it doesn't look like much. If you are one to look past initial appearances for the chance as something great - this is the place for you. If you are looking for 5-star dining and fancy linens you are better off going somplace else. 

The food and the service were incredible. The staff was friendly and attentive and the food was delicious (not to mention, the portions were HUGE). This was absolutely one of the best breakfast experiences I've had while traveling. 

I will definitely be visiting the Polaris Street Cafe next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"First time here, service was great. Didn't take long to order either. I had the two eggs, bacon and potatoes with wheat bread. Food was delicious and our server was nice. Definitely, will go back."}
{"text":"Unfortunately, I did not want to post this, but without tasting the food the service will make me you want to leave by the time you have waited 30 min for your  food. No one came to let us know what reasoning is for the long wait, at least be courteous , and let us know.

No food review, not returning"}
{"text":"Just off the Las Vegas Strip walking distance to the Rio. With  friendly staff and large portions of good food. The bread is very fresh with  thick slices, food is served hot and to order. A must stop."}
{"text":"What a gem of a place. Not much to look at, but the food is delicious and very reasonably priced. The French Toast was fabulous, as well as, the country fried steak and scrambled."}
{"text":"Thank you Yelp! This cafe is in a convenient location right off the freeway. The place is nothing fancy, but it's clean, and cute in a kitschy diner way. The prices are very reasonable, most meals are under/around $10. All of the food was cooked to perfection! I had breakfast, while some of the other people at my table had lunch. The fries were so good! Best pancakes, eggs, and bacon I've had in a restaurant in years! Polite and accurate service. I absolutely recommend that you eat here!"}
{"text":"Wouldn't have gone in if not for yelp pointing the way. Sketchy exterior but it's clean inside. Had a steak burrito. Great food and service."}
{"text":"Well first time here but wow amazed with how good the food is and how affordable portions are good price as well I would recommend it to anyone staying in Las Vegas who doesn't wanna deal with over price small meals."}
{"text":"We had the ranchero omlette, pancakes, chicken strips and the Mexican burrito. It took a while for our food to arrive but it was worth the wait. Is was all good."}
{"text":"When we pulled up to the location it looked like it was closed, kind of was unsure about going in. Once inside it was a better inside then the outside appearance! Service was great, staff were friendly! Food was decent, mom and pop type meal at an affordable price! Beat the prices we paid for same type of meal in the casinos!"}
{"text":"I called and ordered the country scram for breakfast & this time they got it right-2 scrambled eggs over 2 biscuits covered in sausage gravy with hashbrowns & 4 strips of bacon. $6 and they delivered!! It was good with the hashbrowns this time."}
{"text":"There is nothing fancy about this place, but it is fantastic. Delicious food, perfect sized portions, reasonable prices, and good service."}
{"text":"This place is a pleasant little surprise fo a diner located in a funky part of town behind the Rio. It's not anything fancy, that's for sure, but it has a lot more character than say, IHOP or Denny's. You're getting a quality meal of substantial portions, and it's not being brought to you by corporate America, which is kind of a rarity in these days.

PSC (as they like to be known) offers are your standard breakfast fare, with a little tip towards the Mexican/Hispanic end of the palate (we're in southern NV, what do you expect?). To that end, I recommend the chorizo, as well as the ranchero omelet.

Nice staff, and a rather large interior space. For natural light, head to the right when you walk in, you can sit by the windows. Parking is easy out front, if there's not enough angled spaces, just park on the street."}
{"text":"Really nice place close to the strip to have a nice breakfast for a good price! The food is really good. My friends and me went there 3 times and ordered different things of the menu and everything was delicious. I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"Love this place. 

-Funky truck-stop vibe  but very clean and cozy
-Incredible home-style menu options, lots to choose from (especially breakfast)
-Awesome burgers
-Hearty and fulfilling
-Excellent customer service

Ordering in or out, I've never been let down by Polaris and love showing this place off to locals!"}
{"text":"5 star service , food and price. After visiting many of the strip restaurants, we are so glad to have landed here for brunch. Outstanding service, delicious food, huge portions, and reasonable prices. Just down the street from Rio, you need to come here for breakfast or lunch. 
There were 7 of us, all our food was hot and delivered with minimal wait!"}
{"text":"This is probably the BEST restaurant you will find in Vegas for the prices they have. The food is amazing and the service is also GREAT. It's a small family Restaurant but you will leave with a happy belly."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite go to places for either breakfast or lunch. The staff is friendly, the owners make their way through the dining room to check on diners and the food is great. Julie has this way of making your dining experience as if you were at a friends place enjoying a meal. As for the food, my favorite breakfast to date is their Ranchero Skillet (consider yourself warned) it comes with eggs any style over a hash of potatoes, onions, bell peppers, and jalape√±os. And a delicious Italian sausage link. I still haven't been able to finish a full skillet. Also the coffee here is in my opinion one of the best cups in Vegas. Try it for yourself.  You won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"This food is amazing! They accommodated my vegan diet without a complaint at all! The food was delicious and perfectly spiced. The tortillas were freshly made and the pancakes were light and fluffy. We highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"Hole in the wall but nice and fresh to sit down and have a bite. From Los Angeles and car broke down. Walked from AAMCO to here since there is nothing around and it was worth it. Feet are aching, sweating like a pig and this place was an oasis in my screwed up birthday weekend. Service was prompt and food came out fast and yummy. It's a basic breakfast but they do have quite a variety of breakfast items. Would come here again. Wasn't crowded at 8am on a Saturday"}
{"text":"Called in yesterday, guy mumbled something unintelligible through the phone. I was very specific even repeated my order \"Denver Burrito add extra cheese, sub ham for sausage.\" Picked up order got back, no cheese (not even extra) and was about 1/2 the size of the burrito I got about 2 months ago. To describe it perfectly it was a flat pan omelet (Not scrambled) rolled up in a flour tortilla, no cheese. I won't be coming back"}
{"text":"The food was great, the staff friendly and attentive (but not overly so), and portion sizes were HUGE! I can eat a ton and it definitely satisfied. 

They had fox news on, which I didn't appreciate. Regardless of political affiliation I don't think businesses should pick one side or the other and blare it while people are eating."}
{"text":"Came here on a Monday morning for s quick bite. Didn't have many choices in the area. Small NY style delicatessen feeling. Great portions, tasty food and good service."}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast before our drive home, I ordered the biscuits and gravy with potatoes and my husband got the fiesta chorizo omelet. My potatoes were perfectly crisp on the outside, the gravy I felt could use a little more of that sausage flavor that you get. My husband really liked his omelet, it tasted fresh and filled him up. The service is really friendly too."}
{"text":"This hole in the wall joint is Most definitely a diamond in the rough. I ordered the Deuces Wild which comes with eggs your way, pancakes or French toast or biscuits and choice of sausage or bacon or both. I love  how the food isn't oily and taste like your mom's cooking!! Definitely a place to come back to, oh it's a long one block from Rio!!"}
{"text":"This place would get a 5-Star review, because the first time I went the food was tasty and the service was prompt. The omelette I had was well-cooked and hash browns were not overdone/burnt. My fianc√© also enjoyed the food. It was such a great start to our weekend in Vegas.

However, our second trip here was a disaster. It took 45 minutes from being seated to receiving our food, and we were the only people in the restaurant. After initially getting part of my order wrong, the correct omelette I had tasted absolutely undercooked, and the veggies on it were stale. Furthermore, both me and my fianc√©'s hash browns were burnt AF.

Still, I'm willing to believe they had a bad day that second visit, as our first experience at Polaris was truly stellar. Hopefully they see this review and take the feedback constructively."}
{"text":"Asked Box Brothers if I could buy them lunch for helping us out with their fork truck. They ordered lunch from Polaris Street Cafe and I picked it up.
I arrived early and was able to view their operation.
What a pleasant surprise! Food was ready on time, staff was clean, pleasant and all about customer service.
I will be back!"}
{"text":"We walked to the Polaris from Gold Coast where we are staying this weekend. As other Yelpers, we read reviews and learned about the restaurant. I'm glad there were photos of the outside of the restaurant so we knew where to go. 

Arrived at about 9:00am on Saturday and there was only one other customer in the restaurant. 

We were seated and brought water right away. Entrees came out in a very reasonable time.

Three stars:
1. Vinyl tablecloth did not look clean.
2. I ordered a chorizo omelet with potatoes, not hash browns. The chorizo was overcooked & the potatoes not homemade.

With so many choices in LV, this is not a restaurant I would go back to."}
{"text":"I was expecting the off the strip gem, but this place was just meh.  Service was the best part of the place.  Seemed to be an old gas station/service station turned into a diner.  Breakfast was whatever you wanted.  I had poached eggs with pancakes.  Coffee was pretty gross.  Seems like a small local spot that is loved by locals cause its local, not beacuse there is anything worth going there for."}
{"text":"If we don't see the reviews from yelp, perhaps we'll missed out this family breakfast place. I like the service here. Affordable price with outstanding foods. Definitely worth the drive and leave those casino restaurant that robbed"}
{"text":"Fantastic food and service! Just delicious! Great environment.  Everyone friendly and greet you when walking in!  Can't wait to come back for breakfast or lunch!"}
{"text":"This is my second time coming here for breakfast and I can not complain. 

Their prices are super reasonable and the service was pretty quick.
They have a good menu with simple yet delicious items.

If you can't decide between pancakes and French toast, go with the French toast. It's 10X better."}
{"text":"I ate here this morning. The curb appeal is not good. The restaurant is in a industrial area. Bar are the windows sort look. 
Clearly a mom & pop place. Place was clean and the typical cafe deco. Service was prompt and friendly. The food was good, hot, and a good size portion. Price was very reasonable. I come here again."}
{"text":"Great food love the atmosphere and very inexpensive. A great tourist destination my wife and I were amazed that they have been in business for over 25 years we can't wait to come back again !"}
{"text":"We're from CA and put our faith on the Yelp reviews. We were not disappointed! the food was good, the servers were so friendly and just awesome. The location is random and small but overall I will definitely be coming back the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"I enjoyed my visit to the Polaris st Cafe. It's a throwback diner. Very simple nostalgic movie posters on the wall. Flat screen TV's  are situated around the diner. It's definitely a local place that's been around since the early 90's. I found the staff very inviting and friendly. I came right in a was kindly told I may sit wherever I please. There are booths situated around the wall. With tables in the middle of the restaurant. Each with red checkered table clothes.  The menu provides many choices for breakfast and lunch. I Choose one of the hot skillet plates  (South Western ) had about a 7min wait oh and my drink was already there as soon as I sat down. The southwestern hot Skillet plate consist of chicken which was perfectly cooked potatoes green peppers tomatoes in a little sausage it was great. Everything was cooked perfectly and the skillet came out piping hot. I would like to tell you all are so graciously read my post that this is a local place for those of you who visit Vegas on a yearly basis please try it out for those of you who are new to Vegas maybe your first time give yourself a break from the strip the prices are great the food is fantastic and the helpings huge. A Vegas gem right behind Wyndham Tower. This will be one of my favorite breakfast / lunch spots. Finally if you're a local you should put this place on your list."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery and it was fast, decent price ,food was good , the only issue was the phone left on hold for a little long and then hung up on other then that it was a good experience"}
{"text":"Food was quick and easy. Plenty tasty for the low cost. The short walk from the Rio was worth it."}
{"text":"This cafe is located in a industrial area. I work right down the street and didn't get a chance to get breakfast on my way to work, so searching on yelp, I found this place. I ordered a Denver burrito with hash browns. I really wasn't expecting much but to my surprise, it was actually very good. This little cafe just go to show, don't judge a book by its cover. I'll definitely be eating here again!!"}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place trying to get out of the cold and I am happy that I did!
Excellent! I ordered a breakfast skillet and everything was perfect! Eggs were fluffy, chicken tender, potatoes crispy- not greasy!
I also appreciated that their tomatoes, avacados, and zuchini were ripe and full of flavor.  Healthy and fresh.. So much food too! Cheaper and better than Denny's- I will be back."}
{"text":"Honestly, I second guessed my choice when I was getting to the place: it very much is a hole in the wall, and there are bars on the outside windows. 

I'm glad I stuck with it. I had the avocado skillet, tasty and a great deal at around $9 (would easily be 13 at many other breakfast spots). The folks working there were also friendly. Definitely impressed and would return again for another breakfast."}
{"text":"Hands down the best breakfast fare I have had. We stopped in on May 4th after we came in town from Logan, UT. Upon pulling in to the parking lot it doesn't look like much. When you walk in you are instantly taken back  with the Rat Pack, The Godfather, and Marilyn Monroe along the walls.
The staff is very friendly and even in busy times they made sure to acknowledge us and invited us to take a seat where we wanted. 
One of the owners greeted us as we sat down, brought us drinks as well as delicious house made chips and salsa. Which she informed us was a little something to celebrate the holiday Cinco De Mayo! 
I ordered the Chicken Fried Steak skillet and my husband ordered the Southwest skillet. The potatoes had the perfect crisp on the outside and softness on the inside. The chicken fried steak melted in my mouth and the chorizo on the Southwest skillet was delicious. Our over easy eggs were cooked to perfection! 
The overall experience was awesome from the owners friendliness to the great food, I will definitely be back. 
If you are ever coming through Vegas, you need to make this a stop in your list! They willl not disappoint"}
{"text":"What a great hole in the wall for sure.

This little breakfast joint is located in an industrial area pretty close to the Rio. It was a 20 minute walk from the Palms, which wouldn't be bad if it's cooler out or if you went early in the morning. But we left a little late, and it started to get warm real quick lol.

The food was great! The breakfast potatoes are a must get when you're here. I had  the \"mexican burrito\" which was just a breakfast burrito. I'm not too sure why they had to make it a \"mexican\" one lol."}
{"text":"A tasty lil hole in the wall cafe. No frills but good food at good prices. Check it out when your hungry and on go."}
{"text":"Not too how to feel about this place. I feel like this is truly a hidden gem. I can honestly say that I ran into this place by accident. I really didn't know what to think because it was only a single car in the parking lot. I walked inside and it was one customer sitting there eating. I sat in front one of the 4 TVs and it was obvious I was confused. The other patron asked me if it was my first time there, after I said yes he then said the food was really good.

Now onto the food -
I ordered a steak and eggs and an arnold palmer.

The steak wasn't the best. It was cooked correctly, but didn't taste very good. Everything else was amazing. I am definitely going back. I will update my review with the next meal. But this place serves breakfast all day long and I loves me some Breakfast."}
{"text":"Breakfast and lunch eats.

I have never actually visited the place but have used them for delivery option on several occasions.

They offer an assortment of American breakfast and lunch options. The food is actually very good and they give you a lot for your money.

Delivery can sometimes be a little slow but my food always arrives hot and fresh, so never any complaints there."}
{"text":"Terrific dive behind the Rio. Don't let the chain link fence or industrial setting fool you, this is scratch cooking at its best. Great breakfast. Try the Huevo Rancheros or the homemade buttermilk pancakes. The is a gem in the rough."}
{"text":"food is good and was made quick. my only problems ate the tables, the covering on them are dirty you can tell it hasn't been changed for some time"}
