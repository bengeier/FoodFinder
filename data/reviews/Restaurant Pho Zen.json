{"text":"The Pho is good!!!!  the place is clean  the service was a bit slow  but over all it was a nice experience  I will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"The food is great and now under new management. Amazing Pho, and they have now have fantastic sushi!"}
{"text":"PhoZen is always consistently good. I have never been disappointed. Food is reasonably priced and very tasty. Best Pho in Brossard! Service is amazing and the resto is always very clean. Oh did I mention it's BYOB? Amazing!"}
{"text":"Bonne nourriture mais très mauvais service! Cela fait deux fois que nous nous présentons en une semaine le restaurant était fermé. Les heures d'ouvertures n'ont aucun sens, il ne faut pas se fier aux heures écrit sur le net vous risquez de vous cogner le nez sur la porte!! Très désagréable"}
{"text":"Gave it a star just because I didn't have to drive over a bridge into Montreal.  Cai Gao are horribly small - tasty, but reminded me of pigs in a blanket.... Well actually just the pigs... That's how big they were.  Super bonus was bahn mi next door at marchet Thai foo!!!  I would go so far to say that this is the best pho across the river from Montreal.  Tried Sao Sao on other side of interstate 10, and while brighter inside, it was half as good as Pho Zen."}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites in Brossard.  The Imperial rolls are AMAZING, the fried shrimp dumplings are mouth watering. Pad Thai is really good, and their soup is like a warm hug, making my taste buds sing! You can also try the Salt & Pepper squid mixed with veggies that are just as yummy as everything else I have mentioned. I have been going here for years and the staff has always been friendly and always helpful. You gotta try it! Go on, now, go! :)"}
{"text":"J'y suis allé par dépit à 3-4 reprises pour de la soupe tonkinoise ou piquante... ce n'est pas mauvais mais pas très bon, en mon sens, non plus... Plutôt passable et totalement oubliable. Surtout cette fois ou ils n'avaient pas de basilic à offrir avec la soupe tonkinoise ce qui est plutôt singulier... ils me disaient que le fournisseur n'était pas passé alors qu'il y a une épicerie asiatique juste à coté c'est franchement manquer de respect face au client que d'oser offrir la pho sans basilic... J'aurai du quitter c'est comme si tu allais manger des frites et qu'on n'avait pas de ketchup ou de mayonnaise à t'offrir...  Cela écrit le bouillon n'est vraiment pas très gouteux et je me suis senti, à chaque reprise, obligé de mettre plein de sauce Hoi Sin et piquante pour que cela goûte quelque chose.  Il est de biens meilleurs choix autour non loin."}
{"text":"Excellent service, came and ordered a Pho soup to go. Only waited 10 minutes for it to be ready, meanwhile waitress proposed a glass of water and provided me with refills. She was attentionate even if I was only there to take the food to go. Pho soup was really good, not as good as Pho Bang New York, but good for a Pho on southshore. Strongly recommend and will definitely try other dishes."}
{"text":"Very bad experience. Found a piece of disgusting plastic in the soup. The chef was not even willing to apologize, he only kept saying that it was the first time it happened."}
{"text":"Took 15 minutes to even get a menu (we got up and got one ourselves), then waited 45 minutes for Pho, and never got the spring rolls we ordered.  The bill was wrong and had to be modified twice after our server argued about it.  Definitely not worth it and I will never even entertain the idea of going back.  There were other customers in the restaurant that all got the same horrible service and over 45 minute wait time for Pho, the restaurant was also by no means crowded...  and they couldn't explain WHY the wait time was so long. (\"it just happens\" they said)  Really underwhelming experience that left us incredibly frustrated and unsatisfied."}
{"text":"2 stars for friendly staff. Grilled Chicken pho very bland and overpriced. Spring rolls really underwhelming. Vegetable pho was better. Lot of hot sauce to help cover the bland broth."}
{"text":"Great bring your own wine. Great service and very clean. The food is really good especially the tonkinoise soup."}
{"text":"I went back to eat again today, the service was bad today and the waitress was kinda rude..."}
{"text":"So after driving around 7 hours with a two hour stop over in Burlington for lunch and. To pick up my three day 32 dollar Enterprise special....I come to this place for some Pho of course!!!   The Fish Pho was something I actually haven't ever seen anywhere else, it's broth was quite clear and the flavor quite nice...I also ordered the Calamari which was tasty but sparse in actual volume of Calamari...the Tea was decent and everything went down easier because the two waitresses were easy on the eyes and one was actually quite stunning!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent, un des meilleurs restaurants vietnamien où j'ai été. Les rouleaux printaniers au crevettes sont exquis!"}
{"text":"Was really craving pho, and didn't want to drive across the Champlain Bridge into town. I happened to stumble upon this place while out at Le Skratch playing pool, and when we were leaving the parking lot, we spotted this place and decided to give it a go for lunch the following day. It's a small place, but well decorated, and like many Asian places in the area, it's a BYOB.   The menu is pretty expansive and offers an array of options, ranging from Vietnamese to Thai to some Chinese. The pricing is very reasonable as well, with generous portions. We had the spring rolls to start; what came out were imperial rolls. We made sure with the waitress that what she gave us were actually spring rolls without seafood (because my boyfriend Danny is allergic), and she assured us they were indeed the spring rolls with porc. We both bit into one, and the mint was so overpowering, Danny, who usually will eat anything in sight, said he couldn't eat it. I picked out the mint and was able to finish mine, but it left a weird taste in my mouth for the remainder of my meal. We were hoping the pho would make up for this unfortunate mishap. While we waited for our food, we looked around at the other food coming out to the other tables, and it looked really good. We waited awhile (service is pretty slow), but finally food was pouring out of the kitchen. Danny ordered the rare beef tonkinese soup (x-large) and I ordered the chicken with kaffir lime leaves pho-zen special. Not exactly sure what kaffir lime leaves are, but it sounded interesting. Mind you, I didn't taste much of a difference in my soup. Both soups were very good, the broths tasty but not overly oily or salty. Made for a perfect meal on a rainy and dreary day. We will definitely go back to explore the menu more."}
