{"text":"This cafe just opened although the salon has been in business for a while. The salon is in the back, and well-secluded from the cafe.  There is no \"salon smell\" in the building. Clean, comfortable,  and the owners are very friendly.   There are numerous homemade menu items -all very good.  I recommend the chicken soup, carrot cake, and the Lamingtons sponge cake.  Full coffee menu. Excellent lattes. Friendly staff, cozy interior and great porch!"}
{"text":"Sometimes staring a new relationship with a restaurant or a business is like dating..If done in one way, you start out slow, fun and easy..and before you know it.. BOOM.. you are in L-O-V-E!   Of course dating and food/business relationships can vary.. but.. The Salon Cafe and I had our first date with a coffee and a pastry.   A quick bite after a Y workout. (yes this is conveniently located across from the Lake Norman YMCA - so go work out then have a treat) it consisted of a berry turnover and a coffee...  Sky Mountain Coffee out of Mooresville.. yummy, simple, fresh and hot..  A super tasty, flaky pastry with just the right amount of berry filling and sweet sugar sprinkles to enhance the berry and taste of the pastry..  my palms were sweaty, my heart was beating a bit fast..I was just \"happy\" the rest of the day for no particular reason.   On our second date, I kicked it up a notch..  An egg and cheese bagel and a coffee.  The initial nervousness accompanied  a strong desire to get closer.    The coffee .. consistent, simple, fresh and hot.. The eggs, freshly cooked (not too much) intermingled with fresh grated cheese and seasoned to perfection on a great, soft bagel.  I had gotten it to go, it traveled perfectly and was easily consumed while moving along.   While not yet taking for granted, the Salon Cafe and I have some future plans..getting more comfortable, and always looking forward to our next time together..  Side Note -- parking is NOT a problem.. entrance is past the building (left if you were looking at it), exit is right --  once back behind, there are acres and acres of parking and room to move.. out front it  seems a bit cramped just looking at it (dont let this scare you off)  -- it is easy to get in and out despite main street traffic."}
{"text":"Past this place many times coming home so I decided to stop by for brunch on one of my days off. First off it was really cold! 58 degrees inside on a 31 degree December day. When we ordered our food and drinks, our food came out before our cafe drinks, and we had to remind the worker we still needed them (how could he forget, we were the only two in there). The portions were really small for the price, I got French toast for $8 which came with no side and 4 small slices of bread and my boyfriend got a Florentine Benedict which also came with no side. We left leaving hungry. Also their apple cider tastes like someone boiled plain apple juice."}
{"text":"This is a great breakfast on the weekend place in Cornelius.  Good coffee and crepes made with fresh fruit not pie filling. It's right by the bike shop on 115.  I am a coffee nut and here it's good.  Definitely worth checking out!"}
{"text":"This is an adorable cafe! I got the pumpkin spice latte and the pumpkin spice is homemade and not super sweet.  So cozy! I'm going to have to come back for lunch their menu looks like they have some delicious croissants, soups and crepes."}
{"text":"Driving by on a snowy Sunday we realized the salon now had a coffee shop and bakery!  We were so excited to get a cup of good joe and check out the pastries.  We were greeted at the door by the owners and although they were closed we were welcomed in the shop for great conversation a tour and of course a cup of joe.  As we were leaving Jeannie had explained her passion for baking and cooking and wanted to share her carrot cake with us complimentary!  OMG the best carrot cake ever and oh so moist!!  I can't wait to have an excuse to buy a whole cake from her!  We are looking forward to visiting during regular business hours and trying more goodies!    As I looked at other Yelp reviews I see pics of WHOOPIE PIES in her case, which is another sinful pleasure I normally only get when we go to Maine!  As we were leaving the cafe' another couple was walking in and had mentioned how much his wife enjoyed the Australian Pie!  I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"There is little reason to go anywhere else in this community for coffee food and a warm and inviting atmosphere. The alternative milks are cashews soy, Allmond and hemp. The crepes are fantastic. Now they have hamburgers also. Is a real effort here to be sustainable and care about environment and resources. The food is homemade clean organic non-GMO and absolutely delicious. The front porch is breezy charming and spacious. The indoor area is cool bright calm and roomy. It feels like home. The staff is helpful charming and connected."}
{"text":"Adorable cafe with good coffee and homemade baked goods. Excellent carrot cake. Nice options for full breakfast and lunch, both served anytime of the day. Omelettes, burritos, salads, soups, sandwiches, crepes. Wonderful Australian meat pie!!!! The decor is cute and welcoming, lots of natural lighting and different seating sections. Beautiful and large front porch with rockers, chairs and sofas. The staff and the owners are nice and sweet. Full beauty salon in the back of the restaurant. Large lot for parking in the back of the building."}
{"text":"I really enjoy stopping in here for something to eat along with a cup of coffee. The chef will make anything you want as long as he has the ingredients. I recommend the crepes, but everything on the menu is fantastic. Who knew that a bald guy would enjoy going to a salon so much?"}
{"text":"This is a legit cafe & coffee shop.  They also have a salon out back.  Plenty of seating & tables to come work or for meetings.  Lots of light too!  They have a large front porch with tables and couches to enjoy the weather while you sip on a yummy beverage &/or tasty treat.  They have a great variety of beverage options & tasty treats.  They also have lunch options and will be expanding that menu, as well.  Chili, soup, crepes (savory & sweet), minced meat pies, croissant sandwiches (tuna or chicken salad).  I tried the carrot cake and it was WONDERFUL.  If you want to have it for breakfast and don't want a \"cake\", they make it in muffin form, so you can feel a little better about it.  Seriously, so great!  Stop by; try them out for coffee, breakfast & lunch!  Support the local spots you love, so that they stick around for a long time!  If you go to the Davidson YMCA, swing by for your coffee fix.  Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Probably don't go here for food. Yeah they have a lot of options, but homeboy is always vaping out front and I've had to ask 3 times if I can have lettuce and tomato on my chicken sandwich. They could spend less energy on expanding the menu and more time on customer service."}
{"text":"The cafe looks so cute. I have not had a chance to try it but I will for sure. I had a manicure and the lady Jeanne was super sweet. The manicure itself was  nicely done. The only thing I was not a fan o was the soaking of the hands in the solution to take the gel off. If it were not for that , i would have given it 5 stars. My fingers were dry for two days after and most places use cotton and foil on just the nail. Would have liked to see more gel colors but she did say they were expecting it in. The actual job she did was super nice and I did not feel rushed at all. Such a cute salon I might come back to try a cut"}
{"text":"Meat Pies are made once a week, hopefully, and Frozen then thawed to sit in a case. Worker/owner said that they are fresh. He though frozen food is fresh, then asked me what he should do? I said make them every day or every other day. To that he said they can't and it's fresh frozen. I did not like the place."}
