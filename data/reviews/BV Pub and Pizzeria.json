{"text":"Great place.  Laid back and a good menu. I had a flatbread and it was really good.  Cooked just right and a good portion.  Other patrons seemed happy with their wings.  Good prices on drink specials and their rotating food specials were well priced.  I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Guys... you've gotta come here. Genuine people, DELICIOUS CALZONES OMG,
Cheap drinks, and a local vibe. We shared the family size calzone and had a little to take home (two people with big appetites). They also play soccer games, so my husband was happy. Definitely our new fav local place."}
{"text":"Went there expecting good Italian at least good c√†lzone. Ordered  \" the works\" w pretty good!  however...The place had about 6 people total in it all impressed me as local bar flies. There was one fat sloppy looking woman who kept yelling her head off. I don't know if she was drunk deaf or both!!!The music they were playing there made rap sound pretty good....I hate rap with a passion!!! Save yourself go to Red Robin or Bahn Thai in the area I don't think I could have drank enough to make that place look good!!!"}
{"text":"Love it for the family or with the boys after a crappy round of golf.  Great atmosphere, a good combo of newbies and regulars lets us know we're in a friendly spot.  A great mix of foods means there is something on the menu for the health conscious wifey or I can gorge on awesome hot wings that are more like legs.  Don't even think about starting without putting an order of Pepperoni Rolls in, new favorite.  BV knows that cold beer, hot food and great customer service = very happy customer.  See you again soon."}
{"text":"Best wings in town.  My favorite neighborhood bar.  Ted, Hailey, and Amy (the owners) are awesome.  Bartenders Thomas, Deb, and Betsy are also great.  Give it a try.  Good pizza, good bar for football."}
{"text":"Great little place! Had worlds largest Calzone that was also huge on taste. Good music, warm (it was freezing outside). We'll be back soon!"}
{"text":"I stopped in one day with a few friends shortly after they opened and is now my local favorite. Food is very good. Pepperoni rolls are one of my favorites. Chicken wings are meaty. Pizza is excellent! We find it a hidden Italian secret in Ballantyne.  It's nice to walk in and be welcomed with a warm hello and immeditae service. Happy hour prices cant be beat and they even provide Koozies to keep your beer cold . Great environment for friends and the whole family. On point all around!!"}
{"text":"Good pizza, very good meatballs and reasonably priced wine. I really like this place but if you're not a regular you don't get great service. And the pasta was awful! Stick with the bar food and you'll be fine."}
{"text":"They've got small standard bar, have only light beer. I went to this place by myself a couple times to pass time and watch some game. Chicken wings were good, and the pizza as well. Fairly priced drinks. Bartender is a very nice person."}
{"text":"Love this place! It is a regular for me and my co-workers for lunch and happy hour. Food is good, the 'Roni Roll is delicious and they have great daily food and drink specials. All of the employees are awesome. We love Haley!"}
{"text":"This place is GREAT!!! Food is outstanding and priced fair. Service is spot on and they have a great beer selection. Try the belly buster while you are there. The staff is EXTREMELY friendly and seems to know just about every customer by name."}
{"text":"This was our first visit to Buona Vita and we'll definitely go back! The restaurant is cozy and well staffed, and on a Friday night the crowd was about average - no wait. We ordered the mozzarella sticks for an appetizer and they were good, but nothing out of the ordinary, exactly what you'd expect. 

We each got a Calzone and that's when we were blown away. The bread/crust was fluffy yet crispy and cooked perfectly. The waitress even told us to take a picture before we started eating because it was so perfect. I had mushrooms, black olives and green peppers in mine and my husband had pepperoni and meatballs in his. We both LOVED them and will certainly go back for them again! This is a great little spot for date night, locally owned and good service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Good lasagna for lunch- service was great and I would definitely go back if I lived in the area.
Menu looks diverse, atmosphere was clean and sports oriented- the food coming from the kitchen all looked delicious."}
{"text":"This is a great surprise. Unassuming from the front of the building. Had the shrimp scampi and it was great. Super fast service and everyone was super nice and attentive ! We defaulted here because of a wait at another restaurant nearby. So glad we did. We'll be back. Nice job !"}
{"text":"We were looking for some pizza in the neighborhood that we hadn't tried yet and Buona Vita was one of the first ones to pop up. Tucked into the Toringdon shoppes, it has the nice neighborhood-y pizza place feel. Just a few booths, small bar seating, a few hightops and tables. Nothing out of the ordinary and nothing groundbreaking but certainly reliable in a pinch. 

We made it in at dinnertime and we were one of three groups. Our server was nice and, I think, the only one on the floor at the time. We ordered a veggie calzone, 6 wings and a side salad. It took close to 25 minutes for our food to come out, but it wasn't a huge deal. Just wonder what it would be like if it were a full house. 

The salad was pretty weak with a hint of veggies, wilted lettuce, and bleu cheese. The bleu was made in-house and was pretty good. The wings were great. Barbalo (buffalo and bbq) and had great flavor. I'd come back on Thursdays when their wings are .50 each. The calzone was ok. The veggies inside were pretty lackluster and the marinara was pretty bland. The dough/crust they use is good, though. Great flavor and cooked well. Just could use a little improvement on the fillings. 

I think the rest of their menu is probably good and I would order something completely different next time around. 

After our experience with what we ordered, I won't be rushing back but would consider it again if we were in a pinch for some Za!"}
{"text":"The wings here are cooked perfectly - and you can get dry rub or wet - and both are amazing.   I loved the Carolina sauce.   The service was amazing as well - our server was very attentive even though they were busy.   Great selection of craft brews as well.  Nice outdoor patio.    Living up to their name Buena Vita. ... \"The Good Life\"."}
{"text":"Great wings and bleu cheese dipping sauce. The staff is welcoming and the atmosphere is great.  I will be coming back for more wings."}
{"text":"Excellent place to chill and check out sports over lunch.  Their pizza is pretty remarkable, similar to New York Style, large foldable slices.  

The burgers are very good with different themed ones as well. The BV signature burger has pesto, grilled red peppers and mozzarella, which is pretty top notch.  Also a good bar for drinks after work, and a very popular spot for Trivia on Thursday nights.  Try their Big Meaty pizza, their calzones, and the Chicken Parm sub.  You can't go wrong with either of these.

Only thing bad about the place is when they are packed it can be a bit noisy.  This is one place that's more of a \"friend's hangout\" than romantic atmosphere, but that's okay."}
{"text":"This is my wife's cousin's go to place every Friday night. They even reserve a table.  

We had a large group of 10. The service was outstanding. We never waited for drinks and they constantly checked on us even though they had another large party there at the same time.

I try to eat healthy (most times) so I had a gluten free spicy chicken wrap.  What I really wanted was the Belly Buster sandwich. A monster of a sandwich. It is 8 inches of garlic bread with meatballs,sausage,pepperoni, cheese, banana peppers and mozzarella sticks.  They also have a challenge for their 16 inch version.  No one has accomplished this feat as of yet. 

The  wife had the chicken cordon bleu wrap with fresh garlic Parmesan potato chips.

I can see why my wife's family keeps coming back. Nice place to watch a game and hang out with friends."}
{"text":"Great people and a comfortable inviting atmosphere.  Food is great and the bartenders are attentive and keep the glasses full. Thomas and Becky are awesome!!"}
{"text":"Great neighborhood spot for Italian. They support good causes like the Isabella Santos Foundation, so I want to support businesses like this. I came for a spaghetti dinner for ISF, which included salad and spaghetti. So yummy and friendly service. 

Several beer and wine options, delicious homemade potato chips with garlic and Parmesan, so what more do you want?

Will be back to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"This bar & pizza restaurant is on the smaller side of things.

During lunch it can take a little bit longer to receive your food, however, both the pizzas and calzones are worth waiting for. Not only are they fresh and cooked to order (unlike some of the places that offer pizza by the slice), but they are also priced fairly. 

They also offer a daily special for those looking for additional savings.

The service is reasonably quick and always friendly.

I have not been during the evening, but for lunch I would recommend Buona Vita without hesitation."}
{"text":"Welcome to the bar where everyone knows your name.

I am so thrilled that this is my neighborhood bar. Amazing bartenders, great company, and good food, what more can you ask for!

My go to meal is the BV burger with chicken breats. The pizzas are always made to order and have a lovely homemade crust. 


Don't forget every night is Ladies Night ;)"}
{"text":"Saw some good reviews and always looking for good pizza in Charlotte so decided to give this a try.  It's a small place with about 12 tables and a bar that seats about 10.  They do have a good draft beer selection considering how small the place is.  Looks like they have some good happy hour food specials 4-7 M-F as well.

Went solo so not able to try a lot but what I did get was very good.  Ordered a calzone with meatballs, sausage, spinach and roasted red peppers.  Thought it was very good.  Marinara was good and it was a good size portion,  this is a place I would good back to."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! Let's update BV's review!

Turns out, the bar WAS full of regulars and they are now my friends. No seriously, they'll tell you they're my friends. I DID see them the day after I wrote my initial review, and the day after that, and the day after that, and the day after that.... And I love them. 

The food is delicious. They switch to a \"late night\" menu after around 9pm, when the grills get turned off, but even everything on there is delicious. I've had everything from the pizza to the Grown up Mac & Cheese, and its fantastic. The beers are local and domestic. You could pick a beer off the tap lineup, or grab a PBR or High Life. Keeping it classy. Football is big, if there's a game on (especially panthers) then a seat may be hard to find. Come early. The bartenders are fantastic and friendly, remember your name and your drink. 

One of my favorite things about this bar is the regulars, and not just because I am one. Every time I come in here they have some charity event coming up - whether its collecting blankets for the local dog shelter, or raising money for Isabella Santos Foundation (shameless plug), BV is helping, connecting people and bringing the community together. I love it. This year alone, they've  raised over $2000 for the Isabella Santos Foundation, and over $7000 at their local charity golf tournament for Making Strides. 

I love this bar. See you all tomorrow, its ladies night - its gonna be big. 

Go Jets."}
{"text":"Definitely a regular here!!  Always greeted with a smile and my miller lite in a koozie.  Very clean, food is always on point and its a great local place with a diverse kind of crowd that all get along well."}
{"text":"I've now been here twice and will be back for a third trip as well. It's filled with regulars who are super friendly.  The first time I went I sat at the bar and ordered their wings and some fries.  Great wings.  I'm not a huge fan of wings that are smoked but these were decent.  They also had good drink specials both times i went.  They have a small happy hour food menu hanging on the wall as well.  It's not much cheaper than their regular menu prices though. 
The second time I went I tried the funky chicken pizza and it was pretty good.  I enjoyed the crust a lot.  The big let down was that we waited an hour and a half four our pizza because the waitress forgot to put the order in. I should probably give them three stars because of this but I really didn't notice how long it had been because I was having such a good time chatting and drinking the $6 Moscow mules.  (Those were amazing!)
I will be back and I want to try out a calzone and the meatball sub.  I've heard nothing but good things about their calzones.  The staff was friendly and other than the mix up with the pizza, the service was great."}
{"text":"Thanks to our fellow yelpers, we decided to check this place out. We live just a short drive away. The place has the perfect \"neighborhood pizza joint\" vibe. Small bar, limited seating and space, but it yet it seems like just the perfect amount.

It's not a surprise that there are lots of regulars. The food and drink are reasonably priced, and the service was very attentive. 

Knowing from previous reviews that the calzones were GIGANTIC, we decided to split an appetizer and a calzone. We opted for the meatball sliders, which is essentially their meatball sub cut into 4 pieces. Although it wasn't what we pictured, the meatballs were outstanding, and the bread was fresh and crispy. I would, however recommend you just order the sandwich. The calzone certainly did not disappoint! We ordered the medium, and it could have fed 4 of is. The crust was light, flaky, and cooked to perfection. We will certainly be freezing it for a rainy day. 

Why 4 stars, you ask ?(ok, you didn't): What I presumed to be the kitchen crew when we arrived was huddled around the front door smoking when we got there. Every time the door would open, a plume of smoke would come in the restaurant. Knowing that they are going directly back to cook our food is disgusting. This continued to happen throughout the meal, it was a virtual parade of smoky-smelling employees walking past our table. Not what you want mixing with your delicious calzone! Not sure why they can't smoke further away from the entrance or out back.  


I think we may return on a Thursday to check out the 50 cent wings and trivia. Hopefully we can snag a spot away from the front door."}
{"text":"Worst food.. Not coming back again!

Tried the veggie wrap and the garlic parmesan potato chips for lunch . The wrap had no flavor to it and the chips were too fried."}
{"text":"Try the blackened burger...so good!

Note: My ONLY problem with this place is that they do this weird trivia contest on Thursday nights.  It's crowded, loud, and a bit obnoxious for my tastes.  It's the only time that my wife and I won't go there."}
{"text":"Food is horrible!  Everything tastes like it is straight out of a freezer or can.  I am not sure how this place stays open."}
{"text":"A Ballantyne Gem... Top notch food and top notch service, from the servers to the food runners, everyone has a smile.
As I write this my wife sneezed and one of the staff said bless you.
Place is small and cozy.
Been here 3 times.  Once a couple years ago and twice recently (hard to get out with little ones)"}
{"text":"1st experience was with one of my daughters about 6 months ago. Couldn't remember the name of the place and barely remembered where as we had just relocated from across the country.  Brought all three girls today and they graciously seated us even though the entire place was reserved for a trivia night about 40 minutes later. Great service.  White Sauce Calzone was perfect!  Girls got Margherita Calzone and Bianca Pizza. They loved it!  The Penne & Meatballs was take-out for hubby...  he loved it too!  Looks like we have found a good go-to Italian!   The classic rock playing was an added bonus."}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday, there was one woman working and we waited a LONG time.... The food was just \"OK\" - maybe it was an off night, but I truly hoped for more flavorful sauce and certainly better service for a Sunday evening pizza/beer night. I give the one woman working the bar and tables credit - she maintained composure and did what she could, but it was a LOT to manage as nearly every table was taken as well as the bar. A bunch of what seemed to be regulars were in and out for smoke breaks which made the place smell like cigarettes pretty consistently. (It's a small place so this was not really shocking).  We may be back, but it'll be awhile before we venture in - figure we'll give them time to get it together."}
{"text":"This is a casual restaurant and neighborhood spot. The food is good, especially the pizza and calzones. The prices are affordable and they host a very fun trivia night every Thursday. The lunch specials are good for people like me who work in the office park behind the restaurant to grab a quick quality meal."}
{"text":"Huge fan of their meatball subs! Homemade meatballs plus just the right amount of crunch of the bread (I'm all about the texture). Great place to grab a beer or do a quick business lunch meeting. Conveniently located off 485 & Johnston Rd. I'll continue to come back!"}
{"text":"Thursday night is 50cent wing night, which I especially enjoyed because
(a) there is also Team Trivia
(b) they mixed Hot and Lemon Pepper flavors for me, which oddly many places don't
(c) they let me order 10 instead of forcing me to order in multiples of 6
(d) they gave me all flappers
(e) my tea refills were frequent (which helped since their Hot is actually Hot)

5 reasons, 5 stars, done. I'd happily go back."}
{"text":"Best pizza and chicken wings in Charlotte. Great food! Great people! Great staff!

It's a fun neighborhood bar."}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere. Employees are genuinely nice. The pizza is not greasy, well none of it is. It has games inside to keep you entertained. Clean sometimes and TV inside have good channels."}
{"text":"I won't be back. It was just so unremarkable on every level that I can't see myself becoming even a fan.

First off, we showed up at dinnertime and there were maybe 3 tables with people sitting at them. A family, some friends raucously laughing in the bar area, and some other crew. We had heard this place was worth trying, and it's quite close to where we live, so we thought, \"why not?\"

We are kind of pretzel snobs, so we immediately asked if the pretzel appetizer consisted of house-made pretzels. Negative. One star removed just for that. With so many establishments in the area hoofing it to make their own pretzels, and this place already has some baking happening (pizza), I expected better. We skipped apps and ended up splitting a mediocre salad. 

I ordered a veggie calzone, expecting something delicious. When it FINALLY arrived, it was enormous and beautiful. I mean, huge! I believe there's a picture of this monster on the restaurant listing. Digging in, i found two types of cheese. Mozz and goat cheese (?). Texture-wise, it was strange because of the mozzarella's super melty-ness and the other cheese's not-quite-as-much-ness. The vegetables inside, once I found them, were boring. No italian seasonings, no char, nothing remarkable. And the marinara served as a dipping sauce didn't deliver either. I couldn't have eaten the whole thing if I'd tried, not that it would have been worth the effort. I read up and saw that other reviewers had better experiences. I believe the Mr. had some good wings, and I imagine that carnivores would appreciate a calzone with some spicy meats inside.

For me, this place just didn't make the list of return spots."}
