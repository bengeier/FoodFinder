{"text":"Great 4-course meal. I would recommend PGH night combo (is it the name for that?). It's such an interesting experience to watch the chocolate being set on fire. And the combination of wine & cheese/chocolate has a great and novel taste. You definitely wanna try it. The dessert plate is  and can be refilled. The meat plate is just enough for two people's appetite."}
{"text":"This was my first fondue restaurant experience.  I would definitely recommend the Melting Pot.  All of the staff was very courteous.   We had a large, loud, birthday crowd and our our waiter and waitress  were very patient and helpful. We had called ahead and reserved so they had sat us in the large back room which was perfect for this rowdy bunch!  We all ordered the Couples special which included 3 courses for around $42, which is an excellent price.  We had an odd number of people, but just ordered an extra couples special and shared all around.  There was more than enough food!  I really enjoyed the cheese fondue and LOVED the chocolate desert fondue.  Since we had a larger group, we were able to try several of the cheese and chocolate options and all were great.  I wasn't a fan of the meat course, although the shrimp, chicken, and beef pieces looked fresh and perfect.  This was a personal issue and not a fault of the Melting Pot.  I just don't think I am a fan for the flavor of boiled beef - it's not exactly comparable to steak on the grill!    I would definitely head back for desert any day though!"}
{"text":"Good service, food, and atmosphere. Am a repeat customer to this location. Very pleased."}
{"text":"I have only had one experience at the Melting Pot, but it was a great one. 

Very friendly staff, our waiter was smart and out-going. 

But seriously... $100 for two people to cook their own food?"}
{"text":"Never again! Horrible service!! 
The booths are very snug. The waitress wasn't willing to assist and move us to a better table. We ended up leaving"}
{"text":"My experience at the Pittsburgh Melting Pot was a carnival of horrors. The cheese fondue tasted as if it were melted from Velveeta and tears. The entree was foul, the raw meat cubes we were served were slimy and grey, and the manager who visited our table was obviously drunk. She had red wine stains on her teeth. Never again."}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Melting Pot for a Girl's Night during Restaurant Week.  We got the 25 buck special that included a yummy cheese fondue, salad, and entree including shrimp, chicken, and two kinds of beef.  We were there over 2 hours and enjoyed everything!  Our waitress, Melanie, was fabulous.  Not sure why our past visits were so expensive.  This meal seemed very similar to the others except it didn't include dessert.  Still, fabulous experience!"}
{"text":"We were visiting Pittsburgh from out of town and had just finished our tour on one of the ducky tours ( which I highly recommend by the way) and were looking for some dinner. I've never been to a fondue restaurant but thought it may be a fun option for the kids. 

After having everything explained to us by the extremely helpful and patient waitress we placed our order.  Our family of four ( me, wife and two young boys) split two of the four course meals which ended up being the perfect amount for us. 

I think overall the food was good but it was more the overall experience that made this an enjoyable night. The boys loved being able to pick and choose their own food options and following along with the cooking. It was a little tricky trying to keep track of everyone's cooking times during the main portion.

Overall I would highly recommend this place, my boys would too as they say it was their favourite meal of our trip."}
{"text":"I loved how this dining experience is so unique. You cook your own meal in the pot while it boils in front of you. I did the four course with my bf and it was so filling!!"}
{"text":"We wanted to celebrate a special occasion and this was the place.  The service is as good as it gets, attentive, patient, respectful. Our server, Bernard was exceptional.  Three of the four of our party were \"first time\" guest at The Melting Pot so we had many questions, all answered by an expect server.  The cheese fondue was great, the salads not too big and very delicious. The entrees pleased everyone, just wonderful - I want more lobster!!  Our chocolate fondue put everyone over the top, happy happy joy joy.  We spent three hours slowly enjoying every bite, every bit of conversation, our family had an unforgettable time.  The very kind manager checked on our table multiple times and we could tell she genuinely wanted to be sure we were happy.  Bernard helped make our happy occasion every happier."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing. Fabulous atmosphere, server, and food. No complaints at all! The restaurant itself is very nice. The food was delicious and an overall wonderful experience! Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The place needs an overhaul ..dirty tacky tables ..did not accept a gift card with an expired date ..thought there was a law that there was to be no expiration date on a gift ..the food was just so so ..the place was hot an smelly..no air conditioning"}
{"text":"Recently dined here for a work function, it was amazing! Such a unique experience, friendly staff and great atmosphere. We were in a more private area too which added to the experience because our group didn't have to worry about being too loud. Will definitely be taking the wife here for a romantic dinner soon."}
{"text":"Highly highly recommend the flaming turtle chocolate fondue. milk chocolate, caramel, and pecans. The sides came with marshmallows, rice crispy treats, pound cake, brownies, bananas and strawberries. So good :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have come here twice now. We enjoy the food a lot. The waiters bring out prongs to use to put your food into the cooking pot for a few minutes. Both times, we've gotten the four-course meal.

1) Starting appetizer is a cheese fondue with bread, celery, carrots, and fruit. Very cheesy and delicious.

2) Next is a salad, which is the only part of the meal that doesn't involve the cooking pot,

3) Third is the main course, which we ordered with ravioli, various meats, tuna, etc. The broth was delicious both times.

4) Last is the chocolate fondue. We got the yin and yang the first time, which I loved. They bring out fruit, brownies, blondies, rice krispies, and more with the chocolate fondue. 

Overall I'm a huge fan of this place, even if it's on the higher end of prices I'm willing to pay. Delicious!"}
{"text":"I came here often on special occasions with my boyfriend when I used to live in Pittsburgh. All of the fondues are delicious, my favorite being the dessert fondues. For the fondues, you can have as many helpings to the food that goes for the cheese fondue. 

If you live in Pittsburgh or go here often, make sure to join their mailing list. They have great specials often for cheese, dessert, and wine specials as a package. It's a great thing to do on the weekends, hanging out with friends, and I would say up to 4 people could all share the dessert and cheese fondues.

Atmosphere is warm and romantic, they have areas where you don't even realize there are other patrons. They also take special requests, such as flowers, chocolate, waiting for you at the table if it's a special occasion. If you order the whole meal, you can definitely spend at least 2 to 3 hours slowly enjoying all of the food!"}
{"text":"Maybe I am just a sucker for romantic atmospheres -- I love The Melting Pot with a capital \"L\" 
Start with dessert first. Not literally, I mean, it's up to you. This is my favorite part and I am drooling just thinking about it right now. The chocolate fondue in several variations, paired with fresh fruit, cake, and more (it's to DIE for). Well, maybe not DIE, I tend to exaggerate when it comes to things I love. But I'm a big chocolate enthusiast, so of course, this is something I look forward to every time I visit The Melting Pot. The servers are very casual and usually quite knowledgeable, and don't really force you into settling for a payment plan if all you want is an appetizer. I only say payment plan because a meal for two is actually quite expensive, especially if you go all out and get wine, drinks, etc. The appetizer fondue is amazing as well. With the cheese or chocolate fondue, you pick any combination you like of what they have to offer, the choices are basically unlimited. The appetizers come with vegetables and an array of fresh bread bits. The ambiance is really nice, generally quiet, romantic, lights dimmed way down low. I have good memories of this place, and it's in a nice location of Pittsburgh in Station Square looking over the river. The sad thing is, you really wouldn't want to take your date out to any of the clubs next door afterwards, unless you wanted her to get groped in a corner on her way out of the bathroom or trashed talked to by some fugly wigger or wiggette. Sad but true. 
The parking is in a garage close to the mall where The Melting Pot is located, and is relatively inexpensive, which honestly, will be the least of your concerns when dining here."}
{"text":"There's no friggin way this place can be rated 4 stars. Whoever hasn't rated this 5 stars is really stupid and shouldn't be on Yelp if all they're going to do is play around and be stupid. I mean, any review under 4 stars is just little kids playing around on a website/app for those who are trying to be helpful.

I didn't get a real meal, because I had ate at the Hard Rock (also in Station Square). But I had a chocolate fondue. If you've ever been to Wildwood, you'll know what this expression means: It was better than Duffers. Maybe not. Duffers is, or, WAS, my favorite place to eat EVER. Now, I found a better one.

I ordered the s'mores fondue. It was the greatest thing I ever tasted. I never wanted to leave. You will know what the expression, \"Feels like I'm in heaven\" really means when you order a fondue. I recommend this place strongly.

TO THOSE 1-STAR REVIEWERS OF THIS PLACE: Get offa Yelp. You've gotta be kidding me. You kind of people disgust me. I mean, 5 stars and I agree with you. 4 stars and that's okay. But 1 star? Knock it off."}
{"text":"Coming to The Melting Pot was a great and fun experience, but it's not a place where I would frequent. I came with a friend for dessert, and the thing that confused me the most was the fact that they couldn't switch us to a table with 2 of the pot burner things. The restaurant was 3/4 empty so I don't see why they had to force us to share just one. This meant that we could only try one type of fondue at a time. Either way, we decided on the Yin and Yang chocolate fondue which was half white chocolate and half milk chocolate. Sadly, the 2-person portion of fruits and cake that came with it was barely enough for 1 person. It also took them almost 35 minutes to put together that SMALL plate. There was obviously no cooking involved since its just fruits and cake and the restaurant was almost empty so I really don't know what took them so long. 

Sure, the chocolate was good and my Instagram account was happy -- everything looked appetizing and tasted good but the whole experience wasn't worth the time and money."}
{"text":"Went to the Melting Pot for a special occasion yesterday - simply put - awesome! 
 
Atmosphere:  Quaint and elegant.  Well chosen  music in the background.  Great place for a romantic evening or a fun party out.

Service: From the bar manger Hank to the hostess and our fabulous server - honestly - they could not have done a better job.  Our server was knowledgeable  - pleasant and attentive. You could tell she came to her restaurant on her off time.  She was insightful and helpful.  She was there when you wanted her to be but was in no way overbearing.  She was an absolute delight.

Food: Very fresh and plenty of it.  We chose the Big Night Out.  Picked what worked out for us - were able to substitute anything we did not like. Great selection - fresh and plentiful.  Everything you could want.

Wine:  As it was a special occasion  - I brought my own bottle. Corkage fee was more than reasonable.  Being the curious type I also read the wine list.  The list was complete and well balanced.  Anybody - novice to expert - on a budget or not - could absolutely find a great bottle of wine.  This is a great list and one I will be ordering from in the future.

Allergy:  My girlfriend has a severe life threatening nut allergy.  When our server came to the table she was already aware of it.  She explained all the food options and what needed to be avoided.  She also stressed any actions she took to assure there was no nut contact.  I have witnessed many restaurants deal with this allergy and they were by the far the best.

I rarely if ever post these types of reviews - but our experience was so good I felt guilty not sharing our excellent experience.

Stop by - you will be amazed."}
{"text":"That is an amazing place where you can relly relax and enjoy your time!! The atmosphere is incredible!! Our waitress Erin was so awesome!! Thank you,Erin!! You made our day :-)"}
{"text":"If you love fondue, you must visit The Melting Pot. From cheese to chocolate, they do it right! And the minute you walk in, the smell is just amazing. The cheese and chocolate fodues are decadent and hit the spot. They provide a great selection of things for dipping (for cheese they offer bread and veggies and for chocolate the plate has bananas, strawberries, marshmallows, cheesecake, pound cake, and brownies). 

My husband and I went once for the Big Night Out -- a three course meal of cheese fondue, the main course of meats you cook in a broth, and then a dessert of chocolate. We felt like we were there forever. And I think we were there for at least three hours! This is in part because of the time it takes you to cook the raw meats of the main course in the fondue broth. We were not prepared for such a long experience. Some people may love this. We didn't. And we thought it was expensive. Since then, we have gone just for the cheese and chocolate -- just as satisfying, much quicker, and cheaper. 

I had my 30th bday party here, too. For our party of about 16 people, they had set up a long table in a private room. It was nice to have the privacy. We ordered four kinds of chocolate fondue and therefore got to sample lots of sweet flavors. It was a lot of fun!

Whenever you plan to go, definitely make a reservation! They get really busy. It's the only place of its kind in the city!! Also, if you're looking for an especially romantic experience, there are some tables that are kind of secluded and you feel like you're in your own little alcove in the restaurant. I'm sure these tables can be specially requested."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is very quaint and each dining group gets a booth that makes them feel like they are in a very private setting. Set aside about 3 hours for your visit. It's four courses and each item (except for salad) needs to be prepared. The drinks are phenomenal. The wine list is very nice...compliments main entrées nicely. Great special occasion eatery."}
{"text":"Did you know that The Melting Pot has gluten-free options? AND GLUTEN-FREE POUND CAKE?! If that sweet tooth craving needs some attention, this will satisfy.

I stopped in with a small group of friends near closing time, and the staff was more than accommodating to make sure we got our JUST DESSERT. They didn't even mention closing at our arrival, but it was obvious once we sat and realized no one was in the restaurant; alas, this had no effect on the great service! 

Naturally, I couldn't indulge in the s'mores stuff that my friends were eating, but I could order my own pot of chocolate, and received a huge plate full of fruits and cakes and sweets -- double-dipping all to myself! Did I mention the pound cake? 

A strawberry, marshmallow, brownie, pineapple... all coated in four chocolate-y stars, Melting Pot!"}
{"text":"The place is great. They have a really nice dinner ambiance. The waiter we had while here had the perfect amount of service and friendliness. The food was amazing. The price tag to go with it is understandable when you have the food."}
{"text":"This review is several weeks coming! My fiancé and I had dinner at the Melting Pot. We promptly lost the card we were given with our servers name on it, and didn't get a copy of our receipt when we left. As luck would have it though, I just found the lost card in my car under the seats. BERNARD!!! Our servers name was Bernard, and he was by far one of the best servers we have ever had. Not just at this restaurant, hell not even just in Pittsburgh, but anywhere that we have ever eaten. He had the warm & friendly energy that we wish all people had. We had an amazing time and excellent experience because of him. We are frequent visitors and big fans of the melting pot, and people like Bernard are the reason why. Servers can truly make the experience. The food was great. The atmosphere is always cozy & enjoyable. Now if only they could COPY PASTE of waiter!"}
{"text":"Really nice place. Kind of expensive (over $100 per couple with the advertised special,) but a decent place for a romantic date night or fun with friends. The cheese fondue is great, but the meat in the entree is lacking any kind of flavor. The dessert is delicious with a plate full of cakes and fruit to dip into chocolate, with an offering of different chocolates to choose from."}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for the first time last night for our anniversary.  We loved it!  The food was delicious.  We each ordered a 4 course meal.  I got the original entree which had a little bit of everything and my husband ordered the steak lovers.  It all was very flavorful.  We ended with the original chocolate fondue which is milk chocolate with crunchy peanut butter.  That is what I was looking forward to all night. It was well worth it. The one thing I would suggest is just getting one 4 course entrée to split and maybe an extra salad. My husband and I were so stuffed! Overall a great experience. Our waitress was very helpful and friendly."}
{"text":"I went to the Melting Pot for my birthday and I was so excited to try it! I was not very impressed at all! You start off with cheese fondue as like an appetizer and then for your meal you cook your own meat right in front of you in a hot seasoning(you could pick the flavors you wanted.) They give you colored cooking sticks so you can keep track of who's meat is who's. Then I the best part of the night was the dessert fondue. You picked what kind of dipping sauce you wanted and you got fruit, cake, etc. to dip into it. In general I wasn't a fan of the whole experience! I'd only go back just for dessert not to actually eat a meal there."}
{"text":"Perfect date night for us. Slowed down the dinner process with the 4 courses . Enjoyed the food. Waiter was great."}
{"text":"My husband and i tried this for first time on a saturday night (1/12/17). Got there early (4pm) and were seated right away (no reservation). Our server dallas was wonderful the entire time! She knew it was our first time and took her time explaining things. Was expensive but you're paying for the atmosphere and experience. Would definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Worst. Place. Ever. Appears nice at first, but you do NOT want to see what goes on behind those doors.. especially between the manager and his favorites.."}
{"text":"Got the \"Big Night Out\" couples special. Worth every penny. Was nice we could substitute the cheese fondue, salad and dessert for what we wanted. Was highly satisfied with the entree choice. The \"three rivers feast entree came with: teriyaki steak, filet mignon, chicken breast, 4 shrimp, bbq seasoned pork, and pot stickers. We also added a lobster tail.  

Started with the fiesta cheese fondue which was excellent. Beer base, cheddar cheese and salsa. The waitress allowed us to choose how spicy we wanted the cheese by adding fresh jalapeños which was nice. We went for hot which was perfect level of spicy. This was served with a white bread, pumpernickel, tortilla chips, baby carrots, cherry tomatoes, broccoli, and Granny Smith Apples (not a good combo personally). 

Caesar salad was next. Pretty standard. Small but that was ok because I didn't want to get too full.


Next was the entree. The meats were served with mushrooms, redskin potatoes and broccoli. We cooked it Coq Au Vin style 
(burgundy wine infused with fresh herbs, spices and mushrooms.) The pork was my favorite and hers was the seafood. It was also served with 6 small dipping sauces (+1 for lobster) which paired greatly with all the meats and vegetables. 


Lastly, grand finale! White chocolate Creme brûlée. Went all out and got the additional dippers. Fresh strawberries, raspberries, blackberries, bananas, chocolate chip cookie, brownie, pound cake, gram cracker coated marshmallows, Oreo coated marshmallows, slice of cheesecake, cream puffs, Rice Krispie treats, and some rolled cookie. 

Staff was great. They clear your table fast so no dirty plates sit around. If you ever need more specific dippers they'll bring them for you. Very accommodating. Didn't like the first beer I got so the waitress didn't charge me for it and got me a different one even though I didn't care. Overall if you're willing to spend some cash but for great quality and quantity, this is the place to go."}
{"text":"We went to The Melting Pot the day before Valentine's day, we had to sit at the bar because all tables were reserved - which I didn't mind.

I was under the assumption that you had to order the full prix menu (it appeared that people were coming in to bar and just having cheese or chocolate- no big deal we wanted the full experience anyway!) of cheese, salad, entree and dessert - it surprised me it was so pricey $110 for 2.  We figured it was worth it and ordered our cheese (crab - very horseradishy - which we love), salad - Strawberry Almond - excellent!, entree was combo platter of filet, lobster, shrimp, marinated chicken, marinated strip steak, salmon, ravoli & vegetables - with the oil - all the meat, sauces were excellent.  The least spectacular course was unbelievably the chocolate lol - we got the Raspberry Milk chocolate and it was good but I guess I would have enjoyed a dark chocolate one more - the assortment of dippables was very good - cheesecake, rice krispie treats, strawberries, marshmellows etc.  
All in all it was an excellent experience and meal - my bf and I love cooking together so it was not overwhelming for us - (I did over hear other people who were a bit confused or over whelmed though)  We will be back for another special occasions and the experience has inspired us to try it at home too!  Our meal with bottle of wine and tip topped out at $160."}
{"text":"Don't lick the pot! Double Date Night is a great deal and fondue is perfect for groups. Will be coming back"}
{"text":"It was a Monday night ... no Pirate game ... no concert ... we were immediately seated.  I would highly recommend reservations.

We started with the cheddar cheese fondue.  Bread, soft pretzels, apples, carrots, celery, and broccoli were plentiful for dipping dunking submerging into gooey cheese. The iceberg salad ... ugh ... spring greens would have made this a 5 star review.

My date and I typically don't share meals ... carnivore v. will try anything.  We chose a citrus broth to cook our food.  He had filet, jerk beef, and pork.  I had the shrimp, tuna, and salmon.   We cooked the potatoes, mushrooms, and broccoli in the broth. 

Beware the potatoes take a long time to cook and are really hot. 

We finished our meal with the smores fondue.  Marshmallows, rice krispie treats, brownies, strawberries, and bananas were our dipping options ... the fondue was crumbled graham crackers, milk chocolate, and marshmallow... very good.

They are running a sweepstakes ... win $100/month gift card for a year for completing the service survey.

Highly recommend .... great date night"}
{"text":"Pros:
- Cheese fondue is excellent.  Chocolate fondue is excellent.  Who doesn't love dipping things in cheese or chocolate?  The Melting Pot gives you bread, veggies, and apples for the cheese, and a whole tray of delicious goodies for the chocolate - cheesecake, brownies, strawberries, bananas, marshmallows.  There are also multiple kinds of cheese and chocolate fondues.
- Service is really good.  If it's a special occasion, you can order flowers to be waiting at the table.  Because it was our five-year anniversary, our waitress brought us just enough champagne to do a toast, at no charge.  They tucked us away in a private little booth, but we weren't forgotten.

The cons:
- I'm surprised no one mentioned this, but I thought the entree was really bland.  You heat up your entree in broth, which doesn't add much flavor.  It's basically diet food.  Even the wide array of yummy sauces couldn't save the vegetarian entree.  My boyfriend ordered chicken, chorizo, shrimp and something else, and his came with spices already on the meats, so it was slightly better than mine.

The consensus was that it would be a lot faster and a lot cheaper to come and just get cheese & chocolate fondues, and maybe a drink.  I definitely look forward to doing that again sometime soon."}
{"text":"I have been to The Melting Pot a few times now and it has always been a great experience, ESPECIALLY my latest visit on Wednesday!! The food and drinks were amazing! 
And I don't know if managers actually read these but our waiter was Robert and he was thee best!!!!!! He was super polite, he went above and beyond for my friend who had a gluten allergy and was sweet. He explained everything and made sure we always had what we needed. There need to be more waiters like him because he truly made our experience so much better!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to the Melting Pot on a whim last night.  Despite the fact that we didn't have a reservation, we were lucky enough to find a seat at the bar.  We ordered from the prix fixe menu.  I had the Fondue Delight and my husband had the Fondue Fusion.  Both were really, really good with the coq au vin cooking bouillon.  For our cheese course, we chose the Traditional Swiss Cheese fondue and that came with broccoli, cauliflower and carrots and a nice helping of bread cubes.  My only complaint is that there was a heavy alcohol taste to the cheese sauce... it might have benefited from being cooked a bit longer to remove some of the alcoholic taste.  But, it was very good.  We chose the spinach mushroom salads for our second course.  The mushrooms and spinach were very fresh and quite tasty with the shallot vinaigrette that it came with.  The main courses were excellent but the bartender's estimation of cooking times were not very accurate and led to undercooked food.  Fortunately, I am a cook, so we were able to gauge when stuff was appropriately cooked.  The bartender told us that the potatoes should take about 10 minutes... they took 30.  The chicken, about 3 minutes.  It was about 5.  The shrimp and lobster, he said 1 minute.  I cooked them for about 2-3 minutes.  So, you need to be familiar with what undercooked feels like - rather than looks like (because the place is very dim).  We chose the bananas foster for our dessert course along with some 10 year old port.  The bartender told us that he was out of the 10 year old port, but was kind enough to up-sell us to the 20 for an extra dollar.  It was well worth it!  The dessert course was phenomenal!  It came with bananas, strawberries, rice krispie treats, cheesecake, red velvet cake cubes, chocolate cake cubes, and various flavors of marshmallows.  Overall, while it was an expensive meal, we left feeling good and happy for the experience.  I think sitting at the bar was fun because we got to talk to other customers and share our experiences with them.  I would not visit the Melting Pot every week but it is a wonderful special occasion place that I highly recommend.  We will be back."}
{"text":"My husband and I ate at Melting Pot for the first time on a Saturday night for restaurant week, so we got fixed price menu.  We like fondue, which is why we decided to check it out. But the cheddar fondue was really just beer cheese, though edible. The salad (California) was good. But the whole theme of \"cooking your own food\", is really just eating a bunch of co-boiled meats (the Restaurant week menu came with teriyaki Sirloin, Jerk Filet Mignon, Sweet & Spicy Shrimp, Roasted Garlic Chicken, Butternut Squash Ravioli, veggies) with a variety of dipping sauces. I actually can't remember the last meal I ate that was so dissatisfying."}
{"text":"Food and atmosphere are great.  My problem is this.... Out of the last three times I've gone there and asked to be seated at a booth ( after being asked if I had a reservation which I didn't) I was told they were all reserved but I could sit at the bar.  Each time I sit at the bar and enjoy my meal for over an hour whilst I am in an otherwise empty restaurant full of multiple empty booths. Who are these reserved for?  The one time I did make a reservation and arrived at the appointed time I was told there was an hour wait for a booth....while in view of four or five empty ones. When I complained I was immediately seated...... At the bar.    What is the managerial strategy here? Are they short staffed? Are they steering tipping customers to the bar tender/ server? Are there imaginary customers only they can see?   Weird."}
{"text":"My husband and I love this place!!! Food is always great, service is top notch.  The price is well worth the evening out.  We just went for our anniversary dinner.  Everything was perfect. At the end of the meal, our server brought us 2 glasses of champagne on the house and our bill even had Happy 3rd anniversary printed in big bold letters on the printout.  Such a nice touch.  We will be back again as soon as we can!"}
{"text":"We went here on Mother's Day 2017 for the first time. There was a special menu package for the Holiday and it did not disappoint. First the cheese fondue course. We were able to pick from three different kinds of cheese options. The waiter mixed all the ingredients in front of us while explaining each one and giving pointers on how to eat fondue since we had never before. Delicious!!!!

Next we're salads,.....nothing too out of the ordinary there, but good.

Next was a plate of raw proteins. Shrimp, marinated pork, three different kinds of beef and four mushroom filled pastas. Again, we were given directions for about how long it takes to cook each. It was all amazing! Just cook to your liking. I tended to cut everything in half to make sure it was cooked all the way through. A bowl of some veggies were also available. Several dipping sauces were provided. So good. So filling.

Lastly was desert. We chose the French Toast white chocolate and had all kinds of sweets like marshmallows, cake squares, banana and strawberries.

It's a fun experience and the food was great. Nice atmosphere. Pretty pricey, so I will reserve going back for special occasions, but we will most likely be back someday."}
{"text":"Yes its a chain, yes its expensive, yes the drinks are $8 and up...

But the quality is consistent. I have gone at least ten times in the few years it's been open at station square and never been disappointed.

It's extravagent and fun so great when you want to make an occasion out of something.

For two people we usually get a 2 person size cheese fondue, 2 salads, and one entree, which ends up around $45 bucks

Oh and I would avoid this place if you are a vegetarian and especially if you are vegan."}
{"text":"Yesterday we went to the Melting Pot for my sisters birthday ,and it was our first time. It was FABULOUS!! The atmosphere, the cocktails, the service and The Food was amazing! I was SOOOO FULLL I thought I might die, but it was totally worth it! Our server \"Matt\" had a great personality and very thorough and made it fun! We had another server and I  forget his name, but he was great as well! I'm a server myself and I'm an asshole about that stuff LOL!! So I was very happy to write my review today! GREAT SERVICE guys! Thank you!! Now the food was too good to be true! I love fondue, and this was fondue heaven!! I asked who prepared it and it was \"Nick\" . He did an amazing and clean job! I like to get names to give shout outs to those I feel that deserve it lol! For as much crap service n treatment you get these days anywhere , it's good to point out those who can do their job very well!! Melting Pot in Pittsburgh, WE WILL BE BACK!! Thank you! Xoxo

 also, whoever the bartender was yesterday evening, thank you for properly making our cocktails!! Praise the lord for a good mixologist!"}
{"text":"We had another nice experience here for yet another wedding anniversary, though this time it was just for dessert. Seating was available immediately but we had a good 10-15 minute wait for our server to show up. We didn't receive any of the special treatment this time: no rose for my wife, no card, no slice of cheesecake with our fondue.

The chocolate fondue here is excellent - however the graham crackers mixed into the s'mores tend to suck up all the fondue. I would have like to see it presented with a light graham cracker crumble on top instead of the large cracker chunks. 

The Chocolate Fontini was excellent."}
{"text":"The seasonal cheesecake is salted Carmel and it's sooo good. Tonight's visit was for dessert to celebrate my sister's birthday. We made it in right before they closed from the storm. We enjoyed the s'mores fondue with the usual plate of brownies, blondies, marshmallows, rice crispy treats, fruit and pound cake. I have a weakness for cheesecake so I always add it on! It's an extra $5 - totally worth it. It comes with cream puffs. 

If you are looking for a dessert spot for a special occasion I highly recommend it. It's intimate and offers a unique experience. They menu has a variety of chocolate fondues and even a make your own option."}
{"text":"Been here several times; usually with the kids for their birthdays.  Love this place!!! A guy named Jessie waited on us this time. The wait staff can make or break a dinner.  Jessie was totally awesome.  Polite, had a terminal smile on his face and laughed with us.  Someone like that could make a 3 star meal a 5; although the whole meal was a 5.  I also liked that the manager stopped to make sure everything was perfect, and it was."}
{"text":"My aunt and I decided to have a girls day and finally try the melting pot!!! Basically it was the best idea we have ever had. But it's more of a planned night and special occasion because it is expensive, but you do get your money's worth in experience and the taste!!!! First you start with cheese fondue and then they bring salad appetizers, followed by the main entree which you pick meat and seafood. Then last by not least desert!!! Different chocolate fondues and such. Which they give you cookies and fruit to dip in. We chose the peanut butter chocolate and it was A M A Z I N G! I cannot wait to go back and have it again. And our server was awesome! Very personable and explained everything throughly since in fact it was our first!"}
{"text":"I'm all for the cheesy experience, but I haven't been enjoying the food lately. I love the service, the experience, and a fun date night. I hope the menu receives a makeover soon. I will certainly give another chance though."}
{"text":"The BEST place to have celebrated my sister's birthday! Lots of yummy food, timed out perfectly to fill you up and keep the conversation going. Our server; Symone, was 10/10 attentive, personable, and accommodating to our group! Definitely a Pittsburgh must- and try the s'mores dessert fondue!!"}
{"text":"Tonight's meal was amazing. However, we knew the meal would be good. We knew all the parts of the meal would come together to make it a great evening! 
We picked the 4 course meal because it's worth it. We shared the fiesta cheese. Not super spicy but if you don't like spicy don't get it.
I had the strawberry salad and it was a perfect mix of salad and dressing. I picked my own meats. I had shrimp, tuna, steak, and lobster. We of course had dessert and we picked the original and it had milk chocolate with peanut butter and it was to die for.

The actual best part of our meal was our server , Nick. We were not expecting Nick to be so wonderful. He was nice, he explained the menu so well and he gave us complimentary champagne, like how awesome is that. We will continue to request him when we come back. He is the Beyoncé to our Jay-z and Blue Ivy. I hope he gets to read this !"}
{"text":"Absolutely brilliant idea! This place is so much fun. We had a great time and our waitress was incredible!!! So friendly and very helpful when it came to understanding the menu and how to cook the food!!! 

My girlfriend and I got the cheddar cheese fondue to start and I got the yin & yang martini (which was my favorite drink I've ever had...so delicious!!!). We then got the land and sea and the French quarter as the entrees. This included shrimp, chicken, filet mignon, and sausage. We also of course had to add a lobster tail on the side. This was just awesome food. They had six different dipping sauces that were awesome!  Everything was flavored very well and so much fun to cook!! 

For dessert we got the bourbon pecan chocolate fondue with bourbon, dark chocolate, carmel, and candied pecans!! Great dipping items too! Strawberries, marshmallows covered in Oreo crumbles and graham cracker crumbles, pineapple, brownie and chocolate chip cookie bites and Rice Krispie treats. I also had the espresso martini which was great with the sweetness of the chocolate. 

I would definitely go back but the bill was pretty steep because of all the drinks we ordered. But the service was the best I've had in a long time! Very personable. So it was well worth the money."}
{"text":"Like meat? Like boiled meat? How about spending over $100 to boil pieces of meat, one by one? Don't want to boil your steak in chicken broth? Too bad. How about sitting at a dark table while the steam blows in your face all evening? 

Like fondue cheese? Well, for a mere $100 they will give you stale bread and approx 2 baby carrots to dip.

Would be good place to go just for dessert, for the new experience, but cannot imagine going more than once. Once the novelty wears off, you can get much better desserts for far less. WAY over priced. Can go to MUCH better restaurants in Pittsburgh for far less money."}
{"text":"I love coming to the melting pot. I have been at this location a multitude of times and I am always satisfied upon my departure. I tend to go on \"Ladies Night Out\" because it's a great deal for the experience. You get a salad choice, cheese and chocolate. The portions are tiny but they will refill some of your dippers free of charge if you didn't quite get enough of something. I always think this isn't going to be enough and by the time I leave I can barely move. Because there are several courses it is much more filling than it appears. I have yet to come across a fondue flavor that I haven't liked yet, although I have not tried them all."}
{"text":"Went to college in Pittsburgh, and discovered melting pot from my friends. I LOVEEE their dessert! You can go just for dessert or you can also choose to go for the whole meal.

I tried various desserts and I love almost all of them. As for the main course, obviously lobster is wonderful if you are willing to pay for it!

I think it's the BEST place for chocolate fondue (white, milk, dark)"}
{"text":"I am not a fondue fan so I wasn't expecting much out of a group meal but our service was extremely slow. I am under the impression they get a lot of groups and we had made a reservation way in advance. Wouldn't choose to come here again."}
{"text":"Very upmarket place with upmarket and friendly service. Pretty nice food with good portions. Worth it for a special occasion."}
{"text":"We ate here for the first time this week. It was truly an awesome dining experience. 4 courses unlike anything I've ever experienced. Our waiter, Tim, was very patient and walked us through the entire process of using the fondue pot.

We started with cheese fondue & dipped bread, veggies, and Italian meats in it! Yum! Then our salads; I had Caesar and somehow it was one of the best salads I have ever had. Our main courses were packed with lobster, shrimp, steak, chicken, and potatoes which we dipped in the fondue pot of courses, with additional dipping sauces!  You gotta get desert - trust me!! Chocolate fondue...dipping graham crackers, marshmallows, Rice Krispy Treats.....oh we were so full of delicious food.

This place is not cheap, but if you want a one-of-kind dining experience, try the Melting Pot!"}
{"text":"My fiance and I went here for an early Valentine's Day date night and we were not disappointed! We had a reservation for 6, but arrived earlier than expected around 5:30 and they were really great and seated us right then. 
Our server, Ally, was friendly and attentive and overall just went above and beyond to give us an outstanding experience. 
We opted for one portion of the 4 course meal and added an extra salad after reading reviews saying the 4 courses for 2 people was way too much food. The single portion of the 4 courses was plenty and I didn't really need the extra salad, but it's a great option for couples who eat more food than we do. 
We started off with the Fiesta cheese fondue which was a cheddar and emmanthaler cheese blend mixed with lager, salsa, and jalapenos. This course was served with 3 types of bread, nacho chips, apples, carrots, and broccoli. The cheese was gooey, the dippers were fresh, and you might not think apples and cheese go together, but honey, you would be surprised. 
Our next course was the salads. He had the house salad with peppercorn ranch and I had the strawberry pecan. He really liked his and ate the entire thing, I wasn't a fan of the poppyseed dressing on mine and only ate about half. 
The third course we chose was the classic, mojo style. It came with shrimp, mushrooms, potatoes, broccoli, two types of sirloin, pork, chicken, and duck served with 6 different sauces (of which the gorgonzola and teriyaki were our favourites).
For dessert and our final course, we chose the smores chocolate fondue. With milk chocolate, marshmallow fluff, and Graham cracker crumbs all flambayed right there at the table, what more could you ask for? This round came with brownies, blondies, bananas, strawberries, oreo and graham craker coated marshmallows, pineapple, pound cake, and marshmallow treats for dipping. 
All in all this meal was great and way more filling than one would expect. Between the bread for the first course, the potatoes with the third, and all of the cakes with the fourth, you really do get filled up.
The atmosphere in the place is great. It's classy for a date night while still being fun and interactive. 
If you are on the fence, give this place a try! It's not super cheap (we ate for about 60 dollars), but it is an awesome experience for a special night out."}
{"text":"We had a great time at the melting pot tonight. Our waiter was awesome and laughed at all my jokes no matter how dumb they were."}
{"text":"Came here with a small group this past weekend to celebrate my cousin's birthday. It was my first time at the Melting Pot or any type of fondue place, and honestly, it was a little overwhelming. Understanding the different menus and options, what things you pick to dip, what things you pick to dip in, what goes with what... Our waitress was definitely willing to answer any of our questions though.

For cheese we had the Spinach Artichoke and Wisconsin Trio, which were both pretty good. We got the Bouillon and Mojo for cooking our entrees, and I got the Shrimp and Sirloin to go with it. Honestly, the time spent deliberating over which cooking styles to go with wasn't worth it, because I don't think the flavors were strong enough (or at least don't seep into your food enough for sitting in it a couple minutes) to really make a big difference. Perhaps I'm a little impatient, but it would be nice to maybe have some more than 2 fondue utensils, so I can cook more than a couple slivers of meat at once.

For dessert we got Pure milk chocolate and I believe the Flaming Turtle (whatever the second one was, I didn't have any because it had nuts). All of the desserts to dip in the chocolate were delicious!

Overall, everything was pretty good. My cousin loved the experience and so it was a great night, but I don't think I would personally ever pick it for myself. I can't really justify the price for what you're getting, and I prefer food I don't have to cook myself, 1 piece at a time =)"}
{"text":"Great place to celebrate your birthday! The service was exquisite and the food was really fresh and delicious. We ordered two four course menu for three person and it was more than enough. You cook the food in front of you and it is really fun to watch vegetables, pasta, and fish cooking at the same time.

My server was also really kind to bring me a complimentary birthday dessert on the house. We will definitely come back here again.

Definitely recommended."}
{"text":"My experience here was just okay. It's a great atmosphere and you certainly get lots of food to pick from. However, I thought it to be slightly overpriced, even for the amount of food we got. The temperature of our broths weren't consistent- I burnt my mouth on one, and another pot was so hot that it immediately burned my friend's teriyaki chicken each time she cooked it. There were 4 of us who went out and two of us were given two very similar shades of yellow skewers so we were constantly mixing up our meals. Our waiter was great, but it was honestly a 3 hour long experience that didn't need to be. The happy hour was only at the bar, which I was disappointed in, being that it was a Friday night and drinks were normally about $10 each. I did take advantage of one drink at the bar, which was nice. The bathrooms were clean and conveniently located near our seats. There were lots of options for everyone. Regardless if you eat meat or vegetables only, you can create your own combinations. I was never a big fan of this place for practical reasons, but it was a fun time for a girls' dinner out."}
{"text":"My sister and I just had a wonderful experience at the Melting Pot! Our server was excellent and the food was top notch!! They have a lot of specials if you check their website as well! We loved the 4 cheese fondue and the smores fondue!! Even though it is a chain, I was pleasantly surprised with the service and quality! We will return soon!"}
{"text":"The melting pot never fails. The food is a bit over priced, but what you're paying for is the environment. It's intimate, and quite romantic. My date and I enjoyed our dinner very much. They placed us in a corner of the restaurant that was closed off to the rest of the place. I'm not sure if it was because we were Asian, but the service was outstanding. It seemed as though she checked up on us more than any other tables were attended to. Perhaps she viewed us as big tippers. who knows. Over all, I would recommend this place to any couple who hasn't experienced it. It's definitely a unique and fun way of dining."}
{"text":"The wait staff was totally rude. The food was nothing to rave about considering the prices."}
{"text":"The Melting Pot has been a staple at Station Square for as long as I can  remember.  Heck, if memory serves me correctly, The Melting Pot used to be in a different location at the complex.  But for all the times I'd passed it, I'd never eaten here until this past weekend.  Rick and I came here with his colleague and her husband.

Well we started off with the Wisconsin Trio of cheeses for our fondue course. The fondue is the restaurant's raison d'etre (it is The Melting Pot after all).  M-M-M, what a great way to start a meal!  Now for our main courses we could have gone with the Fondue By You or the Four Course Experience.  But we decided to go with individual dinners instead.  I went for the Atlantic Salmon and Rick went for the sirloin.  I don't remember what our friends had, but we all agreed our dinners were done to perfection.

And of course nothing tops off dinner at The Melting Pot better than a dessert if chocolate fondue.  Remember folks, there's always room for dessert!  We tried their signature Flaming Turtle--milk chocolate, caramel and candied pecans flambéed
tableside!  Whoo-hoo, give me a couple of extra units of insulin!"}
{"text":"Just like every other melting pot. I don't suggest doing the dinner as it just doesn't taste that good. Imagine boiled meat. The cheese and dessert are what you should really come for. We came for Valentine's Day for the double date night. They always run holiday specials so check out those!"}
{"text":"Great service, food, atmosphere, a lot of fun, our kids loved it, kids menu is a good deal-a lot of food for the money"}
{"text":"Last night my boyfriend and I celebrated our 1 year dating anniversary at the Pittsburgh location.  Station square is a neat area and great for a date night!  It gives you the ability to walk around and shop or ride the incline before or after dinner!  The Melting Pot is by far my absolute favorite restaurant.   I love the ambiance - it allows for a romantic evening with your special someone!  The waitress was very nice and provided us with a great experience - she also brought us complimentary glasses of champaign for our celebration dessert!  We did the couples meal with 4 courses.  The first course is the cheese and probably my favorite!  They give you more than enough dippers!  We got to choose from 3 salads - while the dressing on the strawberry pecan was a little tangy for my liking - I ate had and my boyfriend finished.  The main course was just phenomenal!  I've never tried the lobster but wow was it good!  They give you a large platter of filet, shrimp, sirloin, lobster, chicken, and ravioli - all of which were fabulous! Now, most people I assume know Melting Pot for its dessert - we chose the snores and the dippers included pineapple, banana, strawberry, Rice Krispies, brownie, chic chip cookies, pound cake, marshmallows etc.  needless to say I felt like I needed to be rolled out of the place!  Great food for a decent price and memorable experience!  We will always return!"}
{"text":"Despite my inherent bias towards anything cheese-related and despite The Melting Pot being pretty unique conceptually, it stops short of blowing my mind. Don't get me wrong.. it's nice.. just not 'Ahhhmaazing'. The fondues are good. We tried a couple. I found the \"make-it-in-front-of-u\" aspect a bit gimmicky and I can't help but feel that anyone can make this at home with grocery store bought cheese for a lot lesser money. Service was ok. The cocktails were a bit syrupy and sweet for my taste.. not fresh and original. In general, a decent restaurant but at that price point, I'm left wanting of a more memorable experience."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been coming here for six years and we love it every time.
Service is excellent and food is unbelievable."}
{"text":"This is a really tricky review to write and you should read until the end. I will start by reviewing my actual meal and experience dinning first. As you read the review you will understand why. 

I visited the Melting Pot as my Friday choice for Restaurant Week. I made reservations in advance for 9:00 on a Friday and was excited to be taking a first timer who had no idea what the concept was. She loved the atmosphere and concept of fondue. We were seated in a cozy and very private booth. 

The first course was Quattro Formaggio Fondue. The cheese was excellent and they give you plenty of options for dipping from breads - Apples. 

The second course was an Apple Bacon Spinach salad. The dressing was a sweet and spicy dressing. It took me by surprise at first but was actually really good. 

The third course was a chef choice platter. We choose the mojo fondue for cooking the choice meats. The choices that were offered teriyaki sirloin, jerk filet, Cajun chicken and wild mushroom sachetti. I definitely recommend the mojo. 

After that I just had no room left for dessert. This is sad because I know they have an amazing chocolate peanut butter fondue. But since the servings are plentiful I just couldn't eat anymore. 

With this all said they would have gotten a 4 star rating hands down... But here is the deal. We had a 9:00 reservation. We were seated at 10:00. Now I give some consideration for things out of control of an establishment. But they get 2 stars because I sat there and listened to the hostess lie to customer after customer about the wait. We were told a \"slight delay\" and waited an hour. Others were told 15-20 minutes behind when they knew the wait was at least an hour. I even brought it to their attention they know that's not accurate and they still continued to lie. I don't mind waiting but when I am lied to about the wait I was mad. I think people would not have been so upset if they were not continuously lied to all night. Also some one that had an 8:30 reservation should up at 9:10 because they were late. The showed up 40 minutes late for a reservation and 10 minutes after me (who was on time) and they were taken 15 minutes before me to a table. If you are 40 minutes late for you reservation I feel you should now wait your turn."}
{"text":"Excellent Easter 4-course meal.  Service and food excellent.  Could of have had a few more vegetables to dip in the cheese fondue.  Only issue is that Easter special was not offered to us we had to mention we saw it on website.  Otherwise a great 2+ hour meal."}
{"text":"Not worth the dough!

I title this review exactly what i thought of \"The Melting Pot\". I mean I get it, the atmosphere, the party feel, the cooking of your own food, but DAMN. It cost 3 of us $240 plus, for a chef to never even touch my food.....DAMN.

I am no cheap skate when it comes to food, I LOVE spending money on food. But I feel it is a little ridiculous to pay $43 a person to cook your own food, when you know, your total meal cost rough $11. 

It was fun, It was. But I might have goofed going to \"4 course meal\". I mean you only really want the cheese & chocolate, let's be real. The main courses i feel are garbage.

Everyone said you'll love it, go there, it's so cool. I cook for living, not fun, nor cool.

If you have to go to \"The Melting Pot\", just get cheese or chocolate.......I'm done.

NOT JEDI CERTIFIED!"}
{"text":"I've been coming here for years. I've never been disappointed. Mother's day, birthdays, 80's night, girls night out and restaurant week. Last night we enjoyed the restaurant week special 3 courses for $28.16 each all we had to add was dessert. The cheese fondue,  California salad, entree and white chocolate fondue was outstanding. The jerk seasoned sirloin was really good that was my first time trying it. The pretzel bread was new to me too and I absolutely loved it. The portions always surprise me but in essence you nibble until you're full. Get on the email list to learn about specials because it is pricey but well worth it. Perfect for date nite, girls night or special occasions. This is the only location in Pittsburgh. Parking is not an issue since there are 2 parking lot options. The restaurant is always immaculate and the staff is very friendly. You can maked reservations online which I absolutely love. This ia certainly one of my favorites."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants.. It would get a 5 star review but the dated decor is getting old.. When you sit in the booths the seats almost collapse.. it's also like a dungeon because no windows.. Cheese and Chocolate are unbelievable and I will always go back for it"}
{"text":"Last night a group of girls and I headed to the MP for \"GIRLS NIGHT\", which turned out to be a really cool event!  For $25 you get a signature drink(cosmo, love martini, or white zin), cheese, chocolate and a $25 \"dip certificate\" for your next visit.  Oh and $15 of your 25 goes to a breast cancer research foundation.

Although, our server was nice,I think he was having an off night, but then again I did hear a bunch of cackling women, so I guess I understand.  We did call him out on chewing gum like a horse while preparing our cheese fondue, but we didn't dock him points for that. 

So the cons for the evening, drinks took a long time, our server almost made the wrong cheese, and one of the drinks was in a considerably smaller glass than the other, see photo.

Overall it was a fun night, the cheese and chocolate were good, and it was a good cause.  

If you're a fan of the MP, join their mailing list, they're always having fun events."}
{"text":"Is there any other fondue place?? Had a great experience.  Service was exceptional and meal experience flowed seamlessly.  Drinks are expensive but no different than anywhere else downtown.  Portions are just at that \"bust the belt\" size but we left not feeling too gorged.  Had the Valentine's special menu - which I thought was a great value for 50/person.  Four courses - cheese, salad, meats (lobster, shrimp, filet, sirloin, chicken and ravioli ) and any of the chocolate desert fondues to finish.  We mentioned our anniversary and was treated to a champagne toast at no charge.  Entire meal lasted just at 2 hours.  Would go again and again."}
{"text":"Went there for my bachelorette party dinner. We all had an awesome time and the fondue was to die for!"}
{"text":"I went with my girlfriend during restaurant week for the special three course deal. We were very excited because our friends loved the place and hyped it up for us. The whole restaurant was very dark and we didn't particularly like our table because the pot was a little bit far for our reach. Our waiter was very friendly and informative about the menu. The cheese fondue came with vegetables, bread, and apples, and they all went well with the cheese, although the veges may have been better warm for the fondue. Next, we got a sweet and tangy salad with candied pecans which I thought was the best part of the meal. Lastly, we got a broth where we would cook the variety of steak, chicken, ravioli, and shrimp. It came with mushrooms, broccoli, potatoes, and 6 different sauces. Even with the variety, the meat dish kind of got boring after a while. Personally, I thought all of the food was just OK and didn't live up to the hype. However, they do give you plenty of food. Overall, it was a cool experience and worth going to at least once."}
{"text":"This is probably the most elegant restaurants, I ever stepped in. I liked the concept of hot pot in front of me. Kids loved the cheese apetizer. The Original Desert was like heaven dipped with Chocolate."}
{"text":"This was our first time at the melting pot and our first experience with fondue. The dining experience was by far the most unique that my wife and I have ever had. On top of that, the food was among the best I've ever had. Everything from the Wisconsin cheddar fondue, entrees that you cook yourself, and the desert fondue was a mind blowing experience. The wait staff was amazing and very helpful in explaining how everything worked. I can't recommend this enough for special occasions or just a unique night out."}
{"text":"Romantic! Perfect for a date, just getting to know someone! The food is good, and you cook it yourself! It's a pricy restaurant but causal, staff is very pleasant, it's a must!"}
{"text":"I came here tonight for my Grandma's birthday. I got the ying yang martini, it was the BEST cocktail I ever had! You couldn't even taste the alcohol... it was sweet but not overbearing and one was more than plenty. 
Let's get to the actual fondue part now, for the cheese part we got the Quattro formaggio. It was really good, the texture is surprising because its quite thick but almost taking on a solid form. I suppose it's the corn starch? Anyways it was delicious .
Next we got the house salads with the house dressing. It was a decent salad in every sense of the word. 
Now it's time for the entrees, My Grandmother and I got the \"Pittsburgh big night out.\" It had everything.. Lobster, shrimp, chicken, pork, steak, and wild mushroom sachette. For the broth we got the coq au vin it was lovely. The shrimp was especially tasty. The portions you get look smaller than they actually are. It hit the spot for sure.
 Last but not least, dessert! We got the banana foster fondue. I don't particularly care for banana however that was the bomb. The Oreo covered marshmallows paired really well with the bananas foster. They even lit candles for my grandmas birthday. 
All in all everything was great. The server was really friendly and personable too which helped a lot seeing we're not from the area. 

(If you get the chance to go here, go! It's pricey but worth every penny)"}
{"text":"The food was very good. the only complaint was that it would be nice to have a cheat sheet to know how long to cook everything. Also felt like we had to ask for a lot. But still Very Very good"}
{"text":"I love this place! Mary, our server, has been amazing both times. She certainly makes the experience. My friends and I will be frequenting this place as the food is always fresh and awesome and the service (Thank you Mary!!!) is always out of this world."}
{"text":"Wonderful food with delightful service!  More than enough food for everyone!  Our server, Mandie, was very friendly and fun!  We went on Sunday, so it wasn't very crowded, but the atmosphere was still lively and fun!  We were here for an anniversary dinner and they treated us very well!"}
{"text":"We came in just to grab something small to eat and were really happy with the Wisconsin trio. Loved that you could really taste the sherry and shallots. Our waitress, Jackie, was the best! We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"We ordered the four-course dinner that included cheese fondue (with bread and vegetable dippers), salad (we chose the caesar and house), entree (meat, seafood, or vegetables in broth that you must cook yourself for a couple of minutes), and chocolate fondue dessert (with fruit, brownie, marshmallow, and cheesecake dippers). We enjoyed the taste of all of the food, and our stomachs felt full after the meal was over. You keep track of whose food is whose by inserting colored sticks into the cooking pot on your table. I recommend coming to this restaurant with people with whom you do not mind sharing germs, because you will be sharing the same cooking pot. The waitress and other wait staff stopped by frequently to bring us the next course and to refill our beverages. The total price for two people was about $100, not including the tip. I will not return to this restaurant frequently, but it provides a different, fun experience to do occasionally. The dress code is casual, although you may dress up if you want to do so."}
{"text":"The Melting Pot is something that I think everyone should experience and this restaurant does it right. The way to go is the Big Night Out 4 Course dinner for under $100 for two people. You start with cheese fondue which comes with bread and veggies to dip. Then you get a yummy salad. The entrees usually come with chicken, steak, shrimp, etc. . . and you cook them in oil on your table. This is great because you can cook your food exactly how you like it. Lastly, you finish up the meal with the chocolate fondue which comes with rice crispy treats, marshmallows, brownies, fruit, etc . . 

This may seem like a lot of food but you go at your own pace. You never feel rushed and this is a great way to spend 2-3 hours having dinner in Station Square or any other Melting Pot location. 

For special occasions they will have your table ready with balloons, flowers, etc. . ."}
{"text":"Melting Pot is a great place for a special occasion or a romantic date.  It is on the pricey side, especially for food you basically prepare yourself, but the experience you have along with an excellent quality of service make it worth the occasional splurge.

My fiance and I went to Melting Pot moments after we got engaged.  When he made reservations he told them it was to celebrate our engagement and when we arrived, they had a private booth in the back along with a small grouping of carnations.  You can order roses or other flower arrangements but because we were going to the Pirates game later that evening, he didn't since he figured they would just die.  While the carnations were nothing spectacular, it was a nice touch that they didn't  have to do for us especially since he had not ordered flowers.

Service was fantastic and they were good about being attentive without being overbearing and intrusive.

We ordered the big night out with the lobster option.  All of the meat was tender and juicy and very flavorful.  Our request for extra dipping sauces and more mushrooms were met with a smile and promptly delivered.  We even joked around about getting extra pine nuts on our salads and the server brought out an entire bowl for us!

Even though we ordered a bottle of champagne to drink with our meal, our server surprised us with more champagne with heart shaped strawberries to have with our dessert course fondue.

We had a great time, left stuffed and really enjoyed having our first meal together as an engaged couple at the Melting Pot.  I have no doubt we will be back."}
{"text":"I had heard mixed reviews but I enjoyed it. It reminds me of hotpot in China, but just a little more expensive. It's a very social experience, so definitely go with people you wouldn't mind sharing with. 

The restaurant is steamy due to all the fondue pots, be prepared for foggy glasses initially. The lighting is dim and perfect for a romantic night out. The hot plates are built into the table and your server will explain what you can and cannot touch. 

My friend and I came for a special they were having called $30 on the 30th. We needed a reservation. It was a 4-course meal. 

We started with the fiesta cheese fondue. It was beer, cheddar cheese, and salsa. We received pieces of bread, soft pretzel, nacho chips, green apples, celery, and broccoli to dip. 

Next we got a strawberry pecan salad. This was one of the best salads I've had in awhile. It has a strawberry vinegarette, with strawberries, candied pecans, I believe blue cheese, and all over mixed green lettuce. I don't even like pecans, but they were so good. They provided a great crunch and flavor profile. 

For the third course we had our meet entree. We chose the seasoned court bouillon and received pieces of brasa seasoned chicken, teriyaki sirloin, Pacific white shrimp, filet mignon, and a mix of red potatoes, broccoli, and mushrooms. We put the veggies in first because they would take the longest and then the meats ranged in cook time from 1 to 3 minutes in the broth. The broth was light and didn't overpower the meat flavors. We also got six dipping sauces. 

For the dessert course, we chose the Smores fondue. It of course had chocolate and melted marshmallow but then topped with a shot of 151 and then lit on fire to burn off the alcohol. There were also gram cracker pieces. For dipping, we got blondes, brownies, pound cake, gram crackers, and marshmallows covered in cookie pieces. It was a perfect way to finish off the meal. The brownies were my favorite. They were dense and moist. Delicious!

My server gave great service. She was attentive and personal. She explained each course very well and constantly refilled our drinks. Despite having a late reservation and basically closing the place down, she didn't make us feel rushed. Her name escapes me but I'll update the review once I find my receipt. 

All in all, the $30 was well worth it. I left feeling stuffed. My friend and I had a great time. I was skeptical about paying a lot of fondue but it was worth it. Checkout their website because they seem to have deals regularly, including a late night special that starts and 9 pm."}
{"text":"Well.. This place is kinda weird! First of all, our waiter was incredible. It was like he put on a one man show. So kind and helpful and he made everything for us right in front of us. In general, I kinda hated how the restaurant is structured. There's a vegetarian option, but it won't work if you are the only vegetarian in a small (or large) group of meat eaters. Everybody has to share. Also, the meat comes out completely raw and you have to cook it in a pot of broth. I thought that was kinda gross! The cheese was really good though! I had spinach and artichoke cheese. I really liked it. The stuff they served it with.. not so much. A tiiiiny portion of cold, raw vegetables and super hard pretzel bread pieces. They will give you more of both if you ask, but they kind of hope you don't ask. Also, unless you just decide to get cheese ($10), each dinner is about $40-50 per person. Food was pretty good, but just too weird to ever try again. Too bad, because I love fondue!"}
{"text":"This was a really unique experience!

The food wasn't insanely unique, in and of itself, but the experience of cooking your food for yourself over the pots and the fondue and desert creations were cool.

We went there with a large group of friends and had a private room.
Our menu and our mutual criticisms:

There are 4 courses to the meals.
A Cheese Fondue appetizer that is served with raw veggies and different breads for dipping.
A \"salad\" (we chose the lettuce wraps which were really tastey with a really great sauce).
The entree of the meats that you choose and cooking broth that you choose to cook them in.  You spear a piece of meat on your fondue fork and let it simmer in the boiling broth and they tell you about how long to submerge/cook each type of meat.
Your desert (several different types of chocolate fondue to choose from) and this is served with Marshmallows, Rice Crispy Treats, Cheesecake, brownies and strawberries.


\"Big Night Out\" Option 2 of \"Fondue Fusion\"
Spinach/Artichoke Fondue = AWESOME, best fondue on the table!
Lobster, Steak, Pork, Ahi Tuna, Chicken, Shrimp & Veggie Wontons = Awesome!
Mojo Style cooking sauce = good (we'd try something different next time)
Dessert Fondue (we chose the crunchy peanut butter chocolate) and it was amazing!!!

Cool for a large group or a romantic night out.

Dress Code:  The girls were dressed cute, but really.... you could have worn a tank top and jeans and been just fine! 
Just don't wear something scrubby!"}
{"text":"The questions you must ask is 1. Do you like chocolate ? And 2. Do you like cheese? If not, you might be wasting your money and time. my husband and I happen to love both so why not ? The melting pot is a nice date night place to go. The atmosphere at first glance doesn't seem like anything special nor do I think they want to make it seem over the top fancy. However, once they seat you,  it feels like you are in your own little world. The lights are dim and the music is soft. It just felt romantic but then again, doesn't dipping strawberries and cheese cake, etc in smooth melted chocolate sound amazing? We had the chocolate s'more fondue but it's all about what sounds good to you! Oh, and the martinis are rich and decedent!"}
{"text":"This place has poor customer service
Went to the melting pot at 945 was advised they were all booked but there were many empty tables
I asked what about all the empty tables and then I was told that there were not taking any more reservations 
I did confirm that the place closed at a 11"}
{"text":"I love other locations but will not be back to this one. The first table we were at was sticky and not cleaned, so we asked to be moved, then the burner didn't work, so third time is a charm. Not an enjoyable experience and the meat was not fresh. Definitely disappointed for the price tag it came with."}
{"text":"I went here with my wife and another couple on a Friday night.  We had reservations for 7 and upon arrival were seated fairly quickly to our table.  The chairs sit lower/table is a little higher since your experience here is cooking your own food.  We used a coupon for a 3 course meal and ordered dessert as a 4th course (which was by far the best course).

For starters, we had two types of cheese heated in front of us with bread, chips, apples, and vegetables for dipping. The cheeses are made right in front of your eyes, and I thoroughly enjoyed the one cheese which was a Mexican Salsa and Jalapeno combination. The vegetables and bread were great dipping selections.  The second course was a salad, and my wife and shared ours with each other.  I ordered the Caesar and my wife had a strawberry spinach.  The salads were fairly small and light, which was good since doing a 4 course meal will fill you up.  For the main course, we had some butternut squash ravioli, Cajun chicken, Teriyaki beef, and filet mignon with a side of vegetables. The food comes out raw and part of the experience here is that you cook the food yourself in a bowl of your selection.  We had an oil based and a water based mix to cook our food in.  Definitely recommend placing your vegetables in first to allow it to soak up some of the flavors of your cooking base.  The food cooked pretty nicely and was easy to do.  Our favorite part by far was the dessert.  We had a turtle chocolate dip and a milk chocolate dip.  They brought out a plate that had strawberries, cookies, angel food cake, bananas, and graham cracker coated marshmallows. Dipping these in fresh warm chocolate was amazing!  Would highly recommend saving room for dessert when you go.

The Melting Pot provides a very unique dining experience. If the price scares you away, I would recommend coming here just to try out the dessert.  They have some pretty good food and it was a fun experience to cook our own food.  Don't expect to be done with dinner quickly here! Great place to make it a night out with friends!"}
{"text":"Great for groups for cheese and desserts not for dinner. I like to be served not to cook my own meal ep for over $100 bill"}
{"text":"My husband and I visited for lunch. 

Service was super, food was as yummy as other Melting Pot locations I've visited. Would definitely return and would recommend to anyone."}
{"text":"Location: Park in open lot beside Smithfield Bridge or garage across from the Sheraton. They do not validate parking. Valet is available on the side of Grand Concourse.

Service: Mitch was our waiter. Excellent; prompt attention, glasses stayed full, thorough explanation of cooking times and menu options. Kudos 

Food: $80 Pre-Fixe Menu. Shrimp Cocktail. Cheese Fondue. Salad. Meat Fondue. Chocolate Fondue.

Experience: Dim, romantic and full. Floral arrangements were on each tabletop. They gave us a rose and complimentary champagne toast. Lovely evening and worth the experience."}
{"text":"Went after dinner and had the dessert chocolate fondue. You can pick which types of dipping items you want. We chose banana, cake, strawberries and pineapple. The pieces are very small so don't go hungry. It will not fill you up. But it's something different to do! Try to use a coupon...not cheap!"}
{"text":"Amazing food, great staff, thanks Paul. My wife and I ordered 1 full meal to share. Cheese fondue to die for, the classic Alpine. then a wonderful salad with strawberry and candied pecans then to the main course. Steaks, chicken pork and shrimps, great flavors. And ended with chocolate fondue with pecans and assortment of fruits and cakes and marshmallows to dip. Great vibe"}
{"text":"Why is it always soooo dark in the melting pots? 

The best advice I can give you is...if you're thinking about doing the 4 courses, don't do it! I seem to always forget that the portions here are huge and I should never do the 4 courses. I could barely walk after the four courses. If anything, I should've skipped the salad for sure. Additionally, I think the cheese fondue and the chocolate dessert fondue would have been actually just right."}
{"text":"I love this place! Amazing romantic atmosphere for me and my honey! Sitting by the bar is always nice and I love how the booths really give you the feeling you have your own private space. They have delish drinks and the waiters are always super helpful and always give really good recommendations! Speaking of which I recommend you come here for a romantic night out!"}
{"text":"Hint! If you go here to eat, you can get 50% off your meal if you eat there for 3p. You have to ask it waiter for it bc they don't advertise it. Also when you do this deal, they automatically add 18% gratituity to ur bill, but hey, we saved $36 off our bill! And the waitress did quite a bit during the meal so I didn't mind paying it. It's a good conversation type dinner so be prepared to be there for 2 to 3 hours"}
{"text":"Came with a large group recently to celebrate a birthday. The restaurant did relatively well with our two big tables, and we definitely recommend ordering ahead of time (it's faster, and there's a 10% discount!). My hat is off to the sous chefs for chopping and plating so many different dishes. The lot of us shared several four-course meals, each with our own entree. No one left hungry; I think even our shadows were full! Given the price and time it takes, definitely for special occasions only. But it's very conducive to conversation while dipping and cooking. If I went back, it would be for a smaller meal, or maybe just dessert. (I sooo wanted to lick the spoon that had been in the dark chocolate fondue, but I had just met most of the people at the table and didn't want to be remembered as THAT person!)"}
{"text":"John S.  (owner) thank  you for reaching out to me.  Jesse (General Manager) thank you for your hospitality and a great meal tonight.  Definitely back up to 5 stars.  Had a great waitress tonight!  Last time was an exception.  Jesse was very apologetic.  

Nice new menu and dinner for 1 is really dinner for 1.  No hidden pricing.  the waitress had made a mistake last time.  I have been here at least a dozen times over the past 2 years.  Very enjoyable!  If you need more of anything just ask and they will be happy to accomodate you. 

I definitely will be back."}
{"text":"Just went for a long needed date night and this was everything I could have ever asked for and more. This place always performs and satisfies beyond your expectations!"}
{"text":"I'm happy to say that my most recent experience at the Melting Pot was a much better improvement over the last time I visited; about a year ago or so.

I'm a big fan of their endless fondue specials they have occasionally; or at least, I am now.

They've recently changed what all is 'endless' for these; it's now a single cheese course, a salad, endless entreé course, and endless dessert course (dippers AND chocolate).

I did mention something in my reservation notes about how the last time I'd been there the endless fondue wasn't truly endless; and it's apparent they had a few complaints because they changed it all up. The manager was actually at the door when I arrived and mentioned my comments and welcomed me back wholeheartedly.

I sat at the bar with a wonderful bartender, and ended up buying a bottle of wine as well. My experience was amazing, and relaxing. It's exactly what I want every experience to be.

In fact, I'll be going back for their weekend brunch/lunch this upcoming Sunday. No, it's not endless; but looks to be just as enjoyable!"}
{"text":"I've been to the melting pot a couple times now and I just love it here! It's such a fun experience when you get the 4 course meal which includes cheese fondue, salad, entree fondue and dessert fondue. It is a lot of food though so definitely come hungry! I've only ever done the 4 course meal but they do have other options which would be less but I think doing all the courses is part of the fun! When you do it this way you choose your type of cheese fondue (served with vegetables, apples and bread for dipping), salad, type of broth to cook or entree and type of dessert fondue. I've honestly never had anything I didn't like, so I don't think you can go wrong! 

The restaurant is intimate but casual. Reservations recommended but not necessary. They have a delicious cocktail menu as well, my favorite being the white peach cosmo! I've always had excellent servers who are helpful and knowledgeable about the menu. It is a little more expensive, approximately $35-$50 per person depending on what you get. The food had always been fresh, seasoned well and delicious! Well worth it in my opinion. 

Looking forward to my next visit! If you've never been here, you've got to give it a shot!"}
{"text":"Me and four of my friends went to  the Melting Pot to celebrate a group birthday.  It was quite an experience.  While not cheap, it was worth every penny.  The chocolate fondue alone was worth the trip.  Just amazing.  The service was also superb.  Wish it was closer to home but then again, my butt would be even bigger if it was."}
{"text":"It is pricey but worth the money! I went with the 4 course meal and I left super satisfied. A note to any jews or muslims, they cook with wine so it may not be an option for yous."}
{"text":"Went with the bf about 6 months ago for Late Night Fondue--$40 for a bottle of wine (I think it was Yellowtail?), cheese fondue, and chocolate fondue.  The cheese fondue (beer one) was great--we were really big on the apples and veggies and our server brought us more to dip without us even asking, no charge!  The chocolate fondue was okay--we got dark chocolate but it was still overly sweet for my taste so the bf got to eat most of it.  Still, considering MP's usual prices, this was a steal.  They do Late Night Fondue the last hour before close, I think every day of the week (though their hours vary).  

And thanks to PA law, you can get the wine recorked--we only drank half the bottle and were able to bring it home.  If you want to experience MP but not willing to shell out $60/person for the full shebang, I definitely recommend the late night deal.  Note--this is a PGH-only deal.  Other cities have other promotions, so watch out for that!"}
{"text":"In a nutshell, it's a pricey, fun fondue experience at this well-done chain restaurant best saved for a special dress-up occasion in which you've got at least 2.5 hours to spare and you'd really like to use that time to get to know your dinner date better.

They have many options for the number of course you have (one to four) and the components in those options.

We opted for the full four course meal starting with spinach and artichoke cheese fondue, house salads with peppercorn ranch dressing, entrees of Pacific Rim and Surf and Turf with a coq au vin broth for dipping, and finally, the chocolate turtle dessert fondue.  The cheese course came with bread, apples, and veggies for dipping; the main entrees we shared included duck, shrimp, filet mignon, mushroom pockets, and lobster with 8 different dipping sauces (4 per course).  It also included potatoes and veggies.  The chocolate course was a mixture of milk chocolate and caramel and nuts with so many delicious items to dip -- bananas, pineapple, rice crispy treats, marshmallows, brownies.  

I had thought it would be too much food to consume, but you'd be surprised how you just keep dipping and munching over the 2.5 hours it takes for all four courses.  It takes so long because first, you peruse the menu for several moments, order some wine perhaps, then it takes awhile for the pot set between you on your tabletop to heat up.  Once it does, the server comes back and prepares the cheese fondue from scratch, adding each ingredient and stirring until smooth and delectable.  You spend quite some time with your partner in food crime savoring the tidbits covered in gooey cheese before heading to the next course -- your salads.  A salad is a salad and may be just a distraction while they're cutting up and preparing your proteins and dips you chose.  Again, they set a pot in front of you of the broth you selected and you wait a bit for it to heat up and you're off and eating again, this time sharing the delights with your partner after the instructed amount of time for cooking them.  When all this is said and done, the chocolate course comes out and, again, it's a pot of chocolate and other decadent sins which your server prepares.  Finally, you and your partner settle in to dip, swirl anything and everything into the mixture while all the while uttering sounds of contentment.  

Do you have to dress-up?  No, but when the meal takes 2.5 hours and the bill comes to 130.00 for a four course meal and some alcoholic beverages before tip and it was for a special occasion -- my husband's birthday in our case -- then, by all means I think it deserves a bit of gussying up."}
{"text":"This location is definitely friendly! Food was great! Our server was also amazing, the owner was very nice as well! We had the fiesta cheese.. pretty good. Our entrees were delicious (get the mojo without cilantro and sub lemon for the lime) 

Hasan is a great server. Go see him! We enjoyed our time there and would definitely go back if passing through again!"}
{"text":"Came for a celebration dinner at 5:30 on a Saturday evening.

Staff was very friendly and patient to explain the menu to us. We basically all opted for the 4-course experience, which includes cheese fondue, a salad, entree fondue, and dessert fondue. Our waiter, Tim, helped us walk through the options and gave us some recommendations on which fondues were the most popular. He was also efficient on mixing the fondues and explaining what each ingredient was while he was making them at the table.

All the food was tasty and fresh. The bread was soft, the vegetables were nice and firm, the meats were well-seasoned and tender, and the fruit/desserts were fresh as well. The cheese fondues had great flavor and depth (honestly, I could probably just do a meal of cheese fondues), the salad was just enough, the coq au vin and bourguignon fondues had good savory flavor, and the chocolates were sweet without being overly so.

Be prepared to spend an while, as each course takes a bit to prepare. The entree course takes time, as you are also cooking your own food at the table.

Overall, The Melting Pot is a great way to celebrate something with friends and family by making the whole meal a social experience."}
{"text":"Four stars for the marshmallow you get with the chocolate fondue! The savory fondues I'm less of a fan for. The cheese part of the cheese fondues is good, but the carrots and vegetable you get to dip in the cheese are boring and I expect better bread for the price tag. The entree fondue is not so flavorful, like the plain jane cousin of the Chinese hotpot."}
{"text":"The Melting Pot is such a fun experience and so different than the normal restaurant vibe.  When you walk in, you can tell you're in a nice and kind of fancy place, but once you sit down, everything is so interactive that it becomes really so much fun! 

I highly recommend looking on the website under the events section to find the specials for the month, because each month there are lots of discounts offered.  I often use the weekend brunch special that gets you cheese fondue, salad, entree (steak, chicken, shrimp and ravioli), and chocolate fondue all for about $30 a person, which is a pretty good deal for The Melting Pot.  Another tip is that if you register on their website a few days before you go, they will send you a special coupon for free chocolate covered strawberries! So yummy! 

The servers here are very knowledgeable about the entire menu so don't be afraid to ask for suggestions.  They will also teach you about the cooking times for each item, so don't worry if you're not quite sure what you're doing before you start.  My last piece of advice is that if you get too full for the chocolate fondue portion...which is sadly what sometimes happens to me, you can ask your server or the manager to write you an IOU and you can come back another day to enjoy your chocolate fondue.  I highly recommend melting pot for a great date night or a fun night out with friends!"}
{"text":"I love fondue. I like the Melting Pot, but this location needs to work on its customer service. Service was extremely slow."}
{"text":"I came here for a 30th birthday party last weekend for the first time. Everyone was extremely helpful and the room that my friends family had reserved was very nice. The food was very good and the atmosphere was intimate. I would come back again for sure."}
{"text":"Fondue delight is absolute deliciousness.  The mushroom pasta was definitely our favorite with lobster for her and filet for him coming in second.  Started with the Alpine classic cheese fondue...a little too heavy on the wine..and finished with chocolate peanut butter heaven dessert!"}
{"text":"I don't know if I went at a wrong time or what. I waited for about an hour to get our pot ready. i was starving, literally. The waitress was nice. The pot and food were good, but it is definitely not the best restaurant in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"The Melting Pot is great for occasions--birthdays, anniversaries, b'nai mitzvos, graduation, you name it. When it comes to the food and service, this place excels. I can only applaud the high quality raw food combined with a gourmet fondue experience (I had no idea fondue was more than just melted cheese) and a dedicated and attentive staff that made sure we had the night we were paying for.

Why the three stars then? Location.

The building itself is within the inside mall of Station Square, resulting in a severe lack of windows. The intimate structure of the franchise results in nearly every table somehow being in a corner, and combined with the lack of windows and dim lighting, I felt like I was in a fondue dungeon.

Business is always booming and the restaurant highly recommends reservations, as they are generally packed. A place like The Melting Pot doesn't really need Yelp reviews, because it is what it is and that's all it's going to be. It's great. I just wish it were in a location that wasn't so...heavy."}
{"text":"A wonderful unique dining experience unlike anything else in town. I had the cheddar fondue, salad, and dark chocolate fondue. For my wife and me the food was enough, once again I believe it is the dining ambiance and experience that make this worth the price. It is a very relaxing atmosphere, our waitress, Blair was absolutely amazing and made the entire meal so much more enjoyable. If you are going expecting \"wow\" food you are missing the point of this restaurant, it is the experience. The process of cooking your own food, quality conversation, and wait staff that knows how to treat people like they are friends make for a completely enjoyable time. Very much worth the time"}
{"text":"Decided to go to the Melting Pot for the 2 Can Dine Special they were running for September. Have only been to the restaurant once previously so it was time to check it out again. We arrived right at opening, 4 pm, and for about 30 minutes we were the only ones there. We had our own private dining experience for a brief time! Our waiter, whose name escapes me, was fabulous. He really was terrific, super friendly and helpful with the menu. We started off with salads and then the main course items showed up. Wow, we were pleasantly surprised with the amount that came. At least 6 pieces each of sirloin, filet, chicken, pork and shrimp as well as ravioli. It also came with 6 different dipping sauces. Teriyaki, sweet and sour and green goddess were our favs. For dessert with went with the milk chocolate, which came with pound cake, blondies, strawberries, bananas, pineapple and rice krispy treats for dipping. Overall it was a very enjoyable experience. There is a Station Square paid parking lot less than a block away for your convenience. However, they do not validate parking."}
{"text":"I went here on my anniversary with my wife and had a great experience.  I was worried that by the end we would still be hungry but I was completely wrong.

I recommend the adding the extras.  Little pricey but well worth it.  Add the meat plate with the cheese fondue and a lobster.  Two of the best item we had.

Only complaint is the ahi tuna was really fishy.  I know its fish, but it was a little strong for my liking.

Customer service was excellent."}
{"text":"The melting pot is a nice place to go for a special occasion...maybe a very special occasion because it is pricey. The menu had a good selection of cheeses, meat dishes, and chocolates to finish. I personally loved the fruit style salad as well. The cooking portion of the dinner was fun although it did take time to cook many individual pieces but it gives time to actually talk and enjoy your company. I 100% recommend the chocolate fondu on any occasion though!! This was my favorite part by far. My table got the pure dark chocolate and it was to die for....a good experiences overall and the staff was friendly and very knowledgeable."}
{"text":"We dropped into the Melting Pot one late afternoon ready to be dazzled by unique melt goodness. 

First:  it's crazy dark in there, even at 4pm in the summer. Dark like... covert meeting dark. Dark like... you'll definitely forget your phone dark. 

But we're in it to win it.  And melty cheese is a huge draw.

We all got salads and a cheese pot to share, with the addition of a meat tray. 

The salads were good, like you'd make at home. 

The melty cheese was good, too...  like you'd make at home!!!

So this is where the issue is:  for quite a premium price I want something that takes me some time to figure out how I could possibly make it at home,  not something that I am pretty sure I could improve on at home.  For a fraction of the cost.  With items that I already have on hand. 

It was an ok experience.  Nothing needs repeating."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible service. I had a groupon and I'm not sure if that's why the waiter ignored us, expecting that we were cheap and wouldn't tip much, or if he was just a horribly inattentive waiter. We had to go to the hostess to complain about how long it took to get our dinner because we couldn't even locate the waiter. He kept forgetting to refill our waters, even after visiting the table, the few times that he did. The whole experience took much longer than it should have. I understand this is an experience and takes longer than a normal dinner would, but because we hardly saw our waiter, it took longer than necessary. Food is ok, I would not pay full price and it seems horribly over priced."}
{"text":"Excellent from beginning to end. It is more pricey but it is more than just dinner, it is an experience too. The wait staff will bring you extra dipping sauces and dippers if you ask which makes it worth it. Our waiter brought us two glasses of complimentary champagne when we were celebrating."}
{"text":"When we asked daughter where she would like to have her 21st birthday party The Melting Pot was the answer. From start to finish the best experience ever! We have been here so many times they do not hand us a menu any longer! Everything was fantastic and a memorable evening. If available, ask for Bubbles as your server. She is excellent!"}
{"text":"Melting Pot Madness-Part 2!

Course Three: Fondue Fusion Fantasia continues...

Figuring out what went best with what became a marvelous game of culinary match-up, but the sour cream sauce was a dark horse that worked with pretty much everything. Or would that make it a Joker? Why...so...serious?

The sirloin was our Alpha. Each chunk was dropped into the oil/broth, and we waited impatiently for each to finish cooking. Once the first morsel came out, I found the creamy curry sauce to be the best coating for it. Then it was the chicken, which also worked brilliantly with the curry. The pork followed, bathing nicely in the sweet/sour sauce after its spell in the roiling stew. The two ravioli went in next, and once they bubbled to the surface, we found that the curious Gorgonzola port had its number.

Kay and I saved the best three for last. The filet mignon was dunked into the garlic butter, the shrimp into the fiery cocktail sauce, and our Omega, the lobster tail, also baptized in garlic butter. Pure seafood euphoria captured in four chunks, our lobster was cooked ideally; soft, plump, saturated. My eyes rolled back. Kay sighed. Kayleigh came to our table just as we ate the final bites of lobster, acting as if she had caught us doing...the devil's business, and we were left wanting more.

The Devil. Satan. The Adversary. Call Him what you will, His accursedness created the final course.

Course Four: Dark and Dulce Chocolate Fondue

Such was the name of dessert, and a carnal cauldron it was, a vat of villany, a stein of sin to which we were hopelessly drawn. 

A baneful bittersweet chocolate united with a demonic dulce de leche to snatch our souls from our bodies, using marshmallows, poundcake, brownies, strawberries, and because it was Kay's birthday, a whole cut of cheesecake (complete with a lone candle lanced through it) as emissaries. A shaker of sea salt stood by to make each treat sing its sinister siren songs even louder, hissing like Galder, wailing like King Diamond. The Cheesecake was particularly divine, made infernal by that succulent, deadly, decadent black crud. 

As we were about to fully succumb to the lava, our love in grave danger of being stolen by Mephisto, Kayleigh broke the spell by bringing us each a glass of champagne. Our souls were now cleansed, our romantic bond renewed, our roundtrip into Heaven, Hell, and Earth finished.

P.S. I really can't say enough positive things about the service. Kayleigh is The Patron Saint Of All Waitresses. In addition to the balloons and chocolate bar, she also gave Kay a bottle of TMP's own Garlic Wine seasoning since she liked it so much on her salad. 

P.P.S. Metaphysical hyperbole aside, I feel it must be noted that The Melting Pot is a staunch supporter of St. Jude Children's Research Hospital, a worthy charity...

{"text":"I took my best friend last week for his birthday, it was both our first time.  We decided to both get the 4 course experience. AMAZING!!!! The white Cosmo, I'm still craving and cannot wait for another.  This is definitely an entire night out so clear your schedule, it's such a fun time :)"}
{"text":"This was a really good visit. They have the option of 4 course dinner, and you get to choose the cheese of your preference for the fondue, the meats you want and the style you want them cook, salad plus a desert. The prices are a bit elevated. However, it is more a restaurant to have a nice experience, chat with some friends/family, and to have fun, rather than just going for dinner.  I ordered the 4 course dinner to share with my son. But you can build your own or get just an entree.  It is enough food for both, unless you are a foodie intense. Otherwise, one meal (4 course) feed you both."}
{"text":"We decided to go to The Melting Pot on Christmas Eve. We knew that the city would be like a ghost town which was pretty cool. 

We were seating promptly for our 7:00 pm reservation. We got a romantic little corner booth. They have some interesting \"speciality\" drinks. I got a pomegranate Cosmo which was really good, BJ got his usual beer. We were kinda familiar with the menu, but needed our server's help with selecting our fondues. We ordered off the \"Alpine Big Night Out\" special menu. Sure, the restaurant is a bit pricey, but we got a lot to eat. Our first course included different types of bread, veggies and apples for dipping. We each got a very delicious salad, BJ's included Gruyere and fontina cheeses, hard-boiled eggs & honey roasted almonds with a yummy shallot vinaigrette. I got a California salad, with mixed baby greens, Roma tomatoes, walnuts, Gorgonzola and raspberry black walnut vinaigrette. Their salads were so, so good! At this point we were pretty much full! 

Then came our main course. We got a lobster tail, NY strip, bratwurst, filet mignon, marinated shrimp, chicken, ravioli's and veggies. I'm not sure what type of cooking broth we got, but your server can tell you what goes best with what you are ordering. It was really a lot of fun cooking our little bites and my boyfriend took charge of cooking all our vegetables. I was kinda put off at first of the thought of steak being cooked in broth. I like my meat seared a bit. But believe me, it was delicious. We also enjoyed the different sauces. 

We could not pass on dessert, we got the Flaming Turtle, which was milk chocolate and chopped pecans \"flambéed\" at our table. We got strawberries, bananas, cheesecake, Rice Krispies treats, pound cake and brownies. Lot's of fun!! 

Also, thanks to yelper Angel for the heads up about their \"mailing list\". We visited their website and got a coupon that saved us $16 on our dinner, which was very nice. I'm a girl that like to think I got a deal!"}
{"text":"This is a place for girls night out.  I went with a party of 4 - service was great and our waiter was very friendly.  Everyone at the table enjoyed the meal.  We tried the 4 course special -- a little pricey (about $65 per person) but a nice treat.  I would go back."}
{"text":"I think the Melting Pot is great for a date night.  Its atmosphere is dark and pretty quiet so that gives it a romantic feel for me.  Also, the sharing that is involved with fondue seems romantic to me.  My boyfriend and I ordered the Classic Alpine cheese fondue for our first course and it was fantastic!  We then ordered the Coq Au Vin fondue for our 2nd course, which was delicious and went really well with the sirloin and filet in particular.  We ended our meal with a chocolate fondue for dessert and we loved everything about it!  What makes the Melting Pot only 4 stars for me despite how pleased I was with the food was that the service was a little slow (still very polite and knowledgeable of the menu though) and they gave us a table that was kind of in the way for waiters and waitresses so it felt like people were constantly bustling past us."}
{"text":"My sister, best friend and I went for dessert which was awesome, lots of choices. The service was quick and the dipping items were delicious. However, if I were to go for dinner I feel as though for what you pay you don't get a great value. Dessert great value, dinner not so much."}
{"text":"The only thing that prevented me from rating this 5 stars was the overall taste of the main course.  It very likely could have been the cooking styles that we selected but I felt like there was a bit of an after taste on the steak.  Overall, the cheese, salad and desert courses were amazing.  Matthew was our server and he could not have done a better job. My parents were new to The Melting Pot so he did a very good job of explaining the overall process. He continually checked on us and made sure the courses were served at an appropriate pace. I can be fairly critical of service and I thought he did an exceptional job."}
{"text":"Gosh where to begin? We scheduled a reservation for 7:00 for a party of 7. For most of us it was our first time dining here so we didn't really know what to expect. Everything started off well, our server was very friendly and explained how the menu worked. We were not served our cheese for about an hour and refills on waters took way too long through out the dinner. After sitting for two hours and ten minutes before being served our entrees, I decided to talk to the manager about the disappointment in timeliness. (The restaurant was NOT terribly busy). He explained the average turn over time was about 2.5-3 hours for a party this large which I was unaware of. He informed us he would take some money off the bill as well as give us a voucher for free chocolate our next time dining. The final time was 3.5 hours for dinner, our drinks didn't get the final refill we had requested, and it was just an overall \"meh\" experience service wise. The food was good but I will definitely not be back. The service was enough for a one time experience. Thanks for the 15% but as Cyrus Rose always says \"not enough!\""}
{"text":"First time going to Melting Pot----celebrated my birthday here.  We enjoyed the food and our waitress was outstanding (Megan).  She explained everything to us since it was our first time.  

The pork, shrimp and steak were really good.  We didn't care too much for the chicken.  Dessert was Flaming turtle--very good.  

Would go again on special occasion---pricey but we enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"If I could pour the whole pot of fondue into my mouth I would. Fo real. 

In theory it sounds good. In real life I'll just drown any morsel of food I can into the chocolate and stuff it in! 

This is a special occasion restaurant. A special occasion where I have enough money to spare, because dear lord, it's pricey! 

The two greatest tips that they don't advertise: 

*Half off on Sundays from noon-3 PM. REMEMBER TO MENTION THIS TO YOUR SERVER! I learned that fact today when I got the shock of a full priced bill. I assumed they just took the discount off automatically, but apparently you have to tell your server as soon as you sit down that you want the half price meal. 

All Big Night Out meals half price = awesome deal! 

*Every day after 9 PM you can get cheese and chocolate fondue and a bottle of wine for $35. Serves two. 

The Big Night Out consists of your choice of cheese fondue (lots o' different choices of cheeses), salads (get the mushroom one), main dish (usually includes seafood and/or meat), veggies, potatoes and ravioli) and chocolate fondue (mmmmmm!!). 

You pick the type of broth for your main course. Usually there's one that complements meat and one for seafood. You're also able to mix and match your chocolate ingredients or choose one from the menu. I lurrrve the S'More's chocolate, it includes choco, marshmallow and graham cracker bits. And, ohhhhhh, the things you dip in the chocolate. Cheesecake, brownies, pound cake, rice crispies, marshmallows, banana's and strawberries. Seriously orgasmic!! 

They usually switch up the menu often so you can come once every couple of months and find something new. I also love the atmosphere. It's a great date night place or good for a group outing. The nice thing is that if you go with a group, you can choose a bunch of different cheeses, broths and chocolate to sneak a taste of all of them. 

Good thing for me that it is pricey. IF it was cheap, I don't think I'd like what the scale had to say after monthly visits to this place!"}
{"text":"so overpriced and overrated. I only went here for dessert and can't really see myself ever going back for dinner."}
{"text":"Love this place! Awesome staff and great food! This is the perfect place to take your family or friends. I can't say enough good things about The Melting Pot!"}
{"text":"Meal started off with a rather plain cheese fondue, even though we went with the suggestion of the waitress on the more flavorful one.

The spinach salad was simple with nothing to remember.

The main course was surprisingly good.  We again took the recommendation of our waitress for the up-sell of the coq au vin cooking liquid which was a mistake for scallops, by the time they cooked, they picked up TOO much of the flavor of the scallops, but the steak I tried was very good and the liquid complimented it well.

The dessert was the star of the show, the bananas foster.  Top notch and wonderful.

Overall 3 stars, too long of a meal, nothing was remember-able except the dessert.  Might stop again for that, but doubt it."}
{"text":"Not a very memorable experience. Not sure I like the fondue format much in general but I always leave here hungry. A fun experience to do every once in a while but there are other fun experiences that are much less expensive (and more filling)."}
{"text":"Went there for Valentine's dinner only we the Friday so we did not have to deal with the rush and crowd. It was an amazing dinner food was excellent and we had our own little private table.  It was my first Valentine's dinner with my boyfriend and it was absolutely perfect! He did good by choosing this restaurant. We will be going back."}
{"text":"I've been to the Melting Pot multiple times over the last few years, and I've never been disappointed. However, I was slightly disappointed last night because I had made reservations, but they gave our table away because my friend was stuck in traffic and was 10 minutes late. They refused to seat me until my friend arrived, so we had to wait an additional 10 minutes after her arrival to be seated. Why bother making a reservation?

But this is a trivial matter compared to the overall experience. I usually don't order an entree unless I'm bringing someone who's never been there before. I'm more than happy with just cheese, chocolate, and drinks (and this cuts the cost down considerably). But we decided to go all out and order all 3 courses. We started with the Fiesta cheese, which is my favorite. There is salsa in the cheese, and jalapenos are added to your liking. Dippers include bread, tortilla chips, apples, broccoli, and carrots. Next, we both ordered the individial filet mignon meal. We chose Coq au Vin for the cooking style, which has a red wine base. I was a little worried that it would have too much of a wine taste, but it didn't at all. It also comes with mushrooms and some other things for flavoring (celery, I'm guessing). Entrees also come with potatoes (put them in early - they take forever to cook), broccoli, and more mushrooms. The filet meal also comes with 5 dipping sauces. My favorite is the spinach dip-like sauce, and the teriyaki is good as well. We went with the Flaming Turtle for dessert. Ours didn't seem to have any caramel in it, but it was delicious nonetheless. Dippers included Rice Krispie Treats (my favorite), brownie bites, blondie bites, marshmallows, angel food cake, pineapple, strawberries, and bananas. All of it was delicious and we left feeling like we'd never eat again.

Service is always excellent at the Melting Pot. Our server, Dalles, was attentive and knowledgable about the menu. It was a busy Saturday night and she stayed on top of things.

I noticed that some reviewers don't like the location of the restaurant. I guess it is a little odd, being located inside Station Square mall. But I've never even noticed that there aren't any windows, and I've always just considered the dim lighting part of the ambiance.

The cost is rather high (our bill was over $100 for two people), but the Melting Pot offers specials such as Ladies' Night, 80s Night (with 80s prices), and Late Night Fondue after 9pm. They send out an email about once a month to let you know what's happening that month.

Overall, it was another great experience, and I'll be back many times to come!"}
{"text":"J and I came here for dinner tonight to celebrate our friend's birthday. This was a first for J and I since neither of us have ever had fondue. We asked our waitress Julia a TON of questions because we were confused on how to order things, and she graciously answered everything well and provided us with great suggestions to enhance our experience. J and I both did the 4- course meal including the four cheese fondue to start, house salads with peppercorn ranch dressing, surf and turf (J), create your own meal with sesame covered tuna, Atlantic salmon, and chicken (me), and the s'mores chocolate fondue for dessert. The food was pretty good and they give you a decent portion for each. At first, we were confused about the whole \"cook your own food\" aspect, but it made the experience really interesting. The s'more fondue was everything! J and I demolished ours pretty quickly. Our bill came to a little over $100, which was decent given the quality and amount of food, Julia our waitress, and the overall experience."}
{"text":"Nope. This is overpriced nonsense. I hate to start out the review with a statement so crass, but truly, its location allows this establishment to charge a great deal of money for a meal that is not really that good. Once you get past the pot of liquid and the skewer, think about what you're eating, and then look at the bill. These things do NOT add up."}
{"text":"We went here for my moms 50th birthday celebration and had a great experience from start to finish! Plan on spending about two hours here since there are many course options to choose from. We also had a $20 off coupon from the Enjoy coupon book that they allowed us to use which was an awesome deal too! We chose the potato broccoli cheddar cheese fondue and it was amazing!! Loved it! The entree I got which had Cajun shrimp and chicken was yummy as well, but was definitely the most filling. We ended the night with the s'mores chocolate and that was to die for, yumm!! Our server was awesome and super friendly. Staff was helpful all night long and even brought out my mom candles to blow out with dessert. We had a wonderful experience and would definitely be back again :)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came here for a last minute date night, and we had a blast!

You definitely pay for the experience, but it was worth it. We ordered the \"fondue by you\" (or something along those lines) where we each picked three entree options along with the four course meal. We went with the normal cheddar cheese fondue (it was fabulous!). We both got the house salads, very good as well. For our entrees we got the teriyaki steak, filet, buffalo shrimp, and chicken potstickers. The meat takes a LONG time too cook, so just watch for that.We went with the normal vegetable broth cooking option. The sauces were all delicious as well. For dessert, we got the turtle chocolate, and it was fabulous! 

Our server was wonderful as well, offering to bring us more veggies or dippers for each course. 

It was about $100 total, which really wasn't bad given the experience. I highly recommend for a date night!


UPDATE:
My boyfriend and I went again last week to celebrate the end of my semester. This time we tried the cheese option with pesto, I can't remember exactly what it was called but this was by far the best. I highly recommend this cheese over the other options!! Also we tried the oil and batter option for our entrees and I think we both preferred this to the plain broth. It is a lot and you have to be careful but it really was delicious! (remember you can get extra veggies, I love the fried broccoli!)"}
{"text":"We were unfamiliar with this restaurant. When we found out that we had to cook our own food, even the entree, we were turned-off. However, Jason G, our server, made our experience very good. He did an excellent job of serving us. I especially appreciated that he was very knowledgeable of the menu items. We asked for recommendations and we were very happy with what he recommended. He was also very patient with us. We ordered The Classic and the French Quarter combo's. Both my husband and I enjoyed."}
