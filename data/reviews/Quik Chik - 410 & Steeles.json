{"text":"I would say popeyes is far more better than that. Tried chicken mild sandwich which was good but the chicken pieces were not upto the mark!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. A lot of the menu resembles Popeye's (biscuits, cajun fries, and a few other things) but the quality is better. They also have jalape√±o poppers which I'm a sucker for.
I had the chicken sandwich which was really big and on a bun similar to a Portuguese bun. You can have it spicy or regular, and that goes for the chicken as well.
When I was there a lunchtime, everything seemed to be very fresh. It meant most people were waiting at least 5-10 minutes, but worth the wait for fresh food IMO.

{"text":"The staff is friendly and attentive, and my chicken strips were made fresh to order, and were hot, tender, and juicy even after I arrived at home. I ordered the spicy strips, which had a good kick but are still relatively mild (not too spicy). My largest complaint is that for the amount of food given, my side of ranch sauce was not nearly large enough. I'd estimate the packet to be only 20g, if that, which was only enough for one chicken strip (extra packets are for sale at 30-50 cents each, and ketchup and hot sauce are free). The biscuit was perfect -- fresh, hot and buttery. I'd strongly consider returning the next time I'm in the area."}
{"text":"My family brought home take out (full fried chicken pieces)so I can't really say much about atmosphere, service, etc. What I can say is that the food is below average, greasy, flavorless and of lower quality. I'd much rather stick to Popeyes which is roughly 5-10 minutes away."}
