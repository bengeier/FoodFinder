{"text":"Loads of vegi options make this place a local star. Capers - seriously where else can you get capers, pine nuts and such on your pizza? The food is made to order, fresh, tasty and full of flavour. Other pizza seems like sodden cardboard after this."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza and panzerotti. We order this about 2x a month. Cajun creole sauce rocks. Great premium, fresh ingredients. Staff very friendly.

If you live or are in the area...give it a try"}
{"text":"They are usually good but if i could give them negative 10 stars on this round I would. I ordered from Just Eat and they took like 2 hrs to deliver. I had to contact Just Eat to get them to refund me. Apparently they showed up around 1am to deliver my food. I was in bed, was not getting up. I had called the restaurant after they were over 30 mins past delivery time, the stupid lady would not let me speak, she said they were on their way and hung up on me, great customer service. I doubt I will ever order from them again even though I really enjoy their food.. Sad, customer service is EVERYTHING"}
{"text":"Had the alligator poutine and Creole seafood medium pizza.

Funny how the bad reviews come from Americans. My girlfriend and I went late on Friday night and went on based off the very funny sign of an alligator cook toting a trumpet. We went in and you felt like you were on Bourbon Street in New Orleans with all the pics and pieces of jazz and Louisiana culture.

We started off with alligator poutine which is a completely different twist from what us Canadians are used to.

The fries are beautifully cooked in a series of cajun spices (not hot, but smooth smoke) and covered in a very smooth gravy mixed in alligator meat and good amount of mozzarella served in a white dish bowl. Good enough for two people if you get something else, which we did.

Now, the pizza, which is what this place is known for, at first seemed much pricier that most places in the city. But when you have ingredients like crawfish, shrimp, and mussells you gotta try it out. So we got the medium (which is a large at any other joint) and when we got it we were happy with the large portion.

When you first look at it, you see four crawfish on top and it makes a very nice look, and taste,. When you bite into the actual pizza, you then realize you ve never had pizza like this in your life. The cajun spices they used on the pizza make something truly unique and enjoyable. The cheese was perfectly done and the vast portions of mussels and shrimp into each slice made you reaize the guy cooking this thing knows exactly what he is doing.

You ll pay good money but you ll receive very good food that is vastly different takes from our usual continental fare"}
{"text":"WORSE DELIVERY SERVICE!!! For some reason, the guy couldn't find the address which is surprising because i live on a popular street in Toronto and you'd have to be blind to miss it. The delivery guy yelled at me, YELLED in front of my neighbors!! I was so shocked that it took me an hour to call their restaurant and  complain.  The restaurant's response was unfortunate and so condescending Which is the main reason i stopped ordering from there and so did all my friends.The food is good but not enough to deal with this maniac delivery man. While i know they have two different delivery guys there, the one that i use to deal with in 2015 and early 2016 was awesome! He even called me by my nickname ( which probably means i ordered there way too much lol) and truly was the best . But starting feb- march 2016 i had to deal with this rude maniac who should be fired. I was left with the impression that they do not care at all about their faithful customers. I actually feel sorry for the first delivery guy whose name i wish i knew. Hope he can find a better company to work for"}
{"text":"By far the BEST pizza in Toronto.  I have been going to Peter's since he opened at Queen and Parliament (about 22 years ago) and now he has moved up to Gerrard.  But that hasn't stopped me from going there or ordering from there.  Pizza dough is fresh, not frozen, ingredients are loaded on top, not counted out and everything is fresh!  The calamari is tender and bursting with flavor.  The chicken wings are dusted in spice and not drenched in sauce.  Everything is absolutely delicious.  Delivery can be slow but for the quality, it is worth the wait.  Ever since eating there, I haven't ordered from another pizza shop in Toronto.  This is the ONLY one I go to.  I have only found one place to top it and that is Viva in NYC.  Small and family run with longtime staff that know what they are doing.  I've tried almost everything on the menu, but when I got to the Primavera pizza, I was hooked and that is what I have been ordering for years.  the slices for me are a bit boring, I'd go for a whole pie anyday."}
{"text":"Chicken wing lovers, how do you do it? Do you do it saucy, or do you do it crispy? YOU KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

Pete's wings fall on the crispy side of the wing spectrum, but none of this battered bullsh. Perfectly breaded, with a delightful kick of spice. Kind of like Shake & Bake, except way less UGH and way more YES PLEASE. Good enough to eat like that, but some (read: I) like to dip my mini drumstick in the  side of hot sauce that accompanies each order (or BBQ, or sweet and sour). The chicken is... (I hate the word 'juicy', what else can I use here? 'Tender'? Ugh, still awful). Anyway, big hunks of amazing wings that may have been taken from chicken angels.

I've never eaten in the restaurant so can't comment on the atmosphere, nor have I tried the pizza they're famous for. But delivery is free, and the wings come in a donut box. Win!"}
{"text":"Unique Cajun inspired fare.  Love the panzerotto's(they come in doughnut boxes) , chicken wings, fries and calamari.  Very tasty, very Spicey!"}
{"text":"Great little place - very Toronto-y!

Heard about this place from The Grid TO's 25 best pizza places list and thought I'd check it out with a friend. 

It's small and unassuming, as many places in Cabbagetown tend to be; had the Jazz Creole pizza and it was really tasty; the pizzas aren't cheap but they're made there and worth the added cost. I recommend going for the regular crust--crispy, tasty--perfection!

Good service, but seems to be cash only.

So, this place strikes me as very Toronto for the sake it's a \"Cajun Creole\" pizza place seemingly run by Serbians. If this doesn't scream Toronto in a nutshell, nothing does.

I'd definitely try it again."}
{"text":"The pizza is fresh and yummy. The resturtant gives off great vibes. Great pizza. So dammmm yummy."}
{"text":"Excellent spices and very different from other pizza and wing places.

I always share a plate of wings and get a Cajun pizza slice.

You can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Peter's Cajun Creole Pizza was Canada's best pizza, IMHO, unfortunately they are now closed, the place will be missed!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular for home delivery and everyone I serve a Peter's pizza to (I typically order the Estate pizza with feta cheese and sometimes italian sausage) and when you order off-menu, like thin crust with double mushrooms, sausage, extra cheese and pesto/tomato sauce mix etc. etc, my guests always say \"this is one of the best pizzas i've ever had\". And then when I have friends who have had it and are out of towners.... they always want Peter's when they come back!  That to me speaks volumes."}
{"text":"I was first tipped off on this place by a friend of mine from Austin, TX who lucked into this place and said it was the best pizza he ever had. I don't know if it's the best pizza but it is pretty darn good. Place is smallish so you may end up eating al fresco. Which may be a problem considering how cold Toronto gets. Decent selection of beers and pizza comes in both slices and pies. Better to get the pies. There is a difference in quality. Lots of regular and cajun/creole selections. Wings are also very good. Full sized wings that are crispy with plenty of a Tony Chachere's like seasoning. It's off the beaten path near downtown TO but it's worth a cab drive over to try pizza the likes of which you've probably never tried."}
{"text":"Pizza here is amazing... I always order the Estate.. I don't agree with the other reviewer who said this place is overpriced, I used to live nearby and I found the pizza prices very reasonable.  Obviously it costs more than 2-4-1 up the street, but this is not cheap pizza, this is really good pizza with good, fresh ingredients.  Also the sizing is very generous, a small pizza from Peter's is like a medium or a large at other places. Staff is super nice too.  I wish I still lived in Cabbagetown, I love this place!"}
{"text":"We ordered from Peter's Cajun Creole Pizza last night, first time.  The delivery was slated to arrive at 8:35PM according to the confirmation we received.  At 9:00PM we called and they said it's \"...not on the delivery vehicle yet but that means it's going to be fresh!  Should be there in 15 minutes... \".

Okay, we're hungry but no biggie... 9:15PM... 9:30PM... we called again.  \"Should be there soon!\"  9:45PM comes and goes and we're considering other options, we have company and everyone is nice about it, but yeah, this it's now getting crazy late.

We decide to go out to get a pizza and leave a note on the door (despite the fact they had already charged our credit card).  Walking out just before 10PM the delivery man arrives (not his fault, of course).

We had ordered two pizzas. Both of them were lukewarm.  And here's the bottom line: the place is expensive and the pizzas are nothing special, they really aren't.  The place has a fancy name, the prices are high, but the pizza is neither fancy or extraordinary.

Lots of great pizza in Toronto... recommendation: try someplace else!  Especially if you are hungry!"}
{"text":"Great wings!! (Never had their pizza)

I love Pete's wings! They're dry dusted with cajun spice. Not battered, not covered in sauce, though I'll admit I do likes those sometimes too but these are by far my preferred method. They come with a side of hot sauce for dipping which is great when it comes to delivery because they're not soggy by the time they arrive. And they deliver them in a donut box which I think is the right balance between keeping heat in but not letting moisture collect.

They also add the same or similar seasoning to their cajun fries which are also delicious.

One of these days I'll try the pizza and update this review. :)"}
{"text":"ive been going to peters for many years now.  its always been my east side choice. the ingredients are very fresh and the pizza is rich in taste.  i always choose my own ingredients.   but they do have really exciting pre-chosen combos like the seafood creole with mussels and craw fish on it.  or great salads like the mediterranean or the alla griglia.  they could let you know on the menu what is in the salads though as i have ask each time to remind myself.  also, if i remember correctly the pizza is always pretty oily - tasty, but oily."}
{"text":"Had high hopes for this place, but unfortunately its a typical pizza joint."}
{"text":"Better than average pizza. Dodgy neighborhood.

The pizza was tasty, with very fresh ingredients. I had the Creole Gumbo...it was good but a little undercooked. The dough was still moist...

I'll go back again.....it's worth it....to see if it was just an off night.

Libretto is still tops in my book."}
{"text":"This is for the wings only.

I'll echo Wendy H. below and say that the wings were a pleasant surprise. They are dry rub so not breaded and not with thick sauce. More like a shake and bake but with much more kick. Definitely not the blazing hot buffalo wing style but...again...a dry rub with a bit of a kick. On the negative side, the meat on them is a little skimpy but that is usually the case with wings anywhere. 

At the very least, they are worth trying if you are in the area and have a jones for something different."}
{"text":"Let's face the facts here... Torontonians go on and on about the best this and the best that, and that's just fine. Who wouldn't want to know where the best things to eat are? Well then let's get down to just where to find the best Panzerotti. If if facts we're talking about then let's start with just what a Panzerotti is. It's a fried... not baked, fried savory turnover. And if it's truths we're trying to seek out here then let's be candid, no one in Toronto does a Panzo better then Pete's. Do yourself the favour, life is too short to miss out on such indulgences. And if you're going to go through with it all, be smart about it, get a side of sauce."}
{"text":"3 and a half stars? really? Maybe their actual made to order pizza is good...I don't know, but their \"Cajun Slice\" was probably the worst piece of...word that rhymes with grit deleted...that I have ever had.

I saw the sign and thought...hey! That's an odd and interesting concept, I wonder what its about. So I walked in and asked \"What's a Cajun/Creole Pizza?\" \"Oh its a pizza that has a spicy sauce.\" The woman sounded like she had a frenchish accent, so I thought, hey, she might be Creole herself. I'll give it a try...I love spicy food.

Out comes this brown paper bag...now I think the reason for the bag was to ensure that I didn't see it before leaving, or maybe it is like the \"putting a paper bag over the ugly kids face so you don't have to look at it\" trick.

Whatever it was, the pizza was AWFUL. It had no flavor, wasn't reheated well enough, was sparse with toppings and the toppings were boretastic. I don't know where this \"spicy sauce\" statement comes from because all I tasted was sub-par below standard tomato sauce out of a grade school cafeteria can with a little bit of red pepper flakes.

I ate 3 bites and immediately chunked it in the trash and shook my fist in its general direction.

Whatever you do...don't come in here. At least, if you do, don't get a slice of pizza. The pictures make you think the whole pies are great, and maybe they are...but the pizza by the slice is akin to eating a three day old piece of pizza you found on the ground walking around."}
{"text":"Food- 5/5
Service- 3.5/5 (It really depends on who is serving)
Wait time- 3/5 (Worth it although I almost drank my Diet Coke while waiting)
Ambiance- 5/5
Cleanliness- 4/5

First time I went here was on July 2016. I would rate it as 5 stars because of the excellent service we had from the old lady in a ponytail running the store then. She was very chatty and she took the time to introduce us with their menu.

We visited the pizza place again earlier. Its almost a year since we've been here. We were served by a different lady who was much more skinnier and taller. She was okay at first but later on her attitude changed. Not as friendly and chatty as the old lady who served us before. 

When I went home, I realized I might have been overcharged by $17. I was able to talk to the server and I told her that I have a photo of their menu and my receipt. I complained to her that I did not understand how did my bill sum up. She told me that their current menu has the old price list. She verbally told me the correct break down of my receipt. 

Just a heads up to this pizza joint's potential customers, they give out receipts without the cost breakdown of your food items. I do remember asking for the breakdown of it last year. I just forgot to do so this time. 

I thought to myself, if their price list changed then why are they still using it in their store? The lady also didnt inform me of this when she brought the menus to our table. Lack of communication right off. I wa surprised with my bill because it didnt really make sense. The lady told me that their pastas are for $15 each. It isn't $9.16 anymore. You can refer to the photo below.

Food quality and taste- Overall perfect! The pizza and pasta tasted fresh and flavorful :) 
I wish I took photos but we were too hungry from waiting so we devoured the food items  immediately.

I really hope I dont get the same lady next time. I'd still go back and order from this restaurant, I'm just not really excited to see the same server again."}
{"text":"Peter's Cajun Creole Pizza is a nondescript dine-in/take-out spot along a strip of Parliament St. in Cabbagetown, on the east side of downtown. There's a mix of businesses in this area, but Peter's is definitely one of a kind. Inspired by Cajun and creole tradition, the menu here offers options such as dry-rubbed cajun chicken wings, and a pizza lineup that will have you feeling like you're on Bourbon Street.

A cajun pizza slice is $5.50 and definitely worth sampling. The pie is big, slightly thinner than normal, and covered in an interesting but simple combination of toppings. It feels like a cross between gumbo soup and a classic Italian slice. I haven't had anything like it, and it definitely inspires me to try the wings and some other items they offer, like the panzerotto.

Decorated with heirlooms and images related to the New Orleans theme, there's a charming vibe you can feel when stopping here. The staff are pretty friendly and this place seems to be tied closely to the community. If you're bored of the way pizza is usually done, it's worth a shot to check this spot out."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with the food and service. I tried to order from them from Just Eat, however they did not offer chicken as a topping on the Just Eat website, so the woman insisted I place the order over the phone. In addition, when requesting arugula as a topping (as it is listed on Just Eat), the woman was confused and said they don't offer that as a topping. If that was the only issue, I would not be complaining, but alas, it was not. Moving on, once the order was complete she ended the conversation - not telling me how much it cost or how long it would take. I called back to ask, and she advised on the price (~$56 for 2 large pizzas) and that it would take 50-55 minutes - pretty expensive and long, but it's winter and they're busy, so I understand. Over an hour later, I call back for an update - they are very busy and the driver is JUST leaving - they were located a bit far from my house so I assumed it would take 20-25 mins...

1 HOUR LATER (2 hours after ordering)...

I call back and the lady clearly recognized my number because all she said when she picked up was \"the driver is on his way\" in an extremely rude tone. I complained that it had now been over 2 hours since we placed the order, and her response as \"what can I do?\" (not in a friendly customer service kind of way but in a \"it's not my fault - there's nothing I can do about it\" sort of way. Well, I responded by saying firstly that she could be a hell of a lot nicer to her customers. I also suggested she could provide  discount of some sort. At first she said no, but then offered to give me a whopping $10 off my purchase, but I HAD to pay in cash. I told her thanks for the generous offer but there's no way I'm paying more than $30 for likely cold pizza and for this type of service. Eventually she agreed, but again, it HAD to be in cash.

About 10 minutes later...

The driver arrives, and seeing as he was just the driver, I could not blame him for the lateness since it took so long for them to cook(although he did make another stop before coming to our house). He was apologetic and very nice though. I gave him $30 cash and told him to keep $10 for himself and tell the boss I only gave him $20 for the restaurant. Hopefully he listened.

The food...

The pizza was boring at best. It looked nice, but the pizza was very bready, and unsurprisingly not as hot as it should have been. The onions on the pizza were more like onion skin (or that outer thin layer of onion that technically isn't skin but has little flavour and dries out very quickly). The chicken on the pizza was like chicken shavings... not the worst thing in the world,but because it is so thin it also gets very dry. Also, there was nothing the least bit cajun-y about either of the pizzas we ordered (unless onion skin is a new cajun trend I've yet to become aware of).

Overall... unless you're in the mood for mediocre pizza with very poor service and extremely long wait times, don't order from here."}
{"text":"The most expensive pizza I've ever (not) eaten, next to Magic Oven, and the latter's got organic/specialty ingredients that you didn't even know you wanted on a pizza in the first place. 

$15.80 for a small \"Jazz Cajun\" pie with two toppings (sundried tomatoes and goat cheese) is far too expensive. I don't count \"sauce\", \"seasoning\" and mozzarella as toppings as those are standard. So I paid almost $16 for goat cheese? Because as you can see from the photo, the sundried tomatoes were liberally \"sprinkled\" on top as an afterthought and immediately fell off the moment I lifted out the lone slice I ate. The pizza tasted OK but there wasn't enough sauce. In fact, I want a refund for the \"sauce\" topping. Unless its inclusion in \"quotation marks\" is intended to call attention to its \"sparseness\". 

Mike S ordered cajun wings ($11.25) and there were eleven of them. They were neither breaded nor sauced - instead a sort of shiny texture glistening with beads of oil. He said they were gristly. I don't even eat meat and I know gristly = not ideal.

I'm trying not to fault this place for taking close to two hours to deliver my pizza on a Saturday night, but really, driving a pizza ten blocks east shouldn't take that long, and I was quoted one hour at most. I had to call back after ninety minutes to ask for an update and was told the driver had just left for my house, but then it still took another thirty minutes. 

Also, what are \"pork wings\"? Because they're on the menu and I need to know exactly when pigs started sprouting appendages that facilitate flying."}
{"text":"Fantastic pizza, usually fresh out of the oven.  The Cajun slice isn't too spicy but has a nice kick.  Sandwiches are great as well.  Unfortunately they just hiked the prices here, maybe because a Magic Oven ($$) moved in down the street, so it's a bit harder to justify eating here often, but really great, unique pizza in Toronto.  Looking forward to trying the wings and cajun calamari."}
