{"text":"Staff here need an attitude adjustment. Seems unless you are a regular, you are an outsider. Super rude, I should be lucky to be served by them. Apple juice is much smaller than other Country Styles I've been to. Tiny english muffins, I had to ask if it was the right size. Won't return."}
{"text":"*PLEASE READ whether you're looking to be hired, or if you are a customer. Former employee review:

I applied for a job here about 2 weeks ago, and was promptly hired, despite having no experience working in food. I began work 2 days ago, and was never instructed on what attire to wear for work, and the head manager referred to me indirectly as dressed like a \"whore\" over the phone, despite my clothing being casual (dark blue ballet flats, grey leggings, white t-shirt covered by a blue lined sweater that covered my hips down to my mid- thighs) for the shift they randomly scheduled me for, without ulterior explaination of how to know which shift one employee is to be scheduled for. 

On the first day, I witnessed dirty wet smelly cloths being used to wipe the counters behind the tills, and to clean the knife used to cut sandwiches, as well as another wet, smelly dirty cloth being used to clean the cream dispenser, which went right into customers mouths daily. 
Not trained properly to use machines besides the coffee brewer, I was scolded for misunderstanding orders or where to find products, because the training was dreadful, they even had a girl who had recently started herself training me, and she hardly understood a thing herself, while a regular employee was pissed the entire time with our inability to keep up. The head manager/owner of the location told me that I wasn't working hard enough and slacking the day before, despite my frequent explaination before being hired that I have no experience working on cash or with food, additionally, the kind employee (who has now left) that trained me on the first day had to show me each and every aspect of the job before I could perform duties efficiently for customers. I worked diligently while the manager sat at a table talking to his friends, all the while, his employees were struggling to keep up. I burned my finger on the toaster machine because it was never cleaned, and a customer's toasted bagel got stuck inside, and I had to risk at the chance to grab it. I threw away the burnt food, and refunded their money. 

Some customers received better treatment than others, and some receive fresher coffee than others, and if you don't know this on your first day, regular employees get pissed with you despite their own bad training. 

Flies and bees make their homes in the bakery doughnuts, and the microwaves are dirty inside and out. The head manager and employees argue ever so often, and services are better at Tim Hortons where cleanliness is top notch, and so are prices, at least your doughnuts won't have fly footprints on them. 

Don't bother applying to this store, their washrooms are cleaner than their food, and the customers are more respectful than the staff. Worst job experience thus far, I had to warn a girl who dropped off her resum√© today to stay far away, because I wouldn't want anyone else to deal with what I had to. Save yourself the time, and eat and/or apply at Tim Hortons, Starbucks, or Second Cup, services are not trashy and they actually have proper uniforms."}
{"text":"The cinnamon twists are great. My parents love the coffee. Other than that... I think the donuts are a little oily at times and if you come later in the day they are stale. 

As far as the atmosphere of the place; there's a mix of older people, blue collar workers and some who.. Don't exactly earn their income. I usually use the drive through or get my stuff and leave. 

Oh; they have pretty decent sandwich sand breakfast eggy things."}
{"text":"Worst customer service I've seen. I was working on my laptop and after 15 minutes they asked me to leave. To bad for them I went to the Tim Hortons across the street, ordered a coffee after being there for more than half an hour, and got my work done. I definitely didn't get any BS from the staff there.

Also, there was a lot of noise including someone from the staff who seemed to be the manager, yelling at a teenager who bought coffee for not taking a seat and asking him to either leave or take a seat. This went on at least 3 times in the 15 minute duration I was there. This was my first time there and I will certainly not make that mistake again.

Lastly, asking customers to leave is one thing, but being rude and disrespectful is not acceptable."}
{"text":"100% Best Donuts - They have the best donuts around. The coffee is fine. I gave 4 stars only since I haven't tried much else AND apparently they're closed on Sunday - what?!  I'll try to verify this.  I wish they opened earlier than 6:00 but I know, my schedule is weird. 

The posts before me seem a bit dated, please try something and update us here. 

UPDATED:  At time of writing the hours posted here are incorrect. They actually open every weekday morning at 4 am and on the weekends 5 am. And yes, they're open on Sunday."}
{"text":"I am a big fan of coffee shops but this one isn't too great.  I am sure that it has its good and great points but I haven't seen them yet.

The food is standard fast food like coffee shop stuff.  Of note is that the donuts though do seem to be on the bigger side than a standard Tim Horton's donut.

This location has the luck of having steady business but that clientele is what makes this place less than great.  There are tow truck drivers or cabs parked in this lot as there are two highway entrances fairly close.  While I have had a great share of meeting amazing tow truck drivers or cabbies, a lot of them congregated in one location can almost look like a biker gang hanging out at this spot with a few tow trucks or cabs always around.  

Coupled with that is that it is a local hang out for many of the somalian community that are in the area.  So most of the seats are normally taken up by older men lounging there or in many cases there is a large crowd of men hanging around at the front door or in the parking lot.  However, I know that female friends have stayed far from this location because it is unnerving to be the only girl there with so many men around.  That basically eradicates half the customer base for this location.

The lighting is great and it has windows across half of the location allowing ambient light in.  However, the location just doesn't give off the clean and safe feel that you get at other locations.

Last item would be the parking lot.  Just around this shop there are always cars on the move and I am surprised that there aren't more accidents. Maybe since i don't frequent it often (or at all) I haven't seen it..."}
{"text":"Nothing really special here. Just your standard coffee shop chain. The service is fast, although it is usually only 1 person behind the counter.

The place can get crowded, with alot older clientele. Not a place for the single ladies.

Bathrooms are fairly clean. The coffee shop empties out by 10pm I find on most nights, so it is a place that you can sit down and do some work.  I usually stop by in the evenings to get some paperwork done."}
{"text":"i stop here every once in a while, the coffee is good, the breakfast sandwiches are good, the donuts are good, too bad the location is awkward, and the service is mighty average.  So its good, not great, just good."}
{"text":"First time trying one of these grilled sandwiches at Country Style. I got the Tuscan turkey. 
I really liked the pictures that tell me what's in it without a description. 

It's on a square flat thin kaiser but toasted. The bread to stuff ratio was pretty good. And you can have different sauces like peppercon ranch, honey mustard etc"}
{"text":"I previously noted in my review of Aroma at the Shoppes of Don Mills about the feeling of entitlement by those who set up a satellite office in a coffee place then write a one star review specifically about a time where a small business owner trying to turn over tables for paying customers. In fact, often it is the only review said person posted. 

Walking north on Yonge Street to Tims and noticing the line out the door, we decided to patronize Country Style at the corner, which had no line and exceptionally warm and friendly service. Josh wanted a BELT, and the version here looked fantastic! Fresh, made to order at the same time concurrent to you paying for the meal? With Tims, you are in the post war soup line of payment, grab your coffee on the raised platform, them shuffle to the food production area where you nervously wait for your food, not knowing 100% if you'll get ever you ordered. Here, you are even asked if you want a receipt. 

For me, a light, chewy seseme seed bagel with a bit of butter hot and toasty (it didn't last to make the photo shoot). If you waste your carbs allowance, this is a great way to do it! The coffee was very good, but not a big fan of the old style caps where you burn your finger on the coffee while  to pressing it in. I guess you can take the cap off first:) 

So awesome service, complementary wifi, no lines, great food and comparable prices. What a gem ! If you want to write you're novel, maybe spend over $2.00 a shot and mind your manners with these lovely folks. -Zuk"}
{"text":"There are times when you just don't want to talk to anyone or see anyone you work with (or sometimes even your loved ones). We all go through that right? When two people talking loudly seem loud enough to be irritating. Take refuge from Country Style on Eglinton Avenue West. I come here for lunch sometimes when I need quiet times. 

It's not busy during lunch time and the place is half empty. People come, order and bring their food back to their office. Or illegally eat in their vehicles (it is illegal to eat while driving, seriously). 

The food selection is not plenty and substandard compared to restaurants. Beside it's a coffee shop - do not expect a gourmet. Heavens. 

I normally order the soup which was probably high in sodium. Who cares I'm stressed out when I'm here. I often rebel. Call it comfort food. They have tuna salad sandwich too often served cold bread. They don't ask you if you want your bread toasted so make sure you mention it before putting a scoop, one scoop, of tuna. 

Not recommended for a date but recommended for quick bite. And peace of mind."}
{"text":"It was a little eerie walking into this place at 6 am and having 3 old guys stare at me while I walked from the side door to the counter. This was my first visit to a Country Style in probably 15 years. 

I wasn't really impressed with the muffin selection as they all seemed to be really boring options; nothing fun like Tim Horton's fruit explosion muffin. I didn't let this fact affect my rating though since one little location in Etobicoke can't be blamed for a corporately mandated muffin menu. 

I gave these guys 3 stars because it was a pretty standard experience. They got my order right, I didn't get coffee instead of tea. The staff greeted me, weren't overly friendly, but weren't grumpy either. The place was clean and tidy. Nothing super fantastic about the experience and nothing poor about it either."}
{"text":"I like this country style it's the one closest to my home so I tend to gravitate here when I'm feeling in the mood for some unique doughnuts!  Also I over heard the women who work the counter talking and the veteran employee was telling the new employee that the owner was very kind. 

Location:
It's awkwardly located at the corner of Yonge and 16th. Awkward because you need to figure out how to get to it. It's not obvious.

Parking:
Donut shop in the suburbs. Lots of parking. I just noticed a new restaurant opened next to it. It might change the parking situation if it ever gets busy but judging from other things that have opened in its space, it shouldn't be a problem.

Decor: 
It's like a nicer traditional coffee shop. Mr.sub also shares the space. 

Seating is table and chairs or booths. 

Staff:
Everyone I've ever dealt with has been really nice. Smiles, joking with the older regular customers, exactly what you'd expect from a traditional chain coffee shop. 

Food:
Ok the coffee is terrific. No joking. I had spoke to the manager about it and was told that at country style they grind the coffee beans in the morning before they make your morning coffee. You can tell. I never realized there was a difference till I tried it

Country style has also upped their donut game!
They have some fancy terrific tasting confections. Ores, snore, Reece, cherry. Etc,.. they are pretty and tasty. Love that combination!

I like this place. I'm definitely coming back. I'm writing this as I'm sitting here!"}
