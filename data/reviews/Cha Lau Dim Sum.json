{"text":"Contemporary decor - decent dim sum but small portions

I was very excited to see a new dim sum restaurant pop up in my hood, so on a whim I went to check it out this week for lunch. It was later in the day (around 3 pm) so the restaurant was not busy. 

They have a fairly extensive menu of dim sum options, from steamed to fried, noodles, cheung fun, and desserts. All dim sum dishes are $3-5, with the noodles and vegetables $5-9. 

They offer a daily lunch special (one vegetarian option, one non-veg) for $8.95-$9.95/pp. A great way to sample their food. I chose the non-veg option which includes a choice of soup (vegetarian hot & sour or chicken won ton), four different steamed dumplings (shrimp scallop & asparagus, pork siu mai, beef & mushroom, pork green beans & chinese olive), steamed daily vegetables, and a bowl of chicken fried rice. 

Overall, I'd say the food was very \"ching\" (in Cantonese), meaning that it tasted very clean, not very heavy. I think some would find the food a bit bland though -  I had to use quite a bit of hot sauce which would often overpower the taste of the food. Everything was served beautifully on nice small plates. Portions are on the smaller side, but having said that I was actually very full after this meal. Quality vs. quantity.

Service was very fast when I was there. One thing that bothered me though was that when I paid for my bill, they never came back with change (or asked if I needed change). I could have asked for change, but in the grand scheme of things, they netted with maybe only 50 cents more than I would have normally given. Not a big deal, but was a bit peeved on the principle."}
{"text":"I was there few weeks ago. This place has one of the best dim sum (esp. steam dumplings) I have ever had in Toronto for the past many years. It's on par to the dim sum I used to have in Hong Kong (grew up having dim sum almost every week so I know what is good). 

The price is higher than those neighbourhood friendly Chinese dim sum resto in China Town, Scarborough, and Markham. Giving the central location and food quality I wouldn't mind to pay more.

I was recommended by a senior wait staff to try the steam dumplings. He said their dim sum are all made in their kitchen instead of the mass produced dim sum from a food factory. And he was right. The dumpling skins are soft yet slightly chewy. The best part was the skin/wrap was not mushy and not any single dumpling skin break when we picked it up with chopsticks! 

We had 5-6 types of steam dumplings. All tasted amazing and all made in different shape using the same type of wraps. Lovely presentation. I also recommend both type of beef Siu Mie and sesame balls dessert.  

I will definitely go back again."}
{"text":"Our monthly dim sum meetup group had uniform praise for the food  (we ordered a wide range of dishes: squid fingers, and fried eggplant were terrific) and the service.  The dessert selection was crazy good (we ordered seconds!). They had a selection of teas on offer (we tried Oolong, Jasmine, and Pu-er), and were very helpful re menu suggestions and Chef specials. 

The place is attractively decorated, with lovely place settings - more Japanese than Chinese. And it is only one block north of College subway station, so very easy to get to!  It is pricier than other dim sum places but if you want to up your game, or impress those not familiar with dim sum, this is the place! We paid $19/person.

{"text":"The food here is fantastic and authentic, but the portions are not ... they are cute though.  They are sort of a miniaturized dim sum but at more than full prices (usually expected and found at chinese restaurants)."}
{"text":"This places great. Food was delicious and carefully prepared. Staff were really nice and attentive. Worth the money."}
{"text":"Stumbled in here one Saturday night for their all day dim sum. 

Highlights were cheap tea (4 - 5 kinds) which was frequently re-steeped, mango pudding and sesame ball desserts, and the decor. I can't say I've had better dim sum desserts than at Cha Lau! Some of the entrees were so-so, I wasn't a fan of some of the dumplings (the chive and pork one comes to mind) but definitely would recommend this place for the sesame balls alone. I don't even like black sesame but ordered two of the balls because they were so good. 

Check them out!"}
{"text":"I was very excited to learn that Cha Lau (originally Cha Liu) was reopening after closing last summer in the Yonge and Eglinton area. I was a huge fan despite the smaller portions and relatively expensive price. The food was definitely worth it. I couldn't wait to order my old favourites and check out what's new.

The new restaurant is spacious and beautifully decorated. It's definitely nice enough to bring a date, but still great for those casual outings. Overall, the meal was great and the service was excellent as usual. I was happy to be reunited with some of my favourite dishes - baby bok choy in garlic sauce (in oyster sauce is yummy too),  sesame balls, egg tarts, pork siu mai, and pan fried beef dumplings. I was sad to learn that they changed the filling for the duck in puff pastry. I didn't find the new filling to be appetizing at all. There was also another beef dumpling (for the life of me I can't really remember which one exactly) that was heavily seasoned with black pepper and onion. It was definitely another miss, but despite these missteps I had a great meal. 

Yes the portions are much smaller than expected from most dim sum places and therefore pricier, but each little portion is packed with flavour and worth every penny. If you're looking for quantity and a cheap price you won't find it here and as soon as you accept this the more enjoyable you will find the food."}
{"text":"Never  go back to this place! Small portion,Bad service and 13% mandatory tips even if the service is so bad. it's should not be your choice If you speak Mandarin. What's the meaning of SHI SAN DIAN?"}
{"text":"Have had a lot of dim sum in the past, this one is pretty overpriced for the low quality of food served. Sadly, the pretentious decor cannot help. However there's some potential there. Might give it another try in six months to see if there's any food quality improvement."}
{"text":"Service was excellent, outside of the owner (or was she a manager) as she didn't crack a smile once. 

The food was mediocre - not worth the crazy price (compared to other dim sum restaurants). The servings small, was hoping for big flavors but got the same old story instead. The only upside is that it was fresh... However, I won't go back. I paid $50 for a meal I would've paid half for. Wouldn't mind cost if taste was there. 

Wish I liked it as much as others... I'll head back to Crown Princess."}
{"text":"Don't go to Cha Lau Dim Sum unless you want to spend your entire meal figuring out if the kitchen was making budget cuts and charging you extra. I spent more than half of my meal staring at the incredibly tiny portions that were brought to our table. Nearly everything, aside from the har gou (shrimp dumplings) and siu mai (pork dumplings) were much smaller than what you could get at most dim sum restaurants. Perhaps the staff had invested in a shrink ray to get everything to miniature proportions.

After ordering 13 different platters and getting a good sense on the lack of flavour for nearly every dish -- the curry cuttlefish (or baby octopus, as indicated on the menu) did not have any curry flavour, the har gou did not have a fresh taste, neither did the singapore noodles, which were also bland.

The black pepper pan fried dumplings, however, were very flavourful, and the egg tarts (although very small) were equally delicious, with just the right hint of sweetness.

The total bill came to just under $70 with tip, which is a lot for 13 tiny appetizer type dishes. Typically, my family orders about 13 dishes for 4 people...at this restaurant, 13 dishes were feeding 2 people...considering my guest and I were still hungry, that says a lot."}
{"text":"Great spot for table order dim sum. Definitely less greasy and healthier than the regular places in china town. The lunch special is good value and not too heavy. Service is very attentive. Decor is tasteful and the restaurant is very clean and well presented. A very solid 4 stars and worth the visit."}
{"text":"I really liked the Eglinton location of this restaurant so sis & I were overly eager to visit their new location. However, the older lady who served us was 'way too busy' conversing & sharing jokes with her friends or coworkers, ignored us calling her about five times in a row, brought us the wrong food (bloated-looking, nasty-assed, chili sauce-soaked de-boned chicken feet), & gave us dirty looks when we asked for more hot sauce (which was still not enough because the miniature dishes the hot sauce arrived in were 4-5 cm in diameter & 2-3 cm high), brought out every steamer we ordered all at once & spread them out instead of leaving them stacked so the food cooled very quickly. When we piled the steamers back up to preserve warmth, the lady tried to dismantle our structure even under our insistence & reasoning. The food was good & the portion sizes were adequate-- only because I know dim sum is not an AYCE smorgasbord & something to be savoured. If you want to eat til bursting, go to McDonalds or Mandarin. I also don't like a lot of meat in my dishes so what other people complained about here was something I benefited from."}
{"text":"Pros:

- High quality dumplings

{"text":"AVOID THIS PLACE!

This would be good if you are a baby and one dimsum would do the trick but for what you get and what you pay, you would have to pay 100$ to be full. 

Quality was very oily and portions are super small. 

service was terrible.  This place is not fine dining and it tries to be."}
{"text":"I have never written a review before about any place, but after how I got treated at Cha Lau tonight, this is the first thing I did after getting home. 

I arrived at around 9:30pm on a Friday night. There was one other table occupied and 2 waitresses. 

I am not really good at reading Chinese and when I asked for congee, the waitress told me that it was not offered on the English menu. She handed me a Chinese menu and I was able to make out the words to make a selection. I then turned over to the English menu and ordered two other dishes. 

The waitress told me that one selection was not available, which I was fine with. She then stood there, and ordered me to mark up the selections together on the same menu. She stood over me as I did this. Perhaps her hands were too delicate to do so or her mind couldn't have remembered the order? 

After awhile, she came to me and said that my order was less than $10 before tax, so I had to order something else unless paying by cash. (Unbeknownst to me, they charged me $1.15 for tea that tasted like hot water and the total came to $9.85. So I was 15 CENTS SHORT.) 

I didn't have enough cash on me, so I ordered a congee to go to meet their request. No fuss, just smiled and handed over my order. The waitress walked to the other waitress to tell her my order, which is when the other waitress called me, very loudly in Cantonese, \" CRAZY/STUPID\" several times, complaining that I just made the order, which is odd considering that they forced me to do so for being 15 CENTS SHORT. I would have happily given them the 15 cents difference, but felt doing so would be cheap. After unmistakably hearing this, I pulled out my phone and googled \" should I tip rude waitresses\" I struggled with the idea because despite their rudeness, I felt obliged to tip. 

Then AS I WAS STILLING EATING, she walked over and placed the bill in front of me. Which is when I noticed that the bill came higher than expected. I rushed to finish my food, went up and asked the waitress meekly. She said it was for the tea, ROLLED HER EYES AND THEN WALKED AWAY.  Having been to Cha Lau several times, I never noticed the charge. But fair enough. I tried explaining to her that charging for tea is no big deal, I only asked because I never noticed the charge before and was wondering if there has been a policy change. She responded \"WE NEVER GIVE ANYTHING FOR FREE\" in an air as if I was some poor beggar. 

After waiting for her at the front for a few minutes to pay, she snapped and asked \"YOUR CARD?\" I handed it to her, and for the first time in my life, I did not tip. 

Having worked as a waitress before, I know the importance of tipping. But there were 2 waitress and 2 tables. The service was slow. The food portion was small, tasted so-so (I heard microwaves in the kitchen). Sure, maybe they were having a bad day and the food has very little to do with waitresses, but they had no excuse to outright insult a customer and treated me with such disrespect.

That's my one-time experience, and I tried to give an objective picture. To be fair, they have been polite the past few times. I even recommended the restaurant to my friends before and personally brought them their with me. But after such a humiliating experience, I will never return."}
{"text":"I had come to this restaurant because I like dim sum. The portions are very small, and quite expensive. However, the service was very good. I do like the idea of dim sum all day, however after my meal I was still hungry even though the meal was expensive."}
{"text":"We had 5 different dishes and loved each one! The atmosphere is relaxed and quiet; perfect for a quick lunch or romantic dinner. Service was amazing, our tea was kept hot and fresh, and we were checked in and accommodated no matter how busy the restaurant got. 

If you are unsure of what to order, they do have a picture menu that you can scroll through with the name and item number for easier ordering. 

Overall, we were really pleased with the food and impressed with the service!"}
{"text":"If you like to pay high price only for the decor, go ahead but I will not go back again. What we can taste is MSG, nothing else. My friend even found some soil in the shrimp of the har gow. FREAKY!!!"}
{"text":"I LOVE Dim Sum and was very excited to find a place in this neighborhood.  
I have eaten here several times with my family and it definitely satiates my Dim Sum cravings.

The Decor  is very nice and the washrooms are immaculately clean (a rarity on Yonge  St.).

The food is very tasty and of high quality.  The staff are efficient and friendly.  I am served in a timely manner and water, tea are topped up without my having to ask.  I am not cooed at incessantly, but that's a good thing.  Its nice to enjoy my food without interruptions.

The portions look small compared to a Chinese restaurant.  But they are not small.  They are typical Dim Sum portions.  I always leave full and happy.  

A few of our favorite dishes: Curry Baby Octopus, tripe with black bean sauce and the Mango pudding.  Also the baked baby pumpkins are cute and tasty too.
The price is slightly higher than some places around Spadina, but the quality is better and its nothing outrageous.  $35 is what we usually spend.  

I don't understand the complaints at all.  Perhaps if they are leaving feeling half full they didn't order the right combination of foods.  A lot of dim sum is little bites of protein, perhaps a side dish of carbs (rice/noodles) will help. Just a suggestion.  

I highly recommend this place as a nice(er) Dim Sum restaurant option.  Great for lunch with friends and family or drinks and and nice dinner out."}
{"text":"The only thing even qualifying little Cha Lau for one star is its decor (and lucky for them, Yelp doesn't allow anything lower).

Came in here with a friend for a dim-sum lunch. Walked out the door 30 minutes later with a few unpleasant, overpriced pieces of what they tried to pass as \"dim sum\" in our stomachs and frowns on our faces. I should've taken the quiet interior of the place as warning. I should also have taken the rude greetings of the hostess to a fellow patron (\"what do you want?\" - I'm not even kidding you! and not letting him sit wherever he wanted in a dead empty restaurant!!!!) as double warning.

The menu was not particularly impressive, but we ordered a few items and waited in anticipation of the meal that was to satisfy our big dim sum craving. My eyes widened when the items were brought out - NOT because they were impressive, but because they were so small I had to open my eyes bigger to try and spot what miniscule servings of food I was entitled to have (I'm exaggerating... sort of? not really).

And the flavour? NO THANKS. The sticky rice in lotus leaf was bland as heck, and the pork pastry contained trace amounts of pork... and I couldn't even be sure that the ingredients that were used were of any decent quality --- were they just left over scraps from somewhere else?

So we voiced our concerns in an effort to give suggestions to the chef for the future, but this quickly turned into a hostile show down with the hostess. This was in Cantonese, so I'm giving second hand information but she was not apologetic in her tone, words, or action. I'm told that the server suggested that maybe we did not know how the Chinese dishes were supposed to taste (uh, what!?) and responded with \"you don't have to eat it\" and immediately assumed we were trying to get a free meal out of the experience.

So, we walked out with our dim sum needs extremely unmet and our moods dampened, but it was such a terrible experience that I was just happy to not be stuck in that environment anymore. I hope she noticed it was not a free meal we were looking for because we touched maybe 1/4 of our food.

Nowadays when I walk by Cha Lau and see a bunch of innocent folks inside trying to stomach their food, I just sigh with empathy and sadness that I could not spare folks from walking through their doors in time."}
{"text":"I just went here for an early lunch with my family. The first thing I noticed was how nice it was inside. If you are  a person who cares about decor, you will enjoy Cha Lau.

We looked at the menu and noticed that their prices are more expensive than other dim sum places we've been to, but we decided to still give the place a shot. I figured that maybe the food might be as lovely as the decor was. However, when we got our food, we noticed how tiny the portions were compared to other dim sum restaurants. We were paying more for the same dishes we normally get, yet the dumplings for example were tinier and didn't taste as good. To me the dim sum tasted like the frozen dim sum I buy from this frozen food place back home. I really tasted a difference between Cha Lau's dim sum and Chinatown's dim sum. I'm not saying the food is horrible, but I don't think that the food here is worth the price, especially since the servings are much smaller than average.

Service was alright. The waitresses made rounds to refill our water glasses or tea cups and they served us our food. No one went out of their way to say much to us or even smile otherwise.

Final verdict: Okay dim sum, but there are way better places to go to."}
{"text":"The decor is definitely a few notches above your typical dim sum place. It is nice and quiet here. I was pretty excited when I saw a dim sum place opened so close my home, and tried it a few times from its opening to now hoping it would get better (and cause I am lazy some times). Unfortunately, it never got better and I think I will just go to Crown Princess which is a few blocks further or get my butt to Chinatown. 

The reasons why I don't love here are:
1) Slowww service even when there is only 1 other table, service is polite but awkward.
2) Portion sizes are minute, as many others have mentioned, they really are 50% smaller than a typical dim sum size. They also charge more per dish, while having the smaller size dim sum.
3) Ok if it is not economical, that is fine, since the decor is nicer and the location is great, but please be flavorful, but it is not :\., the food is pretty bland here. I can't accept not tasty."}
{"text":"This is not your typical dim sum restaurant.   If all you want is to pig out on cheap shrimp dumplings and BBQ pork buns, you better head to the Chinatown, or even better - to Markham.  This place offers a different take on dim sum.  On par with the best in quality, their dishes are a notch above other restaurants' in terms of originality and sophistication.  You will find pan-fried mushroom dumplings served with hot mustard, steamed vegetable dumplings in carrot-coloured dough, mango-and-shrimp spring rolls, and several other dishes that are outside the canonical dim sum menu.  Of course, you will also find delicious shrimp dumplings, beef balls and BBQ pork  buns if you want something traditional.  And they will be excellent.  The only downside is that indeed, as others have noticed, portions are smaller, so you end up paying more to get full.  A meal won't break your bank, but Cha Lau is not a restaurant for cheapskates.

In its earlier incarnation, Cha Liu Dim Sum at Yonge and Eglinton, this restaurant prospered for many years, until rising rents (I believe) forced it to close.  Its clientele was largely non-Asian, and it aimed to appeal to people who might feel uncomfortable in the brightly lit, steamy, loud and crowded tea houses on Spadina.  The owners took the same approach with their new location.  From the rich, dark-toned decor to Japanese-style, dark coloured dishes, plates and utensils, you can see that a lot of thought was put into the dining experience.  There's no plastic on the tables and no carts from which you pick your food.  (You order from the menu and it arrives straight from the kitchen, piping hot.)  It's also quieter.  If you're a connoisseur of condiments, ask for the spicy XO sauce which few other dim sum places offer.

I've had dim sum countless times on Spadina, in many restaurants in Markham, and even a few times in Hong Kong.  I still enjoy coming back to Cha Lau for that touch of  sophistication and those original dishes you won't get in other places.   I hope their new location serves them well."}
{"text":"When I first looked at their sign on Yonge street, I wasn't sure if I'd want to try this place. Then every time I walked by this restaurant, I thought it looked pretty nice inside. I was craving Dim Sum last week and didn't want to drive all the way to Chinatown, so I decided to give this place a shot.

Wow...their food and service really impressed me!

First of all, if you want some cheap dim sum, I don't recommend this place. Go to Chinatown where you pay less for bigger portion.

Their portion is very small, especially for Fried rice and noodles! Their Shu mai, har gao were really good. I've been to so many Dim Sum restaurants in Richmond Hill and Cha Lau beats them all.

Their presentation is fantastic. Order Shu mai or Har gao and you will see what I mean. I also loved their barbecue pork buns. The filling was perfect for my taste. Egg tarts were baked fresh and very tasty as well.

My recommendation:

- Har gao
- Shu mai
- Barbecue pork buns
- Egg tarts

Note: if you're a huge fan of Shiaolongbao, go to Asian Legend. I was disappointed with theirs."}
{"text":"I always find the negative reviews amusing...the complaints that an all-day Dim Sum shop only serves Dim Sum...the \"tiny\" portions...which would seem to lend credence to the idea that those people are 500lbs and usually eat at all you can eat buffet's...my last bill here was $50 for two people and we walked out stuffed.

So...an honest review...

It's a lovely store...the service is not necessarily polished but they try and are lovely people...the Dim Sum is geared towards a western palate...if you want CHINESE go to Chinatown...I've taken a dozen people here and all but one enjoyed it and the one who did not is married to an Asian dude...

Personally, I think the place is a bargain...go a few times, pick out what they do well, avoid what they do not and you can eat for $20-$25 a person and leave stuffed...what more can you ask of a Dim Sum place?"}
{"text":"A lot of the comments that I had have already been covered by other reviewers, so I'll keep it to point form:

- nice decor
- small servings
- friendly service
- good selection
- expensive, but good quality dim sum

Liked: the duck pastry, the pork/chive/chinese olive dumpling and the baby pumpkin dessert.  

Didn't like: being charged for jasmine tea (come on, who does that? especially given that everything is already a bit high on the dim sum pricing scale). 

Summary: Don't go expecting to come away stuffed, but most of what you get will be tasty."}
{"text":"Pro: food is fresh, nice decoration, very quiet, good location

Cons: Very small portion, some dishes taste good, some are not good, average food and below, expensive compared with the quantity and quality provided, different prices on the menu outside the store and inside the store.

Go to crown pricess diner instead, you will thank me for this."}
{"text":"Their 2 stars come from decor and service.
The decor is very nice, traditional Chinese restaurant style that you'll see in a TV show. 

Menu comes, so many choices for lose leaf tea, AMAZING! I guess it is called tea house after all.

We ordered some dim sum and some dishes for dinner. About 6 between the two of us. The food portion was small, flavour was missing. Instead of sticking to the traditional Chinese food, they are being creative and inventive in a bad way. Quality also wasn't there, the short rib on rice dish we had, the short rib wasn't even tender. We also got their peking duck, where the sauce was a variation of oyster sauce instead of PK duck sauce. 

Overall, very unsatisfying meal. I felt more dissatisfied than when I was hungry. I got home and made nachos for myself. 

If you are someone who enjoys nice dining environment, friendly service and are not as picky as I am for Chinese food, this might be a good place for you!

{"text":"This is my absolute favorite dim sum place in the city. I have been there many times and it's the place that I prefer to bring friends who come in from outta town: \"you gotta try this place, best dim sum I swear\" kinda place. Some may disagree because they have their own favorites but no one leaves there questioning whether it deserves a spot on their list of favorites. My uncle came in from Montreal - and this is a guy who has never said a kind word about a restaurant in Toronto without adding \"but it's not as good as Place X in Montreal\" and he said it was the best dim sum he's ever had too.

The pieces are portions are small, delicate. the orders are carefully, lovingly made just for you. It tastes like heaven. Try the pork Sui Mai, salty base with a sweet slice of scallop on too and tell me it isn't among the best thing you've ever had.

EVERYTHING THEY MAKE IS GOOD.
So try it all."}
{"text":"I make a big goddamned deal about dining when I go out of town on business. I do my diligence, read up and occasionally ask for opinions. I'm usually right, if I can pat my own back. But then again I know what I like. 
I was really looking forward to staying in downtown Toronto. Under my own aegis, i have dined rather well in the great white north. Under the guidance of my pals there it has been hit and miss. This DimSum joint looked like it was just the right thing, so it became my choice for the day.
Well i was right--The place was fab fab fab. They sat me in a tight little 2-place booth which didn't give me the kind of real estate I like for a DimSum feed, but that wasn't reason to carp. 
I had all the requisite golden oldies you usually order for DimSum, and i have to say the flavors were fresh and quality was high. Service was a little surly, but what the hell, it usually is in a DimSum situation. My only gripe is that I could not get a refill on my water or Diet coke. 
The charge card machine was on the fritz, and I was lucky I had enough Canadian cash to pay the tariff, which was bit dear to tell the truth, but in line with the quality."}
{"text":"The price is a bit pricy for me but overall everything was good. Im quite happy with the food and service at Cha Lau. Recommend for who want a less crowed restaurant to try dimsum."}
{"text":"Every time I go back and forth from the YMCA I see this place with 'Dim Sum All Day' written all over the glass. And I love Dim Sums! So today I finally stepped in for dinner and was greeted by a really sweet lady (the server). 

We tried the Singapore Noodles, Shu Mai, Ha Gau, Mushroom Dumplings and some Pork Dumplings. The noodles was really good, very flavoursome and not oily at all. Our favourite dim sum was the Shu Mai, it was bigger in size than what gets served at most places. The service was really good and the green tea was refilled regularly. 

Our total bill was $31 which is not very cheap but ok if you go dutch. 

If you are too lazy to go to Chinatown for dumplings this might satisfy the craving."}
{"text":"The last time I went, Cha lau didnt have a liquor licence or take credit/debit yet, but unfortunately, thats not their biggest downfall. 
Maybe I was thrown off when I quickly walked by only seeing the word 'Cha' and the overly asian decor. I was excited for a good bubble tea place in my area, but boy was I wrong.

Cha Lau does all day dim sum, but unlike Rol San or Noble, it seems like all they do is dimsum. Without a dinner menu, for four people, we ordered around 12 items. Each item ranged from about 3-6$ each, a reasonable amount to be paying for dimsum in the area (or so we thought). Blanket statement for every dish we ordered, nothing was more than 2/3 of the size it should have been, or we expected it to be. Think Har Gaos about the size of a Toonie, and Stir fried singaporean noodles on a Guu-sized side plate. 

Items that I would order again: 
Har Gao (the skin was thin with the right amount of chewiness). 
steamed bbq Pork Buns - I could never handle the amount of 'bun' involved in bbq pork buns, so I was actually thankful for the cutesy sized portions of this dish.
Fried octopus tentacles - These are done without batter, and come with a nice side of chinese seasoned salt. Fragnant without being over powering

Never agains: 
- Duck pastry - what duck? 3/4 pastry, 1/4 filling, and when i got to the filling, there was barely even a hint of duck flavour.
-  Rice rolls - The dough was smooth, but again skimpy on the filling where all I could taste was soy sauce and white pepper.

Sidenote: they need a dinner menu!!"}
{"text":"Went on a quiet Sunday 1:00pm.

Ordering to getting food took quite a bit ~20 minutes on our first order. Dim-sum was adequate, but not great. Liked the leaf wrapped sticky rice.

Pretty reasonable, $35 after tax for two people (about 7 dishes and tea). But that being said did not knock my socks off."}
{"text":"Amazingly beautiful interior, especially for the gross-potential that intersection has.

Everything we had was good.  Temperatures on the food were correct (I'm pretty picky about my hot food coming out really hot).  My favourites were the fried sesame balls and the mango/shrimp roll.  Water glasses were refilled without having to ask.  We asked for hot sauce and the waitress had no idea what we were asking her; so for some of their wait staff, there is a language barrier.  

Overall, everything was good, but the portions sizes are the main downfall.  Although I don't really need huge portions of things, if you're in a bigger group than 3 people, you'd have to order a whole lot to actually reach Fulldom."}
{"text":"Environment is very good. Interiors are very cute and dedicated. However, food quality is really disappointing. BBQ bun is too soft. When I took it with my chopsticks, it fell apart. Spare ribs are too oily. All bones. Not much rib meat to eat. Cheung fen is also very soft and sticky but not chewy enough. 
Really really slow!! Not even serving slow. It took a while to bring up the bill. maybe we didn't order the right food. Will not go back"}
{"text":"Took my friend Lil here for her Birthday dinner 

Nice place - very authentic and relaxing decor with tables set very nice and big nice booths. Loads of seating throughout the place. It would have been nice to sit close to the windows but it was a little too cold out and a little drafty there. No biggy, we sat at a great booth.  

We ordered tea and sake.....to warm up ! yummy - love sake and this one was very mild with a nice flavour. 

The menu has a vast variety, (wish there were photos on the menu though), it was a bi-fold order form and you checked off the items you wanted.  Later we saw the real menu on the table wrapped in a wood matting (which looked like a rectangular hot plate coaster) and it had item explanations which later became a little more helpful as to what each item was. 

We ordered about 8 dim-sum items and BBQ dumplings were great !!  The steamed bak-choy with roasted garlic was very very nice ! The crab craw was a little too much breading and no real flavour, but once you dipped it in mustard or chili sauce it was great  !  

There were a couple items that were not to our liking but overall I would go back here,   But with that being said, $65 + tip for two people is kind of pricey for dim-sum."}
{"text":"I have been here three times. The food is excellent, the decor is great and the service is friendly. This is a great downtown Chinese option - obviously not comparable to some of the Markham, Richmond Hill authenticity - however, this is a great place. I generally love to go with groups to order more items - have tried a large portion of the menu."}
{"text":"The best thing about this place was the thinly sliced scallop on top of the Har Gow. And they charged for tea. I could eat the same amount for at least 10 dollars. We ordered two shrimp cheung fun which is decent, two har gow, and one shiu mai. All for 30 plus the 2 dollar charge for tea. Everything was decent but I could go to Dragon City for half this cost."}
{"text":"My friend Cynthia treated me to a birthday dinner here a few months back. 

The food was fair to good, some items were tastier than others, but overall I can't really find fault with the place (except maybe the $).

We ordered about 7-8 items, and the bill was about $65-$70  - for DIM SUM, this could be due to the location being on Yonge Street.

Our server was friendly and took the time to explain the menu to us, as it was riddled with spelling errors (Crab Craw), but we managed to figure most of it out with her help and some creative guesswork.

The steamed pork buns were delish and the sake was nice and warm.  I'd go again."}
{"text":"Unless you have a stomach the size of a golfball or you're extremely bored and have so much cash to burn that you're literally burning it during your downtime, DO NOT GO TO CHALAU.

Seriously, save yourself the overhwleming sadness and disappointment you will feel when your meal is brought to you and you wonder if you've gone blind, because the portion sizes are so small you can't see it.  Okay, obviously this is an exaggeration, you can see it, but the sadness and disappointment will still be there. 

My co-workers tried to warn me, but my stubborness and lack of good dim sum options in the yonge/college area persuaded me to go.  Sadly I did not go alone, I had to take a good friend down with me for the most miserable dinning experience ever.  We left confused and extremely unsatisfied.

My favorite dish : fried chicken taro dumplings were smaller than golfballs.  The young chow fried rice came in a bowl that you is used to hold gravy at Thanksgiving dinners.  The only thing that was served in a manner that I was used to was the Nestea that I ordered.  Thankfully they did not manage to shrink the cans.  But everything else was miniature.  I did not feel like I had dinner, just really over-priced appetizers.  The bill came to about $31.58 for 6 dishes, but again I stress, that they were super tiny dishes.  I cannot believe they have the audacity to smile at me while serving me food made for tiny people.  Oh and the hovering......so annoying.  I can't go to anymore chinese restaurants, where the employees are so afraid of losing their job that they eyeball you during your whole meal so they can rush over and remove your dish as soon as you finish with it or even before in some cases, anything to look busy and useful, pleasing their employer and pissing off the customers. 

This could also explain why the place was empty when we walked in.  I chalked it up to the fact that it's a Thursday night or maybe word had not spread yet, or maybe it had and that's why all the empty seats. 

Chalau, you need to spend less money on decor and more money on the food.  I don't care if you serve me with paper plates on plastic table coverings (love these btw), just don't mini-size my dim sum.  You've got the quality down pat (oh yes, I should mention everything was fresh, but fresh air would have been just as satisfying and free), just unshrink the food, lower your prices and your business will bloom."}
{"text":"This place was utterly one of the worst places ive ever been to literally. The service was absolutely terrible and the food was sub par. When we went in there was only 2 other tables in the whole place. The server that was serving us was so rude. when she came over to ask for our drink order we hadn't looked at the drink menu yet and told her we needed a minute and she rolled her eyes an took the menu away from us. We asked for it back and she huffed around. Not to mention when we got our food we saw her sitting a couple booths behind us eating her food and we wanted hot sauce. So i kind o stood up in the booth and looked at her and she put her head down more as if to hide from me! so then i got out of the booth and said \"excuse me\" and then she came over but acted as if i was burdening her?!?!? like WTF. Then we had some other server we asked for something and she was so rude to us to and blatentley ignored us. It was just aweful because they also forgot a couple things that we ordered. I was just not impressed i with this place and will never return."}
{"text":"Excellent Dim Sum all around!  One specialty that is my favorite here is the Spicy Tofu. The chicken feet are also excellent. Every item is flavorful, hot, and high quality. The decor is dark which is one of my only complaints. If you are looking for good dim sum downtown Toronto, I highly recommend checking it out."}
{"text":"I dropped by this place with two friends one day randomly as we were walking down Yonge. 

The decor was nice so we went for it. When we ordered we realized that the dumplings were quite small and as such had to order quite a few dishes. The shrimp was really good but most of the meat was mediocre at best. Overall we ended up with a bill close to $100. With tips we ended up playing $35+ per person and to be honest it was not worth it. I have had better Dim Sum at much better prices."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff and clean environment. But the food is just too small portion and not tasty at all. DO NOT ORDER FRIED BLACK SESAME BALLS!!! They taste nothing like real dim sum at all."}
{"text":"Great interior, clean and quiet.  Food is colourful and well presented.  Good deep fried stuffed chicken wings, recommended."}
{"text":"I came here because of the unique idea of having Dim Sum at night. When first walking in, the interior is nice and the staff is pretty good. The food is definitely really good and tasty especially the Shu Mai and other numerous types of dumplings. However the only downside here is the price. Small portions of food w/ a very expensive cost is disappointing. But overall this place is alright."}
{"text":"GO TO CHINA TOWN IF YOU WANT GREAT DIM SUM. Seriously that sh-ty looking Forest dim sum or whatever the name is on Dundas is your haven for dim sum. Cha Lau is an overpriced trap, but if you don't mind the price and hate Cantonese-speaking waitress, this place will serve you just fine. But again, foodies, go to China town"}
{"text":"Came here at noon on a Sunday. The place was mostly full. The interior design and their cutlery choice was very tasteful. The service was good for consistently filling up the teapot for us and food came at a reasonable pace.

We ordered 
- bbq pork buns - was good but kinda soft
- Shirmp dumpling - yummy
- beef tripe - average but decent 
- chicken mushroom congee - really good! 
- fried squid - well cooked, flavourful 
- mango pudding (baby koi fish shaped.. ) - super small and wasn't that good  
- Peiking duck from chef's recommendation- was good but the portion was soooooo small there was literally one slice of duck, one slice of cucumber wrapped in thin layer of thing thing you wrap peiking duck in for $5.50 not really worth... 

In total we spent about $45 dollars for 2 people.. Overall I give it a 3 star for the decent taste but this place is not worth the money for their super small portions. Not coming back here for dimsum again though."}
{"text":"Never ever go back to this place! Small portion. Tastes bad. Have to pay 13% tips even if the service is bad. Japanese style environment. OMG are you sure you are serving Chinese food? Okay, probably just Canadian Chinese food. If you want to try the real yummy Cantonese dimsum, definitely not this place. Try scarborough or markham"}
{"text":"Not bad.  Everything is really small n tasted okay.  Nothing sticks out as bad or great.  Okay dim sum."}
{"text":"On a Sunday before a holiday Monday, it can be difficult to find a restaurant you want that is open.

So tonight we ended up at Cha Lau for dim sum and I felt they deserved another star.

The Hargow (shrimp in opaque wrapper) and the Siumai (pork dumpling in wrapper) which they top with a thin slice of scallops were both top notch.

The steamed spareribs with black beans were addictive, the black pepper beef pot stickers are a specialty we have not had elsewhere and are so good.

The chasiu (Chinese BBQ pork) Bao is smaller than usual but the filling is just as big so a much better filling to bun ratio!

The steamed greens are perfectly tender, and I prefer them plain so they served the garlic sauce (or oyster sauce) on the side.

The sticky rice in lotus leaf again, was smaller than average, but again you end up with a greater chicken to rice ratio.  

Excellent service too. 

Hands down the tastiest dim sum downtown, and considering it takes at least 45 minutes to get to Markham these days the slightly higher prices for the quality are worth it."}
{"text":"Overpriced for such small quantitiy."}
{"text":"A good 3.5

Dumplings are fresh, service is fast and attentive. Dumplings are OK but not woahhh, relatively small to my taste, and they tear too much apart when you lift them up with the chop sticks (thus you often have to eat the dumpling sheath first, then the filling separately). 

I would be OK to go back, but will not rush there."}
{"text":"Hmmm, how very odd. I have written a review for this place previously but it seems to have disappeared completely despite that I recall seeing it posted. Anyway, In Toronto, there are tons of great places to eat. This is not one of them, the portions are small, they charge you for tea and the prices are high. There is so many better places to go for Dim Sum. The only positive thing I can say about this place, is that they didn't charge me for the dish I found the short, black curly hair on. 
You're best bet for Dim Sum is to eat elsewhere"}
{"text":"Gotta agree with Emily's comment up there: If you ever experience anything that's not completely satisfying, DON'T EVER try to talk to them about it. It'll become a hostile show down for real - I learned it the hard way. Nice decor, but nothing else really aligns with that.
TL;DR:
Decor: 5 (for a dim sum place)
Food: 3
Service: 2 (as they NEVER crack a smile) and negative once you try to talk to them"}
{"text":"BOTTOM LINE: Beautiful decor and a solid dim sum spot, especially in this part of town. 

Cha Lau Dim Sum fills the all-day dim sum demand on this strip of Yonge where your other options include either trekking to China Town or paying a premium at Lai Wah Heen or Crown Princess.

The decor is beautifully furnished on the inside with dark wood finishes, classic Chinese art and tea pots and nicely embroidered seats. Attention to detail is evident as the menu is bound in cute bamboo covers and even the table ware is more refined than your typical Chinese resto (individualized chopsticks holder, actual porcelain teapots and not the ugly steel ones, etc.).

The dim sum offerings covers your typical dim sum offerings and doesn't try to re-invent the wheel. The prices range from $3-5 per dish and are generally well done, albeit with somewhat smaller portions than you might expect. 

Highlights: 
-Shrimp dumplings (it passes the universal test of any dim sum place's worth), 
-Chicken and Japanese mushroom dumpling
-BBQ duck cheung fun. 

Lowlights:
-BBQ duck pastry (too sticky and not enough duck)
-Ham siu gok (whilst tasty, was much too small)
-Siu long bau (aka the pork soup dumplings weren't soupy enough).

Overall, we ended up ordering about 10 of their items and enjoying most of it. If you're downtown and ever get a dim sum craving, I'd recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"Was in here few days ago, Ordered the bamboo steam rice and bau bum, the steam rice one the bamboo was no flavor and bau bum was too sweet, none of the flavor are original has been changed to American way, also the waitress was so rude, we wanna ordered another food so we told to the waitress but she didn't answer yes or no, just walked away and so on so on, so we told to the manager who is an male old man we don't want this waitress to service us, but didn't work, and the whole restaurant speaking Cantonese, so we even know they were mocking us or speaking something bad because they didn't serviced well.

If waiter and waitress can't smile to the customers and response how should I give you tips and good review??"}
{"text":"We had seen the place before but never bothered to check out and were surprised to discover a gem in plain sight. The place has floor to ceiling glass windows that look out east on Yonge Street. Running east west the place is long and narrow and decorated like a little dark Chinese jewel box. The outside gives no indication of what lies inside. It is really beautiful and precious. There are a selection of booths running along one wall, giving diners lots of privacy and intimacy, and a waiters station running down the middle of the restaurant. On the other side of this are more tables and behind them a beautifully crafted shelving system that features lots of Chinese inspired decorations. At the back of the restaurant is a Chinese screen that is backlit, again creating a pretty atmosphere. 

The menu featured a diverse selection of dim sum dishes, some expected and some not. Each arrived beautifully plated showing lots of thought behind the design, display and the choices of food and dips. The food was as delicious as it was beautiful and left us impressed with the restaurant. Sadly, we regretted ignoring the place for so long, after discovering this gem hidden in plain sight."}
{"text":"Do not go here.

First of all, it smells like a dirty toilet as soon as you walk in. It immediately takes your appetite away. It was so bad I almost turned around and walked back out but they waitress already came over and ushered us to a table. 

They charge you for tea, where 99% of other Chinese restaurants provide you with complimentary tea. The portions are TINY, and are expensive. I wouldn't have minded the small portion and high prices if the food was actually good, but it was less than average. 

I don't even know how this place stays in business, or even has return customers that can stand the awful smell."}
{"text":"Worst place for dim sum, especially for the price you pay. Take a street car into Chinatown and you're way far better off. The ha gou and siu mai were ok, forget about the Shanghainese dumplings - downright the worst I've ever had. The turnip cake was mushy and don't get me started about how bland their BBQ pork fried rice was. I couldn't eat anymore of it because I could hardly find the minuscule cubes of pork.

The staff were polite and service was fine. I'm just thrown off by how terrible the food was for that price. 

Don't waste your time and especially your hard earned dollars on this place. Save a buck and go to Wendy's across the street."}
