{"text":"Great Cheap \"Canadian\" Chinese Food.
Have not Tried their Vietnamese or Thai dishes.
This is not fine dining, but for cheap take-out they are my new go-to place."}
{"text":"My daughter picked up noodles from here today, they smelled awful and rotten, even the chop sticks smell moldy 
Don't wast your time or money here"}
{"text":"Delivery was fast, food mediocre but my PHO order didn't come with garnishes not cutlery or sauces...small details make a difference."}
{"text":"Very average food. The soup base is not rich enough. Ingredients are of very all size almost mini and look like cheap product."}
{"text":"Ordered general tao chicken with fried rice and an egg roll.. The meal was okay but not the greatest tasting. The egg roll was bit burnt and hard, so I had to drop one star off my review for that.

The place has some seating area and seems okay overall. The food is similar to the other chinese place nearby on Dufferin street. Would I go back here ? Probably not."}
{"text":"To me, it's your typical \"choose 1, 2 or 3 item\" Chinese fast food restaurant. It's fine and exactly what you'd expect. My preference is to order an entree outside of the lunch special menu so that it's prepared hot and fresh. I'm a fan of their General Tao (Tso) Chicken. Parking is abundant if you can find the place, (it's located at the side of a commercial building, partially hidden from view from Dufferin). I see that they offer Pho here, but from the fact that it's the only Vietnamese menu item, I'll stick to the Chinese fare."}
{"text":"I had dinner here with my husband recently.  The street address is Dufferin Street but the entrance is actually on Orfus Road.  So it's a great place to grab a bite after shopping all the outlet stores on Orfus Rd.  

I had the Combo D, which was Spicy Crispy Chicken, stir-fried noodles and vegetables all for $6.95.  My husband had the General Tao Chicken on fried rice ($7.25).

The Spicy Crispy Chicken is battered boneless chicken pieces, deep fried and tossed with some spices (mostly salt, garlic and chili peppers).  It's dry, not covered in sauce/gravy.  It was hot and crispy, and a little bit spicy, but I found it way too salty.  If they went easier on the salt, it would have been excellent.  I liked that the vegetables (broccoli, peppers, carrots, bok choy and cabbage) were not covered in oil/grease.  I think they steam them and then toss them in a tiny bit of oil on the wok.  The noodles too were not oily/greasy like at most Chinese restaurants.  I liked that I didn't feel disgusting after eating here (like I do after I eat at places like Manchu Wok, Tiki Ming, etc.).  

I had a bite of my husband's General Tao Chicken.  It was delicious.  The sauce was more sweet than tangy, and it didn't have an overpowering hoisin taste to it like it does at some restaurants.  I was a fan.  The fried rice is just plain fried rice, no vegetables in it.  

Overall for the price this place was great.  You order at the counter and when it's done they let you know and you carry it to your own table.  The staff are very nice and pleasant.  The place is small and a bit dingy, but whatever, the food is good, fast and cheap!

It's in a strip mall so lots of free parking."}
{"text":"Bad.. ordered thru uber eats. 

The food came with gravy spilt all over my items...one dish seaping into the other. I couldn't even open  the bag without juices falling all over the place. So messy...they could have sent with a lidded container. I asked for cutlery for 4 ppl. None was provided. 

I don't know how they expected me to eat. After all the trouble...the food was bland. The eggplant dish I ordered barely had eggplants..more onions and red peppers. Ordered the shrimp tom yum...was not even tom yum style. Just a sour broth with frozen vegetables and 2 pieces of shrimp.

Ordered black bean shrimp lo mein and they were stingy with the shrimp. And no noodle. Isn't lo mein a noodle dish? At least what Google Image shows me. Did I mention most of the black bean sauce trickled on to my crispy chicken alternating the taste. 

Never. Never  never ...I don't care what Peter Pan says. Never again.

JUST BAD."}
{"text":"fast food chinese. Got the wonton soup and broth was weak and used vermicelli noodles instead of the expected egg noodles. Bleh."}
{"text":"Food was good. Price is cheap. SERVICE was great. I enjoyed my experience here  no complaints"}
{"text":"Location: top of orfus road. Parking lot for customers

This place does have seating however it is small and the atmosphere is more of a take out place. 
Interior does need some updating. 

Prices are good for the portions. 
Think pacific mall take out on the second level. Very similar. 

The gentlemen at the till was new and very friendly. 

Food timing is really good so you don't have to wait long. 

I like to come here when I'm in the mood for Chinese take out as the portions are good for sharing. 

They also have several drinks on hand including mango which I love! good alternatives to pop."}
{"text":"Wasn't great - I'm not a huge Chinese fan to begin with but I found the food very bland and mediocre. Price + delivery was good through justeat... no fortune cookies :("}
{"text":"I was far away from home, and in a land filled with discount box stores waiting to go to a super cool event down the block at Rinx. I was starving, and this was the first place I saw on my walk. 

I heard rumors I was only a few hundred paces from Katz's Deli, but I couldn't risk it. In I popped for some cheap Chinese take out. 

This place is dated in time, which often makes me scared it's really dirty. Very serious artwork of horses running and \"We Prosecute Credit Card Fraud\" decorated the wood paneled walls. 

I hesitantly ordered my dinner and my pal's dinner to go. It came to $15, and we were both pleasantly surprised. I had the spicy chicken combo, she had the veggie combo, and neither of us were MSG laden afterwards, and their steamed veggies were the tops. If I worked in this box store abyss, this would definitely be a lunch staple for me."}
