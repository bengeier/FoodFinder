{"text":"Horrible customer service. I ordered chicken fried rice, beef and broccoli, general tao chicken as I always do. I picked up my order got home and the containers are half full of meat/rice. They cheated me by putting the rice in the same beef and broccoli container and did the same with the general tao chicken. When you eat there the portions are good for h e 12-14 you pay per plate. I called back to ask what happened and the excuse was I'm new here and you didn't tell me to separate the rice from the meat. Little things like this upset me because the knowingly do it to give you less meat/chicken but the price stays the same. Be careful and open your containers when you order as they are dishonest with portions for take out"}
{"text":"Great place for Chinese food on the south shore. Their peanut sauce is amazing, and the noodle dishes are reliably good. Dishes are also good value as there are always leftovers you can take home. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Une des pires expériences: 1) 1 heure d'attente pour être servis - restaurant débordé avec trop de commandes pour emporter un samedi soir, les clients dans le restaurant passent après; 2) les dumplings commandés sont vides et composés seulement de pâtes avec sauce à l'arachide; 3) odeur persistante de graisse de cuisine qui colle aux cheveux et vêtements; 4) service désintéressé et donc comme le plat principal n'arrivait toujours pas (poulet général tao) après plus d'une heure, nous sommes partis et ne reviendrons jamais."}
{"text":"Called to order a general Tao, very bad attitude, feeling like i am not a client but someone who is begging food. Was a regular with them but not anymore."}
{"text":"Ah Golden Bowl. I affectionately refer to this restaurant as Golden bowels, because that greasy Chinese food will you know... Make you poo gold. Look don't read too much into it ok? It's a nickname, can we just move on?  The significance of GB is that they deliver. They're pretty quick, the price is pretty good and the quality has been very consistent over the years.  I usually order the spicy shrimp noodles, salt and pepper tofu and orange beef.. The steamed fish is pretty good too.  I don't like eating there for some reason. It's all about delivery. Cash only."}
{"text":"never going back! we've waited 50 min for our entree (cheap spring rolls) then another 45min for our cheap chinese food plates.. the waiter had no explanation for us, the little waitress was pouring water every time we were taking a sip, we felt really uncomfortable and disrespected. were done, going to the cash the cashier tried to steal 50$ from us telling that she gave us our change back but she actually never did anyways.. in other words if you respect yourself please do not go there"}
{"text":"This is the epiphany of fake Chinese food that reminds me why I tend to avoid Asian food in Montreal. Don't get me wrong, I love shareable sub-$10 plates with huge portions. But the food was so covered in starch and gelatinous sauce that we didn't even bother taking out the half-plates that we couldn't finish. Our first impression of the Salt and Pepper Pork Chop was \"hey that General Tao chicken is mighty heavy!\" (the general tao chicken we ordered arrived later it turned out). A few pieces of the glucose-heavy deep fried meat spelled game over for me, so we were quickly moving on to the MaPo Tofu. It was neither \"ma\" nor spicy, probably the worst attempt at MaPo Tofu I've ever tasted but at least it was edible. There's a limit to \"mild\", at some point it just becomes lifeless.  I noticed that the majority of plates coming out of the kitchen were one kind or another of General Tao [insert your meat]. Not to be confounded with actual Chinese cuisine."}
{"text":"Wanting a quick meal I stopped by this restaurant that seems to be very busy with take out orders.  I ordered a Pad-Thai to be safe and a friend ordered the Singapore noodles.  This was the worst pad Thai I've ever had. The overpowering smell of fish was disgusting. I asked for limes to offset the fish sauce and they brought me 3 shriveled dry limes that had at most 1 drop of juice left in them. I brought it up to the server and his reply was \"no exchange\". I said that I've had pad Thai hundreds of times at different places and I've never had it with this much fish sauce. The rude reply was \"that's how we make, if you don't eat you stirr pay\" I put it aside and shared the Singapore noodles with my friend. They were dry and not very good either, but it was edible. The shrimp tastes like it's been sitting on the counter for a month. You'll have suppress your gag reflex if you eat their shrimp.   I honestly don't know how this place stays busy. All I know is with the abundance of Asian restaurants available in Brossard I'll be avoiding this place."}
{"text":"Get a thrill out of finding foreign objects in your food?  Then Bol d'or is the place for you!  A few months ago my General Taos was \"peppered\" with small, sharp white fragments of plastic. Today, I found a strip of metal in my soupe aigre-piquant.  I wonder how many foreign objects I haven't found (i.e. I unwittingly ingested) while eating here. I won't be eating here again; it's simply too dangerous."}
{"text":"Ah Golden Bowl, or as everyone who knows me calls it \"Chase's favourite restaurant\"  I bring everyone I can to this place because its great. I'm vegan, and they have amazing spring rolls that are vegan, general tao tofu, vegetable fried noodles and more. I've been going here for years and I need my fix at least once a month!  Sometimes its super busy and it might take longer. Sometimes they cook the food too quickly and its not as amazing as it was the time before, but they always redeem themselves.  The owner of the place is usually always there and he is super friendly.  When I call to order, they know when I'm going to get and they know my name - feels great!  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"Un must !!! Vraiment le top pour ce qui est du général tao! la bouffe asiatique est leurs spécialité ."}
{"text":"Great place to eat when you are starving but the quality of the food is okay. Their best dishes involved mostly Cantonese dishes, I would avoid Vietnamese dishes.... I ordered once and I didn't finish it. Overall, the staffs are very nice and the wait is not too long for your food to be ready."}
{"text":"I've been coming to this place for years, or rather, ordering food for take out as it is extremely popular among the locals and simply delicious!  It's a really small restaurant that does have some seating area but it feels extremely cramped if you stay there. The kitchen is also out in the open so you can see the chefs tossing their woks flames and all as well as smell the food as you sit for your meal. Most people come in, give their order and when it's ready - usually 15-20 mins- take it to go.  They have a variety of options ranging from Chinese/Cantonese, Vietnamese and Thai dishes along with your western classics like eggrolls and general tao. If you're familiar with asian cuisine and would like a different noodle type or sauce that's not listed, they can probably cook it up just the way you want it. My Asian mom would often come in and chat up with the cooks and get a special dish that isn't listed on the menu.  Prices have increased a little in the almost 10 years that I've been going there, but it remains cheap. Just to give you an idea, my favorite dish, the \"Yang Chow\" fried rice used to be around 6 $ back in 2003, and every year it seems to increase by a dollar.  Portions are very big. This is the kind of restaurant where it is best to order  at least 2 or 3 plates and share.  As per many asian or small businesses I noticed, this place accepts cash only."}
{"text":"Low on money and feeling hungry? Golden Bowl is the place to go. The menu is big and so are the portions. You will definitely feel full after your meal. The food is on the greasier side but who cares when you're hungry right?"}
{"text":"12 novembre 2012 Un petit dimanche bien traquille. Je suis un habitué de ce petit coin asiatique toujours à la hauteur de mes attentes. Une excellente cuisine généreuse toujours à la hauteur des origines chinoise fast-food bien connues par les québécois. Le service est parfois lent, et débordé par la clientèle, il faut donc choisir son heure de commande pour éviter les périodes trop achalandées. En bout de ligne on y revient pour une fringale ou tout simplement pour se faire plaisir :-)  November 12, 2012 A nice smooth sunday. I'm used to buy take out from them, they 're always up to expectancy. An excellent and generous menu always in the line of traditionnal chinese fast-food well known by quebecers. The service is sometimes slow depending on the time of day, so you need to choose your time if you need your order fast. Bottom line is .... you always come back to it for a snak or just to make yourself happy :-)"}
