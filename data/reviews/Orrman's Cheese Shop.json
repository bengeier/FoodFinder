{"text":"Grilled cheese sandwich is a pretty simple task you'll think, but so few know how to do it right. These guys master it and they give you the option to combine different types of cheese on a focaccia bread."}
{"text":"Rachel and her team are always so very nice and so helpful... happy to offer a taste, answer questions, and make suggestions. My husband is working in NY now and it is always one of the first places he wants to go whenever he is home. My favorites are the Fig and Honey Goat Cheese from NC's Goat Lady Dairy and Barely Buzzed (with lavender and espresso rubbed rind). His... all! Such a nice place to go!"}
{"text":"Consistently awesome, love to call them up and give them complete discretion, just set a general total price for 4-5 different cheeses and Rachel will put together a fantastic selection ready for pick-up.  Really interesting Farm to Table stuff that is soooo... much more interesting that the likes of HT or TJ, and much cheaper.  I've ordered quite allot of cheese from Murrays in my life and the product these guys get in is certainly on par.  The selection may not be as extensive but it's always rotating out so if you get the \"Cheese Need\" every month or so there's always great stuff to be had.  Locally owned business with informed caring owners that are commited to their craft.  Definitely worth supporting."}
{"text":"Amazing little shop with so much variety!  Ordered their raclette, ham and fig sandwich and it was delicious!  Definitely stopping by again!"}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Excellent selection, incredibly knowledgeable and friendly staff. Great place to go and grab a beer or glass of wine from one of the other vendors, sit at Orrman's bar and try some cheese. Definitely go on Thursday for raclette night!  The staff always has great suggestions. This place is the best place to buy and experience cheese in Charlotte."}
{"text":"We're lucky to have this place. Rachel impresses with her knowledge , taste, and connections in the food world. Seriously, this shop would be a raging success anywhere!   There's more to good cheese than smoked Gouda and this is the place to discover this intricate, delicious corner of culinary delights.   Take off your blinders, have a taste, and let the expertly curated selection open you up to an exciting world beyond cheddar, beyond mozzarella.  The charcuterie, the jams, the almond and peanut butters, the crackers- you can order any of them with confidence. This shop is an example of what the culinary scene in Charlotte needs- expertise and taste.   Thank you to Rachel and her dedicated staff!"}
{"text":"I thought I'd found my own little secret garden when I wandered through 7th Street Market and saw this gem a couple of years ago...   Originally, I'd come in for cheese... sometimes I was just buying for myself, but then I started coming when I wanted to put together a special cheese tray for a party or add to some charcuterie items... Rachel is always so extremely helpful... she's given me recommendations, let me try samples, and even given suggestions on how to serve certain cheeses, what to accompany them with, and on and on my praises go...  UNTIL TODAY!  I knew they had sandwiches and various lunch things, but I'd never tried them... I wandered in today and on the fly just picked up a ready made baguette sandwich... it was cooked ham and brie with sweet onion jam... the bread is crisp and fresh, the ham isn't salty at all, the brie is at the perfect temperature, and the jam... oh dear lord the jam... give me a jar and a spoon it's SO GOOD... I'm only half way done with it, and I had to stop to write this review.    Dear Orrmans... I think I love you!  Please never leave! Love,  Rebekah"}
{"text":"This review is for the cheese sandwiches only. I've been dying to try this place, and I'm sure their cheeses are great. However I find them to be a tad bit overpriced, so instead I tried one of their cheese sandwiches.    Cheddar, Gouda, pickles, mustard on sourdough... It can't be bad. But it wasn't great either. The bread was very dry and the insides were sparse and low on flavor.  For a tiny $7 cheese sandwich, I expected more. It wasn't bad; it just wasn't worth $7."}
{"text":"Delightfully pungent.    Only at a cheese shop would \"moldy\" or \"stinky\" be considered compliments.  Orrman's was one of the highlights of our food tour inside 7th Street Public Market. They offer a manageable selection of cheese with friendly and knowledgable connoisseurs to guide your palette.  Rather than stare at listing of descriptions or rows of displays, just describe a few characteristics that you enjoy and they'll find a close match.  Wished I could have tried a few grilled cheese sandwiches because they're quite reasonably priced ($5.00-$8.50).  A word of advice - don't leave the cheese in your car with closed windows.  [Original Visit: March 2015]"}
{"text":"I had the gouda pickle and mustard sandwich on sourdough and grilled. Yum. The storefront is small so it can get a bit crowded but the service was friendly and helpful. The setting, inside the 7th Street Public Market in downtown Charlotte is cool. Although there are lots of lunch options in the area, I would definitely go back for a gourmet grilled cheese sandwich."}
{"text":"Great little place tucked in the 7th Street Market. My review is for the sandwiches as I am not really a big cheese buyer/coonosier.  I am not a huge fan of your classic grilled cheese sandwich. I will avoid eating them at all costs. There is nothing appetizing to me about a slab of American cheese on some wonder bread. Luckily, you will not find any of that here!  I was going to opt for the prosciutto sandwich but I chose to try the special. It was cheese curd ham and pepper jelly on ciabatta. The sandwich was delicious! The bread was great quality. The rest of the ingredients were high quality as well. All of the flavors complemented each other well and made for one heck of a lunchtime treat. I think that the sandwiches are well worth the high price tag. I am excited to try the other sandwich next time. Service was friendly and helpful!!"}
{"text":"I had lunch at Orrman's today and it was outstanding.  Smoked blue cheese, cheddar and ham on a baguette with fig jam was a great combination; the baguette was freshly made and there was no skimping on the other ingredients.  I also had the coconut and cucumber soup; really tasty.  I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Wicked grilled cheese options delivered to your table in Seventh Street Market. I tried a grilled goat cheese and jam sandwich on brioche and just writing about it now makes my mouth water again. Reasonably priced, great service, will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Overall, having stopped by the Orrman\"s Cheese Shop on half a dozen plus occasions, I can say that I have been pleased. It's hard to not give 5 stars to such a purveyor of fancy cheeses and many other fancy products like pickled veggies, preserves and fancy peanut butter to only name a few of their auxiliary products. Prices are definitely at a premium, but then again at least it controls my cheese consumption to a degree, which ultimately curtails my cholesterol levels, so that I may live longer to eat more cheese.  My least favorite grilled cheese that I had was the one with the fig preserve because the figs overpowered the cheese and ham that were the other ingredients.  All other grilled cheeses have been very tasty and my only suggestion would be some different breads, as I believe that they use the same bread for all the sandwiches.  I may be wrong on that last statement, but it seems like I have always had the same type of bread....."}
{"text":"What can I say? I'm ecstatic. We have a cheesemonger in 7th Street Public Market now. That's right! Owner, Rachel, is knowledgeable cheese master hailing from the Chelsea Market in Manhattan. What a nice breath of fresh air this addition is to the market!  I was stoked to the shop being built out and ever more enthralled to see it up and running earlier this week! Stopped by to check out the quaint walk-up shop and we talked through some of her cheeses. She was just getting ready to slice into an aged Wisconsin Gouda and my eyes got wide. She sliced off a small piece and handed me a sample. Sold. I ended up scoring a decent sized wedge to bring home. Also, I got my hands on some delicious almonds near the register. A perfect addition to any cheese plate you'd like to concoct.   For those who appreciate fine cheeses, this should become your go-to in Uptown. Curated and sophisticated, but not out of reach for the cheese-craving commoners. Worth every second just to see all of those rounded and wrapped wheels of cheese!  On the flip-side, there are also tons of other items at the shop as well. Local jams, peanut butter, goods from Polka Dot Bake Shop, and other small items.   Welcome to Charlotte and welcome to the 7th Street Market, Orrman's!"}
{"text":"This is all the space you need to buy cheese if the selection every where were this good. From the spanish cheeses, to triple creme and bries.. This place has got it all. Get a loaf of bread from local loaf and walk 100 feet to this place and grab some cheeses, olives and cornichons."}
{"text":"Cheese! Glorious cheese!    My hubby and I finally went to visit the 7th Street Public Market to check it out and I was excited to see a cheese vendor! I heart cheesemongers...I secretly want to be one!     The cheese display is gorgeous and I have to remind myself to practice restraint. We had just purchased some beautiful heirloom tomatoes and I asked for a cheese suggestion and a washed-rind cheese called Quadrello di Bufala was recommended.  We had a little taste and I was instantly in heaven.....yes please, cut off a nice chunk of that for me, please :)    Everyone behind the counter is extremely knowledgeable - a huge plus if you're looking for new and different cheeses.    I didn't have a grilled cheese sandwich but I was tempted, the menu looked amazing.  I'm sure we'll be back for a sammy soon!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough positive things about Orman's Cheese Shop.  Today was my first time having one of their weekend brunch items.  I chose the \"French toastie\" which consists of ham, Kerry Gold Dubliner cheddar cheese, maple cream, ghee and sourdough bread.  AMAZING!!!! The outside of the bread had a sweet crispy glaze from the maple cream and ghee, and the ham and melted gooey cheddar was delicious....sweet and savory and perfect for a Sunday morning.  Besides their menu offerings, Orman's cheese shop offers about 40 selections of some of the best cheeses."}
{"text":"I decided to grab lunch here while wandering around 7th street market and discovered one of the best sandwiches I've had in a long time. The ingredients-- smoked mozzarella prosciutto and tomato-- were incredibly fresh and delicious. Service was fast and friendly. Price was reasonable for the quality of the food. 7th street market is a great atmosphere."}
{"text":"The ladies here were really so nice and helpful. This is a quaint little pop up shop with some interesting cheeses and fun little jams etc. I'm not sure this cheese shop is enough to keep me coming back to the 7th street market, but it was the best experience I had there. They had this buzz cheddar (espresso covered cheddar) that was pretty good so I bought some along with a very pungent elderflower cheese. Both were rich and tasty!! If I'm ever in that area again i'll stop by again and check their selection out!!"}
{"text":"Though an exact date isn't known, homo sapiens probably started making cheese soon after domesticating livestock around 10,000 years ago. This gooey, melty, herculean leap of human advancement is perhaps matched only by the invention of writing, beer, soap, penicillin, vaccination, and the Hubble telescope. So this place is not only a fantastic, but frankly, a necessary addition to 7th Street Market.  The 2 cheeses I've tried so far were absolutely addictive. I got a really sharp cheddar (great with Gala apples) whose name I regrettably can't remember and a mini wheel of goat cheese for my girlfriend's broccoli and goat cheese soup. Because the prices are a little on the steep side, Orrman's earns extra points for being generous with samples and a willingness to cut the package in half and sell just one wheel from a 2-pack. After all, with pungent goat cheese, a little goes a long way.  In addition to all the mouthwatering, velvety, some subtle, others downright funky cheeses, they have a decent selection of other things one might associate with cheese; the most important of which are the fresh baguettes. As far as I can tell, it's the only place in the market that sells them. And they're good baguettes too. As good as Amelie's, in fact. This alone is reason to stop by if you're in the market already. Because really, what's a market that doesn't sell baguettes?"}
{"text":"This place is such an awesome little cheese shop, so lucky to have it the market here in Charlotte. They have a good variety of various cheese and are more than willing to let you taste anything you ask for. They always have a few standard samples out as well. I love getting lunch here, just a quick sandwich and they have some interested flavors of chips! My favorite sandwich is the cheddar, gouda, mustard and pickles on sourdough. The owner is awesome and can pretty much answer any question you ask!"}
{"text":"There's grilled cheese sandwiches and then there's Orrman's Grilled Cheese Sandwiched. I recently enjoyed the smoked mozzarella with prosciutto and roasted tomatoes on toasted focaccia, while my son noshed on an aged cheddar on toasted whole wheat sourdough. In a word: FANTASTIC!!! This is more than a cheese shop with great cheesed... The sandwiches are a must try."}
{"text":"Had an awesome grilled cheese sandwich today in honor of National Grilled Cheese day!  I yelped to find just the right place, and Orrman's was highly recommended.  I had the special, that had gouda cheese, cheese curds, prosciutto and fig jelly  - it was perfectly browned, heated to be exactly the right degree of gooey-ness, and tasted divine!  Will repeat!"}
{"text":"Such a welcome addition to Charlotte. Rachel, the cheesemonger/owner, really loves what she does and it shows. It's always a pleasure to go in there and try something new and they are extremely patient while you are trying to decide. They encourage sampling and really know their wares. I love getting her e-mails and seeing what I'm going to buy for the weekend. Best(albeit small) cheese selection in the city."}
{"text":"I went to Orrman's and got their Raclette, rosemary ham, and fig jam on whole wheat.  I would give the sandwich a solid 4 stars, it was a very good grilled cheese and a pretty decent price.  The sandwich was made and served very fast and tasted very good.  Had I been in the mood for soup I am sure it would have gone fantastic with their soup of the day (butternut squash).  There are a lot of other amazing looking grilled cheeses on the menu as well, I will definitely repeat in the future to try some more of them."}
{"text":"The grilled cheese sandwiches here are amazing!  Additionally it is a great place to buy new cheeses to have as snacks or part of a dinner party at home."}
{"text":"Best grilled cheeses in charlotte. Not to mention the best specialty cheeses. Rachel and her husband, along with Nicole they're right hand lady, are all very knowledgable and helpful. They do weekly cheese and wine tastings with Sorting Table in the market! Ask them for details!!"}
{"text":"My husband and I just moved from DC to Charlotte two weeks ago and were unsure of what the cheese situation would be.  So we were really happy to find Orrman's not too far from our house.   We had friends come for wine & cheese over the weekend.  Normally we would have assembled the snacks ourselves but having just moved in, etc, we decided to give our selves a break and order the food from Rachel.    We ordered the cheese platter for 10 and added on some salami.  We were VERY happy.  It was on a cute recyclable, but sturdy tray.  We had a great assortment:  Carolina Moon Brie, Marieke Gouda, Prairie Breeze Cheddar and Chorizo with Sangievese and some of nuts, etc. Nothing on the tray was just there for garnish, everything tasted high quality.  The almonds were so crunchy & fresh that I need to find out where Rachel buys them. She also put some corn nuts on there that were a great texture change.  I love figs but don't usually like the fig cakes (?) served at cheese shops, this was the exception.  So very flavorful.  The artisan crackers were not my favorite.  But I anticipated that and we did buy a loaf of bread at the shop down the row.  We paid $63 for the platter for 10 people.  I have no basis of comparison in term of prices here in Charlotte.  But I will tell you that we were pleased with the result.  Meaning:  everyone LOVED the selection; we had 6 people eating and drinking for an  hour before heading out to dinner and had plenty of leftovers for the next day; and for us to recreate the same tray with the same variety, we'd have purchased way more than $63 of groceries.  Also, did I mention that Rachel came into the store on a Sunday so that it would be freshly prepared!  Exactly what a small business owner developing a clientele should do, but it doesn't mean I appreciate it any less!"}
{"text":"I discovered Orrman's 5 or 6 weeks ago and have driven in from Huntersville every weekend since. I love the selection and Rachael is absolutely great to help you try new things. Her selection of cheese and things to go with it are the best in Charlotte. The 7th Street Market is a fun place to go as well. I highly recommend Orrman's and will continue to try new cheese and enjoy my past favorites. I am so glad I discovered this shop and you will be too. Make the trip and support our local businesses."}
{"text":"Super knowledgable owner Rachel helped me figure out what cheeses I needed when I was indecisive and what they wet well with.  They were all excellent and my wine and cheese party was a success!!  So nice to finally have a true cheese shop in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Yum...cheese.  I have to tell you I had a chuckle when I visited because Ormans had a sign that it was national cheese month and one of the organic companies within the 7th Street Market had their own sign stating it was National Cleanse Month.  Kind of conflicting if you ask me, but I digress.  The main staple is obviously cheese and boy do they have plenty.  Cheeses of all kinds and tastes and I'm sure from all around.  The also carry crackers, honey and some cheese accessories if you will.  The service is extremely helpful and not bashful with samples to make sure you get the cheese you need and want.  They take their time to explain the history of the cheese and what it best pairs with."}
{"text":"Whether you are a cheese lover or cheese novice, this shop is for you. And here's ten Reasons you need to stop by Orrman's Cheese Shop: 1) Located at the 7th Street Public Market.  2) Their gooey grilled Cheese sandwiches will rock your world. The smoked Mozzarella with roasted tomatoes on focaccia bread ($8.50) is an instant classic, and the Gouda & plum chutney on sourdough bread ($6.50) will melt in your mouth.  3) Great cheesy goodness selections of local cheese (such as Chapel Hill, Una Alla Volta and Fishing Creek) and regional cheese.  4) Also, great selection of Tinned Seafood Plates, and Charcuterie Boards (all-natural salami) from Smoking Goose, Olympia Provisions, and Red Table Meats.  5) Tuesdays: $2 off all Tinned Seafood plates.  6) Wednesdays: $2 off cheese and (or) charcuterie boards.  7) Wine and cheese classes: Every 2nd Wednesday of the month ($25). You'll recieve 10% off any cheese purchases the night of the event.  8) Three-months \"cheese of the month\"club membership.

You don't need more reasons, do you?  Five Yelps"}
{"text":"I recently learned that Orrman's does Raclette Nights on Thursdays.  Melted cheese over boiled potatoes or bread and beef salami with gherkins?  Yes, please.  It's about $10 a plate but the plates take a while to get to you.  Moreover, if you order multiple plates, the first person may have finished their plate by the time the next plate comes out (you can't be polite and wait because the cheese will cool and harden).  The \"event\" runs from 4-8p, but it seems like they run out of supplies before 7pm.  They also have their normal offerings (pending availability) if you or someone in your party isn't a fan of raclette.  The location is mostly empty at this time, so it's fun.  This is especially true if you partake in the wine from the wineshop across the hall (about 20 feet away, really).  The one downside of the location being empty is that it is much colder than you'd normally find 7th Street Market to be--wear you winter coat cold.  But if you can put up with that, you're good to go."}
{"text":"Rachel, the owner, knows her cheese. Her medium-sized but extremely high quality and diverse selection at her shop makes every other cheese specialty place I've been to in town seem sub-par (here's lookin' at you, Whole Foods :-/ ).   I was recently turned on to Looking Glass Creamery of Asheville - they have amazing stuff, especially the Chocolate Lab washed rind cow milk - and was delighted to find that Rachel carried a good selection from there. But, in the end, she sold me on this unbelievably decadent Vermont brie called Moses Sleeper. The initial creaminess gives way to a rich nutty flavor, which ends on... I can't even fucking describe it. It's so good, I've run out of hyperbole.  Anyway, hats off to Rachel and her amazing shop. Also, be sure to check out some of the jams and what-not that she sells. I sampled the caramel - not cream-based the way I like it, but still very nice.  Ooh! Ooh! I forgot to mention the price - super reasonable for high-end cheeses. You really can't go wrong."}
{"text":"My first visit to this shop was such a pleasure.  I am interested in learning more about fine cheese, and was treated with respect and received the best guidance and advice from the young lady at the counter today.  I wish I had asked her name, as she was very informative with suggestions and tastings so we could choose our selection for our own cheese platter.  Will definitely be back to try another round.  The cheeses she recommended were wonderful, and we were thrilled with what we purchased.  Nice to know we have such a shop in Charlotte"}
{"text":"What a little gem of a cheese shop!  Very helpful staff that provides information about the origins, production and flavor profiles of each cheese.  They are personally familiar with each supplier and their production process and how their animals are treated.  They are happy to provide suggestions based on your pallet and will sample the cheese to be sure you like it before you buy it.  The Truffle Brie is a real standout!  They also sell charcuterie and complementary items like crackers & preserves and a heavenly fig compote.  We also ordered a amazing ham & cheese panini with the afore mentioned fig compote....delicious!  We will be back for sure!"}
{"text":"delicious cheese in cool environment.  definitely well educated foodie employees straight from brooklyn!"}
{"text":"While I've been a vegan for the last 2 years (largely due to GMO's and the industrialization of the food system--don't get me started) in preparation for our trip to Europe we are getting re-acclimated to dairy products. So only the best will do...no Sargento or Velveeta for us! I'm so thankful to have found Orrman's Cheese Shop thanks to you's Yelpers. The shop itself is located inside 7th Street Market Place so it already has a really cool vibe and atmosphere. A quaint and cozy shop with all kinds of cheezy deliciousness. There was a new staffer who had apparently been only working 3 weeks but she was already an expert in the world of cheese and helped us make selections for our cheese plate which was such a great value. You get two different gourmet cheeses, artisan crackers and a slice of fig and almond cake (which is not your typical American sugar cake...it is simply figs and almonds pressed together but oh-so-damn-good.) In addition to the great selection of cheeses they have the other normal accompaniments ie cheese utensils, jams, jellies, honey and cheese literature. Love love love!!!  *Make sure to bring your garage ticket for free validation*"}
{"text":"Apparently April is grilled cheese month. Really felt obligated to celebrate. Actually I've been wanting to try this place for a while but 7th St. Market is filled with so many good places it's hard to cheese. Boyfriends and I split the Croque Monsieur (weekend brunch special) and the prosciutto, mozzarella and roasted tomato. I would say one of the top reasons to be in a relationship is being able to split two different kinds of grilled cheese sandwiches.   The guy working was very pleasant and helpful. Def want to go back and buy fancy cheese sometime. I thought the Croque Monsieur was a little one dimensional but the prosciutto sandwich was absolutely delicious. It's almost $10 a pop for most sandwiches so a little pricey for the amount of food you get, but tasty!"}
{"text":"Cheese, glorious cheese. While you can find cheese at Food Lion, and an even larger selection at Harris Teeter, it's nothing on this place. There is no government cheese here (at least, I don't think there is - perhaps I just didn't make it to the government cheese section). There is just about any sort of cheese that you can imagine - and probably several you cannot. Beyond just buying cheese, you can actually get a grilled cheese. How cool is that?  If you want to expand beyond getting some pre-wrapped, American slices, and don't know where to go, you can even get some advice on which direction to go, so stop by, get a grilled cheese with some ginger ale and figure out what to serve at your next event."}
{"text":"This shop gets it - small space, smartly designed, giving the impression of full stock, lots of curiosities keeping your attention. In a half closed market on Sunday, the booth looks warm and inviting. They make grilled cheeses and cheese/charcuterie plates and sell all the accoutrement you might possibly dream to need. Lots of specialty jams, honeys, savory spreads, crackers and pickled veg. I bought a jam and a honey, tried a piece of cheddar. When I have cheese needs I'll know where to come!"}
{"text":"What is it about a grilled cheese? That ooey gooey goodness just seems to make everything better.  Orrman's is a cut-to-order cheese shop sourcing seasonal selections from small dairies. What does that mean? We're talking cheesemakers making the cheeses by hand. If you're hosting a party and want to impress your guests, come here and have them make you a custom cheese board. Don't be afraid to ask questions. Rachel and her staff are all so helpful and friendly.  Along with being a cheese shop, they also offer a small menu for lunch and dinner. Small, but well done. You can't really go wrong with any of the grilled cheese options. All of the sandwiches are created from the products on their shelves and cheeses in the case.  Personally, I always get the farro salad. I think it is so delicious. I usually get a soup as well. They are made from scratch and they source the vegetables from local farms.  Where to park: next door at the 7th Street Station deck. The market validates parking for up to an hour and a half. Just make sure to bring your ticket in with you."}
{"text":"This review is for the grilled cheese only - haven't had the pleasure of buying/eating the many cheeses here. I had the grilled cheese with gouda with walnuts and date jam. The bread was excellent (better than papiqueso IMHO) and the flavors were perfectly balanced between the salty/sweet components of the sandwich. The owner was friendly and helpful. I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Service is always friendly! Not a huge selection but big enough to provide good options. We've never bought cheese we didn't like. They also make grilled cheese sandwich"}
{"text":"My family and I have been going to the 7th Street Market every Saturday for most of the past year.  We usually hit Pure Pizza, Not Just Coffee, and Cloud 9.  A few months ago Orrman's Cheese Shop opened up in a little nook next to Pure Pizza.  Our family enjoys cheese but are by no means cheese connoisseur.  Everyone at Orrman's is friendly and very informative.... without being intimidating.  The cheeses are so delicious and addicting.  Orrman's is now one of our regular stops on our weekly pilgrimage to 7th Street Market and we look forward to learning about/exploring this new world of cheese."}
{"text":"This was the only place in the 7th street public market that I haven't tried so I decided to visit it for lunch today. Other than one or two meals a week, I stick to a pescatarian diet now (more inconvenient than difficult in case you're wondering). The sandwiches with prosciutto looked aaaaah-mazing but, alas, I went with the basic grilled grilled cheese on sourdough and a small bowl of tomato soup. Now, I typically don't like tomatoes but when I was a kid, my mom kept Campbell's tomato soup and grilled cheese on the dinner rotation so it's nostalgic for me. Boy, did this soup blow Campbell's out of the water! It was a thick bisque that tasted like a light marinara. It was so good and the small was huge. I couldn't even finish half of it. My sandwich was also great. The outside was crispy, the inside was gooey and it was piping hot when they brought it to me.   Overall, this was a great lunch!"}
{"text":"Some of the best grilled cheese in Charlotte. We got: The Raclette, ham, and fig jam The Smoked mozzarella, prosciutto, and roasted tomato The peanut butter and triple berry jam with goat cheese  All of them are absolutely delicious and I would highly recommend giving it a try next time you're at 7th Street market!"}
{"text":"Tried this place on part of an uptown food de tour. Tried an amazing goat cheese atop a fig bar and it was out of this world. Will try again for sure"}
{"text":"I had a bit of heaven for lunch in Charlotte today: Ham, goat, cranberry grilled cheese.  It was the best!  I am from NYC and had to stop by to see what all the rage was about with this sweet little cheese shop. It was worth it and more. I even left with a slice of Giselle sheep  Dutch hard cheese, yum.  They do gift baskets so watch out friends & family - here comes some special treats!"}
{"text":"I love Orrman's. Pure and simple.  Ever since the sweet owner, Rachel, set up shop up in the 7th Street Public Market, I've been a fan. Between acquiring off-the-beaten-path cheeses and accoutrements, and wolfing down gourmet grilled cheese sandwiches, there's no way to go wrong.  Today, I was in the neighborhood and decided to try the grilled cheese with pickles and mustard on sourdough. I had tried a tiny sample of this sandwich at Charlotte Rock City in June, and knew it was my next meal-time choice when I was close by.  Accompanied by McClure's spicy pickle chips and a Blenheim's Ginger Ale, I was in cheesy, pickle-y heaven.  Rachel also makes samples available if you're interested in finding out more about a particular kind of cheese.  As a cheese lover and absurd foodie, I can't recommend Orrman's enough. Go there."}
{"text":"Love this little cheese shop and cafe!  They make THE best sandwiches.  I could eat here twice a day and still want more."}
{"text":"Very nice addition to the 7th St Public Market.  As an aside - If you've not yet been to the market, they've reached enough mass with dining and vendor choices now to make it worth one's while.    Back to cheese...  Nice selection of cheeses and Rachel is very knowledgeable about her trade.  She is quick with the samples and also with recommendations.  I was into making some Blue Cheese Dressing this weekend and she recommended the Point Reyes Blue.  It was so creamy with nice veins of blue and just the right amount of \"tang\".  If you want good cheese explained to you in a professional way, Orrman's is your place."}
