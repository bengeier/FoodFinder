{"text":"I've eaten here twice so far, and both times the food has been excellent.  The first time was for lunch, take-away. Li took the time to come out of the kitchen to chat with me.  She says the menu (which includes rice dishes as well as noodles, and stir fries as well as soups) is a work in progress and will change according to what customers request. I chose ramen for the noodles, shrimp for the \"topping\" and soup for the \"style\" (you can do stir fry instead). It was really delicious; a light, delicate broth with lots of big shrimp and bok choy and other vegetables. Just thinking about it is making my mouth water!  Yesterday I went back with my husband, and we tried the appetizer seaweed (wakame) and squid salad. It was very tasty, and a large portion. The Singapore noodles dish was less dry than we've had at other places, and maybe could have been a little more spicy, but nonetheless very good.  And the soup - egg noodles with house special (shrimp, beef, mushrooms, vegetables) \"topping\" - was wonderful. I could live on Asian soups, and both of the soups I've tried at Li's have not disappointed me.  There are phos on the menu too, and Pad Thai, congees, and fried rice dishes.  And the daily specials (served all day) are very reasonably priced.  I can't wait to try them all!"}
{"text":"We've had lunch here a number of times and have never been disappointed.  I highly recommend the Raman stir fry noodles, or the fried rice. We usually get them with chicken. We always start with an order of fried dumplings and shrimp spring rolls, both are excellent. Service is always friendly and the food is always fresh and delicious."}
{"text":"Delicious noodle dishes and Asian food prepared fresh to order.  Since discovering this jewel, I've had lunch there every week.  I have enjoyed the Singapore curry noodle dish which is served with both chicken and shrimp with a kick!  It's delicious.  The Pad Thai is very good as well.  There is a daily  special where you pick your protein and chose your style such as:  Sa cha, Mongolian,  mixed vegetables etc.  served over steamed rice in a large bowl for only $6.95 ...I had the Sa Cha chicken and it was loaded with fresh veggies and it was amazing. Check this special place out!!!"}
{"text":"At first visit. The decor is nearly the same as the restaurant that was before it. Called \"the taste of Europe\" - IMHO that's a mistake but overlooking that the food is pretty authentic. My only \"problem\" would be they have a mix of Asian and I've grown to be not a fan of it. Imho if you're authentic Chinese you should cook Chinese food and not mix your menu with Japanese and Thai and Vietnamese."}
{"text":"Super disappointed in this joint. It wasn't as good as I expected. I got some spring rolls which were good, and the shrimp tempura was good but the noodle meal was really mediocre and I don't think I will be back."}
{"text":"Danger! Soup dumplings took 20 minutes to arrive raw and cold inside. The wrapper was thick and soup inside non-existent. I strongly suggest caution if you choose to eat here, raw pork is no joke."}
{"text":"My husband and I use Saturdays as a \"cheat day\" to splurge on whatever foods we want. This week we decided to try something different.  This is small restaurant with about six tables.  
   The appetizer options reminded me of your every day Asian restaurant choices. We ordered the green onion pancakes and chicken lettuce wraps. The green onion pancake was delicious. It wasn't the typical \"sweet pancake\" you sometimes find. This pancake was soft, savory and melt in your mouth.  The lettuce wraps were filled with fresh chopped vegetables and made to order. There was a perfect ratio of chicken to vegetable and was just what I was looking for. There was an added surprise of something crispy- to my surprise there were wonton noodles hidden amongst the vegetables. 
     There are Chef Specials to choose from and a \"build your own\" noodle section. Choose from pad Thai noodles, mai fun to ramen. The description or each noodle is off to the side if you're unsure what each type of noodle is made out of. Then choose your protein or do something different and order your noodles with wontons or dumplings and finalize your order specifying soup or stir fry. 
    My husband ordered the beef ramen stir fry and devoured the entire meal. There was a large portion of beef, mixed vegetables and of course noodles.  I ordered mai fun noodles (a thin rice noodle) with dumplings in soup. The noodles were tender and not over cooked. The vegetables were cooked just the way I like them. Cooked well but with a bit of a crunch. The dumplings surprised me. I was expecting a savory meat dumpling but instead I was met with a sweet meat dumpling with corn mixed in for an added crunch. Not what I was expecting but still quite tasty. 
     4 out of 5 stars for us. We'll be returning on another \"cheat day\" for more of Li's noodles."}
{"text":"We stopped in here one Saturday looking to try a new Chinese place. We had the lettuce wraps and spring roll appetizers. Lettuce wraps were good and fresh, but the spring rolls were just average. Our main courses consisted of DanDan and combo rice bowl. Let me just say that just DanDan order without an added spice level is very spicy to the point you can barely enjoy it. The rice bowl was ok , it lacked salt and was kinda bland. I like the idea that they offer a smaller menu and it's not traditional fast food, but not sure we will try it again."}
{"text":"I forgot to mention the Dan Dan is spicy - apparently too much heat for a friend of mine, LOL.

Tried the Pad Thai this time, it neither looked nor tasted like the traditional version, this one was a bit sweet and tangy, tasty!   I definitely prefer the ramen shrimp soup to their \"house special\" which to me was a bit bland.

Wish they'd delivered"}
{"text":"Just opened up a few months ago and we decided to try this place before heading home after an 8 hour road trip.   It's a new place so keep this in mind as my review is solely based on the FOOD and not the decor, garnish, service or anything else; these always get better in time with positive encouragement/critiques. 

The main courses are flavorful and come in generous portions, just a little more than enough unless you eat three times the normal human daily intake.  

We ordered the egg drop soup made in the TRADITIONAL way (it's not that slimy goopy thickened soup you eat at most take out places), their egg drop soup is thinner, more flavorful and with a good dash of white pepper.  That was a nice surprise, I gotta say I wasn't expecting that. 

We also ordered the soup dumplings, that's wasn't anything to write about really.... I didn't think they were made in house. 

The main dishes were well seasoned, balanced and full of flavor, I had the rice bowl with Tonkatsu chicken and the wife had the Singapore rice (curry noodles).   The tonkatsu arrived with some vegetables as well, in a flavorful semi sweet and umami garlic sauce that coated the grains of short grain rice blissfully. 

After scarfing down what we just ate and realizing we purposefully did not come here for the past few months so they can \"work out their kinks\", we now wish we came here earlier....and then felt compelled to yelp about it. 

Good food, good portions, great prices.  Will def come again; decent small town eats around the matthews/south Charlotte area. 

Sorry no pics, we ate them all!"}
{"text":"Causal and cozy. This small nook on the strip of businesses is worth a consideration or two (maybe three). Staff were polite, ensured we were pleased with our meals and that our beverages were replenished. The furnishing has that IKEA feel but comfort is what matters most. (I was surprised wooden chairs could be so comfy) 

Now, onto the food. 
As the name implies, Li's Noodles; what their menu consist mainly are.....

YUP! You've guessed it! NOODLES!! 

You can explore into a nice bowl of Hong Kong Wonton noodle soup. Venture down south with Thailand's Pad Thai noodles. Scoot on over to Vietnam with their pho noodles. But, that's not all! Don't forget some Singapore noodles or Japan's ramen! Essentially, Li's Noodle brings the different variety of noodles across Asia into their little shop for all to enjoy. 

Not much of a noodle fanatic? Don't worry your pretty little head. Li's have you covered with the option of rice dishes. Katsu anyone? I selected Katsu over the tough choice between the Hong Kong Wonton soup (one of my favorite). I've tried a few Katsu around the area and this one has to been the cleanest. The panko isn't too tough where it feels like shards of glass piercing into the roof of your mouth. The vegetables are nicely done with no overwhelming addition of oil. I've enjoyed it. Nothing too mind blowing BUT if you want something outside of the usual greased up food. Then it's a nice option. 

Speaking to the owner, she informed us her motivation with the restaurant. It's her attempt to stand out from the typical Americanized Chinese/Asian restaurant. I applaud her. So, stating this....you won't find any typical Chinese menu options such as chicken wings, skewers, hot and sour soup, egg drop soup, General Tso chicken, sesame chicken....(you get my point right?) 

If you want clean eating. Something to explore with. Give Li's a try. They have potentials if people allow them to expand. You don't have to be in love with them. If you want to keep an open mind and try the different types of noodles from Asia, then don't hesitate to stop by."}
{"text":"Li's has taken the place of Taste of Europe, which was here for a short while, and it looks like they did not do a whole lot to change the inside. The layout is essentially the same, and they did certainly put up a few coats of paint, which makes it look nicer, moving things from Eastern Europe to... somewhere. It might be Asia, it might simply be somewhere with a nicer decor. Regardless, the same smallish interior has not really changed much - a few tables is about all you'll see.

The night we were there, someone was working in back and someone else (I believe it was their son) was working the front. He didn't seem particularly interested, but he was friendly enough. Could have been because it was a weekend night and he didn't want to be working. Or it could have been because we were the only customers, so he was bored. Either way, he did a decent job getting our orders and that is about all that can be asked.

When it came to the food, most of the menu is occupied by a selection of noodles, and to those you can add vegetables and protein. That's pretty much it. Some of the noodles are the sort you get on a plate, similar to a Pad Thai, while others are more like a soup, such as a Pho. That's about it. They also have some appetizers, and there isn't a lot here, some rolls and lettuce wraps and the like.

Everything we tried was decent, but not stellar. Nothing especially memorable, and portions sizes were good for the price."}
{"text":"I am a Noodle Fanatic!  I was pleased when I drove by to see this new noodle shop.  I was happy to see that they offered noodles and Pho of all types.

I didn't know what to expect, but I figured I would try it out.    SO GLAD I DID.

Ultra laid back...no frills environment makes it comfortable to \"come as you are\" to a good dining experience.

This is NOT your typical Chinese restaurant where you order by number.  The food is NOT laden with MSG.

This is FRESH and FLAVORFUL food!   Warm and hearty for a cold winters night....yet not heavy at all.

It is a must try, yall.  I hope that our hood supports this business because It is just plain good!  

Give it a try, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"It seems like this food is very traditional oriented. It's not your classic American Asian food. It was not my style, way to much fat in the meat, and the broth was no to appitizing..not my cup of tea."}
{"text":"Tried Li's Noodles today for lunch when it caught my eye as I passed by on my lunch break. Had the chicken Pad Thai and it was very fresh and delicious!

I was expecting a different look and noodle for it but it had the same flavors as the pad thai I am accustomed to regardless.

Definitely plan to try out more of their noodle specialties!"}
{"text":"I don't normally write reviews but I felt like I had to say something. I had the daily special sacha with beef. It comes with steamed rice and vegetables (onions, carrots, zucchini, celery). Not sure if it was the sacha but the taste was bland and disappointing. Not to mention the portion was not worth the $6.95 price. Maybe I'll try one of their noodle dishes in the future since \"noodles\" is in their name--maybe they're actually better than the rice dishes. But I wouldn't do a daily special again."}
