{"text":"The food is great, the vegetarian options plentiful, the service friendly, the portions generous and the price is low. 

The palowrie balls were authentic to my memory of Guyanese ones, and the tamarind sauce was the best I've had in Canada.

And get the plantain. Even if you've only felt lukewarm about plantain in the past - get it, it's amazing."}
{"text":"Take-out joint.
Curries are good.
Dhal puri and roti are good.
Put them together and it is quite an amazing meal here.

I can't rate on service or decor, as service is pretty non-existent.

3/5 for food"}
{"text":"This might be the best Caribbean/Indian food I've had. It's a little stand next to the McDonalds in the Jane Finch mall.  It's very affordable. The rice and peas are excellent as well as the curries and roti. You can get other stuff here such as phalowrie (?) fish, doubles, patties and plantain."}
{"text":"I have to say that this restaurant makes some of the best roti I have ever had. They make their own roti shells, which gives them a fresh taste. Their goat and chicken rotis are wonderful and cheap. They only down side is that they are located at the Jane & Finch mall."}
{"text":"Thought this place was pretty good. Very friendly staff. I would recommend a try!"}
{"text":"First time trying this and I absolutely loved it. I was in Canada for a few days for work and my colleague brought me here. He had good things to say about this place and he was not wrong. I got the roti with with boneless chicken curry and it was bomb. Next time I am around this area I will definitely be back."}
