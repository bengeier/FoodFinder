{"text":"Absolutely Fantastic  ! ! !  Me and my traditional Chinese mother  ( in her late 80's ) are from Ottawa. She is always never satisfied and is very critical.  But after having a meal from them, she was Extremely Happy which is rare.  She loves every detail of the meal that she had.   She had the duck, chicken, vegetables, on rice, and soup.  She said the sauce is amazingly Great.  The vegetables were perfection, and note she has false teeth.  She also loved the soup.  The piece of corn adds a natural touch.  She finished it all completely, which is also rare.  I was in shock.  I tried it too and now it is a favourite and must go to, on our list.  The food, speed, and price is Fantastic.  When we are in Toronto, we always go there daily."}
{"text":"Way back when, this modest little BBQ shop was in Scarberia.   After many years, it's finally moved along with the hoards of Chinese people into Markham and set up shop at Fmp.   I always get one thing: roasted duck on soup noodles $5.50.  It's cheap and filling.   They're efficient at filling your orders.   You can make requests such as less fat, specific sections of the duck.   Today, I even got an extra surprise in my meal..... A nice chicken finger nub.    An added bonus?  I'll let you decide.   As I write this, I'm struggling to finish my meal.   The duck is tender with crispy skin.  It comes with a side of napa cabbage which doesn't appear to be filled with black dots. Plus I'm staring at my complimentary soup which I cannot quite finish.     I'm not sure if this is a customary Chinese thing to call you 'pretty lady', but I'll take what I can get.     3 thumbs up + a bonus chicken finger for Extra BBQ."}
{"text":"Arrived at 5:30 and just barely missed the dinner rush! Came here based on Yelp reviews seeing that some of my yelp friends rave about this place.   Ordered the roasted pig and chicken on rice, comes with a good amount of rice and cabbage! The roasted pig was good it wasn't too fatty or too lean just perfect, the chicken was nothing special but their green onion and ginger sauce was pretty good! I wasn't able to finish all the rice as they give you more than enough (possibly enough to share) although I was starving.  Priced cheaper than a Mcdonalds combo with even faster efficient service, talk about fast food eh?   A lot of seating in the food court as there is also a lot of parking in the parking lot but fair warning when parking is to maybe park a little further away from entrances or have asians follows you on their car when you're leaving or even worst you come back to see a ding or 4.   Very hard choice between Extra and Ho Ho in Scarborough but leaning more towards Extra as you get more food with similar quality and there's a lot  of seating"}
{"text":"I was at FMP yesterday and couldn't help but notice the crazy long lines in front of Extra BBQ House. They specialize in roast pork, BBQ pork and roast duck, but also sell such Hainanese chicken, BBQ goose, and other more exotic snacks. When you're too lazy to cook and hubby is craving BBQ pork, it seemed like a good time to try this place.  Their best sellers are the BBQ pork and roast pork on rice for $5.99 plus tax, which comes in a heaping portion atop steamed rice and some steamed vegetables (typically cabbage or broccoli).  Although I didn't order this at this time, a burly guy sitting beside hubby and I in the food court yesterday had ordered it and wouldn't stop raving about what an awesome deal it was, where portions were often plentiful enough for 1.5 to 2 meals for most people (including himself).  I requested for BBQ pork and roast pork a la carte, which they sell for $6.50 and $7.99 per pound respectively. However they wouldn't sell me a half pound of roast pork as it was \"too little\". In the end I purchased a half pound of BBQ pork and a pound of roast pork, which came to $15. There is enough meat in the containers to feed hubby and I for at least 2 meals. The roast pork is very juicy with a deliciously crispy crackling skin. The pieces of pork were more meaty than fatty. The BBQ pork is served with sauce which keeps it flavourful and moist.   In terms of best meal deal, it is probably best to order the set meal with rice, which is what I plan to try next time. You really can't go wrong with all that food for such a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"Very large portion of food. Duck is crispy and BBQ pork is lean. Soup was very yummy. Rice was a bit on the hard side, but other than that, it was tasty and a good value! It's cheaper than the other BBQ place."}
{"text":"This BBQ house is located inside FMP food court. There's a reason why they always have long line ups. This place is a true example of \"cheap, looks good AND taste good\" food joint. Ordered the duck chicken rice combo which includes a soup. After tax is $6.75. They filled up the box with rice. Totally worth the wait and price! Highly recommend this place if you're craving for Chinese BBQ!"}
{"text":"This place is now revamped with a similar(same?) worn-down menu and different name. However, the BBQ meat was surprisingly good and not too expensive! I used to be a long-time patron of the other BBQ shop beside this one in the food court, but I've noticed recently, they've raised their prices and lowered their quality, taking advantage of their loyal customers...  So with the renos completed, I've finally had a chance to try Extra BBQ house and got the 3-platter of BBQ pork, Roasted Pork and Red Sausage. All three were done quite well. The skin on the roasted pork didn't seem traditional but was crispy. The meat was more tender than other BBQ places I've had. And the price was sub $8! Definitely great value for your money since the portions are gigantic!"}
{"text":"After seeing the reviews on this place I decided to try it out for lunch. I came at 2pm and there was still a line up so I think that speaks for itself. I got the roasted and BBQ pork on rice. There's napa cabbage under the meat which made me feel like it was healthier than it is. It also comes with a soup and everything came to $6.77 with tax. I didn't see the guy put the meat and everything in the box cuz I was getting cash out to pay so when I opened the box, I was like dayummmmm. Look at all that meat! It was seriously a lot of meat. I almost wished I had more rice to go with it but then I remembered I was supposed to be on a diet. Whoopsie. Anyways, I could only eat half and saved the rest for later.   The roasted pork was tender, not dry or too fat, and the skin was soooo crispy. The BBQ pork was good but not the best I've had. I think it could've used a little more marinating time but still good. The soup was piping hot and didn't taste MSG-y. Overall, I will definitely be back to try some other stuff. The price and portion can't be beat. The ppl who work there are also super nice!"}
{"text":"3.5/5  Well what do you know...Hunan Fine Food lasted maybe 3 months before it closed down. It's replacement? Extra BBQ House. The food court in First Markham Place once again has two BBQ stalls now (remember Van's BBQ?)!  Extra BBQ tries to differentiate from its DKS neighbour and competitor. One of the specials that they offer is peking duck for $25. Yup, you can order peking duck from a fast food stall in First Markham Place! Of course they will prepare the duck slices from you, as well as what we call the \"second portion\". You'll also get the pancakes along with it, though it will cost $5 extra for more than one box.  I really wanted to give this place 4 stars, unfortunately there were certainly not enough duck slices considering the fact it was $25. I ended up having more pancakes remaining than duck, so I ended up using the pancakes for other parts of my meal.  Peking duck is easily better to eat dining in, not taking out. However if you simply want your basic peking duck experience without dining in, by all means this place fits the criteria."}
{"text":"Being a long term fan of the bbq place next door, I decided to give this place a try and instantly regretted that when I got my food. Service was very slow, but the people were nicer. I got a roast pork on rice and almost everything was pure fat, like 20% meat at max. They were even trying. I was also not a fan of how their sauce was poured so it would sog up the crispy skin but not be able to make it to your rice.  I think I'm going back to my usual place from now on."}
{"text":"Located in the First Markham Place food court, Extra BBQ provides \"extra large\" portions of Chinese style BBQ meals.    The previous BBQ shop that occupied this kiosk didn't last due to the more popular HKS BBQ joint nearby, but these guys seem to be more and more busy these days so had to check them out.  As with all my BBQ joint comparisons I judge the quality based on their Roast Pork and BBQ Pork Rice Combos.  Portions are huge here and are served with veggies and an order of soup.  All for $6.77 total!  The skin of the roast pork is crispy and meat tender.  A little too fatty for me but some people might love their pork more fatty:). The BBQ pork is flavourful but a tad dry for me.  The soup was an excellent surprise though and had lots of flavour.  The couple running the place are courteous and nice so that is a plus.  Overall it a great choice in the food court as they give a lot of value but I've been spoiled with the likes of Kum Hong so my standards are a little high;)"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this place. Every time I'm in the area, id come here and get my Chinese food fix.  My go to is the hainan chicken rice. For $6.20 you get a huge plate of chicken and rice with a soup on the side as well.  More than the food, the service is always good!! The lady at the front is so friendly and is always smiling. She recognizes me and always asks if I'll see her tomorrow again.  I love this place and you will too."}
{"text":"Great price, great Chinese food. The duck skin was crispy and it is hard to find any Chinese duck at this price point to have similar quality. One box can easily feed two people. For me I have to try my best to finish since the portion is huge. The only downside I can find is they run out of stuffs quite early. You have to come a few hours before closing time ,otherwise, good luck, you will not have many choices. *Update March 4 2018: I tried the food for a few times, my wife and daughter like the duck. Food quality is consistent, so I give extra one star."}
{"text":"[LOCATION] - 5/5 This place is located in the food court at First Markham Place. There are ample parking spots outside.   [SERVICE] - 5/5 The staff are very friendly and generous with their portions. If you are nice to them, they will be nice to you too.  [DÉCOR] - 3/5  Nothing fancy but this food stall was effective and there are lots of seats in the food court. The place fills up during peak hours for lunch & dinner, but there are plenty of seats in the food court.   [QUALITY] - 4/5 One of the best quality Chinese BBQ food stands in the area! The sauce also tastes so savoury and delicious!   [ORDER] - 4/5 Half Chicken & Half BBQ Pork Rice - $5.99: huge portion, high quality meats, and comes with a soup that tastes homemade.   [OVERALL] - 5/5  I would definitely recommend Extra BBQ House because they literally give you extra BBQ meat and so much food!"}
{"text":"New kid on the block in the ever busy FMP food court.  Ordered the roast pork with chicken combo.  I did not know what to expect with the quality.  The roasted pork had a nice taste and texture, the skin has a nice crunch without being too hardm.  Not too fat and good balance of spice to giving the meat nice flavour.  The chicken was flavorful, not the typical Canadian mushy chicken with zero flavour.  The meal came with napa cabbage and a bowl of old fire soup that again was flavorful and not just flavored water many places offer.    I will return to try out their other offerings and see if they are consistent with quality."}
{"text":"Good: 1. Generous portions - Had cha siu and roasted duck rice.  Very good portion size on meats and rice and also came with some napa cabbage.  Neutral: 1. A little uneven on the meats, more cha siu than duck.  Worth it?: This being a food court joint, it definitely delivers on value and is worth it.  Flavours are good and the duck was not super lean.  This place is ok in my books."}
{"text":"Holy. Extra. BBQ.   I don't usually go to FMP often, but I've started visiting the past few days and every time I go here, I stop by. This is honestly one of the best Asian BBQ places I've been to. Look at the meats in the window! Literally DRIPPING with juices and it's so delicious. I usually get the roasted pork and cha siu with rice, cabbage, and soup combo, which is 5.99 not including tax.   What I really love about this place is that even though the take out container is the regular ones, it is PACKED to the brim. They do not skimp out on the meat and rice. I am a huge eater but this combo packs a punch and I rarely finish it, and I save it for later. When I share with my mom, we usually add duck to the combo as well. I don't like duck as I find it has a lot of bones and such, but hands down this is the best duck I've ever tasted.   Love it. Definitely a hidden gem in the FMP food court. Highly recommended."}
