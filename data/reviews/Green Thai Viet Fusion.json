{"text":"This place has closed down now.  When I did visit though it was at lunch for takeout and it was one of the worst experiences of my life.  The server was rude and the they prepared the wrong dish.  Would definitely avoid this place if it reopened."}
{"text":"Green Thai Viet Fusion is in an interesting and fairly odd strip plaza, located next to a Ballbuster Video and Pizza Pizza. The interior of the restaurant is even more interesting, with what looks like a Bizzaro Ikea on Meth. It's almost completely dark/black with Swedish, mod-looking jungle-gym red bars, in the middle of the restaurant. 

Regardless, Green Thai does some of the best Asian Fusion in Toronto. From Vietnamese to Thai (as indicated by the name, of course)  to Chinese they have many different fusion types to select from. On my last visit, I tried the 'Dinner for 2'($23), which included Vegetarian Spring Rolls, Corn Soup, Pad Thai and Coconut Nut Tofu & Eggplant. Every bite was a new assortment of flavours and crispy vegetables. It was perfect, and very much all I expect from Thai food and more. 

The service was warm and friendly, as the server kept us laughing with interesting questions and anecdotes, although sometimes it was hard to flag her down. The restaurant was fairly busy on a weekday evening, a definite positive."}

If Roma M did not write a review of Green Thai Viet Fusion, I would not even know that it exists even I drove by Bayview often. 

We went and visit on a Sunday evening around 8 PM, there were only  4 tables including us. (I guess people are watching the Olympic Closing Ceremonies somewhere)

We ordered Malaysian Curry Beef Brisket, Sambal mixed vegetables and Rare Beef Pho. All the food was great! the mixed vegetables has so many varieties of veg: broccili, pepper, bean, sweet beans, carrots. They were cooked perfectly, with still the sense of crispy. The beef brisket is nice and tender, not too spicy perfect for my friend.  Yes I ate the Pho, it has the fresh noodles, for $5.99 one size it is quite big. They did not give me any fresh chilli and when I asked for it, they said they don't give chilli pepper????!!!!!

Green Thai Viet Fusion is runned by Chinese, the waitstaffs here speaks mandarian and cantonese. They are not too friendly or efficient. No tea or water was offered, we have to ask for iced water. We ask for extra napkins, and they didn't bother.

I would give the food 4 stars, but has to deduct 1 star for services!

They accepts Visa and Mastercard!"}
