{"text":"The grilled seafood counter is what makes this stand out from other hotpot restaurants.  

Located where Mongolian Grill used to be at Market Village, it kept the large circular grill and is now used to grill seafood.  

The price you pay for dinner includes unlimited grilled seafood and raw seafood.  These include crab (only available grilled, and not the imitation kind), clam, scallop and oysters all still on the shell.

The meat options are ordered through the staff, while the veggies, fungi and dipping sauces are self-serve on a buffet table.  

Service was pretty prompt as the food came quickly, and every table is entitled to one free round of plum juice.  The staff mostly spoke mandarin and came by frequently to clear plates and to add hot water.  

Price is average at $28.99 for Monday to Thursday and $32.99 for the weekend.  You do need to pay for the soup base and for split pot.  I'd say it's worth it since the price you pay includes unlimited seafood!

This might be my new favorite hotpot restaurant.  I can see it getting quite busy and disorganized as the grilled seafood is first come first serve.  There were people waiting around the grill area and Chinese people like to swarm when the food is ready."}
{"text":"Went here seeing positive reviews but was disappointed by the food. None of the meat was tender, the cooked seafood station kept pushing out crab that you couldnt even pull meat out of it was cold and meat stuck onto the shell. I got the first spicy soup base and it wasnt good. I didnt like the tingly sensation that one of the hot peppers or peppercorn gave. I tried the seafood and the mushroom soup base as well. Nothing special. I was surprised that they didnt have a satay soup base or anything else interesting. The beef balls did not look very appetizing and somekne from my group said the crab meat stick tasted a little like soap. Its bad when the only thing anyone was raving about was the corn and the tom yum instant noodle. It was dead when we arrived there and it only filled up with maybe 3 other tables in the 2.5 hrs that we were there. We would not come back again."}
{"text":"This is definitely worth a visit! For only $28.95 (Monday-Thursday) or $31.95 (Friday-Sunday) you get AYCE hotpot and Grilled Seafood! There is an additional charge for the soup base though.

The selection for hotpot is relatively large and features some unique options. They offer an impressive selection of beef, pork, chicken, seafood, and vegetables. Overall the highlight of this place is their seafood. Simply walk up to this seafood counter and order up as many grilled oysters, scallops, muscles, jumbo shrimp, or razor clams as you like. 

This is the best bang for your buck if you want a seafood feast!"}
{"text":"This place is definitely one of my top 5 favourite ayce hot pot restaurants because of their grilled seafood bar. It is very spacious inside. The price includes ayce grilled seafood, raw meats and seafood, and pretty much everything you find at a hot pot place plus special items on the menu too. There is an additional charge for the soup bases - there are large communal pots available, as well as personal pots. You have to order the meats through the staff, and the rest is self-serve (veggies and fruits, the sauce bar, and grilled seafood bar). 

Monday to Thursday is $28.99, Friday to Sunday is $32.99 per person. We were offered one pitcher of free plum juice, with an additional 15% off if we pay with cash. Overall, I would suggest this to be one of the most worth it ayce hot pot places for all seafood lovers!"}
{"text":"Expensive, long wait for cooked food, not very flavourful soup base and the list goes on. The meat cuts were the same quality as any store bought hotpot. I would only say the $10 lunch deal is worth it but otherwise not very good. Everyone who gave it 5 stars are obviously over zealous Yelp reviewers following trends as usual."}
{"text":"This place blew my mind in terms of the quality and variety of seafood. If u love grilled seafood and hotpot. This is the place to go. The only hotpot joint that offers ayce scallops, oysters, clams, squid, large shrimps. When I when they were having a discount for soft opening. Bill came to be $76 for 2 including tax and tips. We even ordered watermelon juice and the most expensive soup base. Some how I do not think this place will last long because of the insanely good quality and variety of foods they offer with the price charged. It's just so cheap and so good! Definitely give it a try, you will be mind blown"}
{"text":"Went to try out this place around noon, decided to try the dinner all you can eat menu which have the bbq seafoods included for $25.99.

It was dead silent in the resturant, only our table and another 3 persons at the other table in the corner.  No music at all.  Very very dead silent.

BBQ seafood menu have 7 items and 2 of the items are not available and we were not advised before we choose the dinner all you can eat.  Which is very dishonest.  BBQ seafood taste awful and eventho the oysters are huge in size but not very fresh.

Hotpot was okay.  I would go with the lunch menu, the dinner menu are just not worth it.  The fire alarm went off many times and was told it's normal by the servers.

Not recommand going.  If must go, just try the lunch menu, definitely not the dinner menu!"}
{"text":"1st time is good but after 2nd and 3rd visit, the food quality is going down. Not worth it with the high price. Most of the BBQ corner food are not available and they did not informed the customer before you sat down."}
