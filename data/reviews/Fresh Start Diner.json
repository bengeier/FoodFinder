{"text":"Overall, a fairly tasty place for breakfast - with good portions at fair prices (yes to malty, huge pancakes, but no to icky, super-finely diced corned beef hash). However, the dingy, outdated decor, left over from the previous, long-running tenant, is a detriment to the joint. A select few old timers may love the unchanged surroundings, but worn and greasy, with 80s vibe, is anything but the \"fresh start\" promised by their spiffy, bright,modern \"Fresh Start\" logo."}
{"text":"Best Eggs Benedict with crab cakes! Clam chowder is awesome too! We go here every week!!!"}
{"text":"A damn good place that's light on the chedda and good on the eats.  They even have this Man vs Food pancake thing up there that,man, that sh** is no joke!  Get your breakfast on at Fresh Start."}
{"text":"Wow!  Can't recommend this place enough!  The pancakes are huge and delicious.   The completely homemade corned beef hash is unbelievably amazing!  This is a true treasure hidden away."}
{"text":"Based on the reviews I saw, I was really hoping that this place would be as good as everyone claims. Unfortunately, that is not the case. I went in on a Sunday morning for breakfast. The place was packed and I was lucky enough to find an open booth. I was given coffee by one of the staff as I sat down ... A good start. But from there downhill.  I was able to finish a cup of coffee and get a refill before the waitress even came to my table. When she finally showed up, she did not say a word, just tossed a menu on my table and went on ... No greeting, no water ... Nothing. She came back 10 minutes later and ask \"what do you want\" ... Again no greeting and apparently annoyed that she had to wait on me. I ordered an omelet and a single pancake. Ten minutes later my meal came out ... The waitress put the plates on my table and left ... Again saying nothing. So now I have been here 30 minutes and no one has been pleasant, the service is terrible and rude, the coffee leaves a lot to be desired. Only the food can salvage this experience. No luck. The omelet is dry (how is that even possible!) and the pancake is dry and cold and hard... When I put butter on the pancake the butter does not melt one bit. While I sit there debating if I should even attempt to finish my meal, the waitress walks by and throws my bill on the table ... Again saying nothing to me. I take a few bites of cold food, another sip of bitter coffee, and decide I do not want to waste any more time in such a rude place eating terrible, over priced food.  I pay my bill and get out of this dump. Next time I will go to Yours Truly!"}
{"text":"Just moved to Streetsboro and was looking for a local diner. We found our joint. My wife is gluten free and they offer GF options for everything on the menu including pancakes! The real diner feel, fresh squeezed OJ and giant pancakes."}
{"text":"Hmmm....quick and hot, but not very fresh!  I was catching up with a friend who know the area much better than I, so she suggested this place.   We approached the host, who didnt bother with a greeting, and told us to pick a table. However, its Black Friday, and they were very busy.   Once seated, the menus arrived and so did our punctual waiter. Again, the waiter lacked the warmth I assumed was missing from the busy staff in general.   One Lipton tea (ick) later, my pallid eggs and burned pancake arrived. Sans the fruit I ordered. I politely asked the waitress dropping my food off if the strawberries were missing?  \"Did you check?\" Hostile, and a little annoyed with such a small question. I didnt know what she meant until she huffed, \"They might be baked in.\" It would have been simpler to start with that.   No other huge issues or omissions, but a disappointing breakfast."}
{"text":"Fast and REALLY good!  Large menu to choose from!   True diner food!!!"}
{"text":"We have been here many times.  The food is consistent and good, with generous helpings.  The waitstaff is always on top.  This is your local diner and everyone feels comfortable here.  My only issue is the decor.  Spend a few bucks and fix up the interior a bit.  Otherwise, this is a nice place for an inexpensive breakfast or lunch."}
{"text":"Food is decent but ever time i come here the service is excruciatingly slow...todays excuse the cook was late ...um i saw at least 2 cooks and there wew only 4 people  here besides me"}
{"text":"Love this place! Food is always hot and delicious and wait staff is always attentive   Try Fresh Start Diner you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"Favorite place to eat breakfast or lunch! Delicious food and very friendly service! They are sure to put plenty of ice in their iced tea too, it's always super cold."}
{"text":"I love this place! WAYYYY better than Bob Evan's.   I've never had challah bread until dining at Fresh Start, and I was not disappointed!   Great food, great people, highly recommended."}
{"text":"Greasy greasy food!! Flies all around buzzing you! They have a huge heater in the dinning room , full of dust hanging!! Dont these ppl clean the restaurant??!!! I can only IMAGINE how dirty the kitchen is!! Slooooow service, filthy!! BEWARE!!!!"}
{"text":"Great local spot for lunch, with a broad menu and excellent breakfast-anytime choices."}
{"text":"So yummy!  No nonsense servers that aren't too much when you are first waking up.  Really happy we found this place via yelp - truly not disappointed.  They even have gluten free bread!"}
{"text":"I had the chicken fried steak with 2 sunny side up eggs cooked perfect. Gravy on top and hot sauce made this perfect. Had a side of rye toast came toasted perfect not soggy. Recommend this for anyone looking for a breakfast that wants great food fast."}
{"text":"Excellent! After a bad experience at our last breakfast place the wife and I were looking for somewhere new. And we found it! We have been back a couple times and haven't had a bad meal yet everything is delicious! Great food, great service, at a reasonable price! If you are looking for a fresh start this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"We mistakenly thought this was a branch of a similar sounding breakfast chain, so consequently had no/low expecations for a \"cheap eats\" Sunday brunch.   How wrong we were -- the food was great! Super eggs benedict, corned beef hash, and non-greasy home fries. Much better than some recent medicore-to-poor breakfasts at both of the two leading Beachwood delis. The atmosphere is still 100% the old Dinks, a relic of 1950s Americana.  Please, please open a branch in Shaker -- you'll make a fortune."}
{"text":"Fresh Start Diner is a small and quaint place. The staff is very friendly and the food was outstanding.  The best real corned beef hash that I have eaten thus far, the eggs were perfect and the local bakery had some great bread. Well worth the 40 minute drive to get here. We'll definitely return when back in the area. Thank you for a wonderful breakfast."}
{"text":"This is a great place to stop and have a meal with friends. Great food and awesome service. I know many of the high school kids love to stop here during exam week. My personal favorite is the Greek Omelet."}
{"text":"Love this place!  Great for breakfast or lunch.  The pancakes were delicious and try the cheeseburger with homemade diner fries for lunch.  Brenda and the rest of the gang are super friendly.  Very casual, pleasant place to eat.  Tip the cooks!"}
{"text":"Very good food and fast service. I had eggs bacon and toast, and I was not disappointed."}
{"text":"Good breakfast spot. Better than going to Bob Evans. Gets the job done. Exactly what you expect a small town diner to provide."}
{"text":"Everyone needs to go here at least once.  The restaurant is located on the square in Twinsburg in a tiny plaza.  Inside, it's very small.    The menu selection is huge, and the service is lightning quick.  Every time we go, we order different breakfast selections, and every time, they've come out quickly, and cooked to our exact specifications.  The portions are very large, and for the price, you can't beat it.  The servers are very friendly.  One neat thing, if you leave a tip for the cooks, a cow bell is rung, and you can hear the cooks hooting and hollering.  It's a fun atmosphere."}
{"text":"Best breakfast on the planet. Great service and the kitchen staff is awesome!   Must try the Greek omlettes and home fries. Awesome!"}
{"text":"Great Spot for Breakfast! Love the French Toast and the Pancakes are the best in Cleveland. So much Chagrin History at this location and glad to see the owners have kept the small town vibe inside!   Always a friendly staff!, love eating at the diner bar. This is a perfect american diner, with the bar and all!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast spot. The staff is very friendly and the food is great. It's one of those divey type breakfast spots. I personally like those types of restaurants.  The prices are absolutely reasonable and the service is great. The omelets are great - especially the South of the Border omelet. The home fries are some of the very best I have ever had. You also have to try their bagels warmed up with a little cream cheese and orange marmalade.   If you're looking for a place to grab Sunday breakfast in Twinsburg, I would highly recommend. Make sure you tip the cooks'"}
{"text":"Amazing food and service! Highly recommend this diner. Buckwheat pancakes were one of the best I have had, and the omelette was out of this world!"}
{"text":"My family and I have eaten breakfast here many times. They have delicious, hearty, affordable breakfasts and a huge menu selection that has everything you could ask for. The seating is first come, first serve, which can get a bit tricky, but the food and pricing is worth the inconvenience."}
{"text":"Love this diner!  Tried it after seeing the good reviews and was glad I did!  They have interesting choices, which I appreciate, and really enjoyed my lunch. We look forward to going back!"}
{"text":"Friendly, great food, and good prices.  Just a word of warning: The pancakes are HUGE. One is more than enough for me."}
{"text":"I've been there twice now.  The first time the service was agonizingly SLOW.  The people at the table next to me had to wait so long that they actually asked not to be charged.  I gave it a try a second time, and it was even worse!  I waited 50 MINUTES for an omelette which never arrived.  Finally left cash for my beverage and walked out.  I would never attempt to eat here ever again."}
{"text":"I checked this place out today after reading reviews here on yelp!  I got there at about 1:30 in the afternoon (they close at 2) and they were not busy. You seat yourself, which I did, and I was greeted as I did so. I thought I would try breakfast. Sausage and cheese omelet (w/mushrooms and onions), hash browns, one pancake and coffee. My order came quickly as the waiter refilled my coffee.    Nothing blew my socks off, but everything was hot and tasty.  A lot of places I have been lately really skimp on the pancakes.  Not this place, the one pancake I had was the diameter of the plate it was served on and probably the best one I've had in a while.  I look forward to trying other things on their menu. This just seems to be a simple but solid diner with good food. My meal came to about $11 before tip."}
{"text":"We enjoyed this place despite slightly subpar service (our server was a little brisk). Breakfast was yummy and inexpensive. LOVED the homefries!  Definitely has a diner/dive feel. It was very busy but we were seated pretty quickly. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Good food. Friendly staff. Reasonable prices. Stayed there for hours taking advantage of the free wifi."}
{"text":"Meh, this place OK.  To be honest their pancakes are a bit dry.  I went there one time and we are sitting there and people who came in after us were getting food... Finally I grab the waitress and she goes back and says they lost our order.  Then she puts it in again...I would have expected them to do something for us but no that didn't even come up after waiting an hour for breakfast other than \"sorry\".  Go to Dolphin Family Restaurant for a good breakfast."}
{"text":"Used to come here all the time when we lived in the area and now we go back nearly every visit. Highly recommend the breakfast burrito. Service is always super nice and prices are more than reasonable"}
{"text":"LOVE the salami and eggs!  It's my 'go to' dish every time.  Good coffee too.  My kids always order the pancakes or waffles and they always leave happy as well.  Small spot so plan to get cozy."}
{"text":"There was a huge line up the street so we decided to try this place, and boy were we happy we did!  We ordered the corn beef hash and it was amazing, the right flavor and texture that hash should be.  We also had the eggs benedict, and the ham was thick and perfect, the egg was prepared perfectly and the hash browns were crispy and delicious.  Finally we had a pancake that was great, light and fluffy.  Also they provide real maple syrup as the standard, no up charge.  Very friendly wait staff, also offers promos.  It's a must try for breakfast!"}
{"text":"great little local breakfast place. The food is fresh. It's a little hole in the wall but super busy. All the locals Love this place. Don't forget to tip the cook!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast. Pancakes bigger than your face; unless you have a freakishly large face. In that case you shouldn't leave the house."}
{"text":"Good down home breakfast.  WE always pick up the tab for a veteran when there.  Try it sometime!  Nothing special, but good home cooking.  Fast service"}
{"text":"Wellllll what a pleasant surprise! Yelp u have not let us down yet! Traveling for a living this is the best site ever!!! Now with the review .. It's  a Sunday and packet with livelihood n goodness. We read some of the reviews and made a decision, fresh start skillet for hubby with one pancake & eggs benne for me with ham (u have 4 choices of protien ) with single pumpkin pancake. Omg so good. We sat here listening to the cow bell ring and the cooks yellin hurrah and yeah in the background. Breakfast & and a show!! Lol we love it. The wait staff quick and efficient , refills in a snap and all condiment in the table before food came! Now in some places that's a feat. Too bad we are leaving today. But fond memories for sure and will be back when in town again. Thanx Fresh Start Diner!!!"}
{"text":"Decent local diner. Not anything to write home about. If you are hungry and they open. They have limited hours then you will get an okay meal. Staff is friendly. You get the most ginormous glass of ice tea you will ever see. That's kinda cool. You can tip the kitchen and they'll yell out with glee. Funny."}
{"text":"Not a bad way to start your day.  It's a small restaurant tucked away in the complex.  The parking is fairly limited, but the aroma outside makes up for it.  It can be a bit busy, but the portion sizes and service staff is great.  I enjoyed a glass of fresh squeezed orange juice to start and that just hits the spot.  I ordered up the corned beef hash, with cinnamon raisin bread.  It was pretty dang good. I also appreciate that the wait staff isn't assigned to sections so you constantly get attention.  As we were waiting I saw our food come out, then... one of the best things I've ever seen, the waitress sent my toast back because it was too burned before she delivered it.  That type of care should be taken at all restaurants."}
{"text":"Good place. I'm a big fan of their steak sandwich which is more of a French dip. Whatever you call it, delicious. And the eggs benny is very good as well. Excellent Bearnaise. I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Fresh Start formerly was Dinks.  The strange thing is that after they were bought, it seems as though absolutely no changes were made to the place.  It's completely beat to hell inside from decades of hard use.  If it was quaint, I would get the appeal, but it's not.  It just looks like a rundown diner.  The food is okay.  I had a business meeting there where I got the egg sandwich and he got the french toast.  The toast looked pretty good, my sandwich could have been executed better simply if it was warm.    Another strange thing about this restaurant is no music- the place is huge and you can hear the conversations from way across the room.  Buy a boom box or something if you don't want to install a system.    My advice is to walk down two doors to Yours Truly or go into the square to Einstein Bagels and grab a bite there."}
{"text":"It makes me happy. The food is the bomb.com!  The staff is very friendly and the service is quick and quality.  The giant roll up pancake is to die for! I highly recommend it!"}
{"text":"I really like this place for a hearty, home style breakfast. I love the buckwheat waffles and the challah French toast. The service is always great. My only issue is that I can't stand the bell they ring for tips--way too much noise early in the morning!"}
{"text":"I take my daughter here every Sunday. The food is always good and the service is always fast. The diner fries are amazing. This is a must try breakfast spot. They also offer a good lunch menu."}
{"text":"The food and service were as good as a diner gets. We had a charming waitress. And then...........a man I assumed was the owner.was extremely rude to our waitress. I talked to our waitress and she said thats the way he is! In front of customers! Reminded me of the time,many years ago when the same thing happened at Geraci's pizza. Wouldn't go back. I probably will go back to Fresh Start diner because I love Chagrin Falls."}
{"text":"Everything was fine except I would warn you about the pancakes. They were huge! And dry! Everyone else in my party was quite happy with their breakfast. They did comp part of the cost of my pancakes when they realized that I was not happy."}
{"text":"My favorite local breakfast spot for sure.  I am in love with their pumpkin pancakes, which are sadly a seasonal item.  Service is quick and to the point.  These ladies do not fool around.  I've never waited more than 15 minutes for my food, even when it's packed.  From what I can tell, most of their items are homemade and not from some box or can.  I would give it a solid 5, but they have a bell patrons can ring when the tip the kitchen....  This bell leads to a long, drawn out, loud woo'ing from the kitchen staff.  It's not a quick celebration... it's all 4 of the of them wooting and cheering for what seems like an eternity.  I get it... ya'll are showing your appreciation.  But I kinda wanna hear the conversation my table is having.  With that aside, Fresh Start Diner is a great place for a weekend breakfast."}
{"text":"We live in Twinsburg and love this joint! I would eat breakfast here every day if I could. All of the ambience of a small-town diner with great food and service. Nice variety on the menu too. I know it sounds a little odd for breakfast, but if you like crab cakes try the crabcake Benedict. I'm sure it is just a frozen crab cake, but it's not bad! Give the cooks a tip and listen to the response...."}
{"text":"Great food at lunch time. Would recommend the Cheese Steak sandwich, very good and not like most cheese steak sandwiches. Was almost more like a French dip sandwich."}
{"text":"Yum! Fresh Start Skillet is bomb! Their coffee is the elixir of the Golden Gods on the summit of mount Olympus!"}
{"text":"Very good breakfast place, friendly staff many things to chose.i had skillet oj. Also pancakes pretty good"}
{"text":"This is the best breakfast nook ever. Great food (I recommend the short stack combo) and super friendly service. They are only open for breakfast and lunch though, so no dinner here. Free WiFi if you need to do a little work while enjoying your meal. Make sure you tip the cooks, it's good fun, you'll know what I mean."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly strip mall diner... not a coffee destination, but the rest of the meal was nice.  Hubby enjoyed his chocolate chip pancakes and home fries... pancakes were large and fluffy... potatoes were crispy but not overdone.  The egg buschetta with fruit cup was a nice light start to the day... confusing that it is served with baby spinach and no basil... but the buttered english muffin was warm enough to slightly wilt the spinach by the end.  Lots of refills... but sadly not much taste to the coffee... plenty brown... but no flavor.   Enough variety in the menu to have us interested to visit again... and stick to the soda."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast spot with many gluten free option, endless cups of coffee, and nice atmosphere. Try the buck wheat pancakes with real maple syrup !"}
{"text":"After returning from a late night trip and having slept in the next day, the Fresh Start Diner was the only restaurant I found in the area that served breakfast all day. At first glance it doesn't look like much but once you walk in it is a lot bigger than it looks. My friend and I were seated at the bar right away, our waitress was attentive, the food came quickly, was quite tasty and was reasonably priced. I would highly recommend this place and I plan on visiting on any future business trips I make to the area."}
{"text":"This has been a go to place for me on several occasions where I was looking for a reasonably priced spot to meet for business over breakfast. The service is always very fast and friendly, and the food is always of good quality. Their location is great for those living in Aurora, Hudson, and Solon, and it's very accessible off of I 271 (take either the 91 or 82 exit, it's right on the Northwestern side of the Square). Happy dining!"}
{"text":"Very reasonably priced, very good breakfast food! Need I say more? Ok... got the eggs benedict - it was great! Good portions. Service was quick and efficient. Great local breakfast joint. Did I mention that their menu is reasonably priced? Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"Good food and good people make this a favorite breakfast spot for our family. The eggs are always fluffy and the pancakes are large and delicious."}
{"text":"Awesome! Real corned beef hash.....need I say more!? Their home fries are old school like your mom used to make. Their burger is wonderful. The prices are great. It is a funky fun atmosphere with great service. Go here!"}
{"text":"Typical diner breakfast. Good if you're looking for a cup of coffee, some eggs and a few pancakes (we tried the buttermilk & the pumpkin). Service was quick, even though the diner was very busy."}
{"text":"We were frequent patrons for twelve plus years. About 2 months ago the owners fired our favorite waitress Brenda. No reason was given when we asked why. Brenda always ensured our meal was cooked as we had ordered and sent back when on many occasions it was not."}
{"text":"Great Food, great atmosphere, great people. What more is there to say?! I recommend this to everyone...... o and don't forget to tip the cooks"}
{"text":"This was our first time here. A great place for breakfast or lunch! Breakfast was served through lunch. Great service!! We always request special orders and our waitress was open and said if they have it, they can make it!! Our orders were made as requested and were top notch!! Thank you to the cooks as well!! You can also give them a tip and they will ring the cowbell. Prices are reasonable and you get a large quantity of food. We only wished they were open for dinner."}
{"text":"First time eating here, saw it got great reviews on Yelp so thought we would try it.  Nice little diner, great variety of breakfast and lunch options.  All staff was very friendly.  Only down side was we sat at the table next to the kitchen.  Someone was smoking back in the kitchen and you could smell it at our table,  Nasty!  Not a smoker and don't wanna smell smoke when I am eating,  Will give it another try but definitely will not sit at that table."}
{"text":"Great food! I don't even live around here but anytime I'm in the area, I'll drive a solid 20 minutes out of my way to get breakfast here. Great old school diner feel with real good breakfast food. I switch it up every time and I'm never disappointed."}
{"text":"For diner food Fresh Start is good.  Staff was friendly for as busy as they were.  And it gets pretty busy.  Coffee is good.  Gluten free options!  If you get the gluten free bread, make sure you ask them to toast it.  Space and restrooms (especially) need an update."}
{"text":"We love this place!  It's our goto breakfast place.  I wish there was another out by Cleveland since I'm out there a lot.    Seating- There is a counter with about 8-10 bar stools then maybe 8 booths and maybe about 7 tables to sit 4..  You walk in and sit where you want.  Make a little eye contact w/servers so they see you and they will be there in a flash.  I have to say that we go during peak hours a lot and the turnover for tables is pretty quick.  I don't think we have ever waited more then 5 minutes to sit.   And there are usually 2-4 of us that go.  I love all the older ladies and younger girls that work there.  Seeing their faces all the time is a joy.  They are all so nice and bust butt when it's busy.     I like that their breads are local. And they are good! Rye especially.  They have homemade soup daily.   My usual is over medium eggs/bacon crispy/white toast and diner fries!  Instead of breakfast potatoes, request diner fries!!! You won't be sorry.    My 15 year old son and my hubby have tried multiple things on the menu from pancakes, French toast to sandwiches and have not been disappointed.    They are always coming around to fill up your coffee.  It's just a great little local place - and I'm picky!!!"}
{"text":"Great Diner Breakfast  Try the french toast, made with homemade bread."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. Good prices, good food and good service. Will be going back when the need for a good breakfast arises. Lovely local spot that everyone should support."}
{"text":"Impressed with waitress taking extra time and making sure our items ordered were dairy free. Offered suggestions on alternate items and brought out packaging for us to see. Had kitchen crack fresh eggs for our breakfast instead of using milk egg mix for omelets."}
{"text":"Always great service. Friendly and timely.  A perfect place for great food and community camaraderie."}
{"text":"One of our favorite places for an uncomplicated breakfast or lunch. Good food, good prices, and very good service. They always have interesting specials on the menu worth trying. Love that they have counter service and are always willing to seat larger groups. Our only knock is that we wish their coffee was stronger..."}
{"text":"Of all the places I go to eat at, it's places like these that I tend to treasure the most.  The breakfast world is so full of garbage like Denny's, IHOPs and people are quick to applaud trash like McBreakfast all day and whatever the hell Taco Bell puts scrambled eggs on and calls breakfast, that classic, real breakfast food is really beginning to feel like a lost art in a way.  I sought out breakfast near the roach motel where I crashed at in Macedonia, and a few places popped up.  After eliminating the chains and places that violate my \"don't eat anywhere you could eat at home\" rule, it really left Fresh Start Diner as the only place I could visit.  I knew when I clicked on their website URL and got a dead website, this place might be good.  Good old school restaurants don't care about WordPress or analytics, HTML5 or web presence.  They probably don't even care about Yelp, either.  I knew when I approached the restaurant, and saw it wedged in this dingy brick building with a tiny parking lot, this was the right place chosen for breakfast.  I knew when my dad and I entered the restaurant, and I met the eyes of an elderly gentleman wearing a U.S. Armed Forces baseball cap staring daggers at me, that this was the first place for breakfast.  This is the definition of an old school, no-nonsense greasy spoon.  Except a little easier on the grease, because they did have some fairly surprisingly health-conscious options on their menu too; different strokes for different folks.  The decor is charmingly dated, but well kept, and is about as big as many 50 occupants max, perhaps.  The walls are adorned with photos of presumably locals, staff and family of staff, and there are advertisements of community events and local happenings.  The community newsletter is filled with advertisements that are obviously targeted towards an elder audience, like memory loss, computer repair and side-door bath tubs.  The menu is straight forward and requires no explanation.  Breakfast food during breakfast time.  Service was quick, polite, and at no point, ever let my coffee cup go empty.  I ordered a \"short stack,\" and a side of bacon and potatoes, because I figured a measly short stack wouldn't be enough food before a long drive.  How rudely I was awakened to find out that their definition of a short stack was two 10\" diameter saucers that covered the plate like the oceans cover 93% of the earth.  But hey, I'm a pig, so I love generous portions.  Everything was delicious too.  The pancakes were fluffy and moist, and weren't crumbly and require the sauce to hold things together.  The bacon was crispy without being overly salty, and the potatoes should not go overlooked; so often times, potatoes can be cut too large, to where they don't cook well, and require too much salt and pepper to flavor them.  Fresh Start's were perfectly sized, charred a little, and still tender.  For my dad and I to eat like kings, it was barely $20.  A paltry price to pay for timeless quality.  Places like Fresh Start Diner are the places I love to find the most on my travels.  I would come back to this place in a heartbeat, at least once a week, if I lived in the area.  But because I don't, all I can do is call those who can, lucky."}
{"text":"Five stars all the way! Great food, great friendly service, fast and food is a great value. You get a ton of food for very little. It's a small place and could use a bigger location but I love the place. Every time the cooks get a tip they ring a cow bell. So cute!"}
{"text":"Great food and service. Best little breakfast nook in Twinsburg."}
{"text":"I love this place.  It is my new go-to for breakfast.  We've eaten here 3 or 4 times for breakfast and every time has been great.  Have not had a bad thing yet, the staff is friendly and attentive, what's not to love."}
{"text":"An unexpected pleasure, I went on yelp to find a diner as we are traveling east. Found Fresh Start and expected a good solid breakfast. Instead I found real Challah, amazing French toast and kosher style salami and eggs. Part of the pleasure was the surprise, the rest was the real quality of the food. The home fries were real and as good as I have had in years. Friendly knowledgable service made this a great bargain as well as delicious."}
{"text":"65 reviews and 4.5 stars. That's a lot to live up to. Unfortunately, I must've come during an off day because I wasn't impressed.   First things first, service was OK. Our waitress was polite. I asked for a booster chair for my son and it didn't have any buckles. It was a bit dirty and it was so far from the table. He almost fell into the gap between the table and booth so I switched to a high chair.   The food was OK as well. Eggs Benedict with portobello mushrooms, (I know, weird) but I love my veggies. Hollandaise was nice and eggs were cooked fine. My mom ordered two eggs with toast and home fries. She found a wiry hair in the fries and was all bleh after that. We showed the hair to the waitress and she walked away with it without an apology or anything of that sort but we were comped for that meal, however.   The coffee is flavorless. The entire place is a little run down. Floor under tables looked filthy or maybe it's just really, really old.   The wall art tells a little about the town's history.  That was pretty cool.  I learned that Twinsburg was founded in the 1800s.  By the condition of the wall I could've sworn it dated back to that time period too.    Gave this local spot a try at least. I'll be sticking to my other breakfast choices."}
{"text":"Pumpkin pancakes with eggs, bacon and diner fries.  Twinsburg cheesesteak with diner fries.  Both were really good.  Service was quick even though they were relatively busy. The diner fries are deep fried potato slices - a mix between french fries and potato chips - delicious.  Servings were on the bigger side, so we were filled with leftovers for snacking on later."}
{"text":"I eat here about once a month, both eat in and take out. Everyone is nice, the food is always hot and flavorful. They have a good selection for both breakfast and lunch.  Great place! good value!"}
{"text":"David and I have eaten here several times.  I have to say that it is my favorite place for PANCAKES.  They are light and fluffy, not over cooked and a very good size.  I am and egg snob, so I ask for mine to be cooked \"soft\".  They come out perfect.  I also ask for the bacon to be crispy and it is.  The coffee is mild and has a very nice flavor.  The interior is a bit \"old\" and definitely in need of updating, but the food far out weighs the decor.  The servers have always been pleasant and very attentive.  This is our Go To breakfast place - even though we drive 20 minutes to get here."}
{"text":"I'm giving a four star based off of all my previous experiences, not just my most recent. Fresh Start is literally that - a yummy start to a new day. The service may not be the best, nor the presentation, but at least the food taste is typically great. This is also a great alternative to Yours Truly, which is usually PACKED at all breakfast times...  Typically I order traditional breakfasts with eggs, meat, toast, potatoes. But really I like anything! My last visit, around 11:30AM on a Sunday, was not bad. It wasn't too busy, but since we were an odd number (me and my two siblings went), we had to wait for a four top to open up. We all ordered the eggs benedict four way. Brother had corned beef, sister had portabella mushroom, and I had crab cake. Most disappointing was the crab cake. It looked like some sort of deep fried hush puppy, had a mushy consistency, and tasted like grease. There is just no way they can be proud to serve that, bleggch. The hollandaise sauce was great though. I could eat it by the spoonful."}
{"text":"Great service, great coffee, great menu, great prices.  Somewhere between a $ and $$ though. Cool hole in the wall spot for breakfast and lunch. Love these kinds of diners!"}
{"text":"Great new place discovered on Yelp!  Reuben sandwiches are delicious!   Service staff very friendly and helpful!  Hear they have a new baker on staff!  Can't wait to return to try the homemade cinnamon buns!"}
{"text":"The good is absolutely delicious and the service is Great. The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is on Sundays they seem overwhelmed. I've tried to go twice with a party of 3 on Sundays and was forced to go elsewhere due to the wait."}
{"text":"Stopped here on the way back to Virginia from Cleveland and it was definitely worth the short detour! Our waitress was very friendly, drinks stayed full and our meals were delicious!"}
{"text":"Have been twice now for lunch and have yet to be impressed. This diner is sentimental to me bc it used to be \"Dink's\" when I was growing up. The newer \"Fresh Start\" sounds like it wants to be a healthy alternative to typical diner food, but it's not at all. They serve burger and diner fries plus breakfast all day. Their whole \"fresh\" claim is pretty bogus. That being said, the food they do serve is average, if not subpar. The last trip there, our sandwiches were ok, but nothing I'd come back for. This trip, I tried the sunshine salad, and it was ok too. You can't really mess up a salad. The chicken salad, however, was gross... The chicken chunks tasted like deli meat and had no seasoning. My mother actually got sick to her stomach after our meal. Yikes. Oh and the service was horrendously slow. I am bummed that my precious Dink's has turned into this yucky place. Will not bother returning again."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch - lots of things on the menu sounded good, especially for breakfast - had several specials listed on their board but went with a burger. It was ok - could use a little more flavor, but something I'd expect from a diner. The fries were really good though! Service was somewhat slow, but very friendly. I will return to try breakfast. Seems like a good place for a cup of coffee or a family to have breakfast."}
{"text":"I ordered Texas special omelette and meat lover omelette and maples bacon waffles. The flavor is great and the service is great.  I can't believe I miss this place by living around here for 4 years. Definitely will come every week"}
{"text":"I would give this place a 4 or 5 for the food especially the pancakes but give it only 2 because the prices are kind of high for a \"diner\" and the service is really bad. The last time there, the waitress was rude, ignoring us because she was too busy talking to other people and also snapping at the cooks - we were at the counter by the window to the kitchen and could overhear this. Anyway, we will probably return because the breakfasts are good."}
{"text":"Nice quite diner, tucked away in a small plaza in Twinsburg. Almost missed it driving right by. Stepping in, we were warmly greeted by the wait staff and a humble interior. Service was on par and never let the coffee cup go dry! The Texas omelette was decent, not a lot of pulled beef, but I did like the chipotle sauce. I was a little disappointed with the pancake, not that fluffy and a little dry. The corned beef hash was real corned beef. Overall, decent but a little pricey for what we got."}
{"text":"My family and were visiting from Chicago. We used to live in Cleveland and loved chagrin falls. So using yelp I decided on fresh start. We were 15 people and had called in advance. The mommment we got there the attitude started. The waitress started banging things on the table. When we asked for napkins she made a face.  We gave our orders for omelette and pancakes.  While we were waiting for our food, we asked for a few extra forks the attitude was rude. Once our food came , my friend found out that her Greek omelet had bacon. We called the waitress to take it back and make a new found. She took it back saying we should have read the menu in a condescending manner. She took it back with an attitude. The manager had the audacity to come to our ta Table and ask us why we had yelled at his waitress. He was obnoxious and it was obvious he was trying to upset our party. We were angry but to add to our anger they bought back the omelette without toast and potatoes. We felt singled out because we're Asians. We felt they were racist. I do not recommend anyone go there. We did not eat the omelette but they still charged us. No customer service rude!! The manager was the worst p"}
{"text":"We were looking for a non-chain restaurant for lunch so we consulted Yelp. The Fresh Start Diner is a small place but packed with locals (always a good sign). We were quickly seated and perused the multi-page menu consisting of breakfast (served anytime), burgers, various salads, and sandwiches. Service was friendly,  prompt and attentive. The food was some of the best we've ever had in a diner - crispy, golden-brown thick-cut fries, hand-formed burgers, lean, stacked corned beef, homemade corned beef hash - all generously portioned. If you leave a tip for the cooks, you'll be permitted to ring the cowbell. In response you'll hear a bunch of whoops and howls from the kitchen.  :)  Great food, atmosphere and fun! We'll return!"}
{"text":"My twin and I were in town for a twin festival and came across this small diner for breakfast. I ordered a waffle with strawberries, egg whites and orange juice. Their OJ tasted so fresh and their waffle was superb. Their staff was friendly and gave information on places to visit. Great customer service and great place to talk with locals."}
{"text":"Awesome breakfast with delicious fresh squeezed orange juice.  Large gluten-free menu with bakery items."}
{"text":"Gluten free bread is the best and so is Carol the waitress. Every restaurant should have a Carol.  She is a joy"}
{"text":"Quaint little diner in twinsburg! There are a few tables and counter space to sit. Classic diner food for breakfast including original omelettes. Good low cost food"}
{"text":"I like this place!! Very good service and very friendly staff. Orders were taken quickly and food presentation was great!!  Listen for the Cow Bell, its very interesting!! LoL  I ordered the 2 egg breakfast with ham and pancakes. Food was very good, although the pancakes were a bit stiff. Still very tasty to say the least! I wil visit again and try some of the other items on the menu."}
{"text":"You want pickles veggies, Bloody Mary bars, and other hipster staples?  You will not find that here.  This is basic, honest down home like your local down home breakfast hub would make? Well, Fresh Start is that down home breakfast joint, and they serve lunch as well.  They serve eggs, eggs, eggs, sausage, sausage, sausage, bacon, bacon, and bacon.  Toast me, white (though of course they have other bread).  And coffee, black.  It's a nondescript location that you have to look for, though it's right on Twinsburg's square."}
{"text":"I've been coming here for a couple years now and this place never disappoints. Food is superb and fairly priced! The atmosphere is homely and friendly. If you're around the area of Twinsburg I highly recommend checking this place out!"}
{"text":"I had salami & eggs and B had buckwheat pancakes. Amazing tastes! We had brunch, there will be no need for dinner. There are at least 6 or 7 other menu items I look forward to trying. The ingredients are fresh. The food is well made. There is no skimping  because when 'cakes need maple syrup, real maple syrup is what you get!   We arrived late, around 12:45pm, and the place was full, no empty tables.  It's a \"seat yourself\" kind of place, but whomever is closest to the door greets new arrivals. We slid into seats at the counter & thought we might have a wait for service. No waiting, attentive service, coffee appeared as soon as it was needed.   All in all, I love this place!"}
{"text":"Slooow getting a waitress, and we sat at the counter. But once we ordered, the food was good, and our glasses were kept full. The guy next to us had a big burger and the best looking onion rings."}
{"text":"Almost the worst breakfast I've ever had. And that includes that time that I burnt both the eggs and the toast.  Service was horrifying. The lady who was our waitress literally looked like she could not be bothered with us. Eye rolls at requests and she got two of my family's orders wrong (not even in the ballpark). Probably because she barely wrote anything down, it was hellaciously busy, oh yeah--and she walked away while my sister was still ordering.   The food ranged between 'eh', 'bland', and 'okay--not the worst, I'll give them this one'. Nothing to write home about.  Oh--and beware the front of the building has what looks to be four or five large hornet's nests. Be prepared to run!"}
{"text":"Delicious! Excellent food, excellent service! We moved here in August and have been looking for a good breakfast place. It took us long enough to find Fresh Start but we are very glad we did!"}
{"text":"I've only had the breakfast food so I can't comment on anything else, but the food is pretty good, reasonably priced,  friendly staff and usually there is no wait."}
{"text":"Not sure how this is first time hearing of this place.  Small diner that locals seem to know about and is packed. They have a counter that you can sit and eat at.  We were seated quickly and the owner immediately took drink order. We ea ordered omelette and i ordered cheeses( provolone) and fresh spinach. The fluffiest omelette! And sliced potato home fries and your choice of toast. Fiance.. 2 more months that title ordered Alice's corned beef hash omelette. Real corned beef hash  and smothered in provolone cheese. Same potatoes and he got their challah bread. The waitress kept coming around refilling his coffee.    $21 great value for home cooked food."}
{"text":"Benedict 4 ways is a great concept but wasn't excellently executed. Choices were to have ham, crab cake, corn beef hash or portobello mushroom. All options sound delicious but we're just underwhelming. We tried the corn beef hash, crab cake and mushroom. All were good but not the work of a master breakfast chef. Crab cake seemed like it was a processed frozen patty, the portobello was sliced thin and the corn beef was just ok. However, the hollandaise sauce was thick, rich, and flavorful. The skillet potatoes were cooked perfectly crisp."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a late breakfast.  Was greeted and sat quickly.  Did take a little while for us to order food, weren't in rush though, but our food came out very quickly and hot.  Eggs Benedict with ham and home fries was very good.  Very large menu selection as well.  Great place for the reasonable price.  Next visit we will sit at the breakfast bar."}
