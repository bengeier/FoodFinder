{"text":"Great food, great service, and great price.  I have been to a lot of Mexican restaurants in the Cleveland area, and Dos Coronas tops my list.  Food comes out hot and quick.  Staff is helpful and friendly.  The chips and salsa come immediately upon arrival.  Besides the food the restaurant and facilities are kept very clean."}
{"text":"We love this place. Our fav inexpensive Mexican place in the area. Good margaritas, yummy guacamole, fajitas big enough to split for two and fast, friendly service. Salsa is good and fresh with cilantro and has a variety of hot sauces to add to it if you like it hot."}
{"text":"This place was a pleasant surprise.  We stopped over in Macedonia on our way from NY to Chicago, and we've eaten plenty of good Mexican in both big cities.  We came to Dos Coronas to avoid the usual chains and didn't expect much.  But our food was really enjoyable, even though (maybe because?) we strayed off the Mexican standards.  The mahi mahi was well cooked with a delicious pico de gallo, and the skirt steak with peppers was tender and tasty.  Loved the salsa that came with the chips, too.  The decor could use some pepping up (I love the colorful decorations on the walls of some Mexican restaurants), but we still had a good time and would definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"Not sure this is the place for you if you want to recreate that trip to Mexico food-wise, but the food, though perhaps a bit gringo-ized at times, is really quite good, and consistently so. Staff are very friendly and efficient, and the service is a couple notches above most other mexican places (e.g. they actually check in regularly to see if you'd like a refill, or anything else! Why is that so hard, other Mexican restaurant guys?). It doe NOT not look like an old Denny's inside--it's comfortable, with attractive booths and tables. The salsa's are quite good and not overly hot. Prices are quite reasonable. POpular but not often crowded, so is a great place when the chains have an hour wait (and the food is way better, too). Family friendly and right off Rt 8 on West Highland. Recommended."}
{"text":"I really like Dos Coronas. The fresh salsa is so delicious. The service is pretty good! The servers never leave the costumers sitting for long periods of time without asking if we would like something. The men at the counter are very friendly. The dishes are very good and prices are affordable. The happy hour drinks are cheap and delicious as well. Lastly, when I order pick up they are done in 10 to 15 minutes. They are never late in preparing my order. Also, a positive point is that pick up food comes with free chips and salsa!"}
{"text":"I've probably been in 30+ Mexican restaurants and this is in my top 3. The chips come out super fast, margs are on point, and the food is excellent."}
{"text":"Since the original owners left this formerly fave place has gone way downhill in quality and WAY uphill on steep sneaky pricing... Almost $5 for 2 kids milks, really? I can hit Giant Eagle to get ripped off for milk right down the road...food is looking more like mushy Mexican jail food and the place is not being kept up in the sanitary Dept. Hate to see what the kitchen looks like."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Mexican restaurant. The salsa is always fresh, people always nice, price is right and drinks are amazing along with the food. Rumor has it they are moving locations, hopefully it's not far :) . This used to be a Dennys and they remodled it and it looks amazingly beautiful."}
{"text":"Found this in Yelp and drove around and around looking for it. Found out it is permanently closed. Yelp needs to post that when it is edited in Business Info."}
{"text":"Best Mexican around. Great cheese dip and margaritas. We go once a week and the service is so quick you don't even have time to finish your chips. You gotta try this place."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTELY THE BEST MEXICAN FOOD EVER! Amazing service! the food is authentic Mexican, its hot, they personalize any order for picky eaters (me)! They also have a nice little american selection and kids selection to meet everyone's needs. The staff is amazing so friendly and attentive. I enjoy every time i'm here. the food is to die for! Melt in your mouth Queso dip with chips mmm! and the chefs special tres taquitos! and dollar taco night Monday and Tuesday is great! I HIGHLY recommend i have had only positive experiences with dos coronas! LOVE!!"}
{"text":"Great, inexpensive mexican food.   Just as good or better than Luchitas or Marcelitas at 2/3s the price!  I love the enchiladas, and the chips and salsa very fresh and tasty.   The food is promptly served and the restaurant is clean.   A real find!"}
{"text":"We went to Dos Coronas for dinner last night, a Friday. We got there about 5:20 and there were 2 tables open. They were packed the entire time, too.

We were quickly given chips and salsa upon being seated and the waitress was quick to take our drinks - iced tea and raspberry tea.

We ordered the sampler appetizer to get a taste of a few different foods, and then we both ordered the seafood fajitas. 

The appetizer came out within 5-6 minutes and had a good selection on it. We got 3/4 of the way through it before a guy showed up and rushed us with the food. He put the fajita trays down, then sat down the plates of rice, beans and fixings. We didn't get any tortillas at first but a few minutes later they showed up, dropped off by another person.

I went to make my first fajita and realized we got shrimp instead of seafood. I called over the waitress and she assured me she had heard shrimp, not seafood. Ok, whatever.

So we ate what we had. I will say it was delicious! Everything, from the sampler, to the fajitas to the fixings, even the salsa, was really good! The only thing that tasted a bit off was the nacho chips. Every now and again I'd pick up that hint of greasy broiler taste on them.

So after attempting to clear our plates (we failed miserably!!!), we asked for the check.

We were charged $14.99 for the shrimp fajitas, and without a menu to check, that seemed to be the price of the seafood fajitas, not the shrimp ones. I could be wrong. But on top of it, there were two charges on there for .75 each listed as AYF. I don't know what that is or what they were for. I didn't get to ask because she grabbed our card and bill and ran w it. My husband said just to forget about it. But if it's there when we go back, I'm definitely going to say something.

So check your bill!!! Otherwise, enjoy!"}
{"text":"Overall great value and service for the money.  Dos Coronas has always been a solid choice for Mexican in the area.  The staff is friendly and promptly brings chips and salsa for the table.  After our order is placed, our dinners often arrive before our chips are gone.  Well done on the service and hot food.  I tend to get the Super Burrito (beef and chicken) and am always pleasantly surprised at how good it is.  This restaurant is a great find, but am disappointed to learn that it will be soon moving to Sagamore Hills, due to the takeover of the space by the GetGo station next door.  Do yourself a favor and try the food here."}
{"text":"Well another great meal in town!! Fajitas for two has everything u can want!!  I really was not wanting steak but was delightfully surprised with the flavor of the chicken, pork, shrimp, chorizo & steak together. We could only eat half soo another meal for later!! What a great deal and our bill only $21!!!!  Chips n salsa warm n tasty also. Till next time"}
{"text":"The food is good, service is good, and the drinks are great... Its American Mexican food. My family is from Mexico and this a step above the typical tacos / burritos mexican restaurant you find in this area. If your in this area and looking for Mexican food or cheap quality food then check this place out."}
{"text":"We have been going to Dos Coronas for well over two years.  The last few times the service has not been good and orders were messed up.  The margaritas used to be wonderful and you could really taste the tequila...not so any more.  We could not taste any tequila.  Then, to top off the less than good service, bad drinks and wrong orders, we had to wait for our check to leave.  Sorry, but we will not be returning."}
{"text":"I always get the same thing when I go.this time I decided to try something different and really glad that I did..the quesadilla fajita was really good..the service was great, food was great, atmosphere was good, and it was very clean"}
{"text":"Visiting from Chicago. I got take out dinner. The food was delicious and it hit the spot. Awesome fast service too :) thank you!!!"}
{"text":"2 quesadillas, 2 tamales y 3 tacos to go.  Seems like a good product, very fast out the door, a little bland for our very spicy tastes - grab sauce.  Friendly.  They threw in chips, awesome.  We'd go back for sure"}
{"text":"I eat here whenever I'm home to Cleveland with my mom (I live in Dallas).  Always pretty good, best Mexican around, but wasn't totally on par with Texas' Mexican.  Things have changed, this last visit the food was fantastic! They changed ingredients for the better - meat quality / quantity, sauces, cheese beans, everything was great. Highly recommend, best you can get and on par with Texas."}
{"text":"If you are sadistic enough to enjoy ridiculously spicy food that will bring tears to your eyes and joy to your taste buds, come here and ask for the spicy salsa with your chips. You will not be disappointed... Wow! I'm pretty sure they use habanero peppers, which are rated as the 3rd hottest peppers, with jalape√±o peppers being 1/10th as hot ( the Indian Bhut Jolokia is #1 [and 4x hotter than a habanero ])

I also had the 'fire chicken burrito', which, although spicy, was not as spicy as the salsa. That problem was quickly solved by pouring the salsa on the burrito. The chicken was nice and tender and easily fell apart under a fork. The staff was friendly even though 7 of us rolled in 40 mins before closing time and stayed well until 20 minutes after closing. You'll notice by my other reviews that I have a tendency to eat late.

I'm sure if I were to rate this tomorrow morning I would give it only 3 stars because of the extreme burning pain leaving my body.

The wee ones I was with really enjoyed the el queso ( that's Spanish for 'the queso') dip"}
{"text":"This is my second time at Dos Coronas.   Both visits were positive.  The restaurant is clean, food is fresh and the service is great.  On this visit, I brought my teenage daughter.  Immediately upon being seated, we were given a large basket of warm tortilla chips and a crock of homemade salsa (slightly spicy, but yummy).  I ordered a Margarita (on the rocks) and the Dos Coronas fajita platter, which included chicken, shrimp, steak and veggies.   My daughter ordered the chicken  quesadilla.  My food arrived hot and sizzling on a cast iron server.  My daughter's food arrived at the same time, but her quesadilla included veggies, which she doesn't like and was not in the description on the menu.   The server was very accommodating and immediately took the entree away and arrived a few minutes later with a replacement entree, free of veggies!.  We never had to ask for water/soft drink refills, our server also brought us a second basket of tortilla chips without being asked.  The entree portions were more than generous especially with the sides of rice, pico, guac, lettuce, tomato and sour cream.  All-in-all this was a really good meal, we will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Nice daily special list... margaritas are not terrific... but not neon green either. Love the burrito bowls... all the great fillings and toppings without the soggy wrapper.

Coupons come in the mail monthly as part of the local coupon flyer... so it is super packed for the next week or so but once everyone goes through the coupons the dinner service is about half busy.

The staff does not all understand English.  We have never had a problem with orders, but we do ask them to read it back before leaving the table after seeing several other folks have trouble."}
{"text":"Solid Mexican food off the interstate? Yes!

Just because Mexican American food is Mexican \"American\", doesn't mean it has to lack flavor. My chile colorado was good and spicy. The other 5 folks in my party really enjoyed their food as well. Everything was fresh, flavorful, comforting, well portioned, and affordable. The service was timely, attentive, and very friendly.

Nice work Dos Coronas! Keep it up!"}
{"text":"I was skeptical of trying a Mexican restaurant that was built in an old Denny's location, but my daughter REALLY wanted a quesadilla for dinner, and it was close by.

I was pleasantly surprised to find that the interior had been redone with a lot of dark wood - flooring, half-walls - and the sort of fern green and wood combo lent a comfortable ambience. My daughter managed to shatter that with typical 4-year old behavior, but at least it looked nice.

I ordered a pork burrito with onions and salsa verde. It was good, but there were a LOT of onions, and the onions were not cooked long enough - they were still very crisp, not translucent yet...not the way I like my onions. Nit-picking, I know.

Service was good, food was decent, price was acceptable.  I did think the menu was a little small compared to what I am used to seeing at a Mexican place, but that's not necessarily a bad thing.

This will likely become one of my fave mexican places, though I won't order that same dish next time."}
{"text":"Great Mexican food.  Margaritas are big, and plenty of food to take home as well.  Got the Dos Caronas Fajitas which are chicken, beef, and shrimp.  Very well cooked and tasty.  Glad I had the choice of beans or rice because I don't like beans.  I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Yes, Pritesh, that spicy salsa is amazing!!!!!

The rest of the food was pretty good, typical Mexican restaurant fare. I have to say the mango margarita was slightly disappointing though.

All in all, not bad.

I'd definitely go back for a beer and some chips & salsa!!"}
{"text":"Another 3.5 yelp!  Pretty good, above average, and ok in price.  

Typical chips and dip, but the cream sauce dinners are good.  

The dining was very clean and friendly.  I would defiantly go again."}
{"text":"I was actually sort of shocked to see so many highly rated reviews here. Maybe I just ordered the wrong items? 

It's a pretty generic Mexican food restaurant. But there were so many little things adding up during my dinner there that I just couldn't really look past it. This started with my wine, which was warm. I think it must have been kept by a refrigerator, or lamp, but it was basically tea. 

I ordered a beef taco and a beef stuffed pepper. The meal came and I told the waiter that I think there was a mistake, because on the plate was a beef taco and a big wrapped up burrito. He assured me that WAS the stuffed pepper. He was right, but I did not realize (because it was NOWHERE in the description) that the stuffed peppers were wrapped up in tortillas. So, eventually I dug my pepper out of the tortilla to find that the \"beef\" in the pepper and the beef in the taco are definitely not the same beef. The taco was fine, looked and tasted like a taco. The beef in the pepper looked more like catfood, and tasted pretty spot on to catfood. I basically just ate around the \"beef\" and tortilla, and just tried to get pepper. 

Overall, not the best experience, and I probably would not go back because of it."}
{"text":"I'll preface this by saying I recently moved from San Diego to here so I have high expectations for mexican food.

That being said...this place is great! I had the $1 tacos and $1.99 margarita and was pretty impressed. The tacos used canned meat and chicken but they used quite a bit of it, there was lots of good cheese, and it was a $1. They were better than taco bell and about as good as something I'd make at home. Nothing like street tacos but I wasn't expecting that. The $1.99 margarita was DELICIOUS! They didn't skimp on tequila and the consistency was really good. 

My wife loved her bean burrito and the quesodilla she had was really good.  Is this super authentic mexican food? Not from what I saw. Is it good food? Yeah, absolutely.

Also, the staff was GREAT! Our waitress, though very new, was super attentive and always checked in on us. 

We will absolutely be back again."}
{"text":"My favorite restaurant! Fast, cheap and delicious! The staff is friendly and great atmosphere :)"}
{"text":"We frequent here often, and are never let down. It's good for a nice quick and easy meal, and the staff is friendly. I have recommended this place to so many of my local friends. We will continually be coming back!"}
{"text":"Excellent salsa and chips.  We ordered Miller Lites, but the waiter brought one Bud Lite and one Miller Lite.  I ordered the Fiesta Fajita, which featured steak, chicken and bacon, pineapples and poblano peppers smothered in cheese.  Delicious!  Enough food to feed at least two.  My wife ordered the California Burrito and loved it.  Not exactly authentic Mexican, but very good food at a decent price.The only negative was spotty service, although the place was practically empty.   We will be back."}
{"text":"Excellente Mexicana food. Chicken fajitas were bomb and they are definitely enough for 2 only thing I disliked is that they only give 3 tortillas whaaaaaaa!? Then charge you for another order, not cool! Margaritas were standard not bad not fantastical. Would return here."}
{"text":"Excellent and affordable. The food is both authentic and delicious. The service is excellent, and the kitchen is willing to accommodate guests with greater spiciness on menu options. Great Sangria, and good drink deals."}
{"text":"Good service, good food and good salsa. Best Mexican I've had in the area, though certainly not the best Mexican food I've ever had. Lunch specials are the way to go here."}
{"text":"My favorite Mexican restaurant in the Cleveland/Akron area. The thing I like most about it is that the food is not as greasy and salty as other places. Portions are big and priced fairly. I am usually a chicken fajitas guy at most places, but this place has made me try different things and I liked every one."}
{"text":"This is your typical \"fast\" Mexican food restaurant.  The food is good, service is good, and the drinks are yummy.  Not sure what more you are looking for as long as you know that it isn't true Mexican food."}
