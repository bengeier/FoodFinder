{"text":"I got here it's loud! Everyone is having a good time! Beer is cold and the wings are bomb! It's ghetto but it's in the hood so duh!"}
{"text":"I'm a regular. So I would say my review is very accurate. 

The place is in the hood. So to outsiders, there are \"sketchy\" looking people. But to me, they're just people looking to have a few drinks like I am. Just don't fuck with anybody and you'll be fine. But that goes for anywhere. 

The food is amazing. Hot wings & cheesy fries with shredded cheese!! - Sometimes the crew slacks and you have to wait an hour for food. Sometimes the service is slow. Sometimes you have to serve yourself. 

The drinks are so cheap. The prices have gone up a little bit but you don't ever find mixed drinks under $5 anymore. Patron shots are close to $6 bucks.

They have a jukebox that is cheap too. With 5 bucks I played about 16 songs. & the jukebox has old and new songs. 

ONE downer to this establishment is karaoke. Karaoke should be fun. But here, it's so annoying. You have people singing sad ass songs that put you in a downer mood. Heavy metal songs that give you a headache. -- I know Karaoke is whatever you want to sing. But they have this going on for hours!! It should be held down to 2 hours. And then let us pay for music. 
I leave early half the time because the karaoke is annoying half the time. 

--- I'm 23 btw. The crowd that goes there is mostly older people. Sometimes a younger crowd goes in. I find I like this bar to really just hang out and drink (before karaoke starts) or to get a cheap buzz on before I go out somewhere else."}
{"text":"Came here on a Saturday night, about 8:30pm.

Great atmosphere, loving the lighting and ambiance! 

They have three pool tables, dart boards, a boxing machine, and best of all OFF-TRACK BETTING. Pretty rare! There is also your standard Internet Jukebox, and they even have a stuffed animal claw machine. So fun.

My husband got an inexpensive pitcher of Amber Bock, and we got an equally inexpensive sampler of fried zucchini, mushrooms, and mozzarella sticks! 

Food came out super fast, no lack of quality though considering the swiftness from the kitchen! 

Awesome huge menu, great prices. 
Service is great, very nice staff!

10/10 would recommend coming here for a bite to eat and to enjoy the atmosphere. This place is quite the gem."}
{"text":"Great hot wings and burgers with fries. Orders may be slow somtimes but its worth the wait. Great Juke-Box, Kareoke Night on Fridays and Saturdays, you can play pool and play darts in the back. the atmosphere is very fun and lively I had a great time when I was visiting and I will surelly be back when I have the chance."}
{"text":"Good wings but aside from that service was really bad, I had a corona and a friend had a soft drink and even though the bartender was right in front of us he was on his laptop the whole time and didn't even bothered to offered us more soda or beer. Took a decade to give us the bill and the place had like less than 10 people in there.  Wouldn't go back, there are better places on the area."}
{"text":"Best wings ever! Good place to go if you just wanna chill. It's not a \"scary\" place. Lol
The karaoke has to go it f***s up my buzz everytime."}
{"text":"The chicken wings are the best!! Always consistent and never dry with the taste. Hats off to the cook."}
{"text":"OMG what a sh@t hole. Menu states the burgers are 1 lb.... BS.... they weren't even an 1/8 lb and cooked till hard ( not just mine, everyone in our group). The barmaid talked so much to her co=workers, it took 15 minutes to just get a drink order in. Then another 15 before she came back to give us menus, then another 15 minutes to take our order.....wait, it gets better...... wait to you see the homeless looking man cooking......
NEVER GO HERE TO EAT !"}
{"text":"was going in to try but the police showed up in force so we decided to wait.. this is close to our house so its ghetto.. going to try back later!!"}
{"text":"I love the cheesy fries and their wings are the bomb. And the peolpe are friendly and cool."}
{"text":"Cool bouncer opened the door for us gave him our ID. 
Go up to the horseshoe bar, bartender was talking to a set of older ladies given them advice as to what they should get.  After a while gives up and says I'll be back and comes right to me. I ask for a pitcher tells me I should get a bottle the dispenser is shooting warm beer i couldn't believe it so I look around and see a number of pitchers so I ask \"are they drinking warm beer \" he shakes his head with a eyebrow raised. Get my beer and a water for the lady. As I head to the dart boards I notice it looked nothing like the pictures. After pushing bicycles out of the way I created a nice line to play in. Very old machines but cheap. karaoke screaming in the background. Man passed out cold on the counter. Played a round finished my bottled beer and left......they say the food is good but if looks dirty where people can see so I don't want to know what it looks like where I can't see."}
{"text":"Service is terrible. Food is whatever. The place is very sketchy and tense like someone will get stabbed at anytime. Idk its weird."}
{"text":"Wow. Went to this place once and in less than 15 minutes someone...maybe multiple people got stabbed. Never coming here again!"}
{"text":"Met up with a friend here to have some drinks. The crowd was very sketchy. Lots of bikers and hoodlums. Was a hold on tight to your wallet tight type of place. Although I hear they have very good wings. Might have to hire a body guard and go check them out."}
{"text":"GOOD WINGS BAD SERVICE! I Had ordered wings over the phone and had given them my card number..but once i had arrived to pick my order up; I had realized they have over charged my card by $100!!! When i asked to speak with a manager she refused to speak with me personally.I was bewildered and completely put off by the blaten disregard that i asked for a complete refund and left!! NEVER WILL RETURN-COMPLETE DISAPPOINTMENT"}
{"text":"I always hear this place has very good wings, so I decided to try it. I'm sorry, but I can't wait over 40 minutes for take out wings no matter how good the wings are. The waiter acted like she didn't want me in there. She kept telling other customers \"your food will be out shorty\" leaving me in the dark. Hopefully, if there's a next time I can give you guy's a review on the food and my experience will be better."}
{"text":"A rough old boozer fer shure but as long as you know what you are in for you will have fun.  There is good wait staff and not so good wait staff - - luck of the draw depending on the day of the week.  Plenty of Tejano music on the jukebox - it is a kick when everybody starts singing en espanol.  The boxer machine is awesome.  Anything out of the fryer is good."}
{"text":"I'm a regular of this place and have been for around ten years now. I normally love this dirty little dive bar but today I had the worst service I've ever received here, and as a regular I know that's saying a lot. These new Hajies running the kitchen and counter are horrible. And please go back to the old wings, purple turtle has changed the size/type of wing you get served now and it sucks. They once had the best wings in town with the best horrible service to match now it's just all garbage"}
{"text":"The wings!!!! Neighborhood bar, friendly staff! Karaoke Sundays! Have a good selection of bar food. The establishment is older,  but overall decent place for a cold brew and wings!"}
{"text":"Best wings this side of  the pearly gates! Has that ghetto cheers kind of feel. It is a total hole in the wall but the prices are good and the drinks are strong. Kareoke could use a ringer though!"}
{"text":"When I got my salad, a dirty fork was also delivered. When I asked for a new one I was brought a second dirty fork. At this point I asked for a plastic to-go fork. The salad itself was mediocre at best. The White Russian that was ordered was made with milk not Kahl√∫a.....not sure what that was about. Needless to say, it was a waste of my time and money! Will not return!"}
{"text":"FINALLY this place closed down the horse races! No more horse betting and no more having to walk through a sea of gamblers when you come in here! It's about time!! Now, fix your goddamn booths!"}
{"text":"Just  had lunch at the Purple Turtle with my husband and daughter and I have to say it's was a disappointment the food wasn't very good the beer was crap and hot the soda was syrupy with no CO2 I told the server that it was out and she brought me a new one but it was still the same and it wasn't taken off the bill after I asked for it off if I didn't drink it I don't think I should pay for it overall the  bar is over priced for the shitty quality and service that you receive."}
{"text":"This place is a total dive bar - but in the best possible way! We were hesitant with the other reviews, but we had a great time! Food is typical bar food, but Steve the bartender is great! Hidden Gem."}
{"text":"Unfortunately the smell coming out of there smells like bad oil so the food wasn't worth tasting and the crowd that goes in there is just a little too rough for me not a very good location and not very good parking not well lit up"}
{"text":"Great great hot wings,  who knew. Good prices on beer and mix drinks. It is a whole in the wall but I don't mind them. Several pool tables and they play music, no wierd silence."}
