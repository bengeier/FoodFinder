{"text":"Bar none the best pizza in four counties. That's it.  That's the bottom line.  Do this.  Order the pizza. Eat the pizza.  Love the pizza!  Actually this is probably the best pie in the Cleveland area.  Thank you Fratellos!"}
{"text":"I ordered pizza to be delivered they told me an hour it's now going on two hours, and they will not answer there phone. So  rude. I'll give 2 stars because they do have a good pizza but there service can be a deal breaker.!!!!!"}
{"text":"I just went to Fratellos for the first time with my family and my son had a great time with the pizzas. He's 7 and he's very picky."}
{"text":"Great pizza! Ordered sheet pizzas for a graduation party and it was so popular I had to order more! They delivered quickly and saved the day!"}
{"text":"Outstanding pizza !  It's my favorite in the area! The crust melts in your mouth, regular or thin. I am looking forward to trying other menu items, but I love their PIZZA!!"}
{"text":"Been going to them for 10 years. Even after they moved from their old location on the corner of Pearl Road & Stumph Road. The quality never changed, and was great to see them in their new location in Southland. Keep up the great job. It's always a a once a week stop for pizza."}
{"text":"Got bored with all my usual pizza places and decided to give Fratello's a try. It's a little out of the way between home and work but it was worth the extra drive. The pizza was very good. They definitely don't skimp on toppings on the supreme. The salad was very fresh. No questionable looking pieces of lettuce. The price was great. 2 large pizzas and a large salad for under 30 bucks. They even got our request of no black olives right. It was a good experience all the way around."}
{"text":"I tried Fratellos for the first time tonight. I ordered two calzones with our favorite toppings. I gotta say it was absolutely delicious. THE BEST calzone I've had in a very long time! One calzone can easily feed two people. They are loaded up with cheese and toppings, and cooked to perfection! Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Put me on hold for 15min. Probably the rudest customer service I've ever experienced. If you can't take my order why even have a delivery service."}
{"text":"I ordered crispy wings and they did a great JOB very meaty 20 for 16$ , I had my own sauce , and minus the grease smell in my house it was a faboulus Friday evening ! Good Job ! Iwill return ! My belly is full !!!!"}
{"text":"Great pizza!  We order for my shop every week!   A ton of toppings, great crust!  Love them"}
{"text":"I have only gotten delivery from Fratellos. The very first one I had was awesome with the works! After that, I got a two topping of mushrooms and pepperoni, which was average tasting, but crust was nice and chewy like I like it. The third and probably last time I ordered the works again and it was terribly greasy! The crust was good, though, as it always has been. It is pricy as far as I'm concerned. This pizza establishment was recommended by a friend, which is why I gave it a go. Honestly, when considering a deal and a quick meal, I prefer Little Caesar's. It's greasy, yes, but when we don't feel like making homemade pizza, we really like Little Caesar's."}
{"text":"This is a fairly new busintess by Southland Shopping Center.  They have a decent menu for a pizza place.  But Im here for pizza and a stromboli.  Being happy to have more artiery meat than healthy veggies, I got a mega meat pizza (Pepperoni, Italian Sausage, Ham, Bacon, and Ground Beef). I comuld not see the cheese under the toppings!!  Oh yeah, the toppings are all very good too.  The sauce is completely overwhelmed by the meat toppings.  The crust is bread like, very light, neither crisp nor chewy.  The stromboli was really good.  The ssmall stromboli was about the size of a normal large pizza.  The sauce for stromboli was lightly seasoned but good with cheese, ham, salami, and pepperoni.  You have a choice of mild or Jalapeno peppers.

The salads are in a display case, and everything looked very fresh and decent sized.  The restruant has about 10 tables.  I was  taking out order.  They had a very busy phone for delivery and it was Tuesday.  Definitely wrorth a trying.  Prices are reasonable.  Speciality Pizza are $9.99 small 6 cut, 13.49 medium 8 cut, and 15.49 large 10 cut."}
{"text":"Great pizza with fresh toppings and a great crust!!! Our favorite is the Supreme with the awesome sausage."}
{"text":"Quick delivery. For $15.50 I got a small works pizza and small salad delivered. Absolutely delicious. Posted a picture.
I was on the hunt for a pizza with the kitchen sink on it AND fresh mushrooms. A difficult task actually. Why most places use canned mushrooms I'll never understand, but this place did not disappoint. A lot of food for the price. Would recommend"}
{"text":"Surprised. I wouldn't say it's the BEST pizza around, but it's good pizza. And clean. That was the real shocker for me. 

I had intended on going to Bucci's Brick Oven across the street, but they weren't open yet, and I had just driven by Friaello's, so I figured what the heck? 

It doesn't look like much from the outside; I think it's an old Arthur Treacher's, but never judge a book... 

I was pleasantly surprised by the friendly waitress, clean dining room, and tasty pizza. I got the veggie. Sauce could be better (warmer maybe), but it was still good. JoJo fries with ranch dressing were also delicious (I think they're making good use of the old Treacher's fryer, lol. Another nice touch was the fresh Parmesan cheese in the shakers. 

I considered 4-stars, but there are definitely better pizza places to be found around town. That said, in a pinch, I wouldn't count out Fratello's."}
{"text":"Love Fratello's, we have ordered many times and the food is fresh & delish. Their Calzones, WOW! Pizza, WOW, Chicken Parm, WOW!"}
{"text":"I love this place!! I love local \"mom & pop\" kind of Italian food places, and we go here a lot when we want a good meal. I do love the pizza, the stromboli is great too. I am a big fan of the chicken parm dinner."}
{"text":"cold delivery!!  Very rude customer service.  Not the cleanest looking place"}
{"text":"If I could give this place zero stars I would! We have been loyal customers to Fratello's for years since they opened at their first location! We will never be back again! Fratello's does not care about their loyal customers! They care more about a $13 discrepancy! I would think twice before you visit this establishment!
I ordered a sheet pizza with one topping! The pizza should have been $21.99 + $3.99 for the topping! I asked for a different topping on each corner! That is still one topping! They charge me $39 for a pizza that should have cost $26.00! They charged me an extra $13 for the pizza!!!  I was not informed that I was being charged for more than one topping!!! Call any other pizza place and they will tell you that is one topping!!!! I am livid! The owner or manager proceeded to argue with me! Refused to fix the problem! I was even planning on ordering my sons graduation party food from them!!!!  Not now! I will find a new place that cares about their customers! On top of all of that they cannot follow direction or fulfill orders properly! I have repeatedly received onions on items that I have stated specifically \"no onions please!!!!\"
 I am done with this place! I hope it was worth upsetting a customer over $13 and losing thousands of $$$ of future business!
Needless to say the Fratello's takeout menu is in the trash!!!!"}
{"text":"Super Bowl evening, other pizza places we'd ordered from before had 1.5 hour wait.  So we called Fratello's to see what they could do for us.  They were very busy too, but our pizza was done in about 30 minutes.

Wow!  We were all so pleased when we threw open the lid to find our large Supreme pizza laden with tasty toppings.   It was perfect, and I'm pretty picky about my pizza.  

I'm not a fan of doughy pizzas, so their crust was great.  Not too thin, and definitely not too thick...... but maybe we asked for a thin crust, I'm not sure.  So if you like a thin crust, ask and see what they say  =)

No doubt about it, we'll be back for another!"}
{"text":"Stopped in after a very busy day after work. Ordered a pizza was told it was going to take 30 minutes. I didn't want to wait so I asked if it could be delivered. Cashier told me that wouldn't be a problem and would even try to push my pizza through faster. So I go home, and an hour later still no pizza. So I call and get a lady with a really thick accent. I proceed to tell her that I was told 30 minutes and it's been an hour. She told me it was on the way. She then proceeded to give me attitude when I asked why an hour. She started yelling at me through the phone exclaiming that the cashier (who was super nice) didn't quote me the right time and I also owed a delivery fee. I told her she didn't need to give me attitude or yell at me and she just got louder. I told her I didn't want the pizza and to just refund the money. She proceeded to tell me that I would take the pizza and she would not refund my money. I told her that's fine I would dispute her charge with my bank. 30 minutes later, the cashier showed up with my pizza. At that time I had already given my kids dinner. I told him I didn't want the pizza and I fortunately due to the lady at the establishment I would never be ordering from them again. I'm currently fighting them on the charge because she refused to refund my money and still does a week later. 

*update*
They still refuse to refund my card. I called and spoke with Eric and he advised me that I'm a B(curse word) and I'll never see that money again. My bank is currently disputing the charge."}
{"text":"Although I am giving them 3stars, it is for the the FOOD. I ordered on 3/5/17 and the \"service\" was completely terrible for various reasons. Gonna put them in \"time out\" for awhile. Give some other pizza shops a chance for now."}
{"text":"Had the opportunity to try some Fratello's pizza recently. We had a half cheese and half pepperoni pizza for dinner. It was delicious! The ingredients were fresh and the sauce was good as was the crust. I'd like to visit again to taste a veggie pizza.

We'll be back!"}
{"text":"I don't know what has happened to this place. The first time I tried it, it was fabulous!! It was never that good again. I always get delivery, and there's always a problem. The delivery person is always pleasant, so it's the food. I ask for the pizza well done, it's not. I wait for an hour and a half and I'm barely 2 miles away. I can't pay online. Tonight, I ordered Chicken Parmesan. There's barely enough cheese to call it Parmesan. I asked to bake it until the cheese was brown. The chicken was nearly burned, but the barely there cheese still wasn't brown. How do you do that? Oh, and they forgot my soda. The sauce I raced about now tastes like it comes out of a can. I'm afraid to look at the salad. 

I'm out, Frattellos. Whatever you're doing, you should stop it. It's not working."}
{"text":"Our new favorite go to for pizza. Great sauce, quality toppings. Tried their wings for the first time and they were nice and meaty. Garlic wings had real minced garlic on them. Awesome. Vampires stay away."}
