{"text":"Excellent food but Saturday at 10:30 am was slowwww. Took 40 minutes for food to come (our order wasn't complicated). Nonetheless the food definitely redeemed itself!"}
{"text":"The service is extremely slow,  the order has mistakes and it takes forever to pay. Even after making a formal complaint and getting a free meal,  there was a mistake on my order. I would prefer driving to the Kirkland destination."}
{"text":"Service was excellent, our server was friendly and attentive.  The lox florentine was amazing.  Great selection on the menu,  we will be back here again!"}
{"text":"Lovely brunch spot. Went there Sunday around 10am, before ppl q up. Lots choices of a brunch, noticed ppl came here with young kids which is great . Had French toast this time, might be the largest French toast I have ever had. And it's really yummy, but really over my limit. My hubby ordered the Mexican skillet, and also enjoy it. Will definitely visit again"}
{"text":"I was with my family...l loved it , the service very good and friendly , I would recommend everyone to try the bancake"}
{"text":"Its Sunday and wanted to try a breakfast joint that we have not visited.  Arrived and got seated promptly, and with a smile.  Good start to our experience.  Looked at the book they call a menu, and lots of choices.  We started with freshly squeezed OJ and a cup of coffee.  The freshly squeezed OJ looked whipped and frothy, and tasted like frozen OJ. The coffee came in an extra small cup, and of course no one came by to refill the coffee.  Honestly, horrible experience to start.  Ordered the special guacamole and eggs and the smoked salmon benedicts. Nothing special for the price u pay. Rather disappointing that the eggs looked extra small. The eggs my wife ordered as medium came well done.  They obviously cannot do eggs.  Lastly, there is NO options for turkey sausage or turkey bacon. The beans have pork in it.  Quite disappointing for a breakfast joint offering healthier options.  Overall, the experience was not good.  Would I come back? With all the choices out there for breakfast, No. Sadly disappointed given the 4 start rating."}
{"text":"Very disappointed on the breakfast. They over cooked the eggs, they had to redo the eggs, a simple thing like eggs and they didn't get it right the first time."}
{"text":"Terrible! Service is bad, they forget to bring some of your stuff even when there's only 5 active tables. Waitresses seem out of it as if they were high and take an eternity to complete seemingly simple tasks. As for the food, it's mediocre to say the least. Not worth the price you pay.."}
{"text":"Went to Ben and Florentine for mothers day brunch and I really liked my meal. We chose to go here for mothers day because they take reservations.   I had the eggs benedict with bacon which was excellent. The bacon and eggs were cooked perfect and I couldn't get enough of the hollandaise sauce. The potatoes were also verySCS good not oily with a nice seasoning.  I would go here again for sure."}
{"text":"Awesome service, amazing food and never disappointed. I do find that the waiit can be long sometimes though."}
{"text":"I wanted to go to this place for quite some time and finally had a chance to visit.  Came with my family.  Arrived on a Sunday at around 11am and wasn't too busy.  The hostess was very nice and got us seated almost right away, plenty of high chairs and booster seats for the kids as well as crayons and coloring books galore.  The menu was great with lots of selections to choose from.  Food:   Banana Almond Pancakes-  Sweet deliciousness, the hazelnut spread was plentiful the Almonds and Bananas but the pancakes were fluffy but smaller than the others.  Blueberry Burst- This was great, lots of fresh blueberries and they were sweet naturally.  The pancakes were very fluffy Bagel Lox-  This was pretty straight forward, Montreal style sesame bagel was top notch. The fruits that came with it were excellent.   Avocado Benedict-  Great hollandaise!!! it came with regular strips of bacon, very crunchy and the avocados were well ripened Kids Grilled Cheese-  they were very accommodating and allowed a substitution of fries instead of the home fries.  The cheese was plain American but you can sub for cheddar or others. Kids Chocolate Chip Banana Pancake- This was basically the same as the Banana Almond except there were chocolate chips cooked within the pancake no bananas within the pancake.  It was a huge portion.  Atmosphere: It was definitely great for the family, lots of them!  The staff was very attentive with coffee and water refills as well as anything we needed.  Never had to ask for a refill.  The place was very clean as well.  They had an open kitchen and so that was appreciated, nothing for them to hide. Relaxing yet lively new hits music was playing over the speakers giving a nice vibe. Two large flat screen TVs were on the walls showing the cooking channel, sports news and regular news. We asked if they would put some children's cartoons on for us they said it was absolutely no problem.  I look forward to visiting again and this time trying out the skillet options or delice avocado, they certainly looked good seeing the other patrons having it.  Also really want to try the latkes.  Thanks for a great experience we will see you soon!"}
{"text":"Went to this breakfast place on Nov 27, 2011. We waited at the door for seating at least five minutes, during this time two waitresses and one bus boy walked by us and avoided eye contact. There was no hostess or anyone to seat you. I suppose the owners of this location on St. Charles do not care too much about service. So we left, who cares what food they serve, with the reception they have I believe that if they do not shape up this place is bound to fail.  We went to Petinos and within a two minutes span four people including the hostesses, owner and a waiter asked if we were served. NOW that's service. I suggest Ben & Flo go to Petinos  and learn about customer service. Unless I read some good reviews I will not be going back."}
{"text":"3.5/5. Solid breakfast place, nothing special. Had Monster french toast, my friend ordered chicken and waffle. Fried potatoes were good, fruits didn't taste very fresh. Service was good."}
{"text":"Amazing variety and food service is fast and friendly and the food came out very quickly with GREAT presentation the location is very convenient  as well"}
{"text":"B&F was better back in the day when they weren't franchised everywhere. It's still good, but I find they have increased their pricing way more than what breakfast should be and the competition. I like the decor of this place and it does feel very comfortable to dine in. The food is average and nothing is wow!   Overall, good option for a bfast place on St Charles."}
{"text":"Brunches at this place over the weekend. Gave it a second chance since going a couple of years ago. The plates are small for the price. The service was awkward, seemed like we had to repeat everything twice to be properly understood."}
{"text":"We went there today morning. After we were seated (there were 7 of us), it took them at least 20 minutes before the server even came to our table to take the order for our drinks. It was not as if that the restaurant was packed. After we placed the order, the server disappeared again for another 10 minutes. We had to request her to get us at least the coffee before the other things. They claimed that they have only 1 blender ( that is really strange) to make the smoothies. Why I fail to understand is why should the server be the one to go and make the smoothies. Should there not be another person to man that station so that the servers can actually take care of the guests. Will think twice before going again. The food as well was average - nothing out of this world or to die for."}
{"text":"Basic brunch have been kicked out because they were closing - unimpressed"}
{"text":"We went there for brunch, and expected the restaurant to be packed, it being Easter. Much to our surprise, we were seated right away (and next to the window, yay!).   The service was impeccable, and the server was at our table right away to take our order for drinks. Even our meals were brought to us rather quickly, despite the number of people  The hot chocolate tasted fine, but it wasn't memorable. Unfortunately, it was lukewarm when it came to our table. However, the food we ordered was cooked to perfection and was delicious. It obviously doesn't take a Master's to make an omelette, but it was packed with fillings and cheese. Yummy, yummy cheese... And their potatoes are really that good. Just spicy enough and perfectly crisped.  Quite frankly, I would go back again for brunch, and I do prefer B&F over Cora any day."}
{"text":"The service was great. I had the spinach and cheese crepe which could have been warmer when brought to the table. Overall a very cozy atmosphere."}
{"text":"Good food and lots of choices.  Slow service...  Kids love it!  It was quite busy on a Sunday morning but not so busy that we had to wait long for a table.  I recommend this breakfast restaurant"}
{"text":"The breakfast menu has a wide selection to choose from, so don't get overly intimidated when you see the menu, as I wanted to try everything on there, but I am sure it will take a few more visits. They add a extra to nearly all the dishes that left the kitchen that I saw and the one dish I went for was the \"chorizo eggs Benedict\" and that was delicious every bite of the way I also had an cappuccino which wasn't hand made but done by the \"nesspresso\", which I am not a fan of, and it was expensive for that little cappuccino.   The home fries were so-so and I had better. The \"old fashion skillets\", I also got to try and that was pretty good, maybe a bit too much on the oily side but that didn't really hurt the dish that much.  The service was attentive and friendly and made you feel like you're at home. I would definitely go again but for a special occasion as it can be a bit more expensive for breakfast in comparison to other breakfast places."}
{"text":"Service amical, hyper efficace et d'une grande courtoisie! Un des meilleurs menu déjeuner avec de jolies assiettes gourmandes ! Irréprochable! Merci ;)"}
{"text":"A great menu, in both english and french. If you like Cora styled breakfasts...you must visit for a hearty, family styled  breakfast!"}
{"text":"Unlike some of the reviews here I found the service was very impressive. The host was very quick to seat us and the server was over immediately to take an order for drinks, which were brought over right away. Once we had ordered food, again, it was brought cooked and brought out very quickly. The food was good and seemed very fresh. I would definitely go here again!"}
{"text":"food was ok, not great.  service is very poor.  after being seated, took over an hour to get food order."}
{"text":"Passed through Montreal and found this great breakfast place on yelp. Highly recommend their Egg Benedics, I had the Florentine and it was delicious. Coffee was also pretty good. Plus friendly staff so it makes for a nice start to your day."}
{"text":"the a,b,c's of my reviews Atmosphere, Service, & Food  Atmosphere:  If you're in Montreal (whether a visitor or a local) and feel like going to an *intimate* brunch - please  don't go to Ben & Florentine.  It's a decent enough place - if you're into the big-box, soul-less, chain restaurants.  If you're looking for character and place that doesn't feel like you just drove in from off the high away ~ there are many other places in city to go to. This is a place you may want to consider after you've had  a long night of Montreal living with your boys or gals.  It'll do the trick in a bind.  Service: The service is bland at best.  The staff is young, mostly students, and although they do their best, often their attitude is that of indifference.  Food: Large menu, with the typical items found at other brunch places. Categories include eggs, Benedict's, waffles, crepes, etc.  Unfortunately, quantity often does not equal quality, the food's quality is a hit-and-miss.  Serviceable, but shouldn't be your first choice."}
{"text":"Wasn't impressed at all with the service. It took a while to get us seated when there were quite a number of tables already open. The hostess was not very pleasant. She called us from afar to our table, placed our forks and knives and then walked away without saying much.   It took forever for us to give our order, and once we did, it took so long to get our food.   I would forgive the service if the food was amazing. Unfortunately there was nothing extraordinary about the food being served at Ben and Florentines.  They need to stand out especially with all the new breakfast chains opening recently in Montreal.  I've ordered quite a few dishes in the past.  If I were to pick some dishes that stand out, I would say their eggs Benedict and potato pancakes are very good.  They would get a 3/5 but the service brought it down..."}
{"text":"Went there for breakfast twice and both times I regretted it. First time, we are sat down and ignored for 15 min. We saw two customers who had been there before us leave rather then wait any longer When we flag down a waitress that was walking by and politely asked if she knew who our waitress was. She snapped at us that it was her. Waitress eventually took our order, being rude the entire time. The food was okay, we got the skillet to share.Mostly it was just potatoes. The tea was stale and they were very stringy with their hot water.  Figuring we caught them at a bad time, we came back. I ordered french toast with brie, blueberries and some honey. Or, atleast, that is what the menu said. What I got was french toast with brie, blueberries and DRENCHED in honey. It was like eating straight out of a honey jar. You couldn't taste anything else! I was unable to finish it.  So I paid $15 to leave hungry.  Skip this place, there are better places to eat nearby."}
{"text":"I can only imagine this restaurant survives because of its location and access to tourists.   My girlfriend and I went in on a Saturday around noon, saw it was busy, and expected a bit of a wait. However it took over 20 minutes to get coffee and over an hour to get food. When our food finally came, we were on the verge of walking out.   The food was standard breakfast diner fare. Tasty enough, but not even close to being worth the wait.   In an area with so many other options, I can't imagine a reason to ever come here again."}
{"text":"I was looking to try something new for our breakfast outing and came across reviews for this new place, and decided to give it a try. We were definitely not disappointed with our overall experience. The food was great, and there were tons of options (which almost made it harder because you want to try everything!)   I eventually ordered a new item on the menu called 'the european' which is a vegetarian omelet with a side of potatoes and apple sauce. Overall it was very tasty and left me satisfied without the sickening full feeling you get after certain meals. My husband ordered a pancake topped with nutella and fruits which he quite enjoyed.   The service was phenomenal, both fast and friendly. The location was quite nice as well being near the lake.  We will definitely be coming back sometime soon!"}
{"text":"June 2012 update Got there around 9h00 and the place was almost empty. When we got in it was so cold that I thought I was standing right below the AC.  It took 3-4 min. to get seated after the 2 waitresses finished arguing with one another as to whose section we were to sit in. The waitress that seated us was obviously in a very pissy mood that we landed in her section and pretty much threw the menus on the table and didn't look at us.  After about 5 min. of waiting for service, we were frozen stiff. I figured I would probably get sick if I stayed longer so we left before ordering.  Hopefully this a ''one of'' bad experience but needless to say better staff and temperature control would be in order here  -------------------------------------------------------------  Nice, simple and cozy place for breakfast.  They have early birds specials and a vast selection of breakfast menu items at reasonable prices.  Their portions are large and the fruits fresh.  The coffee is also pretty good and the waiting staff keeps your cup full.  Service is fast and friendly.    It's a great place for a business meeting."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch, many choices, more than sunset grill. Love the potato pancakes with apple sauce. Staff are attentive and work hard, quick, efficient and pleasant. Reasonably priced compared to Cora, more value for money."}
{"text":"Had a wonderful family brunch on Sunday. Server was training so a bit slow but polite and tried hard. Large portions, Gluten Free options, Kids Menu, all good food. A bit of a wait since we were a party of 5. No reservations."}
{"text":"In Montreal on vacation with my partner. We are both gluten free so were excited to hear about the buckwheat crepe option. When we went to order we were told that they didn't have any more buckwheat crepe batter (unsure if they meant for today or just don't have it anymore). Ordered some scrambled egg fusion dish instead... in my mind it should be hard to mess up scrambled eggs but they were gross, could only eat a few bites.  The service was also awful... Aside from taking our order and bringing us our food the server did not check on us at all. Never refilled our coffee despite refilling coffee at tables next to us. Took FOREVER to get our bill. Overall this place was a flop and I wouldn't recommend it."}
{"text":"Have to pay extra for fruit.  The apple sauce they provide  with traditional eggs and bacon plate Is  a good option only for a three year old. Nothing sets it apart from other breakfast places, no effort or creativity in presentation of food."}
{"text":"This is a good place to grab brunch if you are in the downtown area. They have buckwheat crepes and since I am on a gluten free diet, they were great! They always seemed to be busy and the staff was also very friendly."}
{"text":"I visited the new Lakeshore/Kerr location this past weekend  It was OK. Nice and stylish decor. Super friendly (and fast) service but the food... Average. I had the New York French toast and the bread was \"spongy\" and the cream cheese and jam mixture just too sweet (and too much of it) The hollandaise sauce was not \"home made\" and tasted powdery.  I will stick to Milestones for eggs Benedict (THE BEST!!)"}
{"text":"Food lacks flavor. Service is slow. A bit overpriced."}
{"text":"Amazing breakfast! Loved the potato pancakes, waffles and eggs Benedict! Great service from Charlene!"}
{"text":"Had the most fulfilling brunch! Ordered supreme club and 3 meat skillet - both were fabulous ! Service was great too. Price was reasonable to me too.  This place is now my favorite go-to place for breakfast/brunch !"}
{"text":"Just another brunch place chain restaurant. Way too many things on the menu to choose from and I've definitely had better brunch elsewhere. Freshly squeezed orange juice was great. Espresso was blah. Entrees were mediocre. Almost zero wait time at their peak on a Saturday so no need to worry about that. But just nothing spectacular as brunches are supposed to be! Probably won't be coming back...  I'm still looking for something similar to Lady Marmalade or any of the great brunch places in Vancouver in the Oakville area. Unfortunately there are maybe only two here. Business opportunity anyone? Hit me up!"}
{"text":"Very disappointing breakfast  experience today. Potatoes fried in rancid oil. Egg Benedict sauce tastes artificial and they used regular bacon instead of Canadian Bacon.  Espresso is made by an office-like coffee machine. The first and the last visit to this restaurant.  Location is good and service is ok."}
{"text":"We went to Ben & Florentines this morning and we will never darken their doors again.  We were asked if we wanted coffee almost as soon as we sat down and then waited ages to get it and then waited even longer to place our order.  My husband ordered  Eggs Bennedict, which he said he would never have again.  The muffin was burnt on the bottom and sauce looked like it has been around for a week.  I ordered 2 eggs poached with back bacon and a side of sausage and brown toast (which was right on the menu).  The waitress came with what was supposed to be my order and when I told her that what she brought was not back bacon and i had to argue with her. The sausages looked liked they had been cooked two weeks ahead.  Finally when I did finally get my meal,  the waitress said she was sorry but she did not know what back bacon was and it was the first time she had served it (maybe a little more training would help).  Toast was very cold with butter that would not sink in.  Now I know why Pettinos is so busy, with they're great food and much nicer atmosphere."}
{"text":"A disaster from beginning to end. Really a couple of eggs and some bacon and coffee simply cannot be that hard to deliver. Needs fixing fast."}
{"text":"J'ai mangé ici trois fois et c'était D.E.L.I.C.I.E.U.X! Excellent! J'adore... C'est mon endroit de déjeuner préféré.  Ps: les trois mousquetaires... C'est un délice!"}
{"text":"Food was alright- place was quite packed. The glorentine Benedict was tasty . Crepes were a bit dry . The Mexican crepe was disappointing"}
{"text":"What a great place for brunch! I've been here twice. Both times the customer service is on point. The people are so kind and lovely. Off to a great start!  So before I start talking about my meal, I should mention that I hate eggs. Yes, this is a review for a delicious breakfast place. So I tend to really like places that have non-egg options on their menu. Ok end of disclosure.  The food... I assume everything must be delicious. I've had two items on their menu: the banana Nutella pancakes (Ahhhmazing!!!) and the spinach and cheese crepe. Depending on what you're in the mood for, both were fantastic. If you like your sweets, try the banana Nutella pancakes. I'm drooling just thinking about them again. I think I might actually go back for breakfast this weekend now that I think about those damn delicious pancakes. If you don't have a huge sweet tooth and don't feel like eggs, try the spinach and cheese crepe. It's very good. The ratio of spinach to cheese is just right. The crepe is perfectly crispy (no sogginess like I've experienced with spinach crepes at other places).  My Husband had the fusion scrambler and the veggie skillet. He loved them. He liked the way the eggs were done and enjoyed the potato hash.  Coffee isn't fantastic, but really, don't fill your belly with liquids- eat the food! It's great :)"}
{"text":"While the food was decent and my service was good (aside from waiting longer than expected for the check) I was really turned off by the conversation that came from the line cooks and the shift manager. We were seated near the kitchen and could hear them exchanging profanities (loudly) not just an f bomb here and there but every other word was \"F\" \"C\" \"B\" and even talk of doing cocaine and sexual acts. The shift manager (a man in a black shirt) chose to use the area behind our table to argue with employees. We had our young daughter with us and could have sworn this was considered a family establishment. Not enjoyable...Will not be back..."}
{"text":"This place is mostly image, little substance. There was a line up out the door for Sunday brunch, but there's nothing special here other than the large menu, which looks like an in-flight magazine with the Instagram-ready photos to go with.  The service and food are both average, but the value isn't there. For this price you'd expect some artisanal touches, but there are no organic or local options. Big plastic Heinz ketchup bottles is what you'll get. It's a chain and feels like one. Despite all this, I have no doubts people will still keep lining up for lack of competition (there's a Tim Horton's and Thai Zone in the strip mall). Not surprisingly, the only location on the island is in a tourist area and has 2.5 stars, since people have choice there."}
{"text":"Good food but horrible service and management! I left my baby's pacifier on the table and i have literally left the resturant for not even 2 minutes before i realized and came back inside to pick it up. But the manager/ owner ( very rude lady) told me that she had to throw it out!!! I was shocked that i was only gone from our table for not even 2 minutes and she is telling me that she HAD to throw it out! I told her that so if i was to leave my wallet at the table would you have thrown that out too? And she kept saying i had to throw it out. Any ways my baby ended up crying for her pacifier until we bought her another one. And when I told the lady that you have lost us as customers forever she said thats fine!!!. We were regulars there but we wont be going there anymore and i have told all my friends about how rude the lady was and that how she didn't care to loose her regular customers. So if you want to have your day ruined this is the place to go. She has zero management skills and customer service."}
{"text":"Well, I am glad you mentioned the incident, the pacifier was 5 box and worth nothing, but your stupid pulicy is a no sence,  but the main reason I was angry and never gonna go back there again, is you as a manager should be polit and understanding when YOU through peoples stuff out in garbage you should say sorry or apologize!!!!!  for your dumb policy,  instead rudly talking to me and my wife that I have to through it out, and saying \" It is ok if your are not comming back\" wow such a rude thing to tell to a customer !!!!!! Well you just lost a customer after 3 years. Congradulations on having the worst customer service in the GTA!!!!!"}
{"text":"I'll never come back to this place again. The service is horrible, the food is ok and price is slightly above average (things start at about $12-$13). Cora's is so much better or anything else really. I went on a regular monday at about 10 and there wasn't a lot of people (less than 10). The waiters there are what tick me off the most really, the other ben et flos that i've been to are decent, it's just this particular restaurant. First time i came here, it was a 3/5 meh, it's nearby. But now, they lost a customer. The waiters think they're so superior and act really snobby(on both occasions that i was there!). My waitress complained about the tip! Made me want to take my money back. I never give a tip under a $1(even if what I bought was $5) and I usually give about the same amount as taxes, more if the service was good."}
{"text":"Food is great. Breakfast skillets are plenty and savory! Coffee is way better than the \"other\" overpriced chains. Definitely a recommendation!"}
{"text":"Fairly new breakfast spot in Oakville. I took my daughter in law for breakfast as both she and I can't eat wheat and I saw an ad that they had a gluten free menu. I had a fabulous waffle that was gluten free with fresh fruit, it was delicious and she ordered an omelette with served with gluten free latkas and they even had a gluten free toasted bun. We enjoyed the food and the service. It will be our new go to for weekend breakfast out!   The only thing I will mention is that the gluten free extras are an extra cost. We are used to that as every gluten free thing purchased in the markets is expensive so that didn't hamper our personal experience."}
{"text":"I've been several times and always had a good experience.  The food is great, priced well and the service is spot on. The waitresses are always around topping off you're coffee."}
{"text":"Very poor service des organize . Horrible experience , Terrible food , I will never ever  come back to this place again"}
{"text":"A really bad, overpriced chain restaurant. Very crowded on the weekends (it shouldn't be). The pictures yelpers have uploaded are quite representative of the food quality... look at that slop of hollandaise sauce, it's so goopy! And not in the Gwyneth Paltrow way."}
{"text":"Nothing special, in fact, more of a Denny's-like atmosphere. Ironically, this place was recommended to my parents and I by the concierge at the Fairmont, but it really is only a last-resort place for late breakfast, in my opinion. If you like low-end chains, this is a winner. If not, keep looking."}
{"text":"We had a great breakfast at this restaurant. It doesn't look like much from the outside, but it has lots of seating on the inside. Omelette's were very good. The Eastern Omelette with cheddar added was particularly delicious!   Our server was Evelyne and she was really lovely. Always smiling and very pleasant. Thanks Evelyne!"}
{"text":"A nice bougé breakfast spot and a little pricey, but great breakfast food. Friendly staff."}
{"text":"What a horrible experience. Had the breakfast poutine and ate hardly a third of it, since I sensed something funny. Server did not even ask if there was something not ok when he picked up the plate. Menu said coffee comes free with poutine, but server charged for coffee and I had to argue with him. When we came home, I had to go to the bathroom since poutine did not want to stay in my stomach. This place is truly the \"Justin Bieber\" of all restaurants in town."}
{"text":"The best breakfast I've ever had! We had big Ben and bagel&cream cheese, as well as a smoothie called aloha. Ham and sausage Cooked just right, fries taste great, and smoothie perfectly blended. Strongly recommend. Our conclusion: sometimes you have to try urselves, since if we followed yelp, we would never get into this place...it's only because we passed by accidentally ."}
{"text":"Cuisine qui semble santé. De belles propositions de déjeuner ou de brunch. Personnellement c'était très bon et le service était bien aussi."}
{"text":"We returned to Ben & Florentine today and felt compelled to down grade our original rating.  Returning 11 months after our first visit and initial  rating, we have found that the quality, quantity and service have all slipped.  The prices, relative to the value for the portions and quality are not justified.  It seems that everything is an extra charge.  There also lacks a sense of urgency not only to seat people but also to serve and deliver food.    These are our tips for the owners...... 1) include coffee with the breakfasts.  You can keep all prices the same and including bottomless coffee will go a long way.  Coffee costs next to nothing so it's an easy answer to the high prices   2). Increase the urgency when it comes to clearing tables.  As soon as a table clears, get staff on it right away and with more jump in their step.  You'll be able to seat people faster.  Roll cutlery in napkins so that it's ready to go as oppose to setting out each place sitting individually each time.  Your table clearly and setting process needs review -  3). Coffee top up should never have to be requested.  Have someone dedicated to filling up cups so that your clients never have to ask  4).  Put ketchup bottles on every single table.  No excuses   5). Bring all meals out at one time.  Ensure the customer has everything before moving on to serve another table.  There is nothing worse than sitting looking at your food getting cold because something is missing or the other person your with has not received their's yet  6). Move the juicing machine to the back of the kitchen.  We sat at the table directly next to the juicer and every time it fired up, we had to stop our conversation or yell across the table.  Super annoying!  7).  Take a good look at the portions and presentation of what you're serving.  When we came the first time, the presentation and portion size warranted the price.  This has slipped.    All in all, we are now on the hunt for a new breakfast place.  We simply cannot justify paying the higher prices relative to the experience, quality and portion size."}
{"text":"Best breakfast Ive ever had.  My boyfriend and I ended up eating here almost every day on our stay in Montréal.  I had the waffle with nutella, white chocolate and almonds,  the potatoes and bacon where equally as delicious.  Can't wait to take another Canadian vacation just so I can get this perfect breakfast again."}
{"text":"My favourite brunch place in town. Always order Benedict Genève $20.00  (average spent)."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch with a colleague today.  Overall it was a good meal, pretty standard breakfast/brunch/lunch fare, ok service.  The location is great, right downtown and quick walk over from our workplace.  The space itself is large and bright.    I would have given it three stars, except for one thing: they didn't have any buckwheat batter (for crepes) although their menu listed it.  I went with someone who is avoiding gluten, and she was pretty bummed she couldn't have buckwheat crepes.  That alone wasn't a huge deal, it happens, but what really irked us was when she told the waiter why she had wanted buckwheat crepes (avoiding gluten) and he asked \"so normal flour has gluten in it?\".  Faceplant moment.  When you have a special eating situation, you don't expect people to know everything about it, but you expect a waiter in a restaurant to at least have some basic knowledge about something that is becoming more and more gluten.  Rant aside, the food was good in an average sort of way. My colleague had a vegetarian omelette that looked tasty.  I had a (non buckwheat) crepe with ham, asparagus and swiss.  It was filling and priced similarly to what I expect from similar breakfast places."}
{"text":"Aliments, Service, Ambiance 10/10!!!"}
{"text":"Had brunch here after a race. The venue was full but we were seated in decent time. Very friendly staff, always checking in on us (we had Ana as our waitress, great service).  We both ordered a pancake plate and got more than our money's worth with the portions. I can't eat creams so the staff adjusted my plate without problems."}
{"text":"One of my go to breakfast places! I first tried this restaurant in Montreal when visiting my sister. I still remember how much I enjoyed it! I was sooooo happy to have found one close to home! Their home fries are the best thing ever!! They're cooked exactly the way I love them! Cut into bite size pieces, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside and each one perfectly coated with their seasoning! I also love that they serve every meal with a small side of applesauce!  Unfortunately they don't make it in house but still tasty!   I typically get a different meal every time I visit based on what I feel like eating and so far everything I've tried hasn't been a disappointment. They have a wide variety of options for those greasy breakfasts from their skillets to the classic bacon and healthy options such as waffles with fruit.   Will definitely continue going here!"}
{"text":"Having had breakfast here at this location several times by myself and with my family, I would highly recommend this restaurant for breakfast.  We have been to Montreal twice and stayed both times at the Fairmont Queen Elizabeth Hotel.  The restaurant is very close to the hotel, offers many options including sweet options with Nutella.  The kids loved the Sweet Tooth and Avalanche!  I have to admit, I like those too but also the Portuguese Omelette.  This particular morning I had a taste for that omelette, fresh fruit, French toast and Nutella.  This is not on the menu but my waitress still obliged my high level of maintenance and made my request appear just a few minutes after my order.  To my delight the food was good and the bill was still less than the buffet at the hotel!  Many thanks to Valerie, my waitress, for fulfilling my request and making my morning pleasant!"}
{"text":"Nothing special about this place. The food is average, slow service and not crazy about having to pay extra for fruits  Not crazy about the apple sauce you get with the eggs and the coffee was not very good.  I was passing by and wanted to try it but it will be the last time. Didn't enjoy the food or service and it was pricey for what we got."}
{"text":"Pourquoi allé dans se resto quand il y a d'autre option au centre-ville ? Se resto fait parti d'une chaîne de franchise qui se spécialise dans  les déjeuners et les  dîners. Plus particulièrement les ufs bénédictines! Le problème majeur commence la, les ufs bénédictines ne sont pas bon.... en gros ils ne goûtent pas grand chose, la sauce hollandaise ressemble à celle que l'on fait à la maison  avec un mélange French et la plus part du temps c'est froid. En plus comme d'autre l'ont mentionné le service est très moyen.   Donc si vous êtes en région ( à l'extérieur de Montréal ) le service est meilleur et c'est souvent la seul option de variété disponible. J'y mange du pain doré.  Quand vous êtes au centre-ville je vous suggère d'aller ailleurs. Quelque unes des options dans le coin: l'Universelle (Rue Peel), Chez Cora (rue Drummond), M Café ( rue Maisonneuve ).....  Egspectation .....et bien d'autre.  Si vous y allé quand même bonne chance, il y a quelque fois du bon service. Mais encore ici je vous déconseille les ufs bénédictines leur \" spécialité \" .  Pour ma part je n'y met plus les pieds, voilà !"}
{"text":"Le menu était  très alléchant en photos, mais notre commande fut plutôt décevante. De l'eau au fond de mon bol avec mes oeufs pochés, des saucisses qui s'écrasent quand on les coupe comme si elles n'étaient pas assez cuites, pain doré et gaufre sans goût, avec très peu de fruits et de chocolat. Aucun fruit dans l'assiette pour accompagner les patates qui semblaient super, mais qui se sont avéré bien normales. Le smoothie Ruby Red était bien bon tout comme le bacon bien croustillant."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot and amazing staff.  Food is always fresh. I would recommend as a breakfast/brunch place."}
{"text":"Exceeded expectations. Honey fried chicken bacon waffles, the pancakes and the coffee were delicious with fast friendly service."}
{"text":"Nice family place for breakfast ! Food is good and service is pleasant. I consider it a bit more expensive than Tuttie or Cora.   The interior is bright, spacious and you would enjoy a lovely morning with the family."}
{"text":"Made a stop in Oakville and decided to visit this restaurant because of the good rating on Yelp! I went here with my girlfriend and we were seated tucked away in the back, next to the bathroom when there were clearly more than a few open tables near the front by the window set up for 2.   We ordered the Two eggs etc. and the True blue breakfasts, they were both good. My girlfriend really liked the home fries. After we finished eating it was difficult to get any attention from the staff after being shafted to the back.  Suggestion for the owners: if you're going to use that space in the back put another table or two so that the patrons don't feel secluded from everyone else and unwelcomed."}
{"text":"Fantastic little spot in Oakville.  Great service and their food is delish.  The menu is extensive with quality ingredients.  The chef was extremely accommodating to my requests.  Overall a great meal and a great experience."}
{"text":"We actually ate brunch here both days that we were in Montreal because of its proximity to our hotel, our lack of other breakfast options and its HUGE menu.  It was perfect for a large group, everyone found something different to try both time.  It's not a place you would go looking for, but you can't go wrong once you're here. Good food, generous portions and friendly service ."}
{"text":"A friend and I stopped over at this place for breakfast before a Niagara road trip as it's not far off the QEW.   I can't say I agree with the 4/5 rating it currently has but I'm giving it a 3.5.  I got the meat lover's benedict and my friend got the florentine. The taste was so so. Nothing mind blowing. I asked for my egg hard poached and my friend asked for it soft poached which they reversed! The meatlovers didn't come with much meat ... mostly mushy ham, 1 chopped up sausage and almost no bacon.   Service was incredibly slow (40 mins for our bennies to come out). We ordered a side of pancakes that they plain forgot about.  I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and say that it was a one off day. Might be back for one of the breakfast skillets and see if the service improves!"}
{"text":"Very nice Breakfast! I would defenitely recommend this, the service is fast and the food is tasty and plentyful! We hat to notice that the kitchen is only separated from the eating area by a 1,50 high screen wall, which makes for a pretty noisy experience, and the floor cleaning is note especially thorough - one of us stepped into a slice of banana, which was unpleasant."}
{"text":"Had a lovely lunch here with a few coworkers, food was nicely prepared and had a very homely healthy feel to the dishes. The menu offers a wide variety of breakfast and brunch dishes with some really delicious looking breakfasts. I tried their portobello mushroom burger with goat cheese, very filling and delicious. Sided with seasoned french fries and small coleslaw/salad. The service was excellent and friendly, a nice addition was that they have English menus available for is non-francophones. Overall a nice little spot with a few locations across Quebec and Ontario."}
{"text":"My family and I were looking for a place for breakfast-this place was recommended by Hotel Bonaventure and guess what-  THEY MEAN BUSINESS with BrEaKfAsT!  They serve it all day!  The order- I had ham and asparagus crepes=amazingly delicious!  My Mami had the Avocado toast with a poached egg and LoVeD it!  My Dad had oatmeal with fresh berries, cream and sugar.  Our Waiter- Laurent was exceptionally attentive refilling our coffee cups several times as the restaurant was packed and it took a while to receive our order. Laurent liked to chat with us and recommended some places to go including the World's Largest BARBIE DOLL MUSEUM-more about that in a future review! He said he posed as \"Ken\" in the life-sized pink Barbie Box in the exhibit!  Cool find!"}
{"text":"Three meals in one! Brunching like it's no ones business!! This place, though very tiny looking from the outside is huge! Perfect diner feel, very clean and modern looking, and excellent service. I got the ten on ten, and they were very apt to make changes for me to switch out due to my diet. Same with our neighbors we went with, they switched out or ordered a very gluten free friendly diet selection."}
{"text":"Went there for brunch. Ordered drinks, got them after a few minutes as per usual. Then we never saw our waitress again. Ended up waiting an hour and didn't get our food, and still no word or appearance from the waitress. When I approached her to tell her we were leaving, she quickly dismissed it, told me to sit back down. Within minutes she brought our food over, but it was cold and the hollandaise had coagulated. The French toast wasn't cooked. Clearly the food (which wasn't even cooked properly) had been waiting for us, but the waitress buggered off. When we told her we were still leaving and showed her the food she rolled her eyes. We left without taking a bite after sitting for over an hour. Would not return."}
{"text":"This Ben & Florentine doesn't offer much more than other breakfast restaurants (e.g. Cora) in the great Montreal. In fact, nothing that they have on the menu is amazing, nor revolutionary. Preparing eggs does not require any kind of fancy degree, therefore everything that Ben & Florentine offers lives up to expectations. The main reason why I visit this restaurant so often? Its location is extremely accessible - Walking distance from McGill University and from several Metro stations.   The reason why I am only giving out 3 stars to B&F is because of the inconsistency of their service. Sometimes, incredibly rapid and efficient. Some other times, slow and incredibly rude. Being in the customer service field myself, I do understand that rush hour can be a bit overwhelming and stressful to employees. However, it should not give those employees the right to be impolite towards customers. Sadly, some waiters at B&F have not yet realized that fact, which costs them 2 stars! Whoops!"}
{"text":"Food is good, we always order the eggs benedictine, the staff is friendly but always running, the wait is horrible. It looks to me that they are not well organized or missing training. We complained for the wait and they gave us a 15% discount, i find the gesture very pleasing."}
{"text":"Probably one of my favourite chains for brunch. The menu is outrageous with anything you could possibly want to satisfy your breakfast desires.  The 3 musketeers was dry, although who doesnt love sausage wrapped in a crepe smothered in cheese.  Asparagus ham crepe is my favourite, very yummy  Nutella hazelnut pancakes where also good just be sure to ask for extra nutella as they are frugal with it  Smoothies are awesome and have a large range"}
{"text":"Mostly on par with what's offered at the many other breakfast restaurant chains in Quebec, but sadly this chain swaps most of the fresh fruit you typically get with your 2 eggs and bacon for a cup of applesauce."}
{"text":"45 minutes from order to getting breakfast. Eggs overdone, yesterday's limp lettuce. One hour before being asked if I would like a tea refill. Lots of better places than this!"}
{"text":"On a recent trip to Montreal we went to Ben & Florentine twice for breakfast. Large menu with great selection of pancake, french toast & waffle items. Most served with fresh fruit. The portions were large and everything we ordered was outstanding. We definitely would return on our next trip to the Montreal area.  This is among the best breakfast places we have experienced anywhere."}
{"text":"This place has definitely turned around within the last year. It is more organized than it used to and the food Comes out quick! The service is excellent and the same goes for the food. I would definitely recommend coming for breakfast!"}
{"text":"I just came back from the B&F in Dollard Des Ormeaux. the menu consisted of 2 choices #1 deep fried #2 processed.  The home fries I suspect arrived to the back of the restaurant frozen and prepared in factory then were promptly dropped into a deep fryer, the potato pancakes were the frozen McCain ones from the local IGA. I suspect the sausages got deep fried too, if they weren't deep fried they had been sitting under a heat lamp, the sausage casings had peeled right off the sausage. But the part that describes this place up was the \"waffles\" the waffles were shockingly and impressively bad, I mean seriously who can screw up a waffle??? I saw the guy go into the freezer, peel the plastic off of the frozen waffle then stuff it into the waffle iron!!! I have never seen that before. it was like astronaut food. certainly not home cooked breakfast. I think I could actually taste the profit margin in every bite, the best way to describe this place is \"it legally qualifies as food\" the is no care or skill or love put into anything on the plate. everything seemed designed with the highest level of optimization and ease of franchising. These qualities seem to paramount the quality of cuisine. All of this was fine if I was at a truck stop in a rush, but when the bill came and it was 40$ for 2 people I almost fell out of the booth. they didn't even chop up their own potatoes!!! or prepare anything onsite  I hate not getting value for my money and this place was a complete rip off. Any gas station would give you the exact same breakfast for $8. I'm surprised with the amount of competition in this market space these guys are still around.  I read other reviews of bad service, my experience was great service, fast fresh coffee, but the food seemed like it came off the back of the red cross emergency relief bus.  I wish I could give this place 0 stars, I would recommend this place if you cant tell the difference between deep fried and fresh, or if maybe you just got out of prison and you miss the cooking \"inside\""}
{"text":"came here and ordered the cheese omelette with a side of potatoes and some regular poutine. i don't know. everything tasted just ok. nothing memorable. can't remember saying \"wow\" to anything i tasted. this is not a bad place, just average for what i ordered."}
{"text":"Alors que je dégustais mon classique club sandwich matinal que j'adore, des employés ont décidés de nettoyer les conduits d'aération.. il va sans dire que cela a coupé mon apétit puisque je pouvais apercevoir les particules de poussières descendre du plafond.. gros manque de jugement, je me suis sentie sous pression. Cela a miné mon expérience de cette chaîne de restaurant que j'adore :( !!   Est-ce possible de faire votre ménage des conduits d'aération lorsque la nourriture des clients n'est pas exposée ?? Ça serait cool :P"}
{"text":"For the price, this place is good. The food is tasty, the portions are generous and the plates are well presented. There are a lot of items to choose from, both sweet and salty. The service is acceptable. You'll get basic service but don't expect to be awed. The beverages are a little overpriced but you'll get your money's worth with toasts and toppings. Overall, I recommend this place if you're looking for a casual and quick breakfast or brunch. However, if you're looking for a place to invite your in-laws, look elsewhere!"}
{"text":"Kids wanted to have breakfast here for the 2nd day in a row. Different server, different order. The service was again friendly and fast. I didn't experience anything like the bad reviews stated."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed our brunch here . Will definitely come back here , from NYC ,  next summer .  The entire staff was very welcoming and efficient. They are all keepers . Congrats!!!!!"}
{"text":"Every time we visit Canada, there is not a comparable (at least not until Europe) breakfast that meets their fine morning indulgence.  The breakfast and food here in general is extremely fresh and delicately made.  I just couldn't believe my eyes and mouth as we were spoiled to the core with our morning treat. I will Always remember our visit here. The cappuccinos, heaven. Thank you to our wonderful server!"}
{"text":"This had to be the most awful breakfast experience ever! The list of screw-ups is nearly endless.  I came here one Sunday morning while visiting Montreal with 3 friends. The place looked decent from the outside, so we strolled in for a basic, quick brekkie. To start, service was dreadful. After being seated we waited for 15 minutes to even be acknowledged by the waitress. It must have taken about 45 minutes before any food arrived. By that time all of our coffees were empty and our waitress ignored us until we basically begged for coffee. I gotta say, she was quite skilled at ignoring the restaurant patrons. Other tables were holding up their cups asking for refills just as well.  Things only got worse from there. Among the many screw-ups include:  -Wrong toast -No water (which we desperately needed - it was a late night on town!)  -Wrong eggs (I asked for over-easy but got scrambled) -Disgustingly greasy breakfast sausage -Lukewarm food -Spilled coffee when the waitress over-poured the cup (and of course didn't bother to apologize or even acknowledge it) -Rude and painfully slow service (the place wasn't even busy) -Washroom had no soap (I can only imagine the cleanliness of the rest of the place)  In a nutshell, AVOID AVOID AVOID! Tres mal!"}
{"text":"Excellent endroit pour déjeuners de tout sortes. Le service est quand même très bon aussi."}
{"text":"Stopped for a quick bite and randomly found this place off the beaten path in some tiny mall while on a detour. Starving I popped in to find a clean and well maintained Panero's type place but unfortunately one spoke English nor did they have an English menu. Luckily they had a menu with some good looking photos and enough familiar sounding words that I could put a decent order together. Very friendly wait staff did their best to help me. I ended up with a delicious chicken panini on warm bread with melted cheese Ana a ton of awesome fries. Topped off with a very tasty ice coffee, albeit in a to go cup. A diamond in the rough for sure but a satisfying stop indeed."}
{"text":"Great menu and lots of seating at this particular location. The hand squeezed orange juice is amazing. Our waiter was very nice and had no issues speaking (and joking!) in English. The menu is huge. I had the salmon benny. It was a bit much, but it's always good to try new things. The egg was on an English muffin with cream cheese, onions, salmon and the usual hollandaise sauce. Not sure those ingredients went well together but I give them points for trying something different! My friend had salmon on avocado toast. It was lovely. The restaurant was very clean, and I even liked their place mats. I hadn't seen them before trying this location but afterward, I swear I saw like 5 more. I guess it's a pretty big franchise in the area. Definitely recommend it for a good, hearty breakfast that's worth the price."}
{"text":"Decided to bike to downtown Oakville and enjoy breakfast on a beautiful Sunday morning.  There was a bike locking stand by the side so it was meant to be!  First time here!  Service is friendly and prompt.  We ordered juice and coffee and the breakfast club and vegetarian scramblerz (that's not the name but it's all  veg).  Great variety on the menu to please kids and adults alike.  Food came out pretty quick.   It was all tasty and good value for what you pay.  Did I mention that service is friendly?  Really nice and so rare these days....."}
{"text":"Location: On Mansfield, across from the MAA. It's a pretty central location that you can access from Ste. Catherine street and PVM.  Service: Personally, I thought the service was good. We were seated right away and our waiter re-filled our coffee cups four times over the course of an hour so definite points for that.  When we told him we were done, he brought our bill immediately.   Food: I had the Fusion scrambler (scrambled eggs with sundried tomatoes, roasted red peppers, asparagus) minus the cheese and bread. I liked the eggs though they were a tiny bit dry. The potatoes were nice and crispy with a hint of seasoning, and the dish came with a side of applesauce. Standard breakfast fare and overall, I enjoyed it.   Price: I guess it depends on what you're looking for. Some might find that $12 for breakfast is a bit steep. If that's the case, they have an early bird special that runs for about $5."}
{"text":"Great service and food! Can't go bad with that! The waitress/ waiters are very nice and friendly. Always come to the table to check if you need coffee refills or would like to order anything else. Great place!"}
{"text":"Top notch breakfast, this is not your greasy spoon type breakfast. Quality dishes accompany fantastic presentation combined with courteous bilingual staff. Family friendly (I know this because a kid was screaming opera while I was there).  Lots of delicious choices on the menu, and servings are plentiful."}
{"text":"Good solid breakfast at reasonable prices. The staff are friendly, food is fresh, and atmosphere is pleasant. It is a good place to take your mom."}
{"text":"In the mornings, the sun comes in the windows and it is very enjoyable. The staff is nice. This food is good as expected from a Ben & Florentine. If you are not familiar with B&F this is upscale breakfast place with various egg dishes, ( english/american, omelettes. Bowls), fancy pancakes and french toast. Always plenty of good coffee."}
{"text":"Great little chain brunch place.  Reminds me of White Spot from the West Coast.  Lots of selection from omlettes, benedicts, breakfast sandwiches, skillets, and much much more.  Home fries are great, lots of flavor. Great value, you can spend $11-$13 for a lumberjack style breakfast.  It's a nice generic breakfast place!"}
{"text":"Really nice bright and friendly breakfast/lunch emporium, that is rapidly expanding across Montreal and beyond.  Mom and Pop have become CEO and President of a successful resto chain. Congrats!  Relaxed atmosphere belies the bee hive activity in the kitchen as it turns out the multitude of pancakes, waffles, French toast and crepes, with a load of fresh fruit, English cream, and bottomless cup of coffee.  I ordered the Rainbow Pancakes, consisting of 5 six inch diameter pancakes piled high with cut fruit, and a small cup of semi-sweet cream.  The table syrup was not maple, which was an extra charge.  While including the national pride maple syrup gratis would be a great touch, I can forgive them given the cost is more dear than diamonds.  The coffee was fine, if non-descript.   I could not finish my breakfast, which is rare for me.  I enjoyed the free wifi and the friendly banter with the easily bilingual waitress.    No wonder Ben and Florentine are growing.  They provide solid food and fair prices, with a friendly face."}
{"text":"this place is anything amazing but ok enough to go for brunch. I do love their sweet potato home fries though.  coffee is terrible, service is meh, sometimes cleaner than other times."}
{"text":"Today's brunch was at Ben & Florentine in Oakville. I've never been to this place but my visit today left me impressed. Although the place was already packed when we arrived, the hostess was quick to usher us to our table of four. Our server was on cue and we ordered our coffee while browsing through their menu, which by the way is huge. It was time to place our order: we ordered, Two eggs & crispy french toast, Classics, Healthy Scrambler, and Koko Loko for the little lady in our party. At times, we see the bottom of our coffee cups but it's understandable given the crowd. The food arrived. Our plates looked beautiful. Aside from the Healthy Scrambler, our breakfast order came with toast and potatoes. I opted for rye toast. The potatoes were diced, fried and lightly seasoned. It was good but not what I preferred. The fruits were fresh, eggs cooked to perfection, the bacon crispy as well as the French toast. All in all, the experience was positive, the food was good, the place was packed but did not slow down the service we received. Will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"We were staying in Brossard and this place was right across the street from our hotel.  We wanted a traditional Quebec breakfast, not an American style, so we came here both days instead of using the free full breakfast included in our hotel stay.  The staff was very friendly.  Service was fast.  They easily and happily accommodated our large group.  The food was great.  The only negative thing that prevents me from giving this review 5 stars is the creton.  My kids and I LOVE creton.  As far as the flavour of theirs goes, it was great.  However, the portion was very small.  Maybe a third of what you get at Cora's.  It was disappointing, especially since it tasted so good.  You could barley spread it over one piece of toast.  If they started giving real portions of creton, this would be a 5 star place.  The menu is very good.  Everyone easily found something they enjoyed."}
{"text":"This location is inside the Nun's Island indoor tennis courts. It's a good looking restaurant. They have some lovely tables near these high windows and those are the best seats. I went on a Saturday at 12pm and it was packed. Lots of families, it was very noisy. We got an ok table. It was near the tennis courts but far away from the sunshine which is a bummer because it was a beautiful day today.  The restaurant was clean.   The service was bad. We waited a very long time to get seated, order, and pay. Normally, I'm quite patient and don't mind but it was unusually long. I understand the place was full but by the time we were finished eating, most people had cleared out. We also noticed plenty of people being served before us even though they got in after us. Our waitress did let us know we would be getting our order soon but it still took a good 30 minutes.   The food was ok. It's a normal brunch place. I like their menu choices. I ended up getting a crispy chicken and avocado wrap and it was good but the chicken was a bit too crispy and dry. The breakfast potatoes were really good though. They came with some sour cream too which was really cool.   My boyfriend got a pancake with eggs, ham, and Swiss cheese. He said it was very good but not memorable. He ordered it with a side a hash browns and those were reallllllly good (in my opinion). It came with sour cream and apple sauce. The apple sauce was bad though.   Overall just an ok place for brunch. We are willing to give them another chance but it wasn't the best time we've ever had brunching."}
{"text":"Chaque fois que j'y suis allée, j'ai trouvé que j'avais obtenu un bon service. Le café n'est pas excellent, c'est un fait et je ne recommande pas de prendre une assiette de crêpes avec fruits, car j'avais été déçue par la sélection (principalement des melons) et la quantité de fruits. Les autres fois toutefois j'étais satisfaite de mes plats.  Cet endroit est comparable aux autres chaînes de restaurants à déjeuner. Je suis surprise que les autres avis soient si négatifs."}
{"text":"Can you bring this breakfast place to California?! Yum Yum!!  My husband got the standard Eggs Benedict and I got the Ten on Ten (I'm breastfeeding, so this momma is hungry!)  Both were cooked to perfection and my husband and I talked about how good our breakfast was on the way down to Niagara Falls. And our server was about as nice as you can get!!"}
{"text":"More like Ben & BUSY-tine. haha, even though it can be hard to get in, it's still a fun place to be with my two kids, they love the place, but personally, there's nothing here that;s much different from any other breakfast joint! :)"}
{"text":"More than 3 years have passed since my original review. The location has changed to the other side of the shopping complex since, and their menu has been revamped. Other than forgetting to bring us milk and cream for our coffees, the service was really attentive and accommodating.  I was so happy to have some freshly squeezed orange juice, but unless they are the new super-food I can't see why it's so expensive ($5), although the pricing seemed to be a general trend. I also had the Apple-Cheddar Crepes, replacing the caramel sauce with maple syrup. It was really delicious, but calling it a crepe is a bit misleading, it's a large, thinner-than-normal pancake. The texture was unmistakably pancake, so why not give it a different name? I don't know, might seem a bit silly but anyway, bumping my review up to a 3.5/5 for this visit - rounding it up to a 4 for fairness' sake."}
{"text":"Went here for an early Saturday breakfast and got the brie and mushroom eggs benedict.  It's almost a given that when I go for brunch, I will get eggs benny of some type or another.    What I liked: the menu was huge.  I think breakfast had at least 4-5 pages as did the lunch menu.  It was definitely a bit intimidating but i liked it.  It also included a gluten free section.    The eggs benedict was standard and tasty, but what I liked was the fact that they gave a nice big slice of watermelon, grapefruit and some apple sauce on the side.    What I didn't like: coffee was not refilled until close to the end of my meal.  It appeared that coffee wasn't being refilled too often for others as well.    Verdict: while I'd normally give 4 stars, it loses 1 star for infrequent coffee refills and at a price of $2.30, I would expect refills every 10 minutes or so.  Still, great place to try out."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I had a horrible experience today. We arrived at brunch and left at around lunch without having been served anything.  Upon arriving, the hostess seated us promptly and set our table. We waited over 15 minutes to be addressed by our waiter but she had gone to serve the table that arrived 10 minutes after us.  After waving down another staff member who brought us water, our server then arrived.  She didn't say hello or smile the entire time and when she brought our drinks, she placed it on the table from a foot away without saying anything and left. We did not hear from her for the next hour while we waited for our food.   Another table's server had to come by and to tell us the kitchen was a bit busy.   A busy kitchen is absolutely understandable, but we were there for over an hour and decided to get up and leave because of the sub-par service. We definitely would have told someone we were leaving and to cancel the order, but  no one had come by to check on us for the last 20 minutes."}
{"text":"Excellent brunch spot in Oakville! Very extensive menu. They have something for everyone. I know I'll definitely be returning to try more dishes. This time, I had the chorizo skillet. It was good, not great, but good enough to bring me back."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place in the West Island.   Food is excellent and service is great. I pretty much always go for the eggs benedict since A. it's delicious, and B. it makes for the perfect Instagram pic :P"}
{"text":"Efficient staff with even measured decorum. I had two eggs with creton and baked beans. Odd, their creton is served in a market-wrapped portion. Probably accessible in grocery stores soon. All elements of the meal we're fine. My wife had the egg benedict. The hollandaise sauce was rather sweet but still pleasant. Really folks, a good breakfast place but without the charm of a 'mom & pop' intangibles."}
{"text":"This is my go to place after working out at the studio next door. Service is always great, but tends to be a bit slower on weekends. Understandable, since it gets quite packed. I definitely recommend one of the smoothies. My favorite is the watermelon smoothie. Pretty much everything on their menu is a hit, but my personal favorite dish is the Delice Avocado. You get fruit, avocado on bread, eggs and fruit. For a little extra, ask for the house potatoes. I go for breakfast at least once a week here and I have never been disappointed."}
{"text":"New Year's day breakfast with friends. It was packed! Happy to see a Philly cheese steak Benedict on the menu. Delicious. The egg yokes were perfectly runny. The fries were perfectly fried. The fruit portion is abysmal. The coffee cup (which comes free with the meal) is also abysmal.  Who could have thought a coffee cup could be so small? The owner did! I felt like asking the waitress to leave the carafe on the table, but I didn't because of social rules and I was surrounded by non-drinkers... I LOVE fresh ground pepper on my Benedict! But this place has none. The decor is...absent? Is there a hostess? Nope. Wait. Hope. Wait some more. Empty table crying out for me to run to it! Wait.  All part of our wonderful social rules.  A much bigger coffee cup and fresh ground pepper is a MUST in every breakfast joint. It should be a law."}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast or lunch. Staff is always friendly and the potatoes are nice and crispy. Lots of sweet and Savory options on menu. I love combining eggs, bacon and a chocolate banana waffle with a mountain of salty potatoes.  Great healthy options too like quinoa salad and  vegetarian quesadilla.  I usually come every week for lunch."}
{"text":"Nice, hidden breakfast place in Ville St-Laurent. Service is usually on point; they tend to be more scarce when the restaurant is full but they're still attentive to your needs. It's truly reasonably priced for what you're getting. This time I got half a waffle with eggs, sausage, potatoes and apple sauce. It was perfect!"}
{"text":"Although Ben & Florentine is a chain restaurant, it does not discount its taste and quality of food. The service on the other hand, could be a little spotty even in New York standard.   We came here during busy lunch hour and were seated quite fast although quickly ignored for a good 5 minutes. The menu was quite extensive and the price is simply lovely. You pick an entree and you get free bread, coffee/tea and juice all for less than $14.   I got the two eggs scrambled with Canadian smoked meat with some wheat toast. I was so in love with the Canadian Smoked Meat! It is not the pastrami nor a corn beef. It is not bacon either. It is some thinly sliced, salty tender beef I have fallen victim to. The wheat toast is to my surprise, very fluffy and buttery. I have never had wheat toast tastes just as good as milky white bread."}
{"text":"We went here earlier in the morning and did not have any trouble finding seating however it did get busy later in the morning for brunch. The menu is extensive and delicious. Crepes, skillets, they got it all. Good service as well. They have a lot of locations around the world and in Quebec. It's in a small plaza so there's enough parking. Clean bathrooms. Will return."}
{"text":"Excellent variety and choices,  although it is a bit pricey for the quality. The ambience reminds me of a classier version of an University cafeteria. Overall it was a pleasant experience,  my wife LOVE the Benes."}
{"text":"Very nice and complete menu. Portions are a bit large (a bit too much) but lots of fresh fruits and healthy choices. Great service.  Nice, new alternative to the other well known chains."}
{"text":"Pretty AND delicious! I love a beautifully plates dish and I'm sure you're like \"but it's eggs\"... Yeah you can pretty up eggs and if you don't know how just ask the chef at Ben & Florentine!   The service was great. Greeted by a friendly hostess who saw we were with a small child and immediately brought over crayons and colouring sheets, to the waiter who came quickly to take our drink order. We were waiting a bit for the rest of our party to arrive and the staff was great about making sure the ones that were there were well taken care of.  Menu is laid out a bit strange, the \"normal\" breakfast choices are lost in the hustle BUT their focus is on THEIR specialities.   Everything was great and if you don't believe me, just check out my pics!  I will be back! Those waffles were PERFECT!!"}
{"text":"Have eaten at the location in Laval before and it was great, however this one was an awful experience. We arrived at 2pm on a Sunday and the restaurant was 80% empty. We were seated in a booth right near the front where two of the other booths around us had customers just leaving.  We then sat there for 20 mins. while at one point 5 other staff were chatting by our table, not one of them ever came to our table and welcomed us, offered coffee or water.  We walked out.  I wanted to stay and see just how long it took, then talk to a manager but my gf didn't want to make a scene. This was the worst service I have ever seen at any restaurant I've been to in my 35 years."}
{"text":"Had an awesome brunch with the family here today.. We ordered many different dishes and everything was delicious! Simple, clean interiors, friendly service, amazing food - they got it all! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"I actually had an awesome experience here, the food is amazing and I had 0 complaints about the service.   Yes it was packed and noisy but so what it's New Years !! I hope others from here one can have a pleasant experience, like I've had !"}
{"text":"I would give zero stars if I could. Absolutely the worst breakfast experience i have ever had. Went there with my husband on a weekday morning. It was moderately busy. The waitress took a good 10 minutes just to seat us. We asked for water right away...never got it. Ordered some smoothies and they came...still no water. Ordered our food, it finally came about 40 minutes later. No water. No cutlery. The waitress said to hold on while she gets us cutlery...a few minutes later we see her serving other tables. We finally just take cutlery off the table next to us and start eating. She never returns. My husbands breakfast skillet is completely burnt and not edible. Halfway through my tasteless bagel sandwich I realize there is MOLD on the bagel. Finally we call over another waitress because we cannot get ours to come back to our table. We ask for the manager. A young man with a sideways cap comes waltzing over to our table with a cigarette tucked behind his ear (I can't make this stuff up). He says \"Unfortunately it's my day off but I am here so what can I help you with\"....like really??? And asks what the issue is. We tell him: waiting for water, for cutlery, burnt food, moldy food. He says he's sorry and not to worry, that he won't charge us. LOL. I wasn't worried...there is NO WAY I would have paid for that poor excuse of a meal. All around awful service and not edible food. Wrote in a formal complaint to Ben and Florentine head office and received ZERO response. Please save yourself the displeasure and stay far away from this crap restaurant."}
{"text":"Under staffed once got busy took forever for our bills had to get up to pay. I couldn't sit any longer for him to come back with a machine. I did not like my skillet québécoise not impressed. Green tropical tea was good and he did offer me more water .Gave him a good tip not his fault its busy and still trying the best he can. Saturday Sundays should always have a lot of waiters."}
{"text":"Was in my bookmark for quite some time and finally had a chance to visit.  Came with the fam bam and a girlfriend.  Arrived on a Sunday at around 11am and wasn't too packed, given it was also -100 outside but regardless, appreciated the access to seats.  We got seated right away, except that they didn't have enough high chairs for the kiddos.  They really should invest in more.  I didn't realize that this was a franchise but hey so it is.  The menu was great with lots to choose from.  Food:   Banana Almond Pancakes-  Extremely sweet and the hazelnut spread was only on the first layer along with the Almonds and Bananas but the pancakes were fluffy but smaller than the others. Blueberry Burst- This was great, lots of fresh blueberries and they were sweet naturally.  The pancakes were very fluffy Bagel Lox-  This was pretty straight forward, a better bagel would've been better with it.  By better, I mean maybe a Montreal style bagel since the one given was a bit doughy and heavy.  The fruits that came with it were excellent.   Avocado Benedict-  Great hollandaise, it came with regular strips of bacon, very crunchy and the avocados were well ripened Kids Grilled Cheese-  they were very accommodating and allowed a substitution of fries instead of the home fries.  The cheese was plain American processed.  I kinda wished that it was real cheese. Kids Chocolate Chip Banana Pancake- This was basically the same as the Banana Almond except there were chocolate chips cooked within the pancake no bananas within the pancake.  It was a huge portion.  Atmosphere: It was definitely great for the family, lots of them.  The staff were quite attentive except for maybe coffee refills.  We had to ask for ours to be refilled several times.  The place was fairly clean as well.  They had an open kitchen and so that was appreciated, nothing for them to hide.  I look forward to visiting again and this time trying out the skillet options, they certainly looked good seeing the other patrons having it.  Also really want to try the latkes.  It was advertised in my placemat that they are opening in Mississauga and Toronto.  We're hoping it happens soon."}
{"text":"Good local breakfast place.    Very clean and bright.  I usually order the 2 eggs with fresh fruit.  They have many healthy selections as well as the traditional eggs and bacon dishes.  Food is always fresh and tasty.   What more can u ask for in a breakfast restaurant? I go there at least once a week."}
{"text":"Pas de \"bonjour\". Pas de \"ça ne sera pas long\". Pas de sourire.  Attendez et votre tour viendras un jour.   Les serveurs n'aiment pas leur travail ou encore gère mal leur stress quand leur tables sont rempli. Pas de courtoisie. Il y avait une serveuse avec le sourire et qui connectait vraiment ces clients. J'enviais ces clients parfaitement servi... Nous étions assis à côté de la cuisine: chicane et discorde palpable....  Seul point positif, les assiettes sont arrivées rapidement."}
{"text":"I've had better. The food is never great and the service can be slow. It shouldn't be a struggle to get a glass of water, but I'm 2 for 2 here."}
{"text":"Went this morning with a group of 22. This is what my group had to say; **Great venue!!!! Excellent food & especially the service. **Nice way to spend a Sunday. Meeting my friends for a brunch. Both service and food was great. Thank you Maria for organizing this brunch. **A wonderful Brunch And enough to feed an army Delicious and well presented !  Well Organized! **Great service and well organized to have food served well and a friendly atmosphere I think their comments says it all!  This is definitely a place I will return with my group. Event though Ben & Florentine is a chain, it's the people working there that make all the difference! And this place has it all in their  hearts!"}
{"text":"Très bon déjeuner, service impeccable prix raisonnable. Un des meilleurs Ben & Florentine que j'ai essayé."}
{"text":"Restaurant typique déjeuner. Menu intéressant. J'ai pris une omelette pour déjeuner. La qualité est bonne, mais je trouve que l'assiette de cora est meilleure dans la présentation et le goût. Le service est très bien."}
{"text":"Great spot for brunch! So many options for vegetarians. Large menu. Service staff was very friendly and food was delicious. Will be back again."}
{"text":"Ben & Florentine tends to specialize their menu beyond the conventional breakfast menu items. I ordered their breakfast club and it came with a decent portion of baked potatoes and a small cup of applesauce. The club sandwich was decent with eggs replacing the conventional chicken.... but I wouldn't have it again however. The potatoes were cooked well but were quite salty. I'd rather they under-salt then over-salt.... you simply can't go back. I didn't bother with the applesauce (not authentic).  The coffee is light but decent. We were served immediately upon arrival... and then we got back to back refills when it came around the time to pay.... rigggght. I needed a refill when my food was presented to me!! Service was cordial but the attention given was lackluster. He explained the coffee mugs were empty and they needed to refill it but let's be honest folks... if I'm waiting 30+ minutes for coffee in a breakfast place, we're not on point.  Price-tag is about average.  Maybe I'll be back... maybe not. I'll keep you all in suspense."}
{"text":"J'adore cette succursale de Ben & Florentine!  C'est toujours bon et frais, la quantité de nourriture est parfaite, la température des plats aussi. As-tu déjà essayé la poutine-déjeuner? Moi non, mais c'est la prochaine étape. Les oeufs bénédictine sont vraiment sa-vou-reux. Et les p'tites patates aussi. :)  Les grandes fenêtres nous donnent une super vue sur le château d'eau de Sainte-Thérèse. Non pour vrai, il y a plein de soleil et ça fait du bien. Le service est spécialement cool, on dirait que le staff est toujours de bonne humeur. L'accueil est génial et on s'assure de notre bien-être et que notre tasse de café est bien remplie et chaude.   Juste à écrire cette review-ci, j'ai envie d'y retourner."}
{"text":"Bon bon bon.  Bel accueil et service rapide pour la commande initiale, ça, rien à redire.  Je dirais même très rapide (15 minutes tout au plus).  Par contre, le repas, c'était... décevant? Peu goûteux? Et coûteux? 3,50$ pour un petit verre de jus d'orange qu'on devine d'une marque commençant par O... la déception, quoi. Des oeufs bénédictine trop cuits, un muffin anglais froid, des patates tièdes, la sauce qui avait un goût particulièrement inintéressant...   De plus, aucun réchaud de café pendant notre repas (on est restées un bon bout, peut-être une heure).   Vraiment pas ma plus belle expérience de resto déjeuner, côté bouffe. Dommage parce que j'aime bien d'autres succursales du Ben & Florentine."}
{"text":"Great place for breakfast! I've been to different Ben & Florentine, and this one was as good as the others. They have a great variety in the menu and the service is excellent. I love their pancake with blueberries, it's so delicious! Next time, I'm definitely ordering their \"croque déjeuner\" which is a sandwich with made with eggs, chorizo, guacamole and other goodies!!"}
{"text":"My favorite place to have a brunch in the West Island ! There's always something new to try in their menu. Would recommend the crispy french toast and their smoothies, so delicious! Have tried coming with groups and never had trouble to find a spot. Good service."}
{"text":"Been coming in for a long time & it seems like the cooks have changed their ways of cooking ! Microwaved bacon & sausages, not too happy. Honestly it sucks because service is great & it's a cute restaurant but microwaves bacon& sausages is a no from me."}
{"text":"Toasts frette, service médiocre, ambiance extrêmement stressé, manque de personnel, je n'ai jamais eu la sauce Tobasco que j'ai demandé deux fois. No thanks!"}
{"text":"9/10 times I always order eggs benedict when visiting a brunch spot so I liked that Ben and Florentine had several variations of it. I had the chorizo version and while it was good, I can't say it blew me out of the water. The home fries were also average. That said, I'll definitely go back to try some other items on the menu since there is a ton to choose from."}
{"text":"I don't eat cheese so asked them to sub the cream cheese on my sandwich for avocado or hummus. They said they can only sub cheese for other cheeses, veggies for other veggies, etc... Very strange service."}
{"text":"I got the Lox, basically Eggs Benedict with smoked salmon.   It was good, tasty. I like the smoked salmon on my benedict and the saltiness of it was like having bacon. I also upgraded to the potato pancakes for extra $2.25.   The server that we had regularly checked up on us despite the busy Sunday brunch. I appreciated that. I say negative points on my dirty knife, but it happens, not a biggie. I only gave it a 2 star was because it wasn't something oh so extraordinary, for the price we paid. I say this place should be $$$. We paid over $60 for 2 plates, a small glass of smoothie and a hot chocolate. The smoothie was pretty small, probably a cup. This experience is insanely expensive for a breakfast meal IMO. For what it is, the food experience is not something memorable enough to spend that much on it.   It's not that it's a bad restaurant, but I don't recommend it. I mean if you're rolling in bills and feel like grabbing brunch, sure. If you're watching where your money is going, don't bother with this place. I've had better breakfast, that's not even close to this cost."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast spot.  Clean, great service and the best menu options ever.  Definitely gonna visit again."}
{"text":"I visited Ben & Florentine this weekend after trying a few other spots for family day that were closed (I know - silly idea!). I was meeting a friend so I didn't mind the wait (it was about 20 minutes for a table to open up, for two people). Unfortunately for some that were waiting the hostess lost the list, luckily I came in after this happened and of course let everyone waiting before me go ahead of me even though the hostess was confused (I'm so nice, I know!). After we were seated and opened the menu - wow! It was pages and pages long - options from eggs Benedict, to skillets, to pancakes and waffles, to omelettes and anything in between. I liked that they had all different smoothies too! After reading the novel menu I decided to try the blueberries and brie French toast and my friend tried the strawberry fields crepes! Both orders came quickly and the portions were huge! Mine had three French toasts with a ton of toppings, and my friends crepes were crammed full of toppings and Nutella and they filled the entire big plate! Needless to say we could not finish the meals but they were both really well made and fresh! This Quebec chain is doing a great job in Oakville and I can't wait for them to expand into Toronto and the rest of Ontario. I was pleasantly surprised and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"When I need to wait 30+ minutes for a bagel and an order of Eggs Benedict this is all I'll give in ratings. Crazy slow service from the kitchen. The fruit was not fresh and was basically made up of a banana with some nasty grapes. The Benedict was good but not exactly steaming hot according to my husband. Just skip this place."}
{"text":"IF YOU'RE A BLACK PERSON, GO AT OWN RISK  Was in Montreal for my father's funeral and was staying near by.  Decided to take my family for breakfast.   Upon arrival encountered oughty looks from patrons initially and subsequently our waiter.  The waiter was so not interested in serving us that he ended spilling apple juice all over my son.   My wife and kids became indignant and wanted to leave immediately and we did just that.   I grew up in the area and it reminded me as to why I packed up and left Montreal.   Needless to say, we never ate."}
{"text":"Went to Ben and Florentine on St Charles with my sister, brother in-law and Maki who is visiting from Japan.   I had the aloha smoothie which consists of mango, peach and pineapple and I had them add yogurt to it.  For brunch I had French toast home fries and bacon and two sunny side up eggs.   The smoothie was delicious and so was the food."}
{"text":"I personally love their breakfast!  I just HATE their customer service...man, they SUCK!!!  I would have given them 4 stars if they had better service...don't get me wrong, the people are friendly.  It's just that every FREAKING time I've gone there...the waitress just looks at me and I seat myself.  Then, she drags her ass to come ask me for any type of service...like coffee.  After she gets my stuff, she just sits at one of the tables to read the newspaper and chat with the regular customers.  Again, the food is actually pretty good...just the service SUCKS!!!!  After I finish with my food...I take myself to the front to get the bill myself.  Then, I take it to the LAZY waitress.  lol!"}
{"text":"This restaurant had some interesting menu choices- a large variety. I appreciate the health conscious selections and smoothie portions. My breakfast pouting was delicious. I would definitely return here, and the service for a busy morning was exceptional. I would recommend this restaurant to others when they are visiting Montreal."}
{"text":"I was very excited for a new breakfast place to open near my house. Unfortunately, I came away disappointed. It's not terrible, but it's not great either ... just kinda meh.  I had the Big Ben. On the positive side, the Ham was great. The eggs and toast were fine. Orange juice was mediocre. Coffee was terrible, like bitter, tasteless, black water. The sausages seemed like they started off crispy but were then stuck in a pan to keep them warm, making them sweat and turning soggy. And, the worst offence, the bacon was fatty, too thin and completely limp. Honestly, if you can't do bacon right, why open a breakfast place?  I am a little torn about their home fries, which had flavourful seasoning but seem like they came out of a McCain freezer bag with a deep-fried style coating rather than like diced up potatoes. However, I am certain this is a matter of personal taste.   Did not try one of the delicious sounding pancake dishes, but will return to try one and update my review accordingly.   In summary: this place is fine if you are craving breakfast, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come here. There are a couple better choices and almost every other place I would rate as just as good.  I will note that they have just opened, so perhaps it will get better. But I feel like my issues are the kind that a franchise restaurant cannot improve upon (like changing the bacon they use, or getting a better peanut butter for the toast)."}
{"text":"Good food. Everything looks appetizing. Will try again. Food took a while to come.  We got something extra that we didn't order. My second latte came way too late."}
{"text":"Very nice! The hash browns and egg benedict are sooo great. I get soooooooo full. And the menu has so many choices that I am looking forward to try."}
{"text":"Great dinner for indulgent breakfast!!!  The menu is entirely in French so good luck and order something you might not know exactly what it is LOL!!!  He had the french toast with brie, blueberries, granola and yogurt and almonds. It was served but was way under cooked so he sent it back. The server was apologetic and replaced it quickly.  I had the three musketeers and it was perfect!  They did charge me for the lemon I asked for in my water which was odd."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch. Highly recommend it if you're in the area. Good selection and a much better choice that's tastier and prepared nicer than Coras. Friendly staff. Smoothies are good and the entrees are delicious. Convenient if you're staying at the holiday inn."}
{"text":"Get there early on weekends s tables are hard to find. On weekdays, enjoy an earlybird menu good from 6am-8:30am"}
{"text":"Five stars for this little gem! I am NOT a breakfast person (heresy, I know), so usually when I'm travelling, I will have \"breakfast\" at 10:30 or 11:00 so I can have lunch food as my first meal of the day. But I showed up at Ben and Florentine at 7:00 on a Sunday morning, not expecting much, and was pleasantly surprised. They blew me out of the park! This is one of the only places I've ever been that makes me crave more breakfast food.  I ordered sausages wrapped in crepes with real maple syrup, with hash browns and fresh fruit on the side, and my meal was delicious! The sausage was perfectly cooked and the crepes were fluffy and slightly sweet, and the maple syrup just sealed the deal. Real maple syrup!!! It's $1 extra, but totally worth it. The hash browns were also great, and the mountain of fruit was HUGE. I couldn't finish the whole meal...there were three crepes, plus all that fruit and those hash browns, so come hungry. All in all, a great experience!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a brunch place to celebrate my son's bday and came across this gem while searching yelp. None of the brunch places I called would take a reservation and said the waits may be long on the weekend. My younger son and I went to line up first and hubby, bday boy and cousin came a little later. Once we lined up around 10:45, there were about 3 parties ahead of us. We only waited in line about 15 minutes before we got our table. There was a continuous line after us but people were brought in fairly quickly. It's a casual brunch restaurant but their signage, menus, etc are very nice and professional. It was obvious they were a franchise vs a small local place. There is an open kitchen and clean washrooms on the main floor. Service was friendly but quite slow likely related to the long weekend rush. You could omit ingredients from menu items but you could not substitute in anything. The menu is extensive and impressive. We all started with a smoothie or juice (I requested my smoothie without yogurt). We all ordered a variety of meals and everyone was happy. I ordered the quinoa skillet minus the cheese....they would not let me add avocado to it. It was loaded with veggies but very bland. I had to add Frank's red hot to it as it did not really have any flavour to it. I had wanted a buckwheat crepe but none of the fillings appealed to me. Once I checked in on yelp, I got a 15%off coupon to use (Mon-Fri, so I saved it). Overall a great brunch place....will be back again. P. S. Their gf bun was light and airy, nicely toasted and yummy"}
{"text":"I had the deluxe grill sandwich with bacon and a delicious potato soup. I was surprised that the meal also came with home fries and tea, enough food for two!  I was very satisfied with my meal, service and price. Friend ordered waffles with English cream and cleaned her plate so I'd say we both were happy with our visit!"}
{"text":"OMG - Yum yum. This great breakfast spot in a small strip mall is fab.  We have the bacon and eggs with blueberry pancakes. Those pancakes were fantastic!! The wait staff are wonderful too.  So many choices on the menu it was hard to pick -- but lots of benedicts, omelettes, french toast etc.   Note -- their is a small upcharge for real maple syrup as opposed to regular syrup. We opted for the maple -- I mean this is Canada right? Kind of required!! lol"}
{"text":"I needed to meet a friend since he needed to pick something up so we decided to meet here for breakfast. Let me just say that I rarely will have a \"real\" breakfast. If I have anything for breakfast at all, I will generally have a juice.  We went at around 9:30am on a holiday (Victoria Day) and there wasn't a lot of people here. After being seated, I took a look at the menu and decided what I wanted. My friend did likewise. He decided to go with the \"Big Ben\" (comprised of 2 eggs, bacon, ham, & sausages) whereas I decided to go with the \"Blackjack\" (comprised of pancakes, topped with bananas, icing sugar, strawberries, & whipped cream on the side). We both had some coffee as well.  Since the restaurant wasn't busy, our orders came relatively quick. My friend made a comment to the waitress about it not being busy and she mentioned that it is normally busier than the time we went since it was a holiday and most places (ex: the garages next door and the municipal building close by) were closed.  I can say that my pancakes were very good. My friend gave me a few slices of bacon and ham from his plate and I thought that they were good as well. Bacon was cooked right (not too crispy and not too soggy).  Service was good. We were offered refills of our coffee a few times.  Since my friend was paying, I'm not sure what the exact cost was but I believe that each of our plates were around $15 (give or take a few dollars) so it is somewhat pricey for breakfast in my opinion.  Free parking in the front and they accept credit cards."}
{"text":"Great breakfast place in Ville saint Laurent. Coffee is light and not too bad. I find there omelets pretty good, especially the Montebello.  If I you a fan of mushrooms that's a great choice. New on the menu is skillets, seems to be a popular choice. I had the Philly but I found it lacked flavor if you're really a fan for there potato fries then I'd recommend it.  Portions are a good size and service is always friendly. Always coming around for coffee refills. The seating is well spaced out and booths are comfortable.  New menu! And looking forward to try some of the new selections."}
{"text":"I ordered the bagel, salmon, cream cheese and it had sides that were fruits and potatoes fries. It was good but it was a bit uneventful. But My bf got the chicken and waffles with honey. Honestly, I think the chicken and waffles were really good. I wished I order that instead of the bagel and salmon thing. the service was really good and we had a good time. We really liked the experience and would go back again."}
{"text":"Boyfriend grabbed up breakfast for take out. Smoothies were ok, the rest of the order was overcooked or not what we asked for. Forgot to give him the different potatoes he asked, didn't include the extra cheese he paid for, overcooked my eggs, burnt toast, not even fruit included. Very disappointing."}
{"text":"I'm not sure how to even rate this. I saw the menu and had high expectations. The options and taste of the food was totally on point and I will surely come back based on that alone. But my waitress was not great at all. Nelly smiled and seemed nice, yes, but after waiting what seemed like exceptionally long for eggs benny, I hear her manager have to tell her to pick up my food after it had been sitting there and the cook kept ringing the bell and then my eggs were cold when I got them. And she never once asked me how it was or even came to check on me until I was completely done for a while and At that point I asked for the bill. Still no inquiry by her as to how my meal was. I know because  I was specifically waiting for an opportunity to compliment the chef but comment on the foods temperature. And also, their was 4 tables full and a complete waitstaff in the place because I came an hour to close. So incase you were wondering, she wasn't run off her feet... as I left (5 minutes before closing) she was enjoying what looked like a hot breakfast... hopefully I'll get a better waitstaff next time. :( if I had a good experience with staff it would have been a 5 out of 5"}
{"text":"Been waiting to try this place for a while, came on a Saturday morning expecting it to be packed but it was quite nice and wasn't so packed. We were at a down right away and given the menus, so many great options to choose from!! Our waitress came right away, very nice and friendly.  I personally ordered the Lox Benedict because it combined 2 of my favourite things; smoked salmon & eggs florentine - while my friend order the Brie and something Benedict.  while waiting for the food, we got coffee, a bit overpriced for the taste but it was unlimited.   It took a while for the food to come out by was definitely worth the wait. The quality was amazing. I've never had such good hollandaise sauce. And The combination with the smoked salmon was smoothing different but good!   However, I was quite upset that they didn't have a small cupcake or muffin to sing my friend a happy birthday or even a scoop of ice cream to blow a candle on."}
{"text":"Food was really good. Service was friendly and actually really good but the wait was unacceptable. I would not blame the staff for the wait. I would blame the owners directly for under staffing. Looks like long waits is a very common review for this place. Hopefully ownership wakes up and fixes the problem. I would not recommend this place and certainly would never return."}
{"text":"Lots of amazing options. You can pretty much customize your breakfast to suit your self.  Lots of gluten free options too. Everything is delicious!"}
{"text":"Ben and Florentine in my mind is an up and coming breakfast chain. Cora is the local home grown success story of one Cora Tsouflidou who decided to provide some more artistic fresh fruit flair to breakfast. Cora's is across Canada now and 130+ restaurants. Ben and Florentine has roughly 30+ in the province of Quebec and I believe restaurants in Ontario now as well. My issue with Cora's however is it's easily a $15-$20 breakfast. B&F is similar so you must be cautious as you can easily rack up the bill.   The menu selection is large. Everything you can think of from eggs, omelettes , skillets, pancakes, crepes and then some lunch items such as burgers, salads and sandwiches. Also a very solid kids menu. I much prefer this menu than to Cora's. On my visit I had a classic eggs Benedict. My wife had a chorizo omelette 2 eggs rather than the usual 3. My Benny was perfect with lots of hollandanise sauce. She really enjoyed her omelette. We had a buy one regular and get another breakfast 50% off coupon. Fantastic that two large breakfasts with a breakfast smoothie and my coffee with tip was just under $30 with 15% tip and tax with the coupon. Otherwise it would have been high $37-38.   Service was fantastic and the restaurant is modern in decor and clean.   We eat breakfast out infrequently as I believe I'd rather spend $30-40 on lunch rather than eggs and toast."}
{"text":"Average . Been twice . Had the Mexican skillet- last time Not impressed. Stick the more basic things here I guess . But the service is always great and they have wi fi."}
{"text":"I am really giving this place a 3.5 stars.   Came here with a friend for brunch as it wasn't to far from the where we were and it had great a great rating.   Food: Let me start with the food. I had the bacon and apple grilled cheese with home fries and a Nutella and banana sandwich on my the side and my friend had the classic egg benedict. The food was good and the portions weren't overwhelming as you have at other brunch places. everything tasted really good and came out warm. The Nutella and banana sandwich brought me back to my childhood as it was exactly how my mother used to make it for me.   Service:  Alright now on to the service. We were able to get a table pretty quickly because we were only 2 people. If you are going with 3 or more people except a 20-30 minute way especially on Sunday's. Some of the staff were really young there and inexperienced so they forgot a couple things. Also I tried to order an additional meal off of the children's menu with my main course but they wouldn't let me and made me order it in pieces which was slightly more expensive.   Overall the experience was good but not amazing. I might try the place again but I will wait a while before I do."}
{"text":"Service was good today. The food was just okay. I had an omelette that was kind of a mess and the eggs had not been well mixed. Others at the table had the Benedict, grilled cheese and a strangely sweet spinach and cheddar crepe served with maple syrup.  Based on the last time we were here, I think they do best with pancakes and waffles."}
{"text":"So it's mother's day. Decided to try out a new breakfast place to try out. We found Ben & Flortenine on yelp and seems to have a great ambience. Got there at around 11:10 AM . Wait time to get seated wasn't bad  even with the amount of people waiting waiting to be seated outside, we were seated at 11:19. By 11:30 our orders were placed....  It is now 12:15 pm and we still don't have our orders. That's almost an hour from being seated."}
{"text":"Great food nice people they don't take American Express and I'll never eat here again. If the owner is too cheap to take American Express forcing me to pay another was to my inconvenience than I won't patronize them at all"}
{"text":"Amazing food, good location, amazing options.  I had the bacon avocado eggs Benedict any my bf had TWO dishes because he couldn't decide.....some amazing pancake bacon egg tower (sorry forgot the name but they have a photo of it) and a mexican omelette.  If you are an instagramer you can take pics and submit and possibly be on their future ads and menus.  If you are in Montreal you should try this place......all day breakfast!!!!!"}
{"text":"Food is good, but service is very disappointed. Staff totally enough for a busy day, but non of them working hard to care or even notice if customers need service. Rude server dropped a piece of bread of my plate on the table, and didn't even apologize."}
{"text":"My favourite breakfast place! They prepare the food and serve it really nicely. I even had a flower on it which made it cute"}
{"text":"Boy what a menu!!!!!! Not easy to choose. One notch over most breakfast à la mode joints. Fair prices and large servings. Try them!"}
{"text":"Was in Montreal for the weekend and my friends and I popped by on a Saturday morning for some breakfast.  Was super busy and we were able to get the last table.  After perusing through the menu which had numerous options, we decided on the philly benedict, three meat skillet and avocado, bacon and goat cheese dish.  After reading the reviews, I agree with the comments regarding wait times.  It took about 40 minutes for our food to arrive at the table!!!  But overall, it was a typical standard breakfast/brunch spot.  Food was average, but nothing to boast about."}
{"text":"Just avoid this place. The coffee is terrible. Blueberry pancake was like rubber. Service is really bad too. Walk over to Universal on Peel instead!"}
{"text":"We stopped in at peak lunch time for a holiday Monday brunch (August civic holiday) with our two friends. They don't take reservations on weekends or holidays, but we didn't have to wait more than 10mins for a table. The food was good and the service was speedy and friendly, especially given how busy they were. We would return if in the Oakville area again for breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"Three stars is very accurate for the overall quality of this brunch place. The food is passable and the service is just the right amount; not negligent nor amazing. It is a cool spot for families and big groups. The kitchen is open and the smell spreads right into the seating area which may cause your hair and clothes smell like fried food so come in your own caution. I highly recommend the smoothies. Portions are huge."}
{"text":"Food was decent, although not particularly unique imo. Service was quite slow. (They're pretty busy so its also understandable I guess). Skillet was soooo filling. Nomnom"}
{"text":"I only go here when I'm in the area because it's the only brunch place that doesn't have a line up on a Saturday morning... Maybe it's a sign? The service is horrible and extremely slow. It usually takes 20 minutes go get a cup of coffee. The potatoes are tasteless, the eggs Benedict are super runny, the coffee tastes like dirty water... And the list goes on and on. I've given this place a chance, twice, and it just gets worse. If you're able to get in and out of this place with the RIGHT order and under 3 hours, it's a miracle."}
{"text":"Great option nearby if Stoney's, Kerr St., Gingerman Social, et al. other breakfast/brunch places are full!  Which is highly likely if the weather is nice out.  :)  Interior looks like a Sunset Grill/Smitty's/other chain breakkie diner places.  So nothing too exciting.  Lotsa use of yellow/orange.  Places was full for a Sunday lunch service.  Again, good sign!  Menu is very extensive, with various sections for smoothies, eggs benedicts, pancakes, waffles, crepes, sandwiches, salads, etc.  Unless you know what you want to order, length/variation in menu is a bit overwhelming.  Prices are a bit higher than a Sunset Grill-type place.  I'd say average dishes are around $12-13.  Food took a while to roll out, but it was worth it - both portion/quality-wise!  Homefries were soo good.  I got \"The Breakfast Club\" sandwich that came with homefries and a small side of applesauce and I was only able to eat half of sandwich.  Service was friendly.  Was offered a refill for my coffee without asking.  So I'd definitely go back if I was in the area!"}
{"text":"Je suis allée deux fois à cette sucursalle, et ce fut deux expérience différentes. La première fois, nous étions deux avec une amie et nous sommes arrivées vers 10h30, nous avons été rapidement installés et pris en main, La serveuse était vraiment gentille et attentive, nous a su répondre à nos questions sur le menu. J'ai pris une omelette avec du fromage de chèvre et des épinards et j'ai rajouté un extra avocat. Leur patates sont délicieuses et bien assaisonnées, ce qui est très important pour une place à déjeuners. Nous sommes parties de là vers 11h45, le ventre plein et prêtes à continuer notre journée, mais nous avons remarqué que le restaurant commençait à se remplir et une file s'était formée devant.  Lors de ma seconde visite nous étions un petit groupe de 5 personnes et nous sommes arrivés vers 11h, il n'y avait pas encore de file mais le restaurant était bien rempli et nous avons dû attendre un peu avant que quelqu'un nous remarque et nous trouve une table. Après un petit cinq minutes nous avons été placés au second étage/mezzanine. Il y a un seul serveur pour cette portion du restaurant et il était un peu \"overwhelmed\" et confus j'ai trouvé. Nous avons attendu un bon 10 minutes avant qu'il vienne prendre notre commande, une fois la commande placé il nous a d'abord apporter nos boissons, il avait oublié le citron que j'avais demandé pour aller avec mon thé, ça a pris un bon 10 minutes avant qu'il me l'apporte. Cette fois-ci j'avais pris une poêle mexicaine, et Boy! c'était bon, beaucoup de patates (comme j'aime) et tout était bien cuit et assaisonné. Le seul hic fut que tous les légumes étaient en dessous des patates donc je conseil de bien mélanger pour avoir un peu de tout à chaque bouchée.   Pour conclure, je pense que j'y retournerai mais en semaine un matin vers 10h."}
{"text":"Fantastic stop for quick breakfast/lunch. Vegetarian options and fast paced service. A bustling diner with great menu."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in Ville Saint Laurent. Not a coffee drinker so I can't give my opinion on that. A little crowded as I went on Sunday but they wait was bearable. Services was great and food was really delicious. My waffles were fantastic and perfectly fluffy. Will go back soon :)"}
{"text":"Service was just awful. Food was cold. And I have never had a more rude waitress! We asked her if we could place our orders to which she said sure but then proceeded to walk away and took another table's order that came in way after us!!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast here twice last week, was very close to where the major hotels are and shopping on Ste. Catherines. HUGE breakfast menu and, best of all, lots of gluten free options (I had gluten free crepes which were excellent). Service can be a bit spotty when they are busy. Good value and very good food."}
{"text":"This place is a sad disappointment. We walked in, the place was packed. We worried about getting a seat right away but we're seated within 10 minutes. This was just an illusion because we didn't get our food until an hour after we sat down. It wasn't just our food, everyone around us was waiting and you could see the frustration and dissatisfaction in their faces.  The staff looked extremely busy, but yet we somehow had one water refill and one coffee refill the whole time. It took so long that we ordered everything together to start, drinks and food included, and then immediately asked for the check once the food was delivered to finally leave. We have seen other reviews where they said similar things and the service took a long time, but we hoped it was a rare occurrence. After going there, it seems to be the case. Food was nothing speculation, small portions. Taste was good but definitely not worth the wait.  Don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"I had the most spectacular breakfast experience in this restaurant. Came here twice recently and was very pleased. The location is set near perfect for the people in brossard, and in close walking distance from where I live. WIN!   First off, with the food I'm sure everyone will be pleased with their dishes. They dont overcharge you and dont platter useless fruits all over your plate. I know some folks most probably like fruits with their orders but I think its better to charge extra as a side than just giving a whole bunch of fruits. This gives me more of the particular omelette, smoked salmon bagel, or pancakes that Im having without wasting a lot of fruits. Hash browns are a most order side here. And so is the smoothies, they use real fresh fruits and have a whole bunch of flavors for everyone to choose from in variety of small and large sizes ;)  Both the times that I was here, I was served with a happy smile and fast service despite the whole place being packed!!! Atmosphere is friends, family and cozy enough for even just one person to get a seat by the window and watch cops pull over drivers for tickets... Just kidding, although a good watch for a morning view depending on how bored you are.   Verdict: A Go to place if you want some cool breakfast =)"}
{"text":"Oh boyy where do I begin. The experience was very very weird. Partially because their Brossard location is a great hit with me and I never have any complains with their actual food. Anyways to start with, this downtown location is always busy, so try to reserve earlier on if you can. Now I don't know about you but I'm usually on the cranky side when I am already hungry for breakfast and not have a coffee fix yet. So breakfast places usually have to run an extra mile to get on my happy side. A side tip would definitely be come here with you're caffeine dose on the weekend mornings.  I went in with my husband, and waited a good 10 minutes before I got seated. Not a problem, but took an extra 10 minute before the waitress got to us. Even then its okay, its busy, everyone's stressed, someone didnt have their coffee yet, heyy no biggie. What annoyed me to begin with was my seat on the booth was a bit scrapped off. Management should really take a note because I am sure proper seating suits well in a place like that.  Then the hostess literally just drops the utensils on the table. Gee, thanks. Already annoyed luckily the waitress came to save my day. She was really all I could ask for at the time of and the only reason I gave this review an extra star from 1 to 2. Didnt catch her name, but she was really calm and I felt really relaxed. The drinks were okay. But, the food was a bit weird. I usually always order their pancakes called black jack, which is chocolate chip pancakes with shit tonnes of powdered sugar, whip cream and chocolate. I didnt get my chocolate sauce here, and when I asked the waitress whats up, she told me they usually dont serve the sauce. Before making a scene, she was smart enough to bring me the sauce, after I told her that I have this dish quite often at their brossard location. I really wasnt too happy with my experience here. The food wasnt horrible but not as outstanding or anything like the other place I go to. I only appreciated the servers attitude but that too will probably never make me return to this location. Sigghh"}
{"text":"Ugh. The service here was so terrible. First, we were seated in a dark area at a table far from everyone else, which was also the area on the way to the bathrooms. We asked to be moved and got what we wanted, but neither the hostess nor our new server were pleased about it.  What else? The food was fine, but I was grouchy because it took forever and I didn't have water. After asking for water three times, I finally got a tiny lukewarm glass, but only after we had finished eating completely. My husband also got his side of toast then. Was it supposed to be dessert? And even though I kept asking about the coffee that was supposed to come with our meals, it never showed up.   The waitress was nice enough, but totally stressed out, and kept complaining to us, albeit in a jokey way, that she had to clean up after everyone, and it would take forever. Oh, and I could never get the wifi to work.  I was so annoyed by the whole experience and from wasting a vacation meal on this place, that it took me a while to calm down. Fun!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I wanted to go for breakfast this morning, and stumbled upon B&F. We thought we'd try it out since we have both heard of it but never had it. The waitress was super friendly and very nice. A good start to our breakfast. We had a tough decision because the menu had so many choices to choose from . Between the strawberry field crêpes to the \"bananamandes\" pancakes, they all seemed delicious. I had ended up ordering the strawberry Field crêpes and my boyfriend ended up ordering the Number ten, consisting of eggs, sausages, bacon, toast and waffles, with a side order of beans. The wait didn't take long, max 20 minutes. And when the food came, the presentation was so beautifully done. I knew from the smell and presentation that this would be a good meal. We had both taken our bites from the plates, and we both fell in love. We have made multiple compliments throughout the meal. It was absolutely fantastic. The crepe melted into the mouth, and the fruits were very fresh. Just perfect. My boyfriend and I have had our share of breakfast places and this was by far the best yet. Will definitely come back and make this our new favourite breakfast place. Can't wait to go again."}
{"text":"Ben & Florentine is decent. It's usually busy, good for a brunch/breakfast. The burgers are also OK. We've been here a few times and tend to always be pleased."}
{"text":"Je ne peux même pas comprendre que des gens puissent donner plus de 3 étoiles à ce restaurant. J'y suis allée il y a plus de 5 ans et je lui ai donné une deuxieme et dernière chance hier. Franchement, rien n'a évolué ni sur le plan de la qualité et de la fraîcheur des aliments que sur le service. Nous sommes arrivés à 12:15 au restaurant. Nous avons dû attendre pres de 10 Minutes avant de recevoir de l'eau et du café. Nous étions déjà prêt à commander mais la serveuse qui ne sait pas de quelle façon sourire à disparu aussitôt les cafés servis. Nous avons donc du attendre et attendre encore. Nous avons passé la commande. Tout au long de l'attente, sachez que vous serez dérangés par le bruit de la préparation des smoothies, on entend sans arrêt le bruit du mélangeur, ainsi que le bruit au sein du restaurant. Mon copain m'a fait remarqué qu'il y avait bien trop de tables. En effet, il y a a peine d'espace entre les clients, ce qui nuit à la circulation et fait en sorte que les serveurs semblent débordés. À ma grande surprise les clients qui se sont assis 10 Minutes apres nous ont déjà été servis. Je dis à notre serveuse que c'est pas normal. Que cela fait une heure que nous sommes la. Elle ose me répondre avec une attitude déplacée que cela ne fait pas une heure. Je lui précise qu'en effet cela fait une heure que je suis assise à cette table....Je n'ai jamais vu un serveur repondre aux clients, nous n'avons certainement pas la même notion du service à la clientèle. Nos plats arrivent, présentation moyenne et au niveau de la qualité encore moins que moyenne. Mon plat de guacamole très fade. La guacamole ne goûtait presque rien, manque de sel, de goût de lime. Bref, c'est de l'avocat pilé. La crêpe (pancake) de mon copain n'avait également aucune saveur, pas le bon goût de beurre qu'on pourrait espérer. Donc si vous avez le choix allez ailleurs!!! Pas loin vous trouverez l'universel le eggpectations à la place des arts et bien plus ....."}
{"text":"Came here for a quick eat before heading home in the States. So this place reminds me of a better IHOP or a breakfast Applebees. The hostess led us to our table and gave us menus. But we didn't speak French so 3 out of 4 menus were in French. But it's okay, cause we can just look at the pictures. (haha) We asked for 3 English menus when our waitress came. It's quite a big menu with various breakfast things. There is a lunch part if you are here for lunch. I got a traditional eggs benedict, which was portioned very well. It tasted pretty average. Hollandaise wasn't heavy, which is good. I felt like our waitress kind of disappeared at the end of our meal, but that might because they tucked us in corner. It was fine, she came and checked up on us.  Ben & Florentine is definitely one of the better chain restaurants that I've been to. The place is clean and bright. I like it, but the food could use a little work.   Aside: This has nothing to do with the restaurant, just in Montreal in general. Do most restaurants in Montreal carry the change around so they don't have to go back to a cashier? I just found that interesting."}
{"text":"My fiancé and I were in Oakville around brunch and decided to find somewhere for brunch. I typed gluten free into yelp (ahh, trusty yelp!) and we decided to try out Ben and Florentine. Didn't have many reviews but the few it had were great!  The restaurant was super busy (always a good sign!) but we were approached right away. I asked if they had a specific gluten free menu, and the owner said she would take care of us :) The menu had a gluten free section - including buns! And bread! But she told me that almost anything on the menu could be made gluten free.  I decided to order a gfree breakfast sandwich - it had ham, egg, tomato, Swiss cheese and lettuce, all on a gfree bun that was so soft and delicious! It came with potato latkes that were so good I almost threw up from forcing them down after I was full because they tasted so good (no, I don't practice moderation). My fiancé had \"Big Ben\" which had bacon, sausage, ham, eggs, toast and hash browns. The portion sizes were very generous and we both left full and I still had half of my sandwich left over!  The prices weren't low, but I'd say maybe a little higher if not on par with Cora's. They had a ton of variety, the staff was happy, cheerful and pleasant and the clientele was even great. A lot of young families. I can say without a doubt that we will be back, many many times in the future!!"}
{"text":"As a person who heat eating egg, having brunch outside is always a challenge for me. But I need to confess I like Ben & Florentine. The waffles was not bad and my husband had the Benedict Florentine and he was satisfy. this restaurant is a little bit pricey. But I had a good experience and will go this weekend again."}
{"text":"Ben & Florentine is a Quebec chain which has made it's first Ontario appearance in Oakville.  After hearing tons of good things about it, I decided it was time to check it out. It's a pretty unassuming restaurant in a cookie cutter plaza, but don't let that fool you - it's actually pretty huge inside! There is ample seating so even though it was packed, we got seated pretty quickly.   The menu is very extensive, so I know I'll be back to sample off other areas - there are Benedictines/Florentines (as you would expect!) as well as basic breakfast, \"scramblers\", crepes, and lunch options. Being a first timer, I decided I had to try a Benedict.   I got the smoked salmon Benedict, and my partner one of the scramblers. The Benedict was ok, but a little drowned in hollandaise and it had developed a bit of a skin, so I knew it was sitting waiting for a little while. While I wasn't blown away by my choice, I think part of it was poor ordering on my part - I definitely should have requested the sauce on the side, as I'm not a HUGE fan (rookie mistake!). The scrambler was really good, but a bit heavy on the onions. We also enjoyed some smoothies which were really delicious - the small size is perfect and not too overwhelming (i.e. not a smoothie meal in itself!).   So why the four star review? This place has so much potential as a great breakfast place! I'm excited to go back and try other things (and replace my hash browns with sweet potato puffs this time, YAY!).   I bet this place will become an Ontario staple in no time."}
{"text":"A pretty mediocre breakfast spot, but at least the service was nice.   It reminds me of the kind of place you'd go to for breakfast as a kid before a soccer tournament somewhere out in the suburbs. No real charm, no personality, and basic breakfast, which arguably, is sometimes what you want.   Don't come here expecting to be wowed. It is what it is, and so long as you realize that going in, you'll be alright."}
{"text":"We were driving around looking for a breakfast restaurant, when we came across this spot. We hadn't heard anything about it, but noticed it had good reviews on Yelp, so we figured we'd give it a try.  The restaurant is very big and bright. We visited on Easter Monday and I think they were surprised by the number of customers, so they were a bit understaffed. We stood and waited for a few minutes while someone cleaned a table for us.  We were impressed with the variety of dishes offered as the menu is quite extensive. We both ordered the same breakfast 'Big Ben', which was 2 eggs, bacon, ham and sausages. It came with toast (we declined), home fries and homemade applesauce.  We both enjoyed it and the portions were enormous. There's no way we could have eaten toast as well.  There are quite a few gluten-free items on offer which we will try on a future visit. They have 7 variations of eggs Benedict, crepes, french toast, pancakes, waffles, sandwiches, salads and a few skillet meals. And they have a children's menu and a dessert menu. They also offer a large array of beverages, including smoothies and specialty coffees.   We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"We had many awkward moments with the waiter. When the waiter came over to refill our coffee cups, he just stood there until we brought our cups closer to him. Another waiter looked confused when we asked for syrup and coffee. Food was mediocre, and not enough. My overall experience was weird, I felt like I was in a parallel universe."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Friendly staff. Affordable. Definitely an awesome choice if you want a happy belly. I recently read the reviews and I lot of them were complaints about the wait time. Honestly I didn't have that experience. Maybe for those who had a not so good experience it was simply bad timing and depending on the day too. Oh well, me I had a great time.  Well have to add that I go often there for breakfast/brunch during break at work. So far, never disappointed about the food. There are sure crowded around 12. But totally worth it."}
{"text":"As an American, the best I can equate Ben and Florentine to is like a cross between IHOP and Denny's. An affordable, decent quality chain breakfast/diner chain.   I had the Three Meats Skillet, which I thought was pretty good. Nothing outstanding, but it did the job at a good price. However, my wife had the Chicken Croissant, which I can confirm didn't really taste like much. It could have used at least a little bit of seasoning, or salt.  Overall, this is a decent option if cheap breakfast dining is what you're looking for."}
{"text":"Service pourri!  Aucune organisation, café médiocre!  Sauce hollandaise industrielle. Vous en voulez plus pour vous faire une idée?"}
{"text":"Although it is a chain breakfast restaurant, which I am not usually a fan of, I had a pleasant time here for brunch monday morning. It wasn't very busy so we were seated right away. A waitress quickly introduced herself and got us coffees. The menu is pretty standard for a breakfast place, with lots of options. I forget the exact name of the meal I ordered but it was 2 eggs, french toast, toast and potatoes. The meal was filling and was surprisingly very good. My friends all really seemed to enjoy their meals as well (One ordered similarly to me and the other two ordered some variation of avocado toast). The service was quick and friendly. Food: 4/5 Price: 3/5 Service 5/5"}
{"text":"Très bon endroit dans son genre! J'y suis allée quelques fois pour le brunch la fin de semaine. Il y a toujours de la place (allez sur la terrasse lorsque la température le permet!), l'endroit est confortable, relax, familial. Rien de \"fancy\", mais toujours satisfaisant. Le menu, en plus d'être beau visuellement, est super complet et varié. Il y en a vraiment pour tous les goûts, autant dans le salé que dans le sucré. Vous sortirez de l'endroit totalement repu! Les prix sont abordables, je dirais autour de 40$ pour 2 adultes, incluant 2 plats, des cafés/smoothies, taxes et tips. D'ailleurs, je vous conseille d'essayer leurs smoothies!"}
{"text":"I was there today with my wife for brunch, we sat down and placed our orders then I read some reviews here. Most of the review complaint about the wait time being slow. I can definitely confirm that! We waited at least half an hour before our food was served.  Food quality is a disaster (see pictures for example).  They served us dry out orange (1 slice) and an awfully done strawberry (not sure if it's a strawberry, but it does looks like one).  I ordered a smoked meat skillet; meat with potato and an on top... I tried to find the smoked meat... I really did but it all minced to tiny little pieces and the quality is also tiny. I'm not asking for 2 pounds of meat but at least good 4 or 5 pieces at a size that I can pick it up with a fork not a spoon! Charging $13+ for a plate like this is ridiculous!  Would not recommend!!"}
{"text":"My family and I have gone to eat breakfast a few times at this joint in particular. We use it more for family gatherings on  a Sunday morning. They have a good rep in making great omelettes. They change their menus every 3 months to match the season. Each time we come by we each try something new except for my dad who always gets the Big breakfast of pancakes, bacon, eggs and potatoes with toast. Some of us tried the avocado salmon special which was a treat and others got breakfast in hot plates like your bacon topped with eggs or a Philly steak. We noticed that they don't add a lot of fruits unless you get a meal which usually has them. We find the service great often times we found that they would be short in the waitering service. They came a few times to top up our coffees and gave us more jams when we asked for them. I recommend that you get their loyalty card which puts 2% before sales tax into the card which could help defray the cost of a future visit.  Compared to other breakfast places, Ben & Florentine doesn't  seem to get a lot of traffic. They have plenty of healthy choices! WiFi decent better than average.  $-$$"}
{"text":"Ben & Florentine serves a tasty, honest breakfast.  I'm a big fan of their \"Poêlées\", I find them to be a good size and very filling.   Ben & Florentine uses a lot of avocado and offers avocado toast for those who love them.  I find their breakfast potatoes are quite good.  Overall, it's a good breakfast option, always enjoyable, fair service, it's hard to find anything critical to say."}
{"text":"I came here to eat brunch on a busy Sunday. The food was good and is very... expected of what one would get for breakfast at a diner.   You should know that there is two different wait times: 1 wait to be seated and 2 for your food to come to you. Don't expect your food to come out very fast once you've been seated. It will take 30-35 to get food to your table but it will be HOT.   The highlights from the meals were the home fries and the fresh cut fruit. Our server, Lisa M was very polite, well mannered, and very genuine with her interactions with us.  I would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"My eggs were nicely poached. Breaking the yolk was a pure pleasure to watch the yellow goodness slowly spill over. The flavors were ordinary. Looks like what it tastes. The waitress was a bit slow due to this place being super busy during lunch time but regardless, she was very friendly and attentive. My smoothie was fresh, thick, and balanced.  If you're living around the area of Saint-Laurent, you should give this place a try."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Would go there more if it wasnt so far. Cant wait for them to come to mississauga.  Love the bene and skillets. Great menu excellent food service needs improvement  too slow and under  staffed"}
{"text":"Dirty and unorganized.  This restaurant has gone downhill since I last visited a couple of years ago. I walked in  with my sister and we were not acknowledged for at least 5 minutes. There was no one else waiting and it was not absurdly busy.  Finally we were seated where we continued to wait for at least 10 minutes before we were approached by a waiter.  He brought us coffee and water, of which my sister's coffee cup looked like it hadn't been cleaned. When we mentioned it to the waiter, instead of bringing a new mug, he simply said that he had spilled some coffee on the mug before bringing it to us. Mmhmmm :/  Our table was missing cutlery, so we asked a waitress for spoons- she literally went to the table right next to ours and grabbed a spoon out of a pile of cutlery that I wasn't sure was clean or the leftovers from a dirty table... I have no complaints about the food itself except that we waited 45 minutes for it. Not ideal for a breakfast restaurant.   The bathrooms were abysmal. Only 1 of 3 stalls was useable, one had no tp left and the other was just a total mess. The bathrooms were just disgusting.  The overall cleanliness of the restaurant was not good, the floors looked like they hadn't been swept or mopped in a week.   Overall we were both unimpressed and will not be returning."}
{"text":"Ben&Florentine next to Panama never disappoints me. Not the finest cuisine but great portions and good quality of food for the price you pay. They change their menus quite often to add new dishes and I discover new surprises when I go there brunching. Personally I love their fruity waffle a lot, yet their salty dishes are also quite amazing! Really like this place and would recommend it to all!"}
{"text":"Nothing too bad about the restaurant. Might seem little from the outside but has plenty of space. However, a part of the tables are too close to the kitchen and may disturb some costumers. The food remains good and the waitresses are there when you need them!"}
{"text":"Breakfast/Brunch!  This place is located in a very nice area close to the lake in Oakville. The restaurant is clean and gets very busy so there might be a wait.  The food here is amazing. We have gone with friends each time and everyone really enjoys the atmosphere and the food. There is proper seating and the place looks more upscale-ish than other brunch places. The service is great and friendly as well."}
{"text":"This is a great location for breakfast on the way back to the states from Montreal. On the way and you get out of traffic and difficult parking. We had breakfast, the menu was extensive. I will be back as I wanted to try more than one thing. Great service, albeit mostly in French, with endless fast coffee refills (included with most breakfast meals). My wrapped was accompanied by a huge mound of fresh fruit and a bowl of yogurt.  If you want something heartier then have a huge choice of skillets, eggs, etc."}
{"text":"Dimanche 7 avril 2013 Ben et Florentine ne semble pas être en mesure de préparer correctement certains éléments de son menu. Les pancakes ne sont pas du tout ce qu'ils devraient être.  Je suis un habitué mais je crois qu'il faille rester avec les plats plus conventionnels. Des pancakes qui ont l'air de crêpes, c'est passer à côté complètement de la recette. Aucun goût nettement distinctif, même pour des pancakes aux bleuets ! Surprenant.   Le service est toujours courtoi en ce qui a trait aux serveuses. C'était la charmante Sabrina qui s'occupait de ma table. Toutefois l'acceuil des serveurs masculins est toujours aussi mauvais. Les serveuses sont les seules à avoir le sourir.  On y retourne ? Oui, UNIQUEMENT pour les plats conventionnels comme les oeufs bénédictine, les déjeuners complets (oeufs saucisses, bacon, etc...), et les smoothies délicieux. Le reste, c'est à oublier.  Sunday april 7th 2013 Ben and Florentine doesn't seem to be able to prepare correct pancakes. It's part of their menu but they can't make them to a satisfying level.  As a regular, I was shocked to find that pancakes look exactly like crepes. They are missing the shot completely. They even don't have any distinctive taste, even for all blueberries pancakes ! It's a deception all the way !  The service is always great and curtious ONLY FROM THE FEMALE STAFF. The male server are as stressed out and no-smile at all, as always. My table was served by the extremely charming Sabrina. The female staff is always smiling and happy to take your order.  Do you come back to that place ? Yes AND ONLY FOR the conventional items on the menu, being eggs benedict, regular continental breakfast (eggs, sausages, bacon, etc..) and smoothies. The rest is to forget about."}
{"text":"Went there with My Mom when she was visiting as we both Love Breakfast Food. Great Place, Great Service, Friendly Staff, Great Food too.  The only reason I gave it 4 Stars is because I am sucker for Eggs Benedict and with all the Ratings this place had and it said it had the Best \"Eggs Benedict\", I ordered it and it wasn't anything to rave about, I wasn't \"Wowed\" by the Sauce at all, but I know my  Standards are a Bit on the High Side. Although my Mom ordered one of their Skillets and it was \"Amazing\" Will go there again!!!"}
{"text":"We found the restaurant off Yelp and it had a buy one get 50% off second meal coupon which they are honouring. But we just found out they do birthday meal free within 2 weeks of the birth date. Service was awesome. Coffees and waters were always filled before they got empty. Prices are awesome. Mostly everything is between $10-15. Really reasonably priced and decent sized portions. Server was awesome too. Really happy came in. Potato pancakes are amazing and the skillet is great too. Really delicious. Please open a restaurant in Hamilton, stoney creek, or Ancaster!!!"}
{"text":"- Always received great service despite busyness level (visit count: ~8) - Never been disappointed by a menu item (esp. chicken salad sandwich & fusion scrambler) - A bit pricier than other places but the food quality more than justifies - Awesome apple sauce side"}
{"text":"I'm very happy to revise this review and am sorry that I hadn't done it sooner. This location has indeed found their groove:  - Portions & proportions are both in check - Fresh fruits are the standard - Service is A1  I'm thrilled to have a B&F closer to home (though Kirkland wasn't really a big schlep).  Bonus: West Island residents usually get a set of coupons for B&F in the mail on a monthly basis. It's in those cheque-sized booklets. Though the coupon is only valid M-F, more price-sensitive buyers can indulge in a smoothie or fancy coffee mid-week."}
{"text":"Just another breakfast place, similar price to any other breakfast place.   They do have more Avocado-related menu here so if people are interested in eating avocado breakfast food, here's where it's at"}
{"text":"Une chaine de restaurant qui sait se tirer du lot. On sort de ce brunch en roulant tellement les assiettes sont copieusement remplies."}
{"text":"Des Ben & Florentine, il y en a plusieurs à Montréal, et même au travers de la province. Pourtant, je n'y avais pas été avant ce mois-ci parce que j'avais l'impression que c'était une copie de Cora. Et en réalité, c'est à peu près ça. Les prix sont similaires et les options de repas aussi. Je trouve ça un peu cher, surtout parce qu'il y a tellement d'autres petits restaurants de quartier à proximité qui servent des repas de base pour un petit prix. Le service était bien et on n'a pas vraiment eu besoin de demander quoi que ça soit parce que la serveuse a bien fait son travail. À essayer si vous ne savez pas trop où aller, mais je ne ferais pas un détour pour y aller."}
{"text":"ATMOSPHERE: Looks like a typical brunch spot. Not much decor and it's located in a little strip on the corner of St-Charles. Doesn't really stand out in terms of atmosphere.  FOOD: I personally LOVE their potatoes. They're pretty flavorful. I do find that their eggs benedict are a little bit lacking in flavor but it's not bad at all. Their avocado on toast is also quite good (still lacking in a bit of flavor). But to be fair, I love my savoury foods and spices so maybe it's just me.The good thing is that the breakfast usually comes with a cup of coffee or tea. Their portions are also pretty big if you compare it to other brunch spots.  PRICE: Standard prices for brunch.  SERVICE: Their service is always pretty decent."}
{"text":"Oui! Superb brie et portobello benedict. Scrumptious crepes avec pomme, almonds, white cheddar. C'est bon!"}
{"text":"It's not the Ritz but it's a nice place to have a casual breakfast - cuz breakfast are supposed to be casual. The food is good for the price. They actually make pretty good pancakes, and the waitresses are hot!"}
{"text":"Average sized portions. Quality of food and service was good; however, the one time I went (Wednesday at 10am) it seemed a bit understaffed. I had to wait quite a bit to have my order taken and food/bill brought. I look forward to try it again!"}
{"text":"I have to say this is a good place for eggs Benedict.  They have good options and the price is fair.  I had the Lox, which is the eggs Benedict with smoked salmon.  There was one group ahead of me, but the wait was still long for a seat.  This is a busy place so you'll need to be patient."}
{"text":"Good breakfast place in my neighbourhood. My boyfriend and I went about noon on Sunday and it was busy but no line ups and got seated quickly. He got the normal breakfast with pancakes and I got the same but with French toast. It wasn't amazing but it was good. The customer service was fast and attentive. The atmosphere was casual and easy going. Overall it's a nice place to go for breakfast anytime!"}
{"text":"The 4-star rating is credit to the extravagant menu, and those in the kitchen that made it possible. Seating service is frantic, and inefficient. Tables remain uncleared and visible to other guests - not a pleasant dining experience. Was a shame that our server barely interacted with our table, doesn't take much effort to check in."}
{"text":"Not the best experience...  I'll start off w/ the good: the service was pretty good. Not spectacular, but very solid w/ no negatives.  Now onto the bad: The food is not good. In the future, I'll get a coffee and/or a juice and some toast w/ creton (which was fine). DO NOT ORDER THEIR \"CLUB SUPREME\" OR THEIR \"BREAKFAST SAUSAGE\". The philly steak in the former is dry and cardboard-like (Update: I've been told by the resto's HQ that this item is leaving the menu soon). The latter was greasy and I did not like it's seasoning.  Update #2: The resto's HQ graciously reached out to me since this review. This is consistent w the good service experience I had. They explained the changes they'll be making to the menu soon and have convinced me to give one of their many locations another try sometime. I do appreciate this concern for customer satisfaction (I have never had this kind of response before!). Hopefully my next experience will be much improved and I can update this overall review more favourably ;-)"}
{"text":"Love the chocolate chip pancakes!! I usually order the organic maple syrup with it. Although pricey ($2.50 extra) it's worth it. The pancakes are simple but very well made. Their skillets are filling and a healthy option but the last time I went we tried a new item on their menu, the avocado toast. I was pleasantly surprised how good it tasted. The avocado was fresh, and the goat cheese was incredibly creamy. The service is friendly and even though they're extremely busy, I found that thr quality of the food doesn't change. They've been consistent over the 4 or 5 times I've been to this location. One of my favourite breakfast/brunch spots."}
{"text":"Brunch at B&F was good. I had been eating nonstop for 3 days straight and honestly vacation was catching up with me lol so I got the Yogurt Fruit bowl with a side croissant for my breakfast. It was just the right amount of yogurt, fruit, granola and sweetness. No complaints!"}
{"text":"My friend and I wanted to go for brunch and this was where Yelp took us. I was worried there would be a long wait since we arrived during the peak brunch hour. However, we were seated as soon as we got in. There were still available tables at 10:30 am.  I was very disappointed with the slow service at Ben & Florentine. Our server didn't come to our table for at least 5 minutes. The wait was even longer when we wanted to pay. I waited probably 10 minutes for my turn to pay after my friend paid. If the service wasn't so slow I would've given this restaurant four stars.  The food here was good though! I ordered Lox eggs benedict and we decided to share the blueberry pancakes. We only ordered the pancakes because our server said they were small. When the pancakes came they were huge! They were the size of the take-out container. We were too full to even touch the pancakes. My friend took them all home for today's breakfast. I thought the 3 pancakes were overpriced as they were about $15.  What killed the overall experience at Ben & Florentine's was the service. The food was good and there are many options to choose from. Would I go here again? Only if I'm in the area. We only went here to meet halfway."}
{"text":"J'ai pris un bon dejeuner standard pain-oeuf-toast : bonnes saucisses, sirop d'erable en extra, bon thé, bon service, banquettes disponibles, donc tout ca vaut la peine."}
{"text":"My Husband and I are on a budget, so we are always looking for places to eat out that won't strap us for cash. We decided one morning to check out Ben and Florentine, and we were so happy we did. Their prices are amazingly low, and their breakfast is delicious. The service was so friendly and kind, we tipped the waitress more than 20% - she was wonderful. We have gone back twice now, and we will continue to go back."}
{"text":"Première fois que j'allais dans un Ben & Florentine, belle découverte. Le menu contient vraiment beaucoup de choix, de choix santé à choix \"cochon\".  Pour ma part, je suis toujours du genre à chercher une assiette qui aura au moins deux oeufs, toute les viandes (bacon, jambon, saucisse au minimum), des patates (idéalement à déjeuner ou custom), crêpe et pain doré. Hey bien, je n'ai pas été déçu!  Lorsque j'y suis retourner, nous avons essayé les casserolles. En gros une casserolle, c'est plusieurs ingrédient, dont souvent un oeuf, mélanger ensemble et servit dans une poel (d'où le nom j'imagine). Il en existe plus d'une 15enne différente à travers les pages et selon si vous voulez déjeuner ou diner. Il y en a même une style poutine.  Nous avons bien aimé nos casserolle respective, ma copine plus que moi, il faut dire que je suis le plus difficile des deux, mais elles remplient quand même beaucoup.   Les prix sont très raisonnable pour tout ce que nous avons avec le déjeuner et le service est correct."}
{"text":"One of the best brunch spots in the suburbs! I've visited a couple of times and every time I tell myself I'm going to branch out and get something different. But I'll never change my order! The eggs benny with smoked salmon is delicious! It doesn't look like a lot but once you get into it, it hits you!  The coffee is decent and they have free refills, but like most brunch places, it costs way too much.   The only other negative thing I have to comment about is the wait. Sometimes it can take a while.."}
{"text":"Never go there!  Food is old and fermented. Service is slow and horrible. You need to call waitress for many times before you get coffee. And they don't want to speak English - French only."}
