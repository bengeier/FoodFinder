{"text":"Their burger is SO good. Great bun, great bun patty ratio, cheese and sauce and toppings great and fresh. Their fries are the carnie style, soft, med/thin, and cooked well, very tasty. Their special was sloppy joes, will def have to go back! Very interested in the fried chicken sandwich too. Prices are decent (10.50 burg+2.50 fries), better than many others with this caliber of food, and probably more accurate for the neighborhood. Weird exterior, looks like an office lobby entrance, and limited seating inside (under 20 I'd guess), but friendly fast service and hipster modern inside. Portions are huge, definitely go hungry."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches in Toronto. I've eaten nearly everything on the menu and have not been disappointed once. The vibe is cool, the employees are awesome and the location is convenient. Check this place out if you haven't!"}
{"text":"I tried the crispy chicken sandwich which was really really good a must have, the bun was super fresh the chicken was crispy from the outside and so tender from the inside, the spicy coleslaw was amazing and adds to the sandwich, didn't like the pickles but it's just me, every single thing on the sandwich works really well together, also tried their burger and it's one of the best burgers I've ever had cooked perfectly so juicy you can taste how fresh they were made the cheese not the sour cheap kind of cheese as always the fresh sesame seed bun, vegetables were so fresh and their secret sauce it's just amazing, these guys know what they are doing, can't wait till they add more to the menu."}
{"text":"I tried the curried cauliflower roti tonight. There was a good combination of flavours, the cilantro paired well with the curry and yogurt, not spicy. The portion was massive and it's a bit messy to eat but that's what napkins (and I guess cutlery if you want) are for! They have stools now so eat-in options are available.  The service was quick and the owner was friendly,  I'll go back!"}
{"text":"Overall experience: 9/10 Food: 9.5/10 Atmosphere: 8/10 Service: 8/10  Tucked in the SW corner of Queen/Dufferin, this place is a MUST if you like sandwiches at all. It's a casual joint with mostly standing room and a few stools upstairs and by the front windows.   The sandwiches will run you approximately $15-$17 but are STUFFED with premium ingredients. Flavours pack a punch and will keep you salivating all through the work week.   My reco would be the triple bacon BLT....it'll convert non-pork lovers all over the city."}
{"text":"Overall - 3.5/5.0  I enjoy finding new sandwich joints and this one just opened not too long ago. I had the opportunity to give this place a try as it was nearby a venue I was DJing at and wanted to grab a quick bite prior to the gig. It was quite hidden as it was situated at an apartment complex.  The layout of the place was very odd. The kitchen was somewhere hidden upstairs, washroom (only one available) was downstairs in a dark hallway. The main floor was pretty empty with just some side bar tables (no seats) and a small area where you order your food. You would not have a clue that it was a sandwich joint when you walk right in given the cold and sterile setting.  Onto the food, I ordered the Philly cheesesteak and it came out fairly quick. The meat was tender and juicy, onions were nicely caramelized and married well with the provolone. To top it off, there was cheese whiz and jalape√±os for an extra kick. Everything came out nice and hot.   As for the bread, I would personally prefer something with a bit more chew to it but at least this one was not soft to the point where all the toppings fell out and end up creating a huge mess.  At a price of $15.99, I thought it was over priced for what it is. Worth a try if you're in the area though."}
{"text":"Ordered the hoagie sandwich today because it was so good a couple weeks ago!  Today's sandwich was on a stale bun!  As a sandwich shop the bun is pretty important. I can't believe you gave me two stale bun hoagies.   Consistency at this place is really poor.   I want to love this place but they make it really hard to do!"}
{"text":"Very overdue review. I've been coming here since March when my office moved to the neighbourhood. The sandwiches/burgers are always fresh and hot. Unique combinations of ingredients that all balance out to pure yumminess! The poutine is awesome. Cool retro bottles of Coke products. The staff are always lovely and personable. So is the owner and chef!   Today I'm trying the Thanksgiving inspired turkey sandwich: The Moist Maker. Looks yummy!"}
{"text":"I'm a huge sandwich fan and I was looking for a good sandwich shop when I came across Kitson. Right on the corner of Queen and Dufferin, it's a small place but perfect lunch spot.   Their menu isn't that large but has everything - chicken, beef, veggie - enough so you're not staring at the menu for hours trying to decide.   I had the the Pulled Jerk Chicken Sandwich and it was delicious. It has the perfect level of spice and just messy enough to enjoy it without getting annoyed.  Avea was friendly and helpful and the place itself was clean and inviting. I'll definitely be back to try the rest of the items - next up, their most popular, the Crispy Fried Chicken."}
{"text":"When you go to 3 different places within 2 hours and you have 3 fried chicken sandwiches back to back to back and this place had the best one... maybe you'll get it.    Even if I didn't have portions of 4 different sandwiches at 3 different places it wouldn't have really mattered.  Each place was a reset each time.  It's hard though when the first place you go to is Kitson & Co and they set the standard by which the other 2 were measured mentally, just saying.  On it's own merits, Kitson is dare I say it, a \"hidden gem\" but in plain sight so not so hidden just not as conspicuous.  On a very busy street and cross street with a street car and bus route passing by you'd think that being on a busy corner would be sort of good exposure.  Well the street coming down is Dufferin at a tunnel with a mini concrete parkette across the street near the UPX overpass (GO, whatever) at the corner of a condo is Kitson & Co built into this glass tower condo complex.    The layout of the interior upon my first impression was sort of awkward.  They only have bar seating along the perimeter of the outward facing window with an upstairs loft type area with the same type of seating facing Queen street but on an upper level sort of thing going on.  The stairs leading up go to the kitchen and the stairs leading down go to the rest room.  The main floor has the counter where you'd pay as well as a drinks fridge and places to get napkins etc.  Don't be alarmed if you enter and don't see anybody at the front on the main floor as somebody will be down shortly from the upper level.  There's a menu on the wall to the left as well as over the counter behind.  They don't have the Cuban sandwich anymore so don't contemplate it.  You won't get it as they don't have it but they do have some sort of non pressed alternative.  For me what caught my eye besides the fried chicken sandwich (that is what we came for) was the triple bacon BLT.  Bacon and bacon and bacon or what can be referred to as \"B-3\" is one winner of a sandwich.  If you don't like bacon I don't know you.  I don't know anybody that doesn't like it that has no such personal restrictions on the food.    While I'm rather partial to the stack of back bacon on a bun you can get at Carousel  the triple bacon BLT at Kitson is pure gold that looks and tastes like bacon but doesn't cost as much as gold would be.  At almost 15 bucks it's not a cheap sandwich but it's not cheaply put together either.  Multigrain bread with fresh L and T and add on the smoked back bacon, peameal and strip into that stack and what?  This sandwich is downright impressive.  The quality and care that goes into this what could be considered a simple meal is more complex than on paper.  Only a few times in my life have I truly and I mean truly been impressed by a sandwich and this is undeniably one of those times.  Bacon x 3 on a perfectly toasted creation, enough said.  On to the fried chicken sandwich... sigh fried chicken.  So good, so right and so special.  It's my favorite hot and savory go to and that's saying a lot considering how much I just gushed over the bacon.  Kitson's fried chicken sandwich is something special.  From well battered and cooked juicy pieces of steaming fried chicken, this sandwich topped with extras such as a purple cabbage slaw and fresh slices of jalapeno, there's a balance of hot (spice), crunchy (veggies), hot (heat) crunchy (chicken) and this stack is high to boot.  Look at the construction of this sandwich?  I mean it was cut in half upon request but OMG this is not just quantity here.  Kitson's friend chicken is a blend of those tastes and textures all into one  and it has fried chicken.  Imagine that if you can and if you could parse out what you think could be improved if anything what you're left with is near perfection.  I have not recently ever since perhaps Shadow Meats Squared in Pioneer Square in Seattle had 2 halves of 2 different sandwiches which just simply put me back in my seat and made me say, 'damn son' because I was impressed, very impressed.    Kitson & Co.'s sandwiches were so good that day I had to return on the weekend with my wife so she could try the bacon sandwich.  I ended up ordering something different in the Philly cheese steak.  Now I've had cheese steak at Pat's, Jimmy's and Tony Luke's in Philadelphia and I have to say that finally a good representation of what a Philly cheese steak should be is here.  Mind you I wasn't 100% sure if they actually used Cheez Whiz because it seemed less salty but the sandwich was steaming HOT.  I mean I'd recommend you want minimum 10 minutes before taking the first bite.  I may have burnt myself on the first bite because it was so hot.  Both provolone and whiz on this so it's cheesy and the kick was some added jalapenos on it.  Juicy, hot, melted cheese and besides the jalapenos which I liked nothing else on it that in my opinion official \"whiz wit\" should have on it.  Top notch place, period."}
{"text":"What a gem! After seeing their sandwiches on Instagram, u had to come try and they did not disappoint!  Ordered the fried chicken and jerk chicken sandwich. Both were delicious. The chicken was so moist! For the amount of food and flavour you get, this sandwich is definitely worth it. To top it all off, the owner and staff were amazing. Kitson and Ava are such nice people and serve great,  tasty, comfort food. Definitely coming back to try that burger!"}
{"text":"Ordered the fried chicken sandwich. $13 dollars. This sandwich is massive. Fresh bun, super crispy chicken. Tasty slaw and pickles. Service was quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Best burger and poutine since P&L closed up. Muffuletta is incredible so is the chicken sandwich. Can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Wow, amazing sandwiches! Terrific fries too. Friendly and fast. Great for lunch on the go or when time is tight. Or just for take out. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Check out this gourmet sandwich shop located on Queen W.  Cute environment, loved the seating upstairs so you can look down at all the action.   I came here to celebrate my followings on Instagram, and they did not disappoint. Ordered the Crispy Chicken Sandwich, Philly Cheesesteak and Poutine.   The  Crispy Fried Chicken with spicy coleslaw, Kitson & Co bread and butter pickles on a bun was fanfuckingtastic lol. The chicken is juicy and tender, while retaining a big crunch.   I was surprised that Philly Cheesesteak with saut√©ed onions, pickled jalape√±o's, whiz and provolone was my favourite. I'm not a fan of Cheez Whiz but this combo was great. The meat was flavourful and not fatty.   One of the better Poutine's in the City. All those Poutine shops don't compare. The fries are crispy, the cheese curds are extra squeaky and the gravy had so much flavour. The cheese curds were very melty by the time we got to the poutine which I loved.   Check them Out!"}
{"text":"No likes!!! Went after reading these high rated reviews... no doubt the receptionist/owner was really nice and sweet but clearly she didnt  take me seriously. I went on my lunch hour and there was no one else except me in the restaurant ordered burger and told her i wanted to dine in.. it took almost 30 mins to get my order and for 30 mins she vanished there was no one there. After 30 mins she comes and give me box.. and she leave pop on the counter and vanishes again.. i struggled and some how managed to get napkins ketchup etc but couldnt open the bottle since there was no opener and i have nevr had to open a bottle myself in an expensive restaurant. I was not given plate... 15 mins later she comes back and says oh i wanted to dine in... i was like its ok... i didnt have drink so can u replace this for coffee.. she vanishes again... 6 mins later she comes back and says sorry we dont have cups for coffee so i can give u money back for the drink. What a waste of my lunch hour!!!! I had the crispy chicken burger which was completely bland... did not like it at all. Do not recommend and will never go back."}
{"text":"Just piggybacking on Vanessa C.'s review--which I only read after the fact--what I wanted was a deliciously crispy fried chicken sandwich but what I got was almost two day's worth of miserable food poisoning. You'd think that after said review the cooks would make more of a concerted effort to comply with sanitation standards, but apparently that didn't happen.  To make matters worse, the sandwich itself was pretty bland with no clear flavor profiling. And you're paying double digits for it at that. If I had to give a compliment I'll say that the breading on the chicken was nice.   Bottom line, do yourself a favor and just go to P.G Clucks."}
{"text":"I'm not sure what took me so long to check out Kitson & Co Sandwiches, as their food, when I'd see pictures on social media, looked nothing short of amazing.  We arrived in the middle of the afternoon on a sweaty Saturday and the place was pretty much empty. A quick perusal of the menu led me to the Crispy Fried Chicken sandwich (\"with spicy coleslaw, Kitson & Co bread and butter pickles on a bun\"), which the woman behind the counter warned is \"ginormous.\"  It arrived a short time later and indeed, the thing was perhaps the biggest chicken sandwich I've ever been presented with. I really should've taken a picture because its grandeur was intimidating and downright jaw-dropping.  Difficulties eating it aside, this is a seriously tasty sandwich. The chicken had a nice fried crunch on the outside and yet the inside was still super moist and tender, while the spicy coleslaw and butter pickles proved an ideal complement as they didn't distract from the glorious flavor of the chicken. (The bread was super fresh and soft, too.)  I guess my only real complaint was the difficulty I had eating the sandwich. The piece of chicken was so thick that I kind of had to eat around it and by the time I got to the middle, the thing had basically completely fallen apart.  Still, I would rank this chicken sandwich as one of the very best of its type in our fair city and I'm excited to try Kitson's other, equally-delicious looking wares."}
{"text":"Dropped in today after walking past this place way too many times, had a pork Bahn-mi.   It was excellent, just enough fat and crispy, crunchy, crackling.   On the side, I had a super fresh caesar salad with crisp bacon bits and a not too much dressing.   this sandwich shop is a welcome addition to the neighborhood.  Welcome to Parkdale Kitson and Co! Hope you're here a while!"}
{"text":"This all started on one sunny day when my coworker and I had a craving for a burger and split a spicy chicken sandwich and a pork belly banh mi. Little did I know that that was the last peaceful lunch I'll ever have before my world (and body) fell apart.   Fast forward to 36 hours later on an early Sunday morning, my insides had a nuclear meltdown. I felt light headed after a night suffering through uncontrollable cold sweats. Then the cramps came which slowly increased in intensity much like the burning feeling of holding a plank indefinitely. Suddenly, a force to what felt like a punch to my stomach from the inside got me dashing straight to the toilet teary eyed. There I was, sitting there with arms wrapped around myself in pain and terror did my body try to purge the violence that was happening inside. The next 2 hours were indescribable but I was almost convinced that I was losing the fight against what I now called the devil's sandwiches and my insides were being utterly destroyed. I apologized to God for every sin I've ever committed, praying it was enough to make this all go away. It didn't. I almost blacked out. My heart rate and blood pressure hit record levels throughout the ordeal. To spare you any more graphic details, I'll sum it up to this: I dropped 3 lbs in 2 hours. Severely weakened, I carried on with the day slightly confused feeling a dull backache that lingered throughout. Fearing another meltdown, I avoided solid food as much as possible. That night, all hell broke loose again and I began to have a fever. As if that wasn't enough, I began to have an intense muscle ache radiating throughout my back putting me in a perpetual fetal position. Throughout the night, I was profusely sweating yet shivering mentally crying out for my mommy - perhaps her spidey senses would activate. Attempts at contorting my body into various positions to relieve my back pain failed. I did not sleep. By Monday, I was restless as I shakily texted my coworkers telling them I won't be in. If they didn't hear from me by Tuesday, send help. I drifted in and out of consciousness that day, lying in a bed of ice packs for brief bouts of relief. Fortunately, I survived the wrath of the devil's sandwiches by Tuesday. But know this, a shitty, dirty, sandwich reduced a full grown adult into a shadow of a person. You. Have. Been. Warned.  As a side note, my coworker also experienced a similar ordeal since we split the same sandwiches so I'm 99.9% sure it was this place."}
{"text":"Best sandwiches in the city - the triple bacon BLT, amazing. Very good burger as well - get pickles and bacon as an add-on."}
{"text":"Wow, well needed in the queen dufferin corner. A decent list of popular sandwiches including friend chicken, philly cheese steak and BLT.  A bit pricy has me bringing down the rating by a star but fantastic sandwiches."}
{"text":"What could I say that everybody else hasn't...   These sandwiches are fucking delicious.   And hey Philly Cheesesteak, wanna hang out again?"}
{"text":"I had lunch today at Kitson & Co.  It's in my 'hood and I've passed by it lots of times and thought I'd check it out today.  I was torn between the Crispy Fried Chicken Sandwich, Pulled Jerk Chicken Sandwich and the Classic Double Cheeseburger.    I ordered the Crispy Fried Chicken sandwich (crispy fried chicken with spicy coleslaw, Kitson & Co. bread and butter pickles on a bun) minus the coleslaw (I'm not a fan of 'slaw).  It was a big sandwich ... imagine how much bigger it would have been with the coleslaw?!  It was a good sandwich!  The batter on the chicken was definitely crispy and tasty.  The chicken was juicy thigh meat and was cooked to order.  There was spicy aioli on it and it had a nice bite.  I'd get this sandwich again.  Martha was friendly and pleasant to chat with."}
{"text":"Great chicken burger!!I thought \"expensive burger!\" when I ordered but NONO!! The burger is HUGE !! You should share for sure."}
{"text":"Was in the area and wanted something for a late lunch. I order the pulled jerk chicken sandwich and the fried chicken sandwich with a side of poutine.  Be prepare to wait 10 mins for your meal since they fried the chicken fresh for you.   The jerk chicken sandwich has a great kick to it. I enjoy it and it wasn't soggy at all. The fried chicken sandwich was meh. All I could taste was the oil dripping; every bite oil.  Poutine was really salty. So I wouldn't recommend it.  Overall, I paid about $45 for 2 sandwich and 2 poutine with a pop. It was a okay place for okay sandwich."}
{"text":"You know the saying 'go big or go home'?  Well, Kitson has their version and it's 'go big and still take enough home'.  Holy... mother... these sandwiches are HUGE.  You will need to come hungry or just ask a box upfront cause you will bring half the sandwich home.  Kitson sits right on the corner of Dufferin and Queen and it's easy to think it's just a condo lobby... uh no.  You'll find two stellar examples of locally owned great food and drinks (Plentea being right beside Kitson).  Though it has some bright bold artwork behind the counter, the restaurant is really minimalist and modern.  There are a few window bar seatings and I would say that perhaps its more quick counter set up than an actual restaurant.  That being said, it's a good spot to grab your sandwich and people watch at the corner.  The menu does a rotation so you will find new options though it sounds like their crispy friend chicken is ALWAYS on the menu. It is also their big seller from the sounds of it.  I will say that at first glance, yes these are kinda pricey for a sandwich BUT BUT... hold on.  You have to imagine that to the normal person, these are 2 times the sizes of most sandwiches and they're made fresh to order.  Can other places say that as they show their refrigerated sandwiches in saran wrap?   Just an FYI... because they make their sandwiches from scratch, it does take some time.  I think the chicken sandwich came out piping hot nearly 10 minutes later.  It looks like you can call ahead of time to order so if you're in a rush, that would be the way to go.  Crispy Fried Chicken - First reactions to this was \"OH .... DAMN\".  I swear I've seen chickens smaller than this sandwich.  Generous in portion sitting on a mammoth bun and overflowing with purple cabbage with a zesty sauce, this was big on flavour as it was on size.  I will say that most people will need to an industrial sized machine to squeeze this a reasonable size to fit into your mouth.  The bread was soft and didnt add too much other than be a spongey vehicle to the super crispy chicken.  The chicken is the star as it was hot, crunchy, not over cooked and was well seasoned.  4.5/5   Vegetarian Banh Mi - The banh mi almost seemed tame in comparison but it can hold it's own.  With 3 large slabs of battered firm tofu, it had some picked carrot and some slices of cucumbers with a lightly spiced  sauce.  The bread was a bit puzzling as the banh mi bread needs that characteristic baguette crunch ... this was more like a large hot dog bun.  Aside from not quite getting the bread right, I did like the sauce paired with the tofu.  The tofu was nice and crispy... I would have loved to see more vegetables on it but still a solid vegetarian option.  4/5  Overall, great spot to grab a great sandwich at a reasonable price.  Love the fact its right by my favourite drink spot out in Toronto west side too. The owner here was just great in serving us and really shows a passion for what he does.  I would recommend anyone to give it a shot if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Really didn't like the food, over priced, cheap ingredients. Didn't like how the philly cheese steak had bad steak and really fake cheese."}
{"text":"Showed up at 6pm on a Tuesday to try this place out being new to the city and it was dark with no one inside. What gives?"}
{"text":"Kitson & Co. Sandwiches breathes new life into the corner of Dufferin & Queen which was once a sketchy, neglected part of the Parkdale neighbourhood. The menu here is decidedly a mixture of satisfying sammies with a few options for sides. Nothing too fancy or complicated, just a selection which includes an amazing Fried Chicken sandwich ($13) as well as a vegetarian roti option.  Occupying the ground floor of a new condo development, the space is open with an industrial feel that is particularly welcoming and bright. A staircase leads to the kitchen and food prep area upstairs, where orders are made and then brought out while you wait. Bar stool seating is the only option, but you can sit in comfort and enjoy your meal while people watching through a facade which is made entirely of glass.  You'll have to shell out a few more bucks than you'd pay at your usual sandwich spot to sample what they've got in store, but believe me, it's worth it. Philly Cheesesteak sounds intriguing, and the staff are polite and helpful, which is always a bonus. Perhaps not an everyday place to grab your grub, but if you wanna switch things up for change, I highly recommend checking out this joint."}
{"text":"If you're going to Kitson, go hungry. Or prepared to store part of your order away for later. Their portions are huge, but delicious.   I had their curried cauliflower, chickpea and sweet potato roti wrap with yogurt dressing and arugula for lunch one day last week. I was only able to finish half in one sitting but was more than happy to have the other half to look forward to later that night. It offered a great combination of flavours and the roti wrap was the perfect amount of chewy. It was messy though, so make sure you get lots of napkins.   While I waited for my order to come up I chatted with the owner a bit, and it seems the place is very new. They are still waiting on stools for the hightop table area at the window, and just locked down a local artist to paint a mural inside. But they seem excited and passionate about their business so I look forward to visiting again and seeing the space evolve."}
{"text":"If you're planning a trip to Kitson & Co Sandwiches, make sure you go hungry! Their portions are huge and delicious!   We ordered the fried chicken sandwich. ($13) The buns were fresh and the chicken was super crispy and juicy  We also got a side of fries, which were SO good!  The staff was also very friendly and the food prep was quick! They messed up our friend's order and gave him another sandwich on the house even when he said it was alright! We'll definitely be going back!"}
{"text":"I love, love, love how this little block of Parkdale has new businesses under a condo and none of them are chains. Every single business is adding to the nabe in wonderful ways, and Kitson's & Co is no exception.   They're new, so they're still working out the kinks (and waiting on stools), but if you're looking for a lunch to go around Queen & Duff, run to these sweet sammies! I tried the fried chicken, and it was huge and messy, but oh so delicious with crunchy slaw, pickles and hot peppers for some kick."}
{"text":"Very rude staff (maybe it was the owner) and terrible service. Was very unwelcoming and seemed like he didn't even want us to be there!"}
