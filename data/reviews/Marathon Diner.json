{"text":"Incredible incredible vegetarian omelette, worth every penny. There's not a lot of things better than breakfast all day, but the amount of food and the quality of the omelette. If I ever come back to the Pittsburgh airport, I'm going straight back!"}
{"text":"This diner is a great place to go in the Pitt airport if you've got time to spare. The food is always delicious and it never fails to satisfy me. The two egg breakfast is my favorite thing to get and I'd highly recommend it because you get a lot of food for not too high of a price. Definitely would recommend!"}
{"text":"Tried Marathon diner today & it did not disappoint. It has a wide selection menu for such a little place. Excellent marathon gyro & if they have the lemon chicken soup while reading this review, you gotta try it! Service is fast & the employees are friendly. Only down side is this is not a \"diner\" but more of a fast food counter.... although, if in a rush, that could be a plus! I'll be eating here again."}
{"text":"If you're at the Pittsburgh airport don't pass this place by! Not your average airport food. Had the big fat greek omlete, didn't think tzatziki would be good on an omlete but it was fantastic!"}
{"text":"Gyro and loaded fries: absolute satisfying. Lots of meat, packed with veggies and the fries are looked and tasted just like diner garbage fries ought to:crispy and greasy, cheese wiz, and bits of real bacon. It's probably going to wow your taste buds like a 4 star sit down resto nut boy did it hit the spot. It's a little slower service compared to other fast food."}
{"text":"My \"breakfast sandwich\" was a pathetic excuse for a sandwich. It was the smallest piece of bread I have ever seen! I paid 10 dollars for a sandwich that I could fit into my whole mouth in one bite. The home fries are one of the worst things I've ever tasted,too. I confronted the manager about my sandwich, or lack there of, and he could not do anything to accommodate me. I'm still hungry, pissed off, and just lost 10 dollars. Do not eat here if you are hungry or want a quality meal!!"}
{"text":"On my layover and decided on Marathon Diner! I didn't have time for sit down so chose this over Chick-Fil-A and pizza. The vegetarian gyro was yummy and a healthy option compared to the others. I opted for slaw over the fries but regretted it because I didn't love the slaw. It is a vinegar base but just seemed flavorless.   They serve breakfast all day! This is fantastic!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here earlier today with my wife for dinner.  We had both been past marathon diner before and never thought much of it.  As a matter of a fact I was avoiding it, not for any particular reason.  So why did I come here you ask?  Well we had a Yelp elite event at the airport and their food was actually quite good and so I decided to stop on my next personal trip.  Since it's located in the airport there isn't too much to say about it other than it's a counter in the center core.  They serve breakfast all day long and I believe their name is Marathon in order to reference their Greek roots.  For dinner on this day my wife and I both decided to get gyros with fries.  After about a five minute wait our food was ready.  The first thing that I tasted were our fries which were quite good.  They were piping hot and crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Next up was the gyro which seemed wet and quite messy.  As a matter of a fact I didn't even try to pick it up with my hands and ate it with a fork from the start.  The gyro meat inside of it was good and there was a good amount of it.  It had vegetables of lettuce, tomato and onion which gave it color and made it feel healthier.  Last but certainly not least was the tzatziki sauce which tasted good but seemed rather watery.  It was bad enough that I debated about whether or not to eat the pita.  Since I was hungry, I did but a soggy pita isn't that great.  The bottom line for me is that I would stop by here again in the future.  Minus the soggy pita, I enjoyed everything that I had here and my wife did as well."}
{"text":"Love this place!!  Best breakfast in the Pittsburgh airport! Eggs over easy all day long!"}
{"text":"Very good breakfast, veggie omelette for the price. Not at all priced like airport food. Good quantity and quality"}
{"text":"Marathon Diner may not look fancy, but I had the best airport meal of my life here!  Skip the long line at McDonald's and head to Marathon for authentic, fresh, made-to-order Greek diner food.  The veggie gyro ($10) was filled with peppers, onions, mushrooms, spinach, tomatoes, lettuce, and feta cheese.  So good, and I almost feel like it was healthy?!  The guy working at the griddle (possibly the owner?) was really nice about asking whether I wanted banana peppers, cheese, etc., so I'm sure they would accommodate special requests.  I love that Marathon offers a tasty and satisfying vegetarian option, because the cheese pizza slices at Villa just looked sad!   Obviously I was just here for dinner, but Marathon Diner serves breakfast too!  Definitely stop here if you are hungry in the Pittsburgh airport. You can really tell that they put a lot of love into the food!"}
{"text":"I love the food here! It's an option at the airport that I am wish more airports would consider. Their egg sandwiches are terrific and the service is always delivered with a smile. I stop by every time I'm passing through, without fail - and will continue to do so!"}
{"text":"This is a prime airport location with the opportunity to be the place to go. I came here because the lines at the other breakfast places (Chick Fil A and McDs) were really long and I wanted to try something new. Now I know why the lines at the other places were long. I experienced unfriendly service and the breakfast sandwich was quite disappointing."}
{"text":"Was recommended the gyro omelette. Fantastic, good amount of food, good service, good value."}
{"text":"The one at the airport is just ... bad the servers were bored and had the attitude that I was bothering them by ordering ... and the food was very average"}
{"text":"This experience was a joy. The food was great. Service was great. I started out at the currito burrito. Without borders. They were rude. Went to marathon and they offered a frequent buyer card.   Such a great experience. I'll be back here."}
{"text":"I went here as part of a food tasting event. I got to try the lamb gyro, as well as the Greek lemon chicken soup.  The gyro was absolutely delicious. The pita was warmed and the lamb was fresh, flavorful, and not greasy at all.  The gyro had the perfect amount of toppings (lettuce, tomato, onion) and the tzatziki sauce was delicious - it was definitely homemade, creamy and tangy, with lots of dill for flavor.  The gyro was proportioned very well, where you could get a little bit of everything in each bite!  The lemon chicken soup was something I've never had before so it was a kick to the face in flavor that I wasn't expecting. It is very tangy, just shy of sour, with perfectly cooked orzo, small bits of chicken, and a flavorful chicken broth that was a bit thicker than your standard chicken soup. It was served with oyster crackers which I didn't use because the soup was delicious on its own and didn't need them. I will definitely look for lemon chicken soup on the menu the next time I visit a Greek establishment!  The items I got to try were cooked to order, flavorful, and comforting.  I was very impressed with the quality of each and every ingredient and the elevated taste of a standard gyro, without the guilt. Marathon Diner is definitely a solid choice for those wanting some quick comfort food at an affordable price. I will absolutely be back for another gyro the next time I am Pittsburgh International Airport - check it out!"}
{"text":"What a ripoff. For a $13 salad all you get is iceberg lettuce, a few measly shards of onion, cucumber and tomato, and some old tasting meat. So many better food court options."}
{"text":"This was a great find in the Pittsburgh Airport. And early in the morning open with a great set of breakfast offerings and coffee( including decaf). Greek coffee too as one of their specialties. If you are in this airport, take advantage of the friendliness, tasty and fast food and unique offerings. Don't just go anywhere, go the Marathon, it's not as far away as you think. ;)"}
{"text":"During the recent Yelp scavenger hunt event my husband and I got to this place as one of the last venues. We were pretty full from eating elsewhere but told them if they would bag our sample we would eat it at home. They were more than happy to do this for us.  I asked them as far as other locations were concerned. This is the only one in the city and it is Greek themed. When we finally were able to have our \"doggie bag\" I was pleased that they gave us a small gyro which is one of their specialties, along with lemon chicken soup, and oyster crackers. Believe me it did not disappoint. It was just enough for a light meal later.  They have a rewards program that if you buy 7 sandwiches or salads then you get the 8th one free. When i got home I had a chance to review the menu in detail. the serve a vegetarian gyro, specialty burgers and specialty sandwiches along with sides. Everything is ala carte however, you can get a side of fries and coleslaw at a reduced price if you order a sandwich.  Breakfast items are available as well which does includes omelettes, breakfast sandwiches, pancakes, French toast, and two eggs your way. Expect to pay a little more since you are at the airport but they are on par with some of neighborhood diners I have visited.   Since it is part of the fast casual approach don't expect table service however, there is a food court eating area behind the row of fast food eateries on the left side of the center core.  They do offer egg white substitutes if you have health issues. The only thing I found lacking on their menu was desserts. All they offer is rice pudding. Don't expect to see those gigantic pies and cakes you would normally find.  Still they have a good variety of Greek fare selections which is a novel approach to casual dining whether you plan to eat there or take it with you in flight.  Now that non passengers can visit the airside terminal during weekdays only this place is a must return for me next time I find myself out that way."}
{"text":"My son and I stopped for a leisurely meal before getting on our flight. Looked like a cute diner theme; too bad everything tasted like old grease. Perhaps they should clean their grill more than once a week."}
{"text":"It's rare for me to review an airport restaurant experience.  However this one deserves it!  So nice to received a happy welcome and omelets made to order!  Yes it's how it should be when it's comes to customer service and so rare to find.  Thank you for helping v to start my day right!"}
