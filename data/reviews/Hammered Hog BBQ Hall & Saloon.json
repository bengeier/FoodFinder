{"text":"The \"Best\" BBQ rib sandwich on the planet. Great portion, flavor , and price. I've never been to a place where everything on the menu taste great until I came here.. Friendly Staff , Cold Beer, Great Food !! Try it .."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful! The bacon wrapped  Jalapeno stuffed peppers were awesome but eclipsed by the BBQ! The ribs and hot links were the best that I've had here in Phoenix! And with all of my travels, I'm not sure that I've had better anywhere. Tonight was our first time but guaranteed it won't be the last!!! Oh, the owner waited on us and she was wonderful as well."}
{"text":"wow!!!! what a great hidden spot. great food service was great and quick! 

food was amazing !"}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to eat, great service, very friendly staff, fun atmosphere and very good food. I am always full and happy when leaving.

I have had several large parties here and they have handled them all well, the guests have always left very pleased and often want to meet there again. 

Keep up the great work...and food!"}
{"text":"Was looking forward to trying a new private bbq spot but food was poor service so so.  Will not return."}
{"text":"I've been here for three visits, two dinners and one lunch.  I've been waiting to write a review, because I wanted to be fair.  The service has always been pretty good here.  I eat in the dining room, not the bar, and I'm greeted and seated promptly.  The menu covers the basics for good BBQ; ribs, pulled pork, hot links, brisket, bbq chicken.  Sides are good, and portions are generous.  The ribs are awful.  I mean, just wretched.  Two stars bad, for a joint that could be doing better.  The ribs were smoked, and clearly had some dry rub on them at some point.  I like my ribs Memphis style, smoke and dry rub no sauce, so this should be right up my alley, right?  That's where things go awry.  The ribs are clearly reheated, which is perfectly normal.  What's not normal is the texture.  These ribs are squishy.  There is no discernible difference in texture between the lean and the fat.  These ribs are reheated by some moist heat process, which both rinses all the dry rub off and removes any of the char/caramelization from the grill.  I saw grill marks on the ribs, so I'm not debating that the grill came into play at some point, but it was used way too little.  I am begging that they change the method used to reheat the ribs.  Ribs are the yardstick by which I measure good BBQ, and these aren't it.  So much good stuff, but just terrible ribs."}
{"text":"Great food and service! Would highly recommend. Had the pulled pork sandwich. Tried friends brisket, ribs and all were tender and tasty."}
{"text":"Took the family (husband, 3 yr old son & 1 yr old daughter) for an \"early\" Saturday nite dinner out for \"family nite\". Called at 5pm to see if they take reservations - \"no, no hostess tonite\". 
Got there at 5:45 to get a little head start. We were 4th in line (no hostess, no wait list) and waited our turn that took about 1/2 hr. 
We were seated to then wait another 1/2 hr with absolutely no acknowledgement of our presence. It was a bit frustrating to see the table seated after us drinking their sodas and eating their appetizers. Have I already mentioned I was there with 2 small children? 
I waved down one of the 3 waiters to let him know we still hadn't been brought water nor had our beverage order (let alone our food order) been taken. He told me he would \"take our table\" and be right back. 5 min later after checking on other tables and not returning to ours, we packed up the kids and left. 
Many guests still waiting for a table asked us if we ever got waited on...nope. They followed suit and left right behind us. 
 Never got to try the food - just know it was probably the worst service we've ever encountered. Too bad."}
{"text":"this is a biker dive bar

stay away 

dirty looks like it hasnt been cleaned in years 

not a restaurant 

this is a bar

with shitty food and service 

i quess that is why the weekend breakfast is free if you buy a cup of coffee 

will make sure all the food banks know that there clients can eat for a cup of coffee!"}
{"text":"Stopped for lunch ... Took extra home for later .... Some dog the best bbq I've had in AZ"}
{"text":"Unsuspecting location right next to Dodeys Bar! 
I popped in and grabbed their BBQ Pork Sandwich and I was thrilled! Great flavor and texture, the bun held together until the end! I am looking forward to trying some more of their BBQ in the future!"}
{"text":"Hammered Hog offers a free breakfast on Saturday and Sunday mornings with purchase of a non alcoholic beverage. The breakfast is actually really good. You also can buy it for $3 with purchase of an alcoholic beverage. The place is packed on Saturday and Sunday mornings due to this offer and sometimes you have to wait. They definitely need to do something about the lack of hostess / seating assistance. People walk in and just stand around waiting to see when a table comes open and it's very chaotic. There seems to be a lot of staff just hanging around. There was some guy who seems to be the owner, or just acting like it, who would jump in occasionally but for the most part spent his time drinking and watching the game. Through all the ownership of this building, it has remained a Green Bay Packers fan hold and still is.

we have not been there for lunch or dinner yet but plan on it as the menu looks delish!"}
{"text":"I had a similar experience to another reviewer this past Saturday.  I stood at the front for 10 minutes until some guy from the bar came over and said we could sit anywhere.  There were no servers present and the place smelled like stale cigarettes. 

We ordered onion rings and smoked chicken wings for appetizers followed by side salads and each of us ordered a main course.

The server brought out ALL of the food at once.  The only explanation offered was that the appetizers take a longer time.

Onion rings were overcooked and bland.  The smoked chicken wings were served without blue cheese or ranch dressing and they were probably the highlight of the meal. 

Ribs were fatty and under cooked.  They did smell like lighter fluid.  The signature sandwich of pulled pork, coleslaw and blue cheese was over sauced and served on a roll that could not handle the ingredients.

Sides of collard greens were very watery but had good flavor. Blue cheese coleslaw was crunchy with bottled dressing.

We presented a $10 coupon at the end and were told that they add an 18% gratuity when ever a coupon is used.  I checked the coupon and no where did it state that term.   Rather than make a fuss, I resigned myself to the final insult of a bad restaurant with less than average food, or so I thought.  The server disappeared with my credit card for 20 minutes.  I finally got my card back with my 18% tip added.

Never again!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Amazing BBQ Midwest Style! Awesome cheap breakfast during and after football season ! Staff and owners are attentive/cool! Cheree on week/weekends bar she is awesome!"}
{"text":"Ewwww.  For the price there are better bbq places.  Fine probably  for beer but not food or customer service.  I had the brisket sandwich."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good for the price, and drinks for 5 bucks?  Awesome...also my 3 year old ate all the food on his kids plate, so that makes any parent happy....even if it is Mac and cheese and chicken fingers and not broccoli lol"}
{"text":"I absolutely LOVE this place! 

My fiancee and I went last night for our second time.. the first time we both tried the open brisket sandwich. It was so good we ate it too fast that we had to take a nap afterwards ;-) Last night we paced ourselves and I got the 2 meat platter with chicken, brisket, mashed potatoes and macaroni. My fiancee got the half rack of ribs and corn on cob and macaroni. 

First of all.. the macaroni tastes like it has real cheese in it!! The taters tasted home-mashed, but the gravy could have been creamier..still good taste! The chicken and brisket were so perfect and juicy and seasoned just right!!! The rib meat fell off the bone and was juicy and meaty. Very little fat and cooked thoroughly.

Our food came quickly and was cooked perfectly. Wonderful service!!! Very friendly and accommodating(We were cold and she turned up air for us) and as I eat my yummy leftovers for lunch all I can think is..\"Man.. I should have ordered more cornbread to go!\""}
{"text":"The food at This restaurant is very very good. The happy hour prices are almost free and the chicken tenders are the best around. The service is friendly and it's a perfect neighborhood place. Don't pass this up!"}
{"text":"Our neighbor suggested we try the bbq here.  I have to say, the ribs were so dried with no dried rubbed seasoning and pulled pork had no flavor.  The only thing they did right was the smoking of the ribs.  Don't waste your money here for BBQ.  Famous Dave and Bobby Q is so much better."}
{"text":"We went there again last night and had the brisket sandwich which is called the Texan. Very good. A must try. Great Service and love the drinks too."}
{"text":"I was very impressed. The outside didn't suggested very much but the service and food was very good. My whole family enjoyed it. I will definitely be going back and telling my friends about it. The price was very reasonable, and the food sizes were decent."}
{"text":"Arrived with a party of 12 and we were seated right away. We were warned they only had one cook so it might take a while which was ok. The server did a good job but it took a while for everyone to get drinks. I ordered the BBQ  RIbs and I must say they were absolutely the WORST ribs I have ever had!  Full of fat and what little meat there was was soft and mushy, I ate about 3 bites before deciding I didn't want to risk  getting ill. I told the server and she offered to get me something else but by that time I had lost my appetite, she said she didn't know what else she could do, apparantly they don't have a manager. 
We are a group of 8-12 that go out every Friday night for dinner someplace, the next time someone suggests Hammered Hog I will veto that suggestion!!"}
{"text":"Take out was terrible! The nachos were gross. The chicken fingers were way over cooked and dry. The brisket sandwich was dry and no flavor at all. Dining in May be ok but the togo as just plain bad"}
{"text":"Food was great! Fall off the bone ribs. Succulent brisket. Authentic BBQ fare like hush puppies, collard greens, cowboy beans and cornbread.

Service was disappointing. Our initial server was great but soon was replaced by another guy who was too pre-occupied with a large party and activities at the register. Had trouble getting his attention.

Nice clean facility. 
Overall good. 
Try the Oreo Balls for desert!"}
{"text":"I visited a month or so ago. I consisted the food vey average. Simply okay. 

I had a sandwich for about $10 and I was starving after lunch and I'm not a huge eater 

That sandwich would've left a 4 year old still hungry"}
{"text":"We arrived at approximately 2:10 pm and the place was about 1/3 full. 45 minutes later the waitress informed us they did not have enough food to fulfill both orders. We asked for the food to go since we had already been waiting 45 minutes. We left after 55 minutes of nothing but sitting and 2 sandwiches that were soggy, sloppily prepared and not even that great. Disappointing experience to say the least."}
{"text":"So my wife loves loves loves BBQ food and It was her birthday dinner so I took her to The Hammered Hog BBQ hall and saloon. (for the 1st time) Now we live 1 mile away from Famous Daves BBQ and HHBBQ is prob 12 miles away but i thought we would try a new place out. 

NOT impressed! The food was greasy and the BBQ sauce was not up to par. Our ribs were over cooked and the corn bread was as dry as the sierra! Our 7 year old son wen along with us there were no kids menus or anything for them to draw on or color with. The pulled pork was OK but not great. 

In other words don't waste your time! Go to Famous Daves BBQ and get some of the best BBQ in the state! 

Service was good people were nice but not worth the drive!"}
{"text":"We stopped here last Friday-the jalapeño poppers are awesome--homemade and wrapped with bacon. Also tried the slidders-excellent! Good portions, friendly service! They have live music during the week, I will be back soon to try more! Everything is fresh and homemade-definitely a gem!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times and every time I have been disappointed. First the ribs were horrible on all of the times I ate here. I really wanted the food to be good but I can not say so. My wife had the pulled pork and it was just ok. the service is also just ok. I recommend you find another place for BBQ this place wont be around for long. I would rather go to Dickie's BBQ then this place and that says a lot."}
{"text":"I had a horrible experience at this restaurant about 2 years ago.

A few months back and I decided to give this place another shot and I'm glad I did. It was a slammed Sunday and the service was incredible. Really attentive, drinks kept full, beers kept cold.

Food was excellent. Sauce still needs work but I would definitely come back here.

Great job at stepping it up, guys!"}
{"text":"We (3 of us) went here on a Sunday morning for breakfast to this seat-your-self bar/restaurant.  We sat for 15 minutes without any staff member acknowledgement and left to go to Denny's!  One waitress carried a chair across the room and placed it at the table next to us, turned her back, and walked away!  We did go here a few weeks ago and had terrible service for a table of 6.  Expect to flag down wait staff to force them to take food & drink orders.  Our previous breakfast was good, but who cares if the service is completely terrible!"}
{"text":"Coming from Texas, I expect the best when it comes to BBQ. Thankfully, this place did not disappoint! The family BBQ platter was perfect for 6 people and the corn on the cob.....amazing! The staff is great,the food is the highlight of the place and the football on all the flat screens pits the finishing touch!"}
{"text":"We come here almost every weekend. This place has great prices, great drinks, amazing food, and super friendly people. The owners are there almost everyday and remember you when you walk in. Great local place. Don't be tricked by the negative reviews try it for yourself and you will not be disappointed. I throw my work Holiday parties here every year and everyone has a great time. Looking forward to many more parties, good food, and bloody marys in my future."}
{"text":"Ordered from here this evening and it was a complete rip off.  There was no way this could feed 4 to 5 people and it was all the nasty left overs they could fit in a box for $40.00.  Please don't waste your money.  When I contacted the vendor I got attitude and they didn't care about my experience at all.  Ruined my family's evening and meal.  Poor quality all around."}
{"text":"I've tried to like this place since they opened, but every time I go in I feel like I get another disappointment.  I don't think the food is anything special and the service that I get is usually awful.  The ribs are not very good and come with a choice of two side sauces. Maybe I'm spoiled in the fact that I've had such excellent barbecue in my life, but there's got to be something cooked on the ribs either wet or dry.  Here, you have to ask them to cook sauce on the ribs. The ribs are also St. Louis style not baby back... Don't be confused!  The ribs are also way overpriced.  

Since moving to the new location, I don't think they have improved anything. The service is still bad. The food isn't very good. They've just increased the space they have to disappoint."}
{"text":"I drove by this place many, many times before I finally tried it. Don't let the outside fool you as it did me.  It's better than sex!

I've tried several things on the menu and I haven't found a single thing I didn't enjoy. The street tacos are my favorite, with a little of that homemade bbq sauce, and I can never decide between the regular or the habanero, so I alternate back and forth. Excellent beer selection, friendly staff, and a nice decor inside.

The only thing this place is missing is a smoker's patio, but even that isn't enough for them to lose a star."}
{"text":"Drive by all the time so decided to stop in. Had the two meat platter with links and brisket. Absolutely terrible! The brisket looked like chuck roast over cooked in a crock pot! No pinkish hue, no \"smoke ring\" around the perimeter characteristic of slow smoked meat and no \"bark\" on the outside. Just brownish grey \"boiled\" looking meat. No smoke smell or taste either. BBQ sauces looked like catsup and I have had better off a supermarket shelf! Don't bother if you like \"real\" bbq!"}
{"text":"If you like the only flavor of BBQ to be BBQ SAUCE then you'd probably like this, because that's the only thing that had ANY FLAVOR WHATSOEVER. I feel like Great barbecue is hard to come by, but good barbecue really isn't that hard. I'm pretty irritated that I spent almost $20 on food here and they couldn't be bothered to even put some damn salt on anything... That alone would have probably given two stars back. I got the Texan sandwich, baked beans, and mashed potatoes. The meat was watery, had zero taste, and could have been salvaged with even a little salt. How do you mess up Texas toast? Even this had 00000 flavor to the point I just quit eating it. As if that wasn't bad enough.... how the hell do you mess up mashed potatoes? I'm baffled at how everything managed to taste EXACTLY THE SAME.... bland is too generous of a word. This was beyond awful and I'm more irritated at the fact that The Hammered Hog just didn't even try, everything could have been greatly improved with some damn salt, unfortunately I got this to go and had none... so it went in the trash. Save your $20 and go to Pork on a Fork or even Dickey's... I'm thoroughly disappointed and honestly embarrassed for this place, I should have listened to all the other reviewers with the same feedback."}
{"text":"Great BBQ. Nice to see a place that has confidence in their BBQ to serve it naked. Went for lunch. Got the Hammered Hog with Greens. Great wait staff. Great food. Nice beer selection. The poppers are great too."}
{"text":"The few negative reviews prove that you can never please everyone.  One such reviewer even said she \"just doesn't like bbq\" and still felt compelled to leave a negative comment!

 A friend recently introduced me to the Hammered Hog.  I am an amateur chef and I have my own smoker. I \"double smoke\" (two smoke sources) my own pork shoulders.  Hammered Hog's is still better. 

I haven't tried everything on the menu, but the pulled pork is infused with wonderful smoke flavor and so tender it melts in your mouth. Slathered with barbecue sauce, it is out of this world to any barbecue afficionado. The pulled chicken is almost as good.

The onion rings are crispy and large...and the onions fresh and sweet.

Not everyone likes collard greens but, if you do, you should love these.  They are the best I've ever eaten anywhere.

I've partaken of the \"free\" breakfast offered on the weekends.  These require that you purchave any large non-alcoholic drink.  I bought a Diet Coke for $2.50 and got a great breakfast consisting of hashbrowns, scrambled eggs, toast with butter, and about three slices of bacon.  The hashbrowns were perfectly cooked...not too soft and not too crisp.  And it's not small portions, either. Not sure how long they can continue to do this!

For decades Honey Bears has been my favorite barbecue joint. I've driven miles for a \"fix\" of pulled pork and collard greens. Unfortunately, the original location has gone downhill and even the Central Avenue location doesn't seem as good as it once was.  The Hammered Hog is closer and, I'm sorry to say, better than Honey Bears.  This is my new \"go to\" place for barbecue.

Footnote:  There's no such REAL word spelled \"barbeque\" which would be pronounced \"barbeck.\" The proper spelling is \"barbecue.\"  Yes, I know that some dictionaries will carry \"creative\" spellings once enough people use them, but that does not make them correct."}
{"text":"Free breakfast on the weekends!! But u have to buy a cup of coffee... (2 eggs,bacon,hash browns,and toast( nothing fancy) Lol.  The breakfast burrito is the best.. Order it with extra links!!!! And a shot of crown royal.  Lol
There peach cobbler with ice cream.. The best in town !!! The ribs are good,the hamburgers are still the tastiest I've had.. Very moist,juicy!!! There onion rings !!!!! Mmmmmmmmm 
 Go there.. And check it out."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I stopped by on a Sunday afternoon. She wanted some BBQ so we decided to give this place a try since it was close to our house.  This place is ok. Problem is, most of the best BBQ places are in the east valley. This place is very average. They offered a free breakfast with a purchase of a drink so we got that a half rack of rib platter. The breakfast was terrible. Running eggs with hard bacon and dried hash browns and toast. We didn't eat much of it.  The BBQ was ok. The ribs were extremely tender and falling off the bone but had very  little smoke flavor. I have a feeling the ribs were boiled or braised too long.  The brisket had a very weird taste and felt like it was old and reheated from the previous day.  The sides were ok. Mashed potatoes and hush puppies. The highlight of the meal was the BBQ sauce. They had two sauces. A Kansas City and spicy habanero sauce, both were good. Since moving to n Phoenix I'm still struggling to find a good BBQ joint. This place was barely better than heck yeah BBQ."}
{"text":"Very good service. Plain big room. Small portions."}
{"text":"Can I write a second review if years have passed?  I love this place and am a regular, but today I broke out of my norm and ordered the three egg omelette, add mushrooms and jalapenos on the side. The mushrooms were seasoned and grilled to perfection. The jalapenos were fresh rather than picked and grilled. I'm sorry I didn't try this two years ago. Their Kansas city sauce bridges the gap left by Lovejoy's from years back and the have my favorite beer Hop Knot on tap. Maybe I should move closer. Love"}
{"text":"was on a business trip from 200 miles away and wanted some good BBQ. Well I had the Brisket and the Hot links. It was average at best. I had to drive 11 miles back to my hotel and on the way back my stomach started hurting. I had nothing else today to make me this way. Lets just say when I got back to the hotel I destroyed the bathroom. Never going back here again. the rest of my night was shot."}
{"text":"A buddy and I came here for lunch after a weekend project.  I ordered the signature hammered hog sandwich with the macaroni and cheese.  The pork on the sandwich was dry and a little tough.  There are only 2 barbecue sauces to choose from and I wasn't particularly impressed with either. The sandwich had a ranch slaw that was OK and the bun was grilled. Unfortunately I had to disassemble the whole thing to put sauce on the meat and by the time I was done trying to reconstruct it, it was a soggy mess. The macaroni and cheese was home made but not especially good.   The waitress left me with an empty glass of Dr. Pepper for quite a while and it took a longer than I would have liked to get our check taken care of.

Overall I'd say mediocre service and mediocre food."}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ great atmosphere friendly staff the food is awesome then I don't want you order Saturday and Sundays free breakfast from 9 and 2 with purchase of a non alcohol beverage come and check it out in the best barbecue in town"}
{"text":"Wow! Great beer, great food, great service. 

I remember this as a dive bar when I lived nearby. It's now a great BBQ place with just the right level of \"dive\".

I had the hot links sandwich and fries. Meat was perfectly cooked and seasoned. Nice char on the outside. Fries were basic but hot and fresh. Both BBQ sauces I tried were excellent.

The onion rings were spot on. Crisp, well seasoned and the batter didn't fall off. Dip those in the BBQ sauce and be ready for heaven.

So many things on the menu I want to come back and try. With this kind of start I think some awesome rating awaits!"}
{"text":"Great bbq w about everything on menu. Pork, mac and cheese and hushpuppies  were exceptional. Happy hour menu is really good and the nachos are huge."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Love the ribs and the coleslaw. Also they have they great selection of beers on tap. 

The owner is there to make sure you have a great time. Highly recommend for all sporting events. They have big screen tv's on every space. Awesome. Will be great for super bowl. Cannot wait."}
{"text":"The poppin mary is to die for.
Roxanne our waitress it was her first day on the job and she was the best.
i think i have found my new bbq joint.
Just wished they had outdoor seating.
the owner said they are working on that."}
{"text":"Went to this place cuz its by the house, and WOW, it was super good!  VERY casual, and laid back... red checkered table clothes, live music (open Mic) and big screens in the bar area...  $5 Happy hour food, cannot beat that !!  Very smoky, moist pulled pork - mmmmm.  And dont forget to try an Oreo ball for dessert!!  I also suggest you try the Extra cheesy Macaroni and cheese!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Killer bbq. Had the 3 meat platter with brisket, chicken and sausage. All good. Best part is they serve it plain and you add your sauce. This allows you to taste the meat. Try the collard greens for a down home treat! Cowboy beans were best I've had since last trip to Pinnacle Peak Patio."}
{"text":"Every time I've been there, the service is friendly and prompt. We ordered a family platter this last time, and there was so much food! Amazing bbq for a wonderful price. The ability to have a choice of sauces is such a treat. I like hickory my hubby likes spicy. So everyone is happy! A few too many sporting events for my taste, but the food definitely makes up for that"}
{"text":"I place an order to go and got the Popcorn Pig, Catfish Platter and the Peach Cobbler.
I loved the Popcorn Pig, make sure to get the hot BBQ sauce it's amazing. I got the Catfish Platter with hush puppies and mashed potatoes on the side. The catfish was a bit salty, the hush puppies are huge, and the potatoes tasted homemade.The Peach Cobbler was good, the topping was amazing but the rest of it was a bit runny for my preference. I would go back to try other items on the menu and for more Popcorn Pig."}
{"text":"We went late on a Sunday night and almost had the place to ourselves.  Seems like it could be a good super casual neighborhood hangout, but would have to see what it's like at other times.  We tried the family platter (serves 3-4), which included 4 big ribs, generous piles of pulled pork, brisket and hot links, 4 sides, and 3 corn muffins.  Our favorites were the ribs (falling off the bone tender) and hot links, which were both gloriously smoky.  I read other reviews that said the meats were greasy, but that was not the case this time.  The blue cheese cole slaw was a wonderful new taste treat.  They have a great draft beer menu.  We were curious about a couple of the beers that we'd never tried, and they gave us each a small taste to try before ordering.  We chose the Breckenridge Vanilla Porter - wonderful!"}
{"text":"A perfectly good excuse for drinking in the morning... With all the good food value on their menu, breakfast specials and cold beverages I wish I had one uptown to start my mornings. At these prices why cook?"}
{"text":"Wow, what a nice find.  My sister and I had gone out to lunch and initially tried another place on Shea and the 51 which will go unnamed in this review but FAIL.  After walking out of our initial stop completely unnoticed, we decided to try the Hammered Hog.  I drive by this place several times a week and I've been eyeing it for a few years at least and it was close to our initial attempt at lunch so we headed there.
We pulled into the parking lot, it looks like a dive biker bar.  I have no problem with dive biker bars, but the interior was much nicer than we had expected.
We were waited on almost immediately, I wish I had gotten the waitress/bartenders name, but she was very friendly and helpful.  We ordered, got our drinks quickly and the food came out soon after.
I ordered the 1/2 lb. brisket on Texas toast and tater tots.  My only complaint was the bottom slice of toast was a bit soggy.  The brisket was delicious.  I added some KC bbq sauce and was good to go.  The tater tots were nice and crispy, I wished I had a larger portion!  I didn't make note of my sisters order but she was equally complimentary of her meal.  In fact, she took a to go menu with her, in particular for ordering by the pound for when she has company.

The prices were reasonable, I just wish the portions were larger it was so tasty.

I will definitely be back as it is close to my work and home and I love a good bbq place."}
{"text":"Stopped in on a Sunday afternoon to watch a little bit of college baseball. Decided to snack on the street tacos. They were good. The Bloody Mary was just OK but they have Moose Drool on tap!!! Less than 10 bucks and good atmosphere. Not a bad place to make your neighborhood bar. 

And don't forget about their breakfast specials! 

Biker friendly establishment. Support them."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the barbecue and atmosphere at this place. Husband got the pulled pork w/ coleslaw sandwich and I got the brisket platter. His sandwich was too big and messy to pick up right away but it was tasty. My plate had tons of brisket which I only like 1/3 of it. I also had the cheesy grits and coleslaw. All was tasty. I liked the atmosphere b/c it was laid back. Half of the crowd had small kids but the music, tv and noise level was perfect so that the kids can be themselves and loud w/o bothering others."}
{"text":"Great place, it's a must go for some great BBQ. Clean restaurant with friendly and helpful staff. The food comes in large portions so be prepared for leftovers. 
We read about the breakfast and definitely plan on a return visit. The Bloody Mary looks amazing!"}
{"text":"First visit:

Solid food. Above average beer selection. Very good service. Not fancy, but a comfortable spot for a good meal. Side dishes were exceptional: Collard greens, Cole slaw, cowboy beans."}
{"text":"The owner takes pride in her business. There are 2 locations and she cares about her customers opinions. For bar food, our lunch of fish tacos and pork popcorn was good. The salsa was very tasty, but the nachos would have been better just as chips..."}
{"text":"My first visit here and it's the real deal. Some of the best BBQ I've had. I had their signature sandwich the Hammered Hog and it was awesome. Can't wait to come back to try the ribs."}
{"text":"Honestly the smokiest most tender bbq I've ever had. I ordered the family plate with a roommate of mine ... Got to try everything. . As I write this we are still eating and it's been 45 minutes since food arrived . A perfect place where you come for food , not atmosphere"}
{"text":"Horrible. Absolutely the worst BBQ I've EVER been to! Took my grandparents, looking for a good time with plenty of good food
 Did NOT find this here! Ordered a 2 person meal and was barely enough for 1. I am 120lbs and by no means \"glutinous\" but CAN EAT. Asked the manager NOT only the waitress for extra biscuits for them and was nonchalantly brushed off. Bad customer experience. Mediocre food. Will NOT go back. Actually went to eat at Manuels after. Tsk Tsk..."}
{"text":"It pains me to leave a one star review at a place with above average food but this rating is well deserved.

I went in with a buddy for a quick bite to eat on Thursday night. We got there around 6:45pm and sat at the bar. The restaurant was about 30% full. 

My friend and I sat at the bar for roughly 5-7 minutes before we were acknowledged. Three different girls walked by us multiple times and never said a thing. I thought we would at least be offered a menu. We should have taken this as a sign of things to come. 

We ended up ordering beers and an appetizer of 6 hot wings (Coors cans for $2, great deal!). To our dismay, the wings took 45-60 minutes to come out. The waitress apologized to us and said the kitchen was slammed... again the place was about 1/3 of the way full. When the wings finally came out I will have say that they were pretty solid, great flavor, but they only delivered 5 wings to us instead of 6. The waitress apologized for the mishap and brought us out 2 extra wings! Which was pretty comical to us. 

I ordered the beef brisket with mac and cheese and a side salad. My friend got a BBQ sandwich and the bun was soggy and falling apart. My beef brisket was good but not good enough to make up for the 1 hour+ wait. By the time we finished eating and got our check it was nearly 8:45pm. 

As you can tell, we were extremely disappointed in the quality of service and will most likely not be going back anytime soon. If you decide to go, I hope the experience is better for you bc the food isn't bad."}
{"text":"First off the service is great and the staff is friendly.  However, the food leaves much to be desired.  They boil/braise the life out of the ribs in order to make them appear tender, but unfortunately it makes them the consistency of Play-Doh in an AZ car on a hot summer day. Potato salad is uneventful with mayo, celery, and a bit of egg. Bland. Not sure why a side of corn is only 3\" of the actual corn cob. At $3.50 they should be generous enough to share the rest of the 50 cent vegetable. Rib sandwich was pulled meat that's chopped and then allowed to wither and die somewhere to the consistency jerky bits that needed to be rehydrated with their traditional sauce.  Really was hoping for something special after walking in, smelling the smoke, nice decor, and pleasant atmosphere.  O'well."}
{"text":"Quite simply the worst chimi I have ever had, the only reason I am leaving two stars is I tried their signature dish and it wasn't bad, but honestly you have to try hard to mess up a pulled pork sandwich."}
{"text":"The ribs were horrible, but everything else was not too bad. The pulled chicken and pulled pork were a bit bland, but not too fatty. The mashed potatoes were satisfactory and the cowboy beans were flavorless. They forgot to include the cornbread in our order, but I should have checked before leaving, so my fault.

The biggest disappointment were the ribs. They were so fatty, almost no sauce, and what little meat you could find tasted sour. I'd recommend staying away from the ribs, but their taquitos were pretty good."}
{"text":"We decided to check this place out this morning when I wanted to go out to breakfast. Turns out that there is a free breakfast option with the purchase of a drink (as others have mentioned here). This made our morning! 

the free breakfast was good as were the biscuits and gravy, though the gravy was a bit thick for my taste, the quantity of sausage in it made up for the thick factor (I love sausage). 

Overall, I would say give it a try. the prices were great and the staff friendly."}
{"text":"I love barbecue so we decided to take a chance on this place terrible service ordered it to me we were rushed down the line with no sides and no bread walked all the way to work car and realize we didn't have our sides or our bread and when we went back all they gave us was two sides so we went back to her car realize we still didn't get a cornbread not a very good experience service left a lot to be desired unfortunately there are multiple people in line with the same issue"}
{"text":"There are a few very good bbq places in the area that this place has to contend with and it holds its own. Ordered the hammered hog signature sandwhich and it was good, i added quite a bit of habanero bbq sauce to it to spice it up and i couldnt quite get the blue cheese taste in the cole slaw but no complaints. Hush puppies were good and seemed fresh. Excellent beer list on tap! Service was fast and friendly around dinner time friday."}
{"text":"I have to give a one star simply because this place has progressively gotten worse with each visit. Without a doubt this place was the best place to get BBQ two years ago. The owners were always there, the food was always hot, and the cornbread you wrote home about.

Then they tried to expand and ruined a good thing. The quality of food is comparable to a Wendy's and the interior is like that of a truck stop. To go into anymore details regarding this place would be just to see how many ways I could say disappointed. 

As a person who enjoyed what used to be, I can longer give hammered hog my money and watch them waste it on this low quality of food"}
{"text":"Awesome original food, but my lips are on fire after the jalapeño poppers I just popped... Need.. to.. order.. another bourbon & coke..."}
{"text":"I wanted to give 3 stars but after much thought downgraded.
Average BBQ, a place I would go to once in a while but not a place to make a special trip to.
Ordered Ribs and Brisket dinner.  Ribs as everyone mentioned is dry but very meaty.  Good flavor and not overly sauced but the dryness ruins anything else that's good.  Brisket is DRY.  Tasted alright but I've had much better in KC like Oklahoma Joes.
Other stuff witnessed:
Lunch salad was abysmal consisting of iceberg lettuce and l little bit of meat sprinkled on top.  Don't get a salad at a BBQ joint. 
Happy hour is a joke.  C'mon, .50 cents off a $5 beer, you call that happy hour?  Plus the happy hour menu consists of items on the lunch menu.  If you are going to have happy hour specials, make it special, not the same as lunch!"}
{"text":"A friend met me here for lunch, and ever since he did I think my wife and I have been back ~3 times a month. One of our favorite places to eat; great meats, tacos and enchiladas, and enough beer choices to keep it real. Solid for breakfast and lunch too.

Love it!"}
{"text":"We had the Tri tips, hot links sandwich and a half order of onion rings. All was really good. If you combine the two bbq sauces, you get a spicy, yummy blend. They had a surprising large beer list which included 4 peaks local beers which are excellent.  Bathrooms were clean, service was good and atmosphere was casual. If you want a dive place with great food, this place it it!!  Very clean!"}
{"text":"Get one of the platters. They are delicious and even better when heated back up for left overs."}
{"text":"Overdue review

I tried the Hog in August, 2012 between the lunch and dinner hour for take out. 1 table was occupied. Waited at the front for almost 10 minutes before a server came to greet me, despite the bell at the door.

Ordered the pork ribs, blue cheese coleslaw, and mac n cheese. 

Mac n cheese: bland and oily
Blue cheese coleslaw: Fabulous! Crunchy, creamy, very flavorful with the blue cheese. Definitely worth trying.
Pork Ribs: Seriously fatty and greasy. Large portion, but unfortunately the ribs smelled like lighter fluid like they were doused when they were being cooked. This smell permeated my car on the way home, and they pretty much tasted like they smelled. My dogs were happy that night!

I see there is a love/hate consensus with this place. Maybe I caught them on a bad day, but I'm not willing to try this place again"}
{"text":"We just had a great meal with great service. Started with an ice cold beer and then the Hammered  Hog sandwich. My son had the rib tips and they were scrumptious."}
{"text":"I wanted to give it another chance.  Unfortunately, I had the same experience as I did when it was the Notorious P.I.G. Service was awful. Food had it's highlights, but they ruined it with the sides."}
{"text":"Had such a great meal this evening. Started with sliders and a couple of drinks. The drinks were FANTASTIC. Not too strong but just right. Great taste, balanced and delicious. Main courses we ordered were the rib plate and a sandwich. The collard greens were too vinegar-y for me but the potato salad and Mac n cheese were delightful. Too full for dessert there but I brought my red velvet cake home where it didn't last the first hour. It was creamy, moist, and the sweetest most flavorful frosting I've ever had anywhere!  

Some places have very limited choices on their kids menu but not the Hammered Hog. They had several options. Our two boys were happy (and full) after their meals. Very kid-friendly. 

We will definitely go again. So glad we decided to check them out after seeing it on \"Check Please Arizona.\""}
{"text":"Nice casual atmosphere.  Friendly and attentive staff.  One of the owners was checking with all of the patrons to insure they were satisfied.  Turns out her daughter was our server.  Overall I was very satisfied with the meal and the service.  Cost was appropriate for the style of food and atmosphere.  Portions were generous save for the sides.

The onion rings, which I usually don't eat, were excellent.  Same goes for the cole slaw with the optional bleu cheese dressing - Nice twist (\"blue\" on the menu, but give them a break.  It's a BBQ place.  Leave your high brows at home.)  

Mac & Cheese made with real cheese.  Not sure what kind of cheese, but the flavor was light and tasty.  The baked beans were quite good with some pork added for that little extra BBQ taste.  Nice balance of sweetness with plenty of brown sugar and, I believe, a hint of molasses. 

I thought the  portion sizes for the sides was on the light side, particularly considering they came with a platter portioned for 3 to 4 people.  I really enjoyed those sides an would have appreciated a bit more.  Not that there wasn't enough meat to satisfy my appetite... 

We ordered the family platter so we could sample most of the meats.  The pulled pork was OK for pulled pork.  It's never been one of my favorites so don't let me dissuade you if it's your thing.  The chopped brisket and ribs were acceptable, but I've had better at Famous Dave's.  The hot links were marvelous, however if you like yours very spicy they are not for you.  To me they were perfect and delicious with just enough spice to make them interesting.

Like most restaurants I've patronized, some menu items I liked and others I did not.  I found enough items that I truly enjoyed at Hammered Hog to return again."}
{"text":"Not much good to say at all about this place. We live in the neighborhood and wanted to give this place a shot. I immediately regretted even walking in the door. Our food was totally flavorless and a horrible value. I ordered the \"Hammered Hog\" sandwich, which touted a 1/2 pound of our house smoked pulled pork covered with blue cheese cole slaw. My wife ordered a pulled pork sandwich which stated it had a 1/3 pound of pulled pork on it. I swear, their was more meat on hers and mine was a buck more. Not that I would have wanted more meat, it had no flavor except smoke which I'm guessing was liquid smoke. The collard greens side I ordered was so acidic and lacking the long cooking time that this dish needs. I think they might have tasted sour because they had gone bad? My in-laws split a two meat combo and I was embarrassed to take them there. A $70.00 tab for two sandwiches, a split entree plate, one mixed drink and three sodas? Oh, and we ordered a plate of happy hour nachos which were store bought round corn tortilla chips, congealed cheddar cheese, maybe a cup of diced tomatoes and black olives with lackluster sour cream and salsa on the side. Needless to say, we will never go back. I give this place 6 months tops. Whoever thinks this qualifies as good BBQ needs to go to read a recipe and attempt to cook BBQ for the first time ever. I'm almost positive it will come out better."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were nearby waiting for our car to be repaired and happened on this place for lunch. The vibe of the place is cool, nice decor and overall ambiance. Unfortunately, that is about the only good thing I can say about our experience. 

Service was terrible. Waitress came over once to get our order and once to drop the check. The rest of the time she was chatting by the bar and generally ignoring us. Ran out of water halfway through and never got more. 

The food was...weird. I love BBQ and really wanted to love theirs but couldn't. My sandwich was cold and had been sitting awhile, while my girlfriends was so hot she couldn't eat it for 10 minutes.  There was finally a warm bite in the very center of my sandwich. I'd bet my paycheck they used a microwave on both. The fries were cold and gross. 

I really wanted this to be a new \"hidden gem\" near my home but instead was left wishing I had got Jack In The Box across the street. At least then my food would be hot and I would get decent service."}
{"text":"Love the service here. I go to see Travis almost every weekend for my hole-in-the-glass mimosas and I've tried almost everything on the breakfast menu."}
{"text":"I am warning you. This review is not gonna be pretty. It starts bad and it ends worse. Is that even possible? Read along and you be the judge. In an attempt to use some of the many Restaurant.com certs that we have laying around, we decided to grab take out one night and finally try Hammered Hog. Upon entering the establishment, my husband was told he could not use the certificate which has no expiration date, mind you. He was then told , how the 'relationship ended very badly' with Restaurant.com. Not really one who likes wasting money nor establishments who don't make good on redeeming things such as this, I think my relationship with Hammered Hog may have ended there, as i would have deemed it unprofessional to not honor a $25 certificate and go into the story with a customer; but, that said, I also tend to be the more impatient of us two in the couple-dom and my husband opted to give Hammered Hog a chance anyway. He ordered a platter. It came with pulled pork; pulled chicken; and hot links; for the sides we got mashed potatoes and gravy; and blue cheese cole slaw. I found the meat to be tasteless. The hot links were good but not spicy and the smallest links i've ever seen in a BBQ restaurant. They are cut up into bite sized pieces .. why?? The pulled chicken was dry and bland and the pulled pork was just blah and watery. The sauces also left little to be desired. The mashed potatoes were pasty and instant .. something served in a hospital would have likely tasted better. What was that texture ??? I was afraid to touch the sludge of mess they labeled as 'gravy' -- KID you not, brown, lumpy sludge! And to round out this less than stellar $35 meal..the blue cheese cole slaw ? Literally was cole slaw with some blue cheese dressing ( again with NO flavor ) drizzled on top, it seemed. This meal just aggravated me to no end. The portion size was okay , but no offense .. who cares? I didn't finish my small plate of this waste because it wasn't worth my calories, and i don't like eating things that I don't like. There are some really GOOD BBQ places in Phoenix for it not being a 'BBQ area' like Kansas City, North Carolina or the deep heart of Texas. This.. isn't one of them. Save your time, your money, and your taste and go somewhere else when you have a hankering for BBQ takeout next time. This place is hammered alright .. and not in a good way."}
{"text":"Would be awesome but the buns are always soggy. May want to invest in better bread to increase the quality of the sandwhich."}
{"text":"Fantastic BBQ! I read the good the bad and the ugly and decided to give it a try. Living in north central Phx, we have several BBQ places to choose from, but none I'm excited to go back to till now.
I called early Super Bowl Sunday and ordered a family platter to go, with a pickup for 3:30pm. I arrived on time and they were just finishing packing it up. 
Way more food than we could eat, so plenty of leftovers to share.
I found all of the BBQ, fresh, crazy tender and tasty. Coleslaw and MnC were really good, but the cowboy beans are off the charts yummy. Nothing better than excellent flavor that's not over salted.
I'm excited to go again."}
{"text":"I love BBQ joints so this was on my list to try for a while.  It ended up just being a big waste of money.   We had the brisket which actually wasn't so bad, just not tender like it should be.  The sauce was good, the mashed potatoes were okay, and the corn on the cob was water-logged and soggy.  But you go to these places for the meat, right??  We also had the ribs, which not only were not good, but grossed us out enough that we left still hungry.  They seemed under cooked and were very gristly and pretty much just chunks of fat on a bone.  The meat that was on the bones was rubbery and gross.  Maybe we just hit this place on a bad night, but it was bad enough to make me say I will never go here again."}
{"text":"Great food every time at this place. Picked up to go food today using the app thru Yelp. Was very easy to use and food was ready to go when  I arrived. 

The brisket, Mac n Cheese, potato salad and Hammered Hog sandwich are all fantastic! 

The atmosphere inside is very comfortable and the staff all very friendly! I'd recommend giving them a try!"}
{"text":"Some of the food was great.  The pork nuggets, the pickles...these were quite good.  My burger, however, was requested medium rare and came out just past Charcoal Briquette.  Also it came out 5 minutes after everyone elses food. i guess they wanted to make sure it was really dead!  

Unfortunately due to my time constraints, and not being able to find my server, by the time my server actually came by to check up on the food, I was 1/2 way through eating it. He did ask if he could get it replaced, but I just didn't have the time to wait, and I had eaten a good portion of the burger.

All in all, interesting place with some good attributes, but not a home run. i will try it again one day, but I will not go out of my way to do so."}
{"text":"I had the oppertunity to try this establishment out last week, I wasn't out looking for it. I was just in the area, and it was there! 

This is a place I would like to try again, 
I had their Hammered Hog sandwich w/fries. This sandwich consist of 1/2 pound of pulled pork, served Carolina-style with creamy bleu cheese cole slaw on top. Even though this is their hallmark sandwich, glad I tried it, and it was OK, I will not eat it again. However, there are a lot of other items I would like to sink my teeth into! 

Not sure if this place is a Bar that sells food, or a restaurant that sells beer? Place is a little dark, has a bar with TV, with a dining room.

When I come back for a second time, I will follow up with second review!"}
{"text":"Ok. I am so glad I tried this place out. From the outside it looks a little deserted and well...a little ominous. I finally went in today and experienced the best enchiladas w/pulled pork I have EVER had. The homemade onion rings are to die for. Mom had tacos.My brother in law had the spare ribs. 
ABSOLUTELY A MUST TO VISIT....I am not kidding. Try it once and you will be sold. UNBELIEVABLE. Can't wait till my next trip there!!!!!!!!!!!! 
A +++++"}
{"text":"BBQ was decent, we're not pork eaters so we were limited to just the pulled chicken n the Beef brisket, the sides were small portioned I wished they served them
In bigger sizes. The price for what you get in not bad. Service was nice just slow cause they only had one person on Sunday nite and she was running the bar, waitress, cashier.. Soda was also flat.."}
{"text":"Went in on a Saturday night about 8PM.  There were 3-4 people at the bar watching hockey and Barret Jackson.  Other than that, the place was dead. My friend and I decided to share a plate of ribs with sides of corn on the cob and fries.  Food was a little slow coming out, as were the drinks, especially considering how empty the place was.  When the food did come out, there was a huge stack of ribs on the plate.  The ribs were definitely meaty enough, but seemed a little undercooked and bland to me.  Fries were good, though the portions seemed a little small.  Corn was excellent.  My friend went to the lady's room and was thoroughly disgusted with the appearance - she said it was dirty and smelled like someone had vomited.  Men's room was acceptable.  The waiter was polite and attentive.  We boxed the leftover ribs, but I threw them out this morning as I was concerned about the cooking.

Meal for two of us, with a few drinks each came out to 50+, not including tip.

I was surprised that the web page has nothing on it besides the store location - no menu, food descriptions, etc.

Pretty sure I will not go back."}
{"text":"Name says it all! Scrut BBQ, decent atmosphere (it's a bar kids)! Sides? Beans were good and I should have ordered the Bleu Cheese Cole Slaw. Mac n Cheese, regular Slaw and Corn muffins (with no Corn meal or seasonings at all) were all meh. Hey, we don't need no sides....it is all about the proteins! Will not order sides next time. No worries!
Tip...Come prepared to eat great BBQ and a ton of it...and take home leftovers!"}
{"text":"Came here with my girlfriend on a Sunday night. A few other families were there watching the cardinals game. We sat at the bar, the bartender provided attentive service. We split a full rack of ribs (sauce cooked on) and they were deliciously tender and saucy. Non pretentious atmosphere... The way a barbeque place should be."}
{"text":"I'm giving a higher rating than I should.  The good, the great was our Hostess!! The flip side if this was their food.  They have a huge banner inside that clearly reads won for:  \"Voted Best BBQ in Phoenix\", I would have to say to that there must nit be any other barbeque joints on the county! 

If you're interested in trying this place then go for the platter that comes with your choice of meat, 2 sides and corn bread after 5 pm. 

I had the brisket platter w/2 sides. The brisket was super DRY, difficult to eat since I kept viewing and chewing and chewing, bland smokeless flavor, no rings or char from being smoked, no burnt like ends. You get quiet a bit for the meat portion. The sides I had the jalapeno coleslaw which was good and mashed potatos and beef gravy -bland. The cornbread was tasty with actual corn bits, but the smallest corn bread ever, you only get one.

My other diners with me had ordered the sandwich, pulled pork and rib tips. The sandwiches were super small, the size of like that of a quarter pounder. They were disappointed in their meal, perhaps a kids meal in comparison. The corn side is $2.50 and it's not even a 1/2 an ear. (My picture makes corn seem large, but gives you a perspective of the pulled pork sandwich size. small) They also stated it was bland."}
{"text":"Yaay for Small Business Saturday!

Came here for breakfast today and this time we didn't get the usual...
Hubby got a 3 cheeses omelette with jalapeños (for less than $5) and it was yummy... tons of jalapeños!
I wanted something light and was not sure what to order... I went for a cup of collard greens... what? collard greens? yes. I only had them once in the past and I did like them. I had forgotten how 'vinegary' they are, but I still liked them. 

Our server Easton is winning his way into our hearts : ) We like that he remembers our beverage choices from previous visits, which is nice."}
{"text":"Tried the Poppin' Mary today. Yum yum. Super busy for to football season. Great service, free breakfast... Do I need to say more? : )"}
{"text":"I ordered the ribs 1/2 rack and beef brisket 1 pint to go.  The quality of the meats are very good.  Lots of meat.  Thick, moist.  Unfortunately, the flavor wasn't there.  Growing up on Texas BBQ, I am used to much better flavor."}
{"text":"We showed up around 615 on a Saturday night.  We were the only ones there initially, which made me a bit nervous.  The dining room was dark, but paper signs indicated that they were moving to a new location this summer.  The decor was otherwise ok/nothing special.  The food was decent and priced appropriately.  I got the brisket BBQ platter; my spouse got the pork BBQ platter; his mom got the catfish.  The mac-n-cheese was a 6-7/10--at least made with seemingly real cheese (my favorite mac-n-cheese in the Valley is at Bliss/Rebar--so everything gets compared back to that for me).  The hush puppies were a 10/10!!!  The meat was a 8/10.  The collard greens had a bit too much vinegar for our tastes.  The BBQ sauces were good, and the habanero sauce was not spicy at all (to me)--probably just right for a larger public.  The muffins tasted like a Jiffy muffin mix, which was fine with me (at least they were edible!).  Overall, decent service and solid food.  We'll go back.  It was better than I thought it would be, and there is enough variety to entice me to try more on the menu."}
{"text":"When you step in you feel like you are in rural North Carolina!  Great happy hour prices.  Rib tips good.. Can't beat nice people and dollar pbr all the time!!!  Location has moved and it is for the better. More space and nicer environment."}
{"text":"Saturday & Sunday free breakfast w/purchase of a drink..& It is a good breakfast....While you are grinding & getting your eyes open you get your ears & feet working with \"Dry Heat\" ol'school blues three piece w/ a mystery drummer from 
10:00 AM to 2:00PM.. We have had a couple of fun mornings and early afternoons drinking & eating at The Hammered Hog!
Then it's time for lunch and we order the combo a little taste of all the the meats,sides of sweet potatoes,& salads..we went home happy!
Turned into a dirty unkempt restaurant that closed and reopened in another location. I will not be going to."}
{"text":"Had a HOG ride there, 3160, food was great and they did a great job taking care of all 30+ of us. Pork was tasty, but have to say the chicken was really good."}
{"text":"I believe that this might be related to the Notorious P.I.G. restaurant which I didn't like.  Even if it is, I'm not holding it against them.  Small unassuming restaurant with good prices.  A giant platter capable of feeding five people (and having some leftovers) is about $30.00
The platter came loaded with brisket, smoked hot links, pulled pork and pork ribs.  It had four sides and four pieces of cornbread.  We were stuffed.  The cheesy grits and cheesy macaroni and cheese were really really cheesy.  The two taste pretty similar though.  So I would get one or the other.  Baked beans were standard as were for the mac and cheese.
The meats are very well smoked, and will taste of smoke.  They will not taste of much else though and you will have to add the sauces.  One is a tangy K.C. style sauce, the other is a smokey habenero which is not spicy at all but has just a smidge of heat.  Both sauces are on the table and you can sauce as much or as little as you like.  The sauces really transform the meat, without it all you taste is smoke.  With the sauces they transform the meat entirely.
Overall, its a good value for decent food.  Its not going to necessarily replace Honey Bears in my heart, but not a bad place and good value."}
{"text":"I have been here a few times (both before and after the name change) and have seen changes that I don't like.

I have to admit though, the Hot BBQ sauce and the 3 meat combo are great, the staff is attentive and atmosphere is conducive to a nice meal. 

I do miss the half-chicken meal, but I understand that if a menu item isn't selling, it has to go!"}
{"text":"Really, really tasty ribs and pulled pork with two yummy sauces - one regular, one spicy. Also loved the hot sausage links and regular cole slaw. Sports bar atmosphere, but the service was good and friendly. Free cornbread is a tasty plus. Don't bother about the grits - they weren't hot and lacked any seasoning. Definitely would recommend and return."}
{"text":"I braved the reviews and decided to try this place out anyway. 

Sorry to anyone that has Ill feelings but unfortunately we do not know the truth and can only comment on the current, as we see it. 

It took me two u-turns to actually find the place but that is because I did not look at the address before I left. It is located on the North East side behind the Oil changing place. 

The building was bigger then I had expected and I liked the colors of the exterior. 

I walked in stuck me head in the bar and the waiting room and no one was there to greet me. It took about 2 full min which feels like forever for some reason. The owner (I assume) seated me in the bar while I waited for Ryan C. 

The interior was clean and inviting. I liked the bar setup. 

The bar tender/waitress helped me with a cold drink while I waited. I usually wait for Ryan for just about everything. LOL 

I looked over the menu and the the lunch specials are killer. $4 for a 1/4lb pork sandwich with a side. WOW 

We both had pork sandwiches one with fries and one with salad. The meat was good, we each had one hunk o fat but the texture and flavor (before sauce) was good. The meat was a little too greasy and soaked the bottom bun while dripping out as well. The spicy sauce was good but not too spicy. The blue cheese was lacking. 

All in all I had a great lunch. I would go back and use my REST.com coupon for dinner."}
{"text":"Glad we found this gem! Great brisket, hushpuppies & Mac n cheese! So so good!"}
{"text":"I saw this on check please and thought we would check it out.  Got the platter with pulled pork, pulled chicken, fries and cole slaw.  Delicious, moist and fresh.  Bloody Mary's are $2.00 (WHAT) WOW.  Nothing fancy, great service and just good food."}
{"text":"This is our favorite BBQ joint.  Love the BBQ, Mac & Cheese, Taquitos and even the chicken strips.  You have to save room for the cobbler as well because a trip there is not complete until you have had the cobbler.  I have not had anything yet that I did not like.  The cobbler is not as good if you get it to go though - you have to eat it there.  I just wish this place was closer to home - I would eat here all the time!  Most places won't have Nascar on but we showed up one day & they changed one of the televisions (as there are plenty) for us so we could finish watching the race.  Got to love that!"}
{"text":"Looking for BBQ and your in north PHX, come check this place out. You will not be disappointed. The meats, the sauces, and sides are on point!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to eat hands down!  The pork tenderloin sandwiches are to die for!!  I eat here at least 2 - 3 times a week and I still cant get enough of their food.  A must eat place to go to!"}
{"text":"Good food and good prices (generous lunch menu prices, too).  The service is friendly and the food is tasty.  The mac n cheese is a but odd, not bad, just odd (gritty).  The appetizers are good sizes as well."}
{"text":"What an unexpected gem! We were out of our normal hood for a meeting and didn't know where to go. We don't eat fast food, but we wanted a quick lunch. This place was great. Food was hot, tasty, and plentiful. The service was super friendly. Couldn't have ask for more! They have specials and kids eat free one evening. (We don't need that benefit any more but it is good to know)."}
{"text":"This place used to be the Notorious P.I.G. now it's called Hammered Hog BBQ Hall & Saloon and it's still owned by the same owner.  

Had a Snag and Save e-gift certificate from when the place was still called the Notorious P.I.G.

By the time I was ready to use the e-gift certificate, SnagandSave.com was bought out by Buywithme.com and my SnagandSave purchases disappeared.

Luckily, I had print out the receipt and even though I did not have the actual e-gift certificate, the owner (who could have not honored the e-gift certificate 1. because I did not have the actual e-gift certificate 2. because the place was now called Hammered Hog BBQ Hall & Saloon, a completely different restaurant) honored my receipt and give me $30 worth of tasty bbq.

How coooooooolllllllll is that!?  An owner with a sense of integrity!!  I really hope this restaurant becomes a success just because the owner is so righteous.

Plus, the bbq was tasty too!"}
{"text":"This place is epic. I'm a bbq pro and this place was not only filling but also delicious. The cooks are champs. They sit in no ac and smoke delicious pork and brisket all day. 

I bought extra to take home for dinner. Check this place out it was totally worth it."}
{"text":"The food is amazing. They have something for everyone. The ribs are fall off the bone delicious. My favorite is the Hammered Hog sandwhich, it's so yummy."}
{"text":"Well after seeing a 4 star overall rating and in the mood for some BBQ I went here and was sorely disappointed. I called in a to go order and then came to pick it up. The only upside of this place seems to be that it is clean and the hostess and bartenders are friendly and courteous that is why it is a 2 star review instead of a 1 star. As for the food well it was below subpar at best.

I got the two meat BBQ platter with chicken and brisket, along with mashed potatoes and cheese grits. This came out to be $16.00. I picked it up and went home and starting eating and well the chicken was tasteless, bland, and I could make something better on my own crock pot. The brisket was OK in terms of texture but the taste could also use some flavoring. The mashed potatoes would be ok but the gravy they used had a particularly horrible sour flavor that made me not want to eat them. The cheese grits were the best thing on the plate but weren't particular flavorful either. Overall a disappointment, maybe I came here on an off night but at least the staff seemed nice."}
{"text":"Great service!! Had a wonderful waitress. Food on the other hand was ok. Ribs were a bit watery. Pulled pork was meh. However the jalapeño poppers (Jalapenos stuffed with sausage and cream cheese wrapped in bacon and served with habanero pineapple jelly) were awesome! There was also an issue ordering our beers. The keg lines had been swapped so they poured an amber instead of an IPA but the wait/bar staff did a great job figuring out what was wrong."}
{"text":"Hands down, the best BBQ in AZ! We had the family platter between 4 people and went home with a ton of leftovers. The price was reasonable, service was great and the food was amazing! We will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"This place is terrible. We were not greeted upon entrance. They still had the Friday special on the board, when it was Sunday night. We ordered the platter with choice of 3 meats only to discover 3 bland flavorless meats. The chicken and pork seemed to taste as if someone rubbed them in an ashtray upon serving. If it weren't for the BBQ sauces available to drench them in, I do not believe I would have even bothered to swallow them. Cornbread is nothi9ng special/ French fries are crinkle cut, nothing special. Can't complain about the beer because we ordered Coors light bottles. Do not go here ever. Tell your friends to get a tub of Lloyd's at the super market. This is not BBQ."}
{"text":"Ordered the family platter and it had a ton of food however most of the meat and all of the sides were bland,  bland,  bland,  bland! The barbecue sauce was good but the meat is boring without it.  The ribs were fall off the bone but very fatty.  Ordered hush puppies as one of our sides but they forgot to give them to us. Will not be eating here again."}
{"text":"We got BBQ pork and brisket. Both were very tasty. This place is kind of divey, but good solid food, good service and a no nosense atmosphere. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Well,  free breakfast? I was expecting crap.  Surprise!! It was pretty darned good.
My friend got a side of brisket.  
That was pretty good too.
Biscuits and gravy, meh.
I wouldn't order it again.  A little too crunchy. But I ate it

I'd come back again
Black butte Porter on tap. Yum and reasonably priced"}
{"text":"As a professional chef and having spent the past 13 years working barbecue here is my review. 

Pros: 
1. Wings were smoked n fried and lathered in a nice tight sauce that clung to the wings and gave them so so much extra love. Wow! They were just like I serve them at my restaurant and the greatest part about that is any pit master can tell you that eating world class barbecue without doing it yourself is always a major plus!
2. My whiskey was brought to me in a nice double shot glass, beer was ice cold
3. Servers were nice and attentive. They made eye contact, were prompt, polite and for the most part attended our every need. 
4. The GREENS were out of bounds good!!!! I wanted to order 2 pints of the broth and just drink it. ( I mean you could cure a hang over, probably cancer, cold or the flu with this stuff)

Cons:

1. Brisket and pork on the 3 meat platter were reheated or held too long. They almost tasted like someone heated them up in a sautée pan and burnt it. Watery but not moist if that makes sense. 

2. Mac n cheese was extremely grainy? Maybe the béchamel too thick or too cool when cheese was added? Not sure but extremely grainy. Edible but missing the smooth finish it should have. 
3. Rib tips were very dry. I work in the barbecue world and know just how temperamental rib tips can be so here's my advice; after smoking them you should steam them or braise them for a couple hours real slow. When I think rib tips I think moist, tender and cost effective money saver and still getting my rib action on.  

When I'm back in Phoenix area I will be sure to stop in for some dynamite wings. Good cold beer, whiskey by the glass full and good times. Thanks for the wonderful time and having the Super Bowl on for me to watch."}
{"text":"Went to the location on 32nd and Cactus. The ribs are very good and house cole slaw is good. HOWEVER we ordered for 2 and received two very tiny containers of sauce and one very small container of cole slaw. Way over priced. They need to stop being so stingy with there side orders and sauce."}
{"text":"I like the brisket. The street tacos were regular size tacos and not the tiny tortillas. The toppings of the tacos were very fresh and crisp. I would like to try their wings next time. Overall the food was good."}
{"text":"Two stars for the serving staff being so great. I have been there a half dozen times and each time we go the experience is worse than the last. The food is progressively getting worse and the portions smaller. My husband and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"I'm not a big BBQ fan but willing to try it to see if I can develop a taste for it .... This place was pretty dang good in my opinion .. All the meat was tender , not dry like some I've tried... I usually don't like BBQ sauce so even if you don't dip it in sauce it's still good . Not dry or flavorless. ALL the sides were good , couldn't stop nibbling at everything. Cool divey kinda bikerish atmosphere (which we love) .. And there's even a bar ;)"}
{"text":"I didn't go in person - we ordered over the phone and my boyfriend picked it up. We got the family platter but substituted chicken for the hot links. We had a half rack of ribs, pulled chicken, pulled pork and the brisket. I love ribs and slow cook my own - these were just as delicious if not more so. You could taste the smoke but it was subtle and not heavy. I'm not a big fan of brisket but loved it! The chicken and the pork were both great - moist, tender and very tasty. I like that it's smoked, slow cooked and dry rubbed with the bbq sauce on the side. This is definitey going to be a \"go to\" place when we're in the mood for BBQ!!! I only gave it Don't let the exterior deter you from trying this place!!!"}
{"text":"Went to Hammered Hog for the first time last night, although we live right down the road. It was amazing! We tried their jalapeño poppers that were delicious, the Pork Tenderloin sandwich, smoked wings, cheese grits, pulled pork sandwich.... Everything was fabulous! Great service & by looking at the Happy hour menu & drink specials we'll be back!"}
{"text":"Good BBQ nice staff enjoyed hope to try more stuff pulled pork was good  the place is clean & ever thing is new"}
{"text":"Taylor took great care of us and made us feel at home as we watched the USA vs Jamaica Gold Cup semi-final. BBQ was tasty, apps were also good, and the beers were cold! Recommend the potato salad as a side!  The only thing that would have made this visit better was the USA winning, but that was the team's fault! Wouldn't call this place a sports bar, but with the lack of good choices in this part of town, it has to be one of the better places to watch a game....if you want to eat good food during a match."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a bite during a Saturday errands day. Looks like a dive bar from outside but it is really more resto than dive bar. Great BarbQ w western style sauces. Pudding shots were of particular interest to my partner and she loved them. (they serve theirs frozen!)  The BBQ pork is very good, moist and tender smoked just right. The Hammered Dog is very good and you can substitute the Blue Cheese Slaw (Which is good all by itself) on the dog. They have terrific food specials for lunch and for happy hour AND their breakfast items on the menu look amazing!!"}
{"text":"If you like yourself some BBQ this place will curb your cravings. Looks a little sketch from the outside, but the inside is pleasant enough. Family Platter was HUGE and allowed us to taste a little bit of everything. Server was super friendly and helpful."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. Very clean and well laid out restaurant. Kinda a sports bar / BBQ place with great microbrews on draft and awesome BBQ and happy hour choices 2-7 on happy hour high def television everywhere. 

One of my new favorite spots in the area for sure I recommend you check it out. Especially the habanero jelly sausage stuffed jalapeño poppers and blue cheese coleslaw"}
{"text":"Some of the best BBQ I've had in the valley. The smoke on the ribs was great and there was incredible flavor in their hot links. Great environment, friendly staff and good prices."}
{"text":"Perhaps if I were \"hammered\" I would have enjoyed this meal better... I was sorely disappointed in this BBQ spot. I ordered take-out on a Sunday, and when I arrived I felt something was off right away. The place was dead... Not one person in the gigantic dining room, only two people working there sitting at a table looking bored. The bar however was pretty lively, maybe I should have just sat down and had a beer instead of getting food. 

Ribs - all char and fat, barely any meat and extremely overcooked
Pulled pork - lacked flavor and came in a canister of grease
The sides, corn (half a cob is considered a side for two??) Cheese grits, worst I have ever tried, dry and flavorless
Cornbread - perhaps if it was used as a dry sponge
BBQ Sauce - disappointing at best, watered down and we were only given 2 tiny containers (like salsa sides).
Peach Cobbler - canned peaches poured in to a container with a crumble on top

I really don't like writing scathing reviews, but  there was not one redeeming item in our meal. There are tons of great BBQ joints in Phoenix, this is not one."}
{"text":"Worst BBQ I think I have ever had and an empty restaurant should have been a clue. Brisket was not brisket, tasted more like roast beef. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"Bloody mary's were great food was awesome.  Dave and Roxanne ate great people."}
{"text":"I checked this place out recently.  It used to be called the \"Notorious P.I.G.\" but got a name change in the last couple of months.  It's hard to say what changes were made since the name change because inside everything looks the same.   

I ordered a full rack of ribs with sweet potato fries, macaroni and cheese and a corn bread muffin.

I ordered the ribs with the sauce on them.  The ribs fell of the bone and were very tender.   There were two types of sauce on the table, Kansas City and Smokehouse Habenero.  I tried both but was not that excited about either of them. They missed the wow factor.  Now, what does have the wow factor is their sweet potato fries and their macaroni and cheese.  OMG, these both were incredible!  The sweet potato fries are crunchy and delicious.  They are great with ketchup.  The mac and cheese is the best I have ever had.  REALLY!  It was super cheesy and was made with bigger macaroni noodles.  The corn bread muffin was dry.  That was a bummer.

I wish this place had more comfortable chairs in the dining area but the chairs at the bar are comfy so next time maybe I'll eat at the bar.

I was there on a Wednesday and they had live music @ 6:30 in the bar. The band sounded nice.  

I'm giving this place three stars because I am holding out the hope that the rib tips will be better.  I ordered those a lot when this place was Notorious P.I.G.

Worth another shot I'd say."}
{"text":"Went there Friday night. No crowd.  Saw that it was a bar with BBQ not a BBQ place with a bar. That should have been the first clue. Order the rib platter to share with my wife. It was good size that is about all I can say on the positive side. The ribs where mostly fat and gristle, the beef was flavorless and dry. The potato salad was not bad but the blue cheese Cole slaw was just blue cheese dressing poured on top.
Would I  go back? No!! There are to many other very good BBQ places."}
{"text":"We ordered the large, family platter for our family of 3, and the recommendations stated on the menu are accurate - it was WAY too much meat for us!  Our favorite turned out to be the pulled pork, which was absolute, smokey & flavorful, perfection.  The sides are a bit small but everything tastes like home-style cooking.  I did find myself wishing the BBQ sauce had a deeper, darker flavor, which is why only 4 stars, but that's more of a personal preference and they served it on the side. The meat was fantastic."}
{"text":"Delicious food and service was good. Great for a large group of people.  We had family style so we got to try a bit of everything"}
{"text":"My plater of ribs were very well done.  Food was very good and the service was very nice.  I only wish the sides were a little bit bigger, specially if we ordered a big plate if ribs for two.  We were short of mash potatoes and coleslaw."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place on a lazy afternoon and absolutely loved it! The drinks were great I would recommend the moscow mule it comes in a copper mug. Also their food was incredible! We had everything from the wings to the pulled pork and the sandwiches. Everythign was great. The owner was there and was actually our server and she gave us free mousse shots, which were also amazing, that tasted like birthday cake since it was my friends birthday celebration. Overall a great place good service. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Can't believe anyone gives this place a good review.  To me, it is as bad as it gets.  We ordered 3 different meals.  Shredded pork, shredded chicken and ribs, all with 2 sides each.  Chicken and pork were both soggy and tasteless, just thrown on a plated very unappealing.  Ribs were dry and the rub was not properly cooked into them.  It was like eating raw spices.  The barbecue sauce is just average.  Taste store bought.  The cornbread muffin was disgusting.  Totally dry, tasteless and rubbery.  Obviously the batter had been beaten too long.  The baked beans were decent but the mac and cheese was very basic, not much better than Kraft Dinner.  Still searching for a good barbecue place in the north Phoenix area.  Unfortunately, the few that are wonderful, are so far away.  If you have any suggestions, please do tell.  Definitely stay away from this hole."}
{"text":"The food was awesome. We had the street tacos as an appetizer and I was surprised at how good the smoked pork was. My friends and I shared the family sized platter. It was humongous! We took some home. The smoked ribs tasted so good and fell of the bone. The selection of draft beer was okay but a little pricey for being common domestic. I would love to see more microbrews and more than just pale ales. The server wasn't the most friendly, seemed a little put out having customers coming in close to closing time. I'd still recommend the restaurant based on the food. It could be better with nicer servers."}
{"text":"Wow... I must have caught this place on a bad night based on all the other reviews - I would have given them 1 star had it not been for the fact that the staff was very friendly. 

First, I eat a LOT of BBQ all over the country and so I consider myself a little bit of pro. I wondered how this place had got its name until I ate here and now I realize you really should be hammered first.

I ordered a 1/2 rack of ribs and a side of brisket and collard greens - the brisket was dryer than a popcorn fart and not only was it way too smoky but I think they used old pallets or maybe a tire for the smoke. 

The ribs were absolutely horrid. First, I LOVE tender, fall-off-the-bone pork ribs. That in mind, these were horribly overlooked and the quality of the ribs was horrible as well - if these were from an actual Pig, it was the Wilford Brimely of pigs... TONS of fat, very little meat and I swear every time I bit down I heard some gravelly voice say \"DIABEETUSS\". Just Really, Really horrible, mushy, fat-filled, greasy, ribs. 

I ordered Collard Greens and they were swimming in orange, greasy water and the taste had been boiled right out of them.

Even the corn-bread was dry and flavorless. 

Like I said the staff seemed nice and the restaurant looked clean inside. You simply need to be hammered if you're gonna eat their Hog."}
{"text":"Went here for my husband's birthday, just because it was close and had tvs for the game.
Upon walking in thr place stunk like sewage.
I ordered the bbq pulled chix sandwich with cowboy beans and grilled corn. The bun ended up being soggy, the chicken was tasteless, the beans tasted like liquid smoke but the corn was good. 
Maybe I just dont like bbq....first and last time going to this place."}
{"text":"Awesome food and friendly clean atmosphere. The weekend free breakfast definitely got me going there but everything on the menu is really good and verry fairly priced"}
{"text":"We hit this place around 2pm on a Saturday. Sat on the \"saloon side\" (which we think should have some swinging doors separating it from the restaurant side to lend an air of authenticity).

Oddly enough, this place has happy hour 7 days a week. So, we decided to order a selection of things from the HH menu. Sliders, taquitos (wrapped in a \"pastry dough\"? not a corn tortilla), poppers (which are cream cheese filled AND wrapped in bacon), wings (smoked then sauced), and street tacos (again, not a corn tortilla). We covered all the bases; brisket (sliders), pork (various) and links (also sliders). Have to say - everything had a nice smoke to it. Good smoke ring, good flavor without being too cloying. 

I tend to like my hot suace with a kick, so poured on a bit of Habanero sauce. The sauce wasn't bad at all - but no hint of habanero to be found. Maybe it was labeled wrong. 

The \"fruity\" dipping sauces that some items come with - we weren't impressed with, as neither of us like our BBQ sweet. 

The bar staff is attentive, and knowledgeable. Good at orders too. Jen took our entire order, with our modifications and requests - without writing anything down, and got it all right!  Nice job. 

Beer selection is good, with plenty of indy and microbrews represented. Many are available as HH offerings. You can even get PBR in a can for a buck if it's that kinda day...

If you are a bourbon drinker, you'll be happy here. Nothing too spectacular, but they have a decent selection of small batch stuff and Jack single barrel stuff (yes I realize Jack is NOT bourbon). 

On Sundays, you can get a free breakfast with a beverage ordered. So, might be a great place to catch a race or game on TV (they have some nice falt panels on both sides of the place), sip some mimosas or Mary's and have a bite to eat. 

What kinda BBQ is it? Depends. Seems the owner has grown up with a variety of styles - so there's a bit of Carolina, some Texas, some KC...you'll probably find something you like!

Happy Hour grub will run you $4 an item, with beers less than that. If you are looking for some good smoked food, and a nice selection of bevs to wash it down with - definitely hit this place up. You'll find it behind the Jiffy Lube, on the East side of the street."}
{"text":"Since this place is kind of a dive, I was hoping it would have killer BBQ but alas I can only give it 2 stars. The sauces offered fell short of expectations. I ordered the brisket and felt it was a bit dried out. I liked the blue cheese cole slaw though. Our server was good and the food arrived promptly. Probably wouldn't go back unless it was for drinks."}
{"text":"Placed order for pick-up. Order was completed in a timely manner and was hot when we picked it up. When we got home and unpacked the meal I was disappointed. My husbands enchiladas looked and smelled delicious. He didn't comment on them which means they were good. My meal however was blah. The French fries were soggy baked from frozen( I could have done that at home). The coleslaw had a nice kick to it with crisp cabbage and not too much dressing, however iceberg lettuce was mixed in as filler which was disappointing.  The rib plate I got looked good for a half rack. The meat was tender and done however the smell was less than ok. There was waaaaay to much smoke used and the stink was overwhelming and was all I could taste. I couldn't taste the seasoning they put on the ribs at all or the meat itself. The barbeque sauce tasted like Famous Daves barbeque sauce in the blue bottle with ketchup added to it. I am not sure how Hammered Hog got a 2015 top review for best of.... I was disappointed, I expected more. We will not go back."}
{"text":"The ribs are the reason to come to this place. The potato skins were okay, but had spent a bit too long in the freezer. Service is friendly. Ambiance dominated by televisions playing Fox News, which I detest. Lots of room."}
{"text":"Went here over the weekend and my wife and I were very disappointed. We ordered the 3 meat platter opting for two orders of brisket and one order of pulled pork. The brisket was like eating string leather (very tough). This is by far the worst brisket I've eaten in the valley. The pork one the other hand was good. The ambience was nice and quiet though which is a plus in my book. Two stars is what it's worth. If you can't make a decent brisket then there's no hope."}
{"text":"I got the family platter to-go,everything was room temp when I got home.i know it's to go but I live 1 mile away so I figure it would stay hot.not a fan of microwaving the food I just brought home.dont get me wrong the ribs were alright and the pulled pork was decent.but I would not suggest getting take out"}
{"text":"I have eaten here twice and have not been disappointed. I love any BBQ place that has collard greens; they are delicious! The ribs fall off the bone and they like to spice things up. Their habanero BBQ sauce is very good. Overall, the place is quiet. They have a decent happy hour that goes from 2:00 pm to 7:00 pm. They have a decent selection of draft beers, with some local brews. I will definitely come back here again."}
{"text":"Consider the Hammered Hog to be a sports bar that serves good BBQ or a BBQ joint that just happens to have an unusual number of high definition televisions. Either way, it's a pretty good choice. On our most recent Monday dinner time visit, the Hammered Hog was definitely a BBQ restaurant. We had the restaurant to ourselves when we arrived, which could have been very worrisome if we were not familiar with the place, but it was mostly full by the time we left. All couples. Mostly middle aged. Not a sports bar demographic at all. Arrive at another time, you might find a bar crowd.

This building was remodeled in recent years when the Hammered Hog moved south from its previous smaller location. The restaurant still feels fresh and clean inside, even though the exterior screams, \"I was built in the 70's,\" which I'm guessing it was. Don't be off put by outside appearances. Come on inside. It's nicer than you'd expect. The dining room is long and narrow, perhaps less than ideal, featuring tall bar style tables near the entrance and lower dining tables toward the back. The bar, the focal point of the room, features a large variety of beers.

On this particular night we ordered a sandwich, the Sammie, which features pulled meat of your choice and one side for $7.50. Tonight's choice was pulled chicken. The bun was fresh and the chicken tender. We opted to add our own BBQ sauce at the table, but they will toss it in the kitchen if you prefer. We actually like to blend the hot and mild sauces together, a significant violation of BBQ etiquette I'm sure, but you do what you have to do. Our second entrée was the BBQ platter with one meat and two sides for $12. We opted for pulled pork. The pork was very generously portioned and deliciously prepared. Leftovers were taken home. 

We loved two out of three sides that were served  at our table. \"I'd come back just for the baked beans,\" was one comment. The corn on the cob was also nicely prepared. The potato salad, however, while seemingly fresh and well prepared, was a bit bland. The corn bread that came with the platter was moist and tasty.

Throw in a friendly server, all in all a very good experience. It's only a bit of BBQ snobbery, I guess, that prevents me from awarding five stars. Consider it a strong four, perhaps open to an upgrade after a future visit."}
{"text":"Awesome BBQ/food clean bright and plenty if TV's! Great deals on HH senior's and breakfast on the weekends :)"}
{"text":"Nice, themed, friendly restaurant/bar. The bartender was also serving at the same time yet did a great and courteous job. The food was delicious and although we missed out on the 50c wings, they were awesome at happy hour price. We haven't really tried smoked/buffalo before...at least at that awesome blend. We will definitely return often as newbies to this side of town."}
{"text":"The first thing you need to know is that I moved to Arizona from Texas and I love me some barbecue!  You might even call me a barbecue snob...

On our first visit we ordered the family platter.  It was a huge amount of food and a good value for the price.  The ribs were the hands-down winner of the meat taste test.  They were hefty and delicious, but lacked the super smoky flavor I have become accustomed to and love so much.  You may order the the ribs with or without sauce. The hot links were delicious, but not unlike hot links I have had everywhere else.  Not an item that set most barbecue joints apart from one another, in my opinion.  The pulled pork and chopped brisket came in last due the the sogginess and lack of flavor.  Yes I want my meat to be moist, but I don't want it to have flavorless water-like juice seeping from it as I pile it onto soft, delicious white bread meant to soak up greasy, fatty meat drippings.  The sides were also hit or miss.  The cornbread was good, but nothing special.  The collard greens were okay, but decidedly bitter.  The macaroni and cheese was tasty and unique.  It used mediums shells rather than elbow noodles and the cheese sauce was rich and creamy.  It reheated wonderfully.  The hush puppies were AWESOME!  Possibly the best I've eaten in a restaurant.  

Our second visit was better because we stuck to the items that we liked the best from our previous trip.  We got a rack of ribs with, you guessed it, macaroni and cheese and hush puppies. There were all as enjoyable as we had remembered.  This time we had to try the oreo balls.  They were great, but you could get a pack of fudge dipped oreos and enjoy virtually the same flavor for a much lower price.

Main thing to remember about the Hog is: You don't want to leave without eating, at least a few, hush puppies!"}
{"text":"There are times when people have referred to another person's review and said, \"So-and-So said it all, I really have nothing to add.\" 

Well, in this case, it is literally literal. 

Daren C said pretty much what I would have said, as far as an objective description of the place and what went down. 

http://www.yelp.com/biz/hammered-hog-bbq-hall-and-saloon-phoenix#hrid:tVZ6FRcn8Osi0QsJT4beNQ 

However, I have to part from my wise brother in my rating. Although I believe we felt the same about the fact that the meat had a really good, smokey flavor, it was too greasy for me to enjoy that flavor. The bottom of the bun sponged up so much that it was soaked, and a light squeeze produced a stream and puddle. Eww. 

The meat and sauce had good flavor, so there's potential, but the grease just overpowered it so much, and I fear the repercussions that may be to come."}
{"text":"Had HHog deliver which was very cool they do. We ordered on line and it said 1.5 hours for delivery. Our food arrived in 30 min and it was fantastic. Ribs, pulled pork, brisket, cole slaw, blue cheese cole slaw and fries. Everything was very fresh! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Finally! A real BBQ place in Phoenix. The hammered hog is the one of those places where you just want to hang out all day and stuff your face. Amazing food with all different types of BBQ and some amazing homemade creations, (the smoked pork tamales are killer!) my kids love it and I also love hanging out at the bar when they aren't with me. You have to check this place out!"}
{"text":"I love BBQ, I have a big green egg smoker and I love to smoke my own meat and my friends think it is pretty good so I have become a smoked meat snob. I also travel for work and have eaten BBQ all across the country and I highly recommend the Hammered Hog! I had the rib sandwich (never thought of pulling the meat off the bones and putting in a bun) and it was delicious. Smoked just right, flavorful sauce and just enough to fill me up. I also had the cowboy beans. Loaded with just enough smoky flavor and smoked meat to make them \"lip smakin good\". I am so glad that I made a u-turn to have lunch in this Phoenix restaurant. The staff is extremely friendly, met the owner and was waited on by the owners daughter so it is a family operation. I will be back again!"}
{"text":"Tinder fall of the bone ribs! I had the ribs plater choosing the pulled pork as the other meat with collard greens and potato salad as my sides. Loved all of it including the corn bread that came with. The meats don't come pre sauced unless requested and though they are super tinder they are very bland without the sauce.  Both the hot and mild bbq sauces are yummy.

I ordered to-go in the restaurant and the server/bartender was super helpful. Aaaand if you just so happen to end up doing a hard break and your food goes flying in the car....well their food is packaged well"}
{"text":"We've been here a few times but have never had the ribs until this visit. WOW ! Unbelievably awesome. I've had a lot of ribs from other places and these were some of the best I've had. Really enjoyed the smokehouse habanero sauce. 

Well done, Hammered Hog !"}
{"text":"This is a great place for pulled pork, ribs, whatever smoked meats you like. They truly smoke the meat & it shows in the quality. The ribs are as tender and meaty as they come. Great Mac & Cheese for a side. Beer is cold & service is prompt and friendly."}
{"text":"I love the Hog and the owners are awesome. I have been coming here for a while I have to say I love the ribs & fries its the only reason I come there. The drink selection is not bad either."}
{"text":"I took my grandsons and their Mother, to the Hammered Hog BBQ Hall & Saloon. My first indication of trouble, was the legal sized typed paper menu. Then I had to beg for water, but the drinks (including those from both the Bar and Soda fountain) came fast. One of the drinks ordered was a Sprite (by one of my Grandsons) and it tasted horrible. Their Mother told me this happens when they don't clean out and replace the soda pack? The waitress insisted that this was the way their Sprite tasted? We ordered, from the starter menu, ribs and nacho chips with pulled pork. I sampled the boys plates of ribs. True, it fell off the bone but somehow tasted like dish liquid to me. My nacho chips were OK, but again, the pork tasted like dishliquid. Then there were flies buzzing around our glasses, and of course, food. I had to chase down the waitress to ask for our bill. I told her, after taking one bite of our plates, we weren't happy with the taste. Her reply: \"Oh well, you still have to pay.\" She got kinda angry when I complained about the flies. Again, her response \"Well, they come in every time the front door is opened!\"

I had purchased a $100 coupon for $40 from restaurant.com for this place. I'm all for supporting small, local businesses.  But this was the pits for us. I'm calling Restaurant.com about either exchanging my coupon or getting a refund."}
{"text":"Surprisingly bad.  I really wanted to like it too."}
{"text":"Fantastic BBQ!! And the prices are ridiculous. On Saturday and Sunday they offer a FREE breakfast with the purchase of a drink. Got to love it. Oh, and $1 PBRs. Life is good when you know where to get BBQ"}
{"text":"Stopped for a happy hour drink or two but so put off by one of the bartender's attitudes that we left after one drink. One bartender was friendly but offered nothing extra as far as a bit of conversation but the more interesting was the other bartender who we think was an owner. We asked about the 'free' breakfast they offer on Sunday's if you buy a 'non-alcoholic drink' and she acted insulted and uninterested that others offer a different special and then went Into detail telling us what a 'good deal' their special was...interesting since we wanted a couple drinks and not a dissertation. Uncomfortable all around and we left after one drink. Doesn't sound bad but we look for something welcoming and relaxing. This isn't the place for that level of comfort.  Can't speak to the food."}
{"text":"We met some friends and family for dinner last week at the Hammered Hog.  This is a pretty standard BBQ joint with the additional upside being the full bar and selection of Arizona beers.

The service was very good, we had both a waitress and bartender look in on us frequently.  My wife and I split the $30 family platter, which came with pulled pork, brisket, baby back ribs and hot links.  All the the barbecue was very good.  Whoever runs the smoker knows what they are doing, everything was tender and smokey.  My wife really loved the hot links but they could have been spicier for my taste.  The real letdown was the side dishes.  The platter came with a choice of 4 and we ordered mashed potatoes, collard greens, mac & cheese and hush puppies.  The hush puppies we bland and greasy and the bachamel in the mac & cheese was broken. The mashed potatoes were marginal but the greens were pretty good.  The table also ordered onion rings and jalapeno poppers. The rings were huge but flavorless and oily however the poppers were really good.  Be warned though, they were very spicy.

I'd definitely return for the barbecue but I think I'll pass on the sides next time, with an exception to the collard greens."}
{"text":"I am a little late posting this review. Our visit was in July. My Mom and sister and I were out shopping and got way hungry and thirsty. We felt like barbeque and Yelped the closest location. The Hammered Hog won out...darn it. This was not a good experience. The drinks were OK. My Mom had that huge bloody Mary which she deemed as good. My sister had an IPA and I had ice tea. Also good. So, why the two stars? Obviously the food. The ribs were DISGUSTING. They were dry and overcooked. Seriously bad. The server/bartender didn't get a darn at all when we pointed this out as we ordered second drinks. She shrugged her shoulders. Seriously bad. My sister and I both had the Hammered Hog sandwich. It is a pulled pork bbq sandwich covered in slaw and bleu cheese. Sounds great! Wasn't. Again, the meat was overcooked and really had no flavor. The fries, slaw, and cowboy beans were all pretty blah too. I'm guessing that many of the four star reviews are from regulars and/or people who got lucky enough to have fresh meat. We probably won't give it a second chance because there are too many other barbeque places to try and too many other barbeque places that give a damn about quality.

I did want to say that their sauces were good! I think they were homemade."}
{"text":"Iced tea was watered down, bad,  But food is very good, and not expensive, especially happy hour.  Try the jalapeno poppers!  The owner is good looking too, but I didn't hit on her as I hear she has a mean biker boyfriend.  Too bad.  I will be back for HH."}
{"text":"BBQ awesomeness!! Love the specialty BBQ sauces and the homey feel. Started out with drinks and some appetizers the amazing jalapeno poppers and cocoa-cola taquitos both with habanero pineapple jelly---YUMMY!!!! Tried the Poppin' Mary- bloodymary on overload so full of flavor and came with eye full of fixings. We also ordered a family platter plenty of food for a group of 5 and was able to try different things. Everything was so delicious but the best was  the St. Louis loin back ribs so tender and falling off the bone!! Even has NFL ticket and great specials throughout the week. So glad i found this place. Family friendly too!"}
