{"text":"The pizza is excellent, but the few times we have ordered delivery from here the food has arrived 30-40 minutes later than the latest delivery time estimate. Weather and road conditions were not an issue. We will not be ordering from here again."}
{"text":"I ordered a large pizza, a veggie wedgie, an eggplant parmesan sandwich, and a Greek salad for delivery. Delivery was about 10 minutes behind the time-frame I was given online. The delivery driver also called me as he was standing in front of my house. I could see him dialing his phone on the sidewalk. That was weird. Also, the tab was near $45 - not cheap.  I was very disappointed in the food. The salad was packaged separately from the hot stuff - always a plus. The salad was the best thing I ordered, so I was very glad that it wasn't warm. There was nothing special about the salad, the tomatoes were boring, but it's not exactly tomato season. The lettuce was fresh and that's the most important thing. The Greek dressing that came with my Greek salad came in pouches, so not home-made, but it was good anyway.   Eggplant parmesan is on their menu with their Classic Subs and without a description. The chicken parmesan sandwich says it comes topped with cheese. Stands to reason the eggplant would too. Also, I've ordered a lot of eggplant parmesan sandwiches in my time & I have never been served such a disappointment. The eggplant was breaded and fried, but there was no indication that this eggplant had ever been crispy. The marinara sauce was unexciting and the whole thing was just soft and blah.   The wedgie was sad. Pathetic really. The dressing that came with this item was also in plastic pouches. Sadly, these pouches contained much more boring dressing. These poor little pouches never had a chance of saving this wedgie. The veggies were in short supply and the cheese was sparse and tasteless.   I thought I'd review the pizza last because there seemed to be a generally positive vibe regarding the pizza here. I didn't want to lose my audience right out of the gate. The pizza didn't even make it to mediocre by any standard of mine. I'm a bit of a pizza snob, maybe it's just me. The crust was chewy and yummy. That's the only nice thing there is to say about the pizza that arrived at my door. Missing were the mountains of cheese that other reviewers mentioned (sometimes unhappily). Of course, the cheese wasn't any good, so mountains of it might have been just as icky. The fresh mushrooms were acceptable - a little thick to be a great pizza topping. They were much more generous with the green olives, too generous. Nothing special at all. Absolutely not worth $13.  The food here is soft and boring. I won't bother trying them again."}
{"text":"Their Buffalo Chicken Pizza inspired me to finish med school. No, this story doesn't make sense. Especially if you're sober right now. I will reiterate the fact that this place is hands down THE BEST PIZZA IN OAKLAND. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Decent pizza. Wings were a little dry, but I'll chalk it up to a bad batch. Sauce was good. still looking for a slice of NY in the 'Burgh though."}
{"text":"I've spent the past year trying a new pizza place once a week or so...I've arrived at Say Cheese as the best pizza in Oakland...not greasy, fast delivery, good customer service, not much more you can ask for."}
{"text":"Nothing spectacular about this place. It's just a average take out pizza place, not bad not great. However, the delivery time was fast. I ordered the onion petals and was disappointed. The pizzas we got were average."}
{"text":"Good pizza but even better breadsticks. Also, they included a packet of pepper flakes which was a nice touch. Definitely glad I branched out and tried this place."}
{"text":"I've never really taken the time to review a place before so this is my first. Let me start by saying I'm kind of a pizza savant and have tried a lot of pizza places around Pittsburgh. You're never going to find the best pizza place in Pittsburgh because pizza is so subjective but if you order from here you will not be disappointed. The staff is courteous, polite and friendly. Their delivery is timely and usually much faster than what they initially tell you. Their food is excellent. The pizza sauce is flavorful and the pizzas are delicious. So far I've tried their Hawaiian and BBQ chicken pizzas and both are excellent. If you're looking for something new give this place a try and I'm certain you'll enjoy it"}
{"text":"On a whim, we ordered from Say Cheese Pizza during the Penguins playoff game. Did not have high hopes because we have never had good luck with pizza delivery in Southside. Let me just say.... It took less than 30 minutes to get our food and everything was delicious. From the cheese pizza to the pepperoni roll and the Italian sub, everything was excellent. In addition, we ordered the tiramisu and the carrot cake. Again, I did not have high hopes for the dessert, but . . . OMG! Both desserts were moist, fresh and delicious. Not what i ever expected. Way to knock it out of the park!"}
{"text":"I have been buying from this place since they opened because they were right by both of the places that I lived. The delivery driver tonight called saying my food was there, I said I\"d buzz him in if he could just bring it up. He said no, I said, \"I'm not really dressed to come down.\" (and in all honesty had been having an asthma attack for awhile and didn't need to be running the stairs) he said, \"then get dressed and come get it.\" So I asked for a return and he said \"call the shop'. So I called and they forced him to bring it up. now I don't trust it's clean because he sat out there in the car for 10 mins before he brought it up. He tells me he brought it up out of respect for his manager and told me to fuck off and never order from there again. I called and complained, they said he'd be fired but it's doubtful. I have NEVER received treatment like this anywhere. They refused to give me a refund. I asked for his name so I could not get him again, but I doubt I will be buying from there anymore. Which is a shame, I always liked the old owners (Don't know who owns them now that would allow that kind of bullshit.)"}
{"text":"Lived in Oakland for 5 years and this is by far my favorite take out. Calzones, hoagies, pizza it's all quacktastic. I want to be in college again just so I could eat there. Love to order it hung over with a two liter of sprite. Grant hill drinks sprite too"}
{"text":"ordered food, was quoted 40 min and it came in about 35-40 min. fries were good and cheese sauce was pretty tasty, i ordered that and a hoagie. both were really delicious, i dont have anything negative to say about this place,if i wanted to be picky id say the 40 min delivery based off of the fact i live less then a mile away is sorta questionable, but regardless i was happy and enjoyed my food. id def go there for a late night bite"}
{"text":"While living in Pittsburgh for a year, I would order from Say Cheese Pizza about twice a month, and frequent it often when I am back in town.  I still havent tried the Pizza, but I would recommend the Calzone as it is one of the best I have ever had.  I get it with Sausage, Pepperoni, Pineapple, and Ham.  Every time they laugh, but every time it has come out tasting great.  I order these often, and have to say out of all cities I have been to, they have had the best one.  If your looking to try a new pizza place, you have to give these guys a try."}
{"text":"I have to say, I wasn't really impressed.  This place has been on our work radar for some time now and I can see why we didn't order from here prior.  The menu is pretty straight forward and typical for a pizza delivery place in the city.  Many items are just repeats of other places competing for your buck.  Ordering and delivery were pretty basic and easy.  Our food however wasn't all that great.  I wasn't feeling quite as hungry as my coworkers and ordered their cheddar bacon fries.  By the time they got here I knew I overpaid for this item.  Barely a large sized fry covered with cheese and bacon that was chewy, not crispy.  The fries appeared to be fresh cut, but I could be wrong there.  Most of the bacon I had to take off the fries because there was no taste and like I said it was chewy.  My coworkers decided to try their lasagna calzone.  According to one, it wasn't the best and they said they needed to make a trip to the bathroom shortly after as he claims there was far too much oil on and in this thing.  I doubt that we will be ordering from here again anytime soon."}
{"text":"I've had pizza from Say Cheese! quite a few times and was always floored by how tasty it was.  Believe me, I've had a fairly extensive sampling of different pizzas from all over Pittsburgh as a college student at CMU, and Say Cheese! was hands down the best pizza I had in my four years there, if not in my whole life (but then again I've never had pizza in NYC or Chicago, so... EXCUSE MOI if you happen to be a pizza snob).   Every part of their pizzas taste fresh and delicious, and I especially love the crust of their traditional pizzas -- thick and doughy.  They have pan and Sicilian pizzas, calzones, and lots of other offerings on their menu, too.  Their prices are also very budget friendly, and they have free delivery!  And I just looked at their website and it looks like they now accept PlaidCash (CMU dining bucks).  WHAT.  I wish I were back in college.  Okay, not really.  But I'd definitely stop by Say Cheese! if I'm ever in da Burgh again.  Nom nom."}
{"text":"I ordered a chicken salad from this place last night and it was below average. The chicken was warm, but definitely not hot. And the french fries on the salad were cold.   While the portion size was quite large, it was     a very poor product. The only reason I ordered from this place is because it is pretty cheap (even cheaper with a coupon code on Grubhub), but it definitely wasn't worth the $7 I paid."}
{"text":"I use to live in Pittsburgh PA.  Hands down their pan pizza is prob the best pan pizza I have ever had.  I miss this place.  I am glad they are still kick'n it in my old hood.  I have turned so many people on to this place.  They also have yummy salads."}
{"text":"I was excited to finally try this place but I'll never come back. Pizzas small and nothing special. But way overpriced. You'd be better walking up the street to Antoons or sorrentos for a better, bigger pizza and spend about half as much. Also got nachos and the cheese sauce was cold. Not sure how this place stays in business."}
{"text":"Ordered from Say Cheese for the first time this past weekend. We got two salads (the Mandarin and the Steak) and some cheese sticks. The cheese sticks tasted like the frozen variety so not horrible, but it was sort of like, \"Really?\" My boyfriend didn't like the chicken in his Mandarin salad, said he would've preferred it grilled, but he liked the dressing and the rest of the toppings. My steak salad was fab. I'd get it again.  I think the food is mediocre to good, but what gets them 4 stars is the service. We got our food delivered and it was there in a totally reasonable time. You know how with delivery guys/gals it seems to either be stoner college kids or some rude asshat? Total opposite with Say Cheese. The delivery guy was very nice, polite, and friendly. I mean, really - this shouldn't even be a thing I complain about, but I've had so many bad experiences with delivery people that I dread going to the door to meet them. So props to you Say Cheese."}
{"text":"I finally tried their food and it was a good thing to do. Descent pizza and good selection of dessert!"}
{"text":"I just had the worst pizza I've ever tasted from this place.  Many other reviewers seem to concentrate on how good the service is.  The service is good, they delivered my pizza within 25 minutes, but I can't imagine how they could have done a worse job making it.  The chicken tasted like it was irresponsibly old.  I'm glad other people thought it was good but I will not be going back.  Me and a roommate got a pizza planning to split it.  We got about 1/3 of the way through, couldn't finish, and now he is laying on the couch with a sick stomach and I am dissatisfied enough to write my first review of any business.  My other roommate asked me to throw the remaining 2/3 of the pizza in the outside trashcan because it smelled so horrible. I would've given it zero stars if that was possible."}
{"text":"I ate here for the first time today, and i will never go back. I called in and ordered a medium pizza with sausage, olives, mushrooms and onions. The guy told me that they were out of mushrooms- we said fine, we will just have the three other toppings then. When we got home, the pizza didn't have onions on it.. just olives. But we still got charged for the onions?! On top of that, the crust and bread were so undercooked; it tasted like barely cooked dough. The bread was so chewy and wet like it has been sitting out for hours. It truly did taste raw. There was also SO much cheese on the pizza- a disgusting amount. With the cheese sitting on the undercooked dough, it slid right off in giant clumps whenever we went to pick up a piece. I can honestly say that this was the worst pizza I have ever had in my life. Such a disappointment when you're hungry and craving a delicious, fully cooked pizza!!"}
