{"text":"Food I would give a 5 stars. Excellent burger!Waitress I would give 2 stars. She was not friendly, nor polite. Were were there later, maybe she was having a bad night?  She looked at us like we were inconveniencing her. She should get a job that doesn't require customer service."}
{"text":"The mac and cheese here is str8 garb. What was going through their minds when they decided to put potato chips in it?  Whenever I eat mac and cheese I always think, \"You know what this is missing? Potato Chips.\" Who's mans is this?!?!"}
{"text":"Good atmosphere and service for the most part. I go for the turkey burger best one around. Not alot of bars have them."}
{"text":"Traveling with the family and stopped for dinner and to watch USA defeat japan for the Women's World Cup. Great neighborhood bar. Good service and great food."}
{"text":"Very disappointed tonight in the food here. As my husband said, \"It's obvious who ever created the menu and does the daily prep put in a great deal of effort and care. It's a shame the night shift doesn't give a damn. Only thing the night shift knows how to do is run a deep fryer. Everything else is either prepped too fast for the wait staff, then dries out under heat lamps, or it was half assed and it shows they don't pickup where the daily prep left off.\" Not sure we will come back even though we had good experiences before this."}
{"text":"Ok, food here was good.  Got a Greek Pita, adding on the cheddar cheese and pita. Service was slow. We were seated, I went to the bathroom and came back and no drink orders were taken.  We sat on the patio.  While we were out there, one of my dining companions got bit by what we think was a fire ant.  The bites were not on her arm before we sat down.    I think I should've took it as a warning when the sign said need managers, servers, cooks, etc."}
{"text":"This gives me mixed feelings. While I had the Cheese Steak, which was phenomenal, and the nachos were decent, the waitress I had was not as good. Not the friendliest attitude at all, and when I asked for a refill, I never got it. Other than that, the food was good and lot's of TV's. Seems like a good sports bar, but definitely not the greatest"}
{"text":"I really enjoy the atmosphere and the prices are not bad at all. They have great lunch specials. We have also have had several events by renting the back bar area. Cant wait to go back."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place based on reviews. Was told the patio was full, without hostess even checking. Half of the patio was empty, which we saw when walking in from the parking lot. I've worked good service and could understand if wait staff coverage was thin, but as we waited 15 min for someone to seat us, I noticed there were only 4 tables seated inside and about 8 waiters running around-so no problem with coverage. This is lousy service and I wouldn't give my money to place like this. Never going back and would not recommend to anyone, unless you want to me made to feel that you aren't allowed to go here. If I could give less than 1 star, I sure would."}
{"text":"Excellent place! We had a group of close to 30 people and they handled us with no problems. They have a separate room for larger parties and a large parking lot across the street for extra parking. The food was excellent as well and the prices weren't unreasonable.   I highly recommend this restaurant for large parties."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Santa fe spring rolls are the bomb.com  and I really enjoy that they give you the option of taking any of the sandwiches and making it a wrap.  Food is fresh and service was superb.  We'll definitely be back"}
{"text":"Great place and the patio they added is amazing for the space. The Neptune (fried fish) was very good.  Salad was fresh and service is always attentive.  Recommend the place."}
{"text":"Not a bad place, but I dont consider it a \"great sports bar\". I had a reuben, it was pretty good. However, the mac n' cheese needs a new recipe. Not much taste with it."}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this establishment, and I was very impressed to say the least. They just opened their new bar/patio addition and it is really one of the nicest in the area, The bar is not on amain road, so the environment is really relaxing. They have yet to get their audio and video systems installed, but they were not missed on this beautiful Mother's day. We had a few appetizers and the avocado dip was fantastic. Great Martini bar as well as great selection of microbrews. I will be back to try one of their burgers, that were getting served to many of the customers around me. The bartender and servers seemed to approach their work with enjoyment."}
{"text":"I went to this Gem of a Sports Bar last night.  The waitress, Lisa, was extremely helpful with the menu and cocktails.  I had the Steak House Salad with Vidalia Onion Dressing.  The steak was perfect and the dressing was really good without an extreme onion taste.  The lighting in the bar area was a little bright, but not overpowering.  Lots of TV's for sports.  This is defiantly on my \"return\" list for Sports Bars."}
{"text":"You need to come and try this bar that isn't on a normal street corner. The wife and I stopped in for late night dinner and boy did they deliver. I have not had bar food this diverse, unique, and tasty in a long time. I will be coming back for more."}
{"text":"Sorry guys, this place was a significant letdown for us.  My wife and i went a few weeks back, to celebrate her birthday.  We were in the mood for appetizers and wings and had heard good things about the place.  In addition to a few drinks, we ordered three menu items: potato twisters, salad, wings.  A server had passed us by with a couple of Long Island Ice Tea's that looked good, so we decided to give them a try.  Alcohol content was fine, but there were super, syrupy sweet making it hard to find them refreshing.  The potato twisters are kind of like a nacho platter made with a base of curly potatoes (not really fries exactly) covered with cheese, tomatoes, sour cream, etc.  The potatoes had a burnt oil taste making them less than appealing.  The salad we split was quite good, covered in a tangy (almost zippy) gorgonzola vinaigrette dressing and a nice selection of veggies.  Lastly was the wings, which we ordered buffalo style.  Two issues there...not enough sauce, and some of the wings were so large that they were underdone in the center.  Not the meal we were hoping for, maybe it was just an off night?"}
{"text":"Great place to eat. Fun atmosphere, extremely friendly staff, and very reasonably priced. This place is a diamond in the rough and we can't believe we didn't try it earlier. We absolutely recommend this place.  Get the potato chips!"}
{"text":"Great service every single time we've stopped in! Food and drinks are both delicious! Patio is awesome and a great friendly Atmosphere! Definitely has become a go to place to eat!"}
{"text":"Great bar to watch a game, especially if you are a Steelers fan like me.  Friendly atmosphere and people are respectful.  Nick, the owner, is a warm and welcoming guy.  This bar doesn't look like much outside but the inside is very nice not to mention spacious.  Large outdoor patio with a TV.  I ordered the pulled pork sandwich with bourbon bbq sauce and it was very good.  Skin-on french fries loved the malt vinegar bath I gave them.  Cool spot."}
{"text":"Great service, awesome burger. Wife had grilled chicken sandwich, and was best she had in a long time. Cold beers, tons of TV's and good friends. Recipe for a great night."}
{"text":"Minute we walked in to minute we walked out A+++. Kids loved Food.  Adults loved Food.  Will be back 100%.  Great service."}
{"text":"The steak was great, but the California wrap was a little on the dry side. Overall the fries were good the vegetables were fresh. Can't complain too much"}
{"text":"Great menu and service. Food is good and not just your typical bar food. Love, love, love the patio!"}
{"text":"Our waitress was really good and paid great attention to our needs. The potato spirals were awesome and my burger was cooked exactly how I ordered it. Fries are extra crispy.  They got us in and out pretty quick. They always look busy from the outside but has plenty of seating and tvs."}
{"text":"Every time I go in there I'm always happy with the service and the food.  They have great specials.   I just bought a j b dollar deal, spend $10.00 get $20.00 worth of food and drink.   The new bar / patio is beautiful.    Lots of parking as well."}
{"text":"This place is the go to for my girlfriend and I.  Been here multiple times and have never had a complaint.  The food is amazing and the patio is a great place to have a drink.  Highly recommend rivals to everyone!"}
{"text":"It was simple for me to give this place and its staff a 5 stars. Amazing management and bartenders along with very good food with ample selection of beer. Can't go wrong when looking for a great place to catch a game or have dinner with friends. Thanks to Nikki, Johanna and Rachel for making my evening that much special . Enjoy!"}
{"text":"So, I'm not usually a sports bar person, however, this place makes me appreciate the concept.   Rivals is off of Smith Road in Middleburg Heights, and looks quite small from the outside...  It's not.   The place is very large and has a patio outside that's massive. And for a big place, with lots of food and drink choices, I have to say, it's prices are really good, the staff is nice, and the food is REALLY great. It's not the typical bar food; wraps and sandwiches of exotic bent, salads, burgers and appetizers designed to make the tasebuds dance, the place is a real treat.   The only thing is I think they need to get rid of, say, about ten or twelve hundred yards of the neighborhood to accommodate the local parking,because for a place this popular, the lot is a bit snug, but that just means that if you want their great food, you'll just have to get there EARLY.   I give this a solid rating; if you want to have a nice date night, an evening out with friends in a casual atmosphere, and mostly if you just want feed the need for tastiness indeed, this spot is a good one to discover.   In my mind, this place has no rivals, but don't take my word for it, decide for yourself;)"}
{"text":"Steve N was one of the best servers I have ever had. Food was amazing and drinks were cold! Can't wait to come back."}
{"text":"Holy Beers On TAP!  Yay for Rivals.  I was pleasantly surprised when the man and I stopped her for a quick bite on Saturday.  What a lovely patio!  It's huge!  The interior of the space is nice too.  Looked very clean!  Our waitress was manning the whole patio by herself and doing a pretty good job at it.  She was informative and didn't rush us. . The man got wings & I got a wrap.  They weren't too bad.  The beer was beer. I'll go back.  I think it would be a great place for friends to get together!"}
{"text":"I travel all over and it is hard to find a great local sports bar with equally great food. Rivals; however, is the exception!  The food was fresh, prepared to order, and bursting with flavor.  The jumbo shrimp app was a perfect starter. I followed it with The Clevelander Steak: an 8oz fire grilled sirloin with sautéed mushrooms, onion, and garlic!  It was cooked perfectly.   If you are in the area, check it out! You will not be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"BEST breakfast and bloody Mary's around! Also highly recommend dinner there too! Their chips and dip are great with a beer on the patio in the summer!"}
{"text":"This place blew my expectations out of the water.  I took my girlfriend and we both ordered the Clevelander, which was sirloin steak,  corn on the cob and a baked potato. It.was.so.good. I can't even begin to explain how great it was. I then told our waitress how much I enjoyed myself and she told her manager who then came over to our table to shake our hands and tell us she appreciated having us as patrons. They had a lot of people who were clearly enjoying themselves. Friendly service and they seemed like they were really proud of their restaurant. I will definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Clean, friendly, solid menu & good food....nuff said!  We'll be back"}
{"text":"Do not waste your time. The website clearly states dinner seven days a week from 3 pm to 2 am. The last time I checked, 11 pm falls within that time range. Upon my arrival at this restaurant the hostess/waitress/maid didn't bother to greet me.  The floors were sticky...so much for cleanliness. When I requested a seat to have dinner, she informed me that the kitchen was closed because they close early during the week. Why have a website posting for dinner seven days a week until 2am???  Don't actually expect any breakfast at 8 am. The entire restaurant staff will still be in bed though they claim breakfast is available at 8 am. They have the audacity to have a human interest segment showcasing their establishment on a local news channel! They may have the largest patio in the area yet they have the smallest and worse ambiance and customer services! Deuces and good riddance!"}
{"text":"I don't know which is bigger? Huge or Giant? But whatever is bigger I want to thank Rivals Sports Bar for looking after their customers. I had a bad reaction with novocaine and one beer. I have no idea what happened but they looked after me and they even called the paramedics for my safety. This thank you goes out to John, Rachel, Sarah and all the other staff and most of the customers because we know everybody here! It's like cheers."}
{"text":"The Rival pale ale was good. The service was excellent. The strip steak was decent had good flavor the mashed potatoes were awesome. I would come back. Next time here on business I will try again. Go Cubs"}
{"text":"Still thinking about those St. Louis style ribs. Everybody seems to do baby back and/or smoked. Don't get me wrong, love me some smoked or baby back rib. These ribs blew me away! They were cooked very well. Tender with crispy sections on the exterior. They are my favorite non-smoked rib.   Fire place was cozy on cold February Cleveland day.The menu is huge which usually is a bad sign for me, no complaints on my plate. Extensive beer selection however is always welcome. Friendly staff, great place."}
{"text":"Amazing food with a unique bar layout! The patio is nice on summer evenings and the crowd is pleasant. Service isn't always the friendliest, but the food quality forgives this. Personally my favorite bar. I believe they have the best wings on the west side."}
{"text":"ABSOLUTE WORST SERVICE. You're better off eating at Wendy's. The restaurant wasn't busy and my table of four had all finished our drinks AND appetizers and we still waited 10 minutes. Afterwards they messed up our entrees and only when we were about to leave did they offer to buy us another drink instead of cover any drinks we already had purchased. Not only will I never return but I will let everyone know not to bother. Please do yourself a favor and go anywhere else."}
{"text":"Food was ok, service was terrific. Will come again on game day for the fun atmosphere!"}
{"text":"First time here, appeared to be overwhelmingly busy. Once inside it was busy, but very well staffed, service from door to seat to order to table,very timely. The server we had was very knowledgeable about the menu and very honest. I got the wet Cajun traditional wings they were definitely close to the best I've had,and meaty. Everyone else with me for the Lake Monster, looked very appealing.  The census on the Lake Monster ate mixed. Overall a wonderful experience."}
{"text":"Great food, large shareable portions, nice taps. I'll be back!  The rosemary garlic tots and chorizo mussels were worth a shout out. My friends had burgers that looked fantastic. In my best Schwartzeneger \"I'll DEFINITELY BE BACK!\""}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game, multiple rooms, good staff.  They put a lot of money into the outdoor patio and added a parking lot. Nice to see owners who aren't cutting corners. Have only had one meal there but it was tasty."}
{"text":"Good service, good beer, good food. The hot sauced and homemade chips/dip are my favorite! Very fun for Browns games."}
{"text":"We enjoy going to rivals! Food is great, lots of variety and never disappointed. Everything is great from entrees to burgers. There is always a drink special going on to enjoy."}
{"text":"We had a fun time at this restaurant. The beer was cold and a great price for happy hour. There are lots of TVs to view sports. Our server was very nice. The food was standard grille type food. My husband had a Rueben sandwich and he said the corned beef was some of the best he has ever had."}
{"text":"Rivals is an all time favorite for my husband and I. We love their burgers and chicken sandwiches! The owner John is a super nice guy and you can tell he really cares about his restaurant with how well it's doing. We stop in 2-3 times a month for dinner and we are never disappointed. Their outside eating area/bar is very nice and we frequent that in the spring/fall on the cooler nights. All in all you can't go wrong at rivals!  Update: We have also tried their breakfast menu now and we are hooked, it's so good for such a cheap price!!"}
{"text":"After a very rough day at work, my partner and I were finding ourselves in need of a drink... Or three!! Being on a business trip we were very unfamiliar with the area. We drove for a couple of miles searching for the right venue, and when we found rivals, we knew it was going to be a great experience! It was a nice day and their outdoor patio seemed to call to us. We sat down and were immediately greeted by friendly faces from all of the staff. Then came our server, Holly. Where to begin!? Holly was exactly the kind of server every restaurant strives to have. She was personable, funny, and when we asked for drink suggestions, she was more than happy to help us out! Not only did she provide the type of service you would expect when you are out, she just seemed to go above and beyond! After we ordered our drinks, they quickly were brought to our table, and her suggestions were spot on! Just what we needed! Not only that, but our drink never got to the point of empty before we were asked what else we needed. We can't really give an opinion about the food, because we only had a few drinks, but based off of the drinks, and the amazing service, Rivals is definitely a place we will be stopping back everytime we are in the Cleveland area!"}
{"text":"Had a good time at Rivals. Our server, Steven was amazing, very nice, laid back guy!! Fried pickles, fried mozzarella and loaded fries were delisch.  We'll be back for more patio shenanigans!"}
{"text":"Great food! Good beer specials! Love swinging by for lunch or dinner. Have to try the Cajun salmon meal. Best salmon meal I've had in Cleveland."}
{"text":"I admit it. I was nervous. This is outside of my comfort zone. But I bought the I Heart Radio deal and I'm so glad I did.   Dad and I went on a Saturday around 7pm. Sat at a table in the middle, would have preferred a booth but that's ok.   Waiter, Bryan, was great. Friendly, but busy.   Beer was awesome, they brew their own!  Food was good! Dad had a steak, he cleared his plate. I had the philly cheeseteak...and if I'm honest, I've been thinking about how I want it again!  The people who frequent here what you'd expect for the area and this type of bar and grill. That's my only complaint, I just don't love that area of town, or the drunk townies who smell like bonfires. But yeah I know that's what I get. I dealt with it and I will again for that Philly Cheesesteak and beer.   Try it out!"}
{"text":"There isn't really another bar like this in the area. I live in Lakewood (land of 1000 bars) and will DRIVE to go to rivals. Great beer selection, good bar food and a lot of TVs.   Rivals is actually 3 bars, there is a large bar, a smaller bar and a dining area. All three areas have TVs and the dining area has a fireplace which is pretty cool.   This is a true sports bar. Great for college games and on Sundays during football season you get your typical browns fans but also fans wearing Viking, Titans and Chargers jerseys. There are also a large contingent of Steelers fans that frequent this bar on Sundays.   There is more than enough space, beer and TVs for all and everyone gets along really well.   Without a doubt one of my favorite bars and definitely worth a trip."}
{"text":"The craft beer selection of draft and bottled goodies gets a 5 by itself. Nice lovely bar, delicious food and great service."}
{"text":"FIRST, check out their website.  You will find that whoever put it all together understands the importance of providing a vibe and an image that differentiates Rivals from the competition.  You don't have to go far in Middleburgh or Parma to find a Sports Bar, but there are only a few who choose to take pride in their food - and when it comes to pub fare, Rivals Sports Grille is ironically in a league of their own..  Upon our arrival at Rivals, I surprisingly reveled in the atmostphere - TV's in every corner with a wood burning fireplace in plain view - I knew this was not your average Buffalo wing joint.     The menu was cut and dried and exactly what we expected - this and that fried, burgers wings and fries, with a few daily specials.  Everything I tried was better than anticipated, with at least few items worth mentioning.  They offer 20+ wing sauces along with a few dry rubs.  I chose the 7 pepper rub and the Carribbean jerk rub, and both were outstanding.  The flavors were bold without being too salty, and the jerk seasoning offered a complex blend of heat, spice, sweetness without being overpowering.  The General Tso's sauce is something different, and the Raspberry BBQ has a subtle sweet and smoky flavor as if it were cooked in a smoker with cherry wood.  The dipping sauces are made from scratch, and the honey mustard was sublime.  The buffalo chicken wrap was crispy and well prepared, and the bacon they add is a nice touch.  The spinach artichoke dip featured gorganzola cheese, a change of pace from the dips you find elsewhere.  My only complaint would be that the fettuccine alfredo was a bit too rich and sticky, and the fries were on the greasy side.  Overall, you can tell this restaurant put a lot of thought and effort into their menu and image, which give this place a touch of class not often found at the neighborhood sports bar."}
{"text":"My go to bar. I have been coming here before it was close to home. They have daily menus, drink specials, etc. The staff has changed some, but the new servers have improved alot!"}
{"text":"Killer food and great service. Came in at end of the night and still got the same quality food and service as middle of the day. Keep it up. Burger especially cooked excellently. Would recommend rivals to anyone"}
{"text":"I want to rate this place higher, but can't bring myself to do it. I really like the bar, the big screens, good beer selection (but no PBR), very clean. The service sucks. Went on a Tues nite about 7. Waited longer than I should have to order a beer, the barmaid was busy b.s.ing with a waitress, and the bartender was busy. -1. They have Keno. Bar owners may say it doesn't take away from business, but iot does. -2. The food. They were out of the $4 tacos, so I ordered the $8 Tiujuanna(?) tacos. Basically chicken tacos, cold, overpriced. -3. Finally got my bill and he saw me put up my card. Waited almost 10 min. before the barmaid finally took it. Almost dined n dashed. Didn't leave much of tip (I'm one of those people who tip based on service, not obligation or guilt)."}
{"text":"Came here after grandsons basketball game - nice little find!  Split a sandwich & had a beer.  Great sandwich & home cut fries - service was great - brewmaster came out & introduced himself & gave us samples of their Rival IPAs!  We are seldom in this area, but if we are again, we will make a stop!!"}
{"text":"Best patio! Dog friendly patio too! Wife and I eat here often. Usually three or four times a month. Hamburgs and wings are great! And the food preparation and service is very consistent. Which is very good. Managers usually can be seen walking around talking to guests. Just a great place to enjoy a summer evening."}
{"text":"If you're looking for a great place to watch all the games, you've found it! The service was great and the food was served hot, good and quick! We both had steaks with vegetables and potatoes. The asparagus was cooked to perfection and the steaks were exactly the way we ordered them. Great time, great food, great  service"}
{"text":"I ordered the Gyro for lunch.  It comes with fries but I decided to up charge for the onion rings. I am unable to give a five star rating for this lunch.  The atmosphere was awesome.  I did enjoy eating here today.  But while the Gyro tasted great.  As I got to the end there was just too much grease from the meat.   Also the upcharge of $.99 for the onion rings was a great price.  Except one problem.  I got FOUR onion rings.  That was disappointing.  They were small onion rings at that.  Oh well.   Overall the food and experience was good. And that deserved the four stars.  Enjoy your next meal there.  I did."}
{"text":"This place was really nice surprise. The menu looks good -- the apps we had were tasty -- and the brew list is quite long. As a fan of nerdy electronic trivia, I wish this place was a lot closer to me."}
{"text":"In town for work and the hotel brought me here. Had the fried perch and it was good. The handcut fries and hushpuppies were even better. You can tell they care about the food they put out. Nice atmosphere also"}
{"text":"Rivals Is consistent in their service and the beer and food choices. They have a chef who delivers great entrays. The wings are always consistent in doneness and flavor. They are getting ready to expand into another location formally owned by Fatheads. I expect nothing short of greatness. Thanks."}
{"text":"Great burger!  Friendly and fast service.  Even wearing my M coat was treated respectfully.    I will come back!"}
{"text":"Great food and even better service.  They have the formula to success.  Mondays are great with craft beer specials."}
{"text":"One of my favorite placea.  The patio in the summer is great and the food never disappoints.  I have tried most of the menu and i have not had a bad choice.  The burgers and the Salmon are the best in the area.  The wings are up there as well."}
{"text":"Ok I wasn't going to leave a review but this is the cherry on top... for a sports bar it's awesome - they have a ton of TVS, food was great, service awesome, $5 bud light pitcher great deal. THEN... just as my phone is about to die, they have outlets under the bar!!! ON the CUSTOMER SIDE!!! So great!"}
{"text":"Another sports bar checked in to by your friendly local soccer team, the snail cats!  This is the third place we've been after a game for food and it is by far the best! This place is massive. I didn't get to see the patio but I did catch a glimpse of some pictures. Definitely somewhere I could see us hanging out in the summer.  It was pretty late so I was only in the mood for some light bites. Of course, this means wings!! I was pleasantly surprised with all the sauce choices and...wait for it....they have general tso's sauce...for their wings! I know, right? My eyes became blurry and  immediately honed in on the magnificent words I was reading. I practically yelled my order at the waiter so he didn't misunderstand...I clearly needed wings with that sauce on them. Yes, yes they were as delicious as I imagined. Against my better judgement, I also ordered the \"unrivaled heat\" wings. The spiciness was good but the flavor was off. Not a fan.  Over all I enjoyed Rivals. I will be back!"}
{"text":"Terrific Monday specials (3 sliders & fries, ribs & wings & tater tots), good prices including $3 pints-lots of choices, and terrific service!!  Steve was the best waiter we've had in ages!!!!  Excellent job!"}
{"text":"A missed flight, an extra night near the airport and a shuttle dropped me off at the only reputable establishment in Cleveland, Rivals.   A gigantic 25oz. beer mug full of a local IPA served to me which was enough to please a Viking, I was already happy with my decision to go there.   Chicken sliders w BBQ sauce and fried onion rings hit all the right notes only caveat they were unexpectedly very spicy.   Barbacoa tacos, bomb! These things were clearly made and shredded by hand on site. I was delighted w this unexpected Mexican dish.   Another gigantic beer and I retired for my flight home the next day.   Getting stranded and getting to meet all the local staff and fire department raising money for charity while pleasantly watching the sun set at the outside bar wasn't the worst thing after all."}
{"text":"Their ad doesn't lie: Upscale food for a fair price! I had the Homerun Ribeye and can honestly say one of the best steaks I have had anywhere! Casual/sports bar atmosphere, which we enjoy. Service was superb!"}
{"text":"3.5 stars!  Stopped in here on a Thursday looking for some casual grub. Rivals has an extensive draft beer list! We started with the fried mushrooms, they were good but not memorable. We also had wings and they were the standout! My only qualm was that the prices were really high for this type of sports bar, especially for the smaller size portions."}
{"text":"Best hangout! Love taking clientele for a drink after work, winter or summer weather the staff is always excellent!"}
{"text":"The best pretzels with cheese you will ever have! The service is good and fast. I like the environment and the restaurant overall. Long Island were good!!!"}
{"text":"Visited here a few weeks ago with good intentions of trying their own beer but Fat Heads was doing a promotion here for their beer, so that didn't happen. I did sample the food and thought it was typical pub fare. Tasty and reasonably priced. The beer menu was extensive with a wide variety of in-house beers. I will update his review after a return visit when I can sample the Rivals beer options."}
{"text":"Have been back a few times since my last review and have to say things are on the upswing with their food and service. We've been really happy with our burgers, salads, wings and fish and chips to name a few items.....and fries. All have been great. The service has improved 100%. Actually really refreshing!  The owners are obviously putting everything into making this a success. New bar being built outside too. We actually sat outside for dinner the other night and the patio was full of other patrons enjoying a burger and cold one on one of our first warm evenings!    I like you, Rivals. My partner and I will be back soon.....say next Monday!"}
{"text":"This is a great laid back atmosphere with an outside patio, awesome food, and really reasonable pricing. Love it!"}
{"text":"After a long time on the road, my sister and I wanted a nice sit down dinner. I found this place close to our hotel. The place had lots of parking. Ambiance as you come in was good. There was the bar area as you enter then the dining area was separate. We chose to be seated in the dining area. It started as a quiet evening. The staff were friendly. I got a margarita for $3 since it was their Tuesday special South of the Border night-yay! Unfortunately it didn't have enough ice. Not very impressed about that. But the high light of the evening was the food. We ordered caprese salad which was delish for sure! I was actually surprised. Then came the wings. My sister chose the sauce, smoke bourbon bbq, honey bbq and I chose hot garlic. My hot garlic is not as hot as I wanted but very tasty. The other 2 sauces surprising (since both were bbq)full of flavor yet distinctly different. We loved it! This place got packed when several large parties came in for graduation celebration with no reservation. The serving staff took turns attending to us and did a great job! I would highly recommend and would def come back given the opportunity."}
{"text":"They advertise for their Sunday breakfast all the time so I tried it. The food was good once it got to us, which took long enough. However, the service was horrible and no one really seemed to care.   The patio is very nice, however; so, my review may be different when I visit Rival's again in the evening."}
{"text":"Huge drink list.  We had a light dinner made of apps.  Fried mushrooms were \"A-\", large and yummy in beer batter.  Teriyaki chicken sliders were an A+, very delicious and very real chicken breast, and they were large for sliders.  Finally, steamed potstickers were a mixed bag.  The shrimp ones didn't have much shrimp flavor, or much flavor period.  The edamame ones had a great flavor to them.  Would probably order again but ask if I could make the whole order of 6 edamame potstickers and no shrimp (and this is coming from a seafood and meat lover).  Server was fast and friendly, though a tad crass in her language, in the same way that many PG-13 movies awkwardly insert certain words to come across as \"hip\" or \"adult\".  Yes I know it's a \"sports bar\" but the workers shouldn't assume you want to join them in a round of cussing.  GREAT patio!  Will be back."}
{"text":"This is my favorite local bar. Great food, Great PATIO. Always looks packed but I think everyone just drives up separate there. Been going to rivals for years and never have had a problem!"}
{"text":"Best fried fish around!  Always great service with a clean atmosphere.  Patio has been a great addition and it has its own bar."}
{"text":"The homemade kettle chips are amazing! The Red Filet is the best steak I have ever had."}
{"text":"Never complain when I come here! Came again for dinner tonight and it was BOMB!!!! \"I'll be back\""}
