C'mon guy. Your sitting on a gold mine. 
Small country cafe in middle of? 

Here from CA visiting family and I was so excited to get my grub on at a place like this--- sadly, didn't happen here. 
Really shocked to see how unclean the place was- decor offered no warmth as one would expect. 
The food? Wow menu was to big for a place like this. 
Keep it simple , use quality ingredients from local area; never go wrong. 
Pork chops? . To thin and way way over cooked. Google \" Brine meats\" 
Okra? Way over cooked, lacked seasoning. ( looks like you need to change your oil) 
Green beans? Fresh out of the can! Sad just sad, no salt or anything;  laziness on the cooks side. 

I noticed most others had burger  baskets - that might be your saving grace. 
Comfort meals it isn't! 

Again, you have a gold mine there. 
Learn some good recipes and go with it. 
Add things that no else sells. 


For your meals; garlic rolls, cheddar rolls. Something that shows its you. 

I was so disappointed as the server kept Saying, no to \" is it house made?  
Look at your freezer ; time to clean up! 
Anyone can use frozen foods, what's special about you? Make it personal. 

Take that place to a whole new leave. 

I trained in Italy, learning to cook with fresh ingredients, keeping it simple and people love it.  
I wish you luck. 

All feed back is positive!"}
{"text":"Not much simpler than a name like \"Bob's Restaurant\". The menu isn't much to look at either - essentially we're talking a diner on the side of 601. Though you'll find items like chicken and green beans and fried squash, I'm not sure that I would choose them, as the beans tasted like they were from a can - not that there is anything wrong with that - the chicken was strips with some form of seasoning tossed on it (which apparently you could not order without, or get on anything else), and the squash had a huge layer of (something) surrounding it before being fried.

The burgers did look a bit promising, but it's tough to screw up a burger. It has apparently been done, but not here. Probably best to stick with those.

On the good side, staff was friendly - though they weren't terribly accommodating wanting to make changes, such as getting some of that seasoning on something other than the chicken for instance."}
