{"text":"Sorry but horrible ! I don't believe I was eating real food . The meat tasted like it came from a can. I had to throw it out . The corn bread was two mushy and sweet . I didn't think red beans and rice could go so wrong. It is obvious the ribs are precooked and prepackaged like Bubba's or Tony Roma's just not similar to their quality. Somebody needs to start over with their menu!"}
{"text":"Sides to NO!!!! I ordered the one meat and three sides meal. I ordered Pickle fries, Jo Jo's and mashed potato and Carolina Pulled Pork for $12.99. I got 5 tiny Jo Jo's (Wendy's fries are bigger) 7 pickle fries which were the size of a Burger kings fry, a small scoop of mashed potatoes which was smaller than an actual potato, and plain pulled pork with a small cup of sauce to dump on. It was horrible for the price. The only good thing was the tiny square of cornbread. I would never buy again based on the portions for 12.99. I could get better quality and bigger portions for 12.99."}
{"text":"Wow, this was pretty dam good. The BBQ chefs here definately have skill. They are  bit raw in other aspects but they are customer service oriented and make some tasty shit.

All I can comment on is the pulled pork. Did not need sauce. Yes smoked meat with great flavor that was not soaking im crap Cleveland BBQ sauce.  Smokey tangy and well flavored pulled pork. I asked if I could sample some, yes with much enthusiasm was the answer. Taste I did, more is what I wanted. They obliged. I ordered a halfer of this porky goodness. They countered that I needed to order a whole pound. Let's go back to the sauce. I wanted something spicy and not sugar laden. The pit master advised he has a Tennessee hot sauce but may not play well with BBQ pork. I tasted once  again. It was fanfuckingtastic but not spicy. The pit master said he could kick it up no problem.  Wow this so worked with the pork. Man this was amazing. If you visit this fine establishment get the Nashville hot sauce, divine.  The sides looked amazing but pork was what was needed and pound is what i received. Yeah I now have bbq Nashville tacos for the foreseeable future and really happy."}
