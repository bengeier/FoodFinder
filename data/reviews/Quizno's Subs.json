{"text":"Ordered a mesquite chicken for takeout. Service was good food was not. When I got home, not even a 3min drive, sandwich was already cold. The chicken was rubbery and there was a hair in the lettuce. Ended up throwing the whole thing out. Will not return."}
{"text":"Decent service and staff. Food is alright. Love guacamole as a topping, but the bread is poorer quality. Otherwise the sandwich tasted good, but would have liked to have more say in the topping selection.

Cookies are prepackaged and not baked fresh. 

Also more expensive then subway by a couple $."}
{"text":"I've been to this location many times and the service has always been very good along with their food. But the last time I was there, the worker dealing with order taking didn't seem to be interested in providing decent service to any of the customers. I admit it was very busy so maybe the worker was just needing a break. I hope the owner can see this so the employee can given some advice on how to handle customers even at times of rush. I like going there so I'm hoping the employee was just having a bad day."}
{"text":"Stopped in to this Quizno's about 20 minutes before they closed. The chairs were already on top of the tables, the food was being packed away and the girl at the counter did nothing to hide the annoyance on her face that customers were coming in. When I started to place my order, she cut me off and said very rudely, \"Well, could you get your food to go? We're closing.\" Big customer service no-no. 

Her attitude got worse when I asked her to leave the lettuce out of my sub, after she put two giant handfuls of it on and after I had said at the beginning of my order \"no lettuce, please.\" Then she proceeded to charge me full price even though I got the drink and chips combo. She got annoyed again when I pointed THAT out. 

I gave them an extra star, because when she's not working there, it's actually a nice Quizno's to go to."}
{"text":"Overall the food is good, it's clean and well maintained. What I don't like is paying prior to getting my sub. The look on his face when I told him to load it up made me think he regretted asking if I wanted anything on it. Not to mention you have to pay for extra sauce. As I was leaving I asked for extra napkins(I just paid extra for sauce, it's going to be messy), and yet once again I got the same look from him as he gave me earlier when putting my toppings on. The only thing stopping me from returning to this location was the amount of uncomfortable eye contact."}
{"text":"I don't know if all Quizno's are this poor, but the Quizno's at King and Dufferin is terrible.  It's changed management several times in the last year, probably each trying to fix the poor quality coming out of this joint.

The flatbread's are slimy greasy undercooked messes.  The subs are mediocre (at best) and are never toasted enough.  

Do what most in the 'hood do, cross the street and go to subway."}
{"text":"Quiznos is my second favourite place for sandwiches my favourite place is of course subway.  I would usually go to subway but since this quiznos is so close when I want a sandwich this is were I go.  There sandwiches aren't big enough.  I feel  like they use better ingredients than a lot of other sub places  but they don't have enough sauces to add on.  overall quiznos has really good food and ive never become frustrated with any of the staff.  I think if you like subway its worth giving quiznos a try because although I like subway more I know plenty of people who prefer quiznos.  I have no complaints about this quiznos restraint."}
{"text":"Have ordered delivery from here a few times for meetings.  The food is good but the delivery staff leaves something to be desired.  Every time the delivery driver requests a tip as part of dropping off the food.  I find this to be very bold and rude.  

In my experience, a tip is based on exceptional customer service and is not requested at the time of delivery.  This staff member should be reminded of that and if it's such an issue, increase the delivery fee rather than make your customers uncomfortable."}
{"text":"A decent location. Clean and fresher than the other locations I've been too recently. The only downsides is related to the overall company, not just this particular location. Every location just seems like it's not supported anymore by the company and send kind of abandoned. The meat portions are definitely smaller too than it used to be, especially compared to Subway now."}
{"text":"The other reviewers are right. I have been to this location since 2015 more than once. I always regret going back when I get that Quizno's \"craving\". The toppings are very skimpy, I asked for extra lettuce and was given the same \"look\" as if I was doing something immoral. Normally all other locations have the squeeze bottles out, not here that costs extra. I sent a inquiry to head office whom did not seem to care and simply CC'd the owner on the email and the owner simple replied with \"come into the store so we can discuss this face to face\" - not interested. You should see the look he gives you if you ask for ANYTHING extra... let along do I want to be confrontational with this on the skimpy toppings on all his subs... if you do go here be prepared to walk out paying upwards of $10 for a under dressed sub... when the owner eyeballs you as you request more than 1 topping on your $10 sub... I love Quizno's but hate this location and try to avoid it at all costs... however it is clean and recently updated the customer service and overall sub construction is lacking in all areas."}
{"text":"I don't know why but I like Quiznos... of all the major sub chains it's my fav by far! The Chicken Carbonara on Rosemary Parm bread is my favourite. The prices are a little steep but toaster DOES taste better.

As a warming this location tends to under-toast a bit."}
{"text":"the manager basically runs the resturant, he requests payment before the sub is even finished being made. all the employees look scarred being there, he does yell at times. if you order over the phone the order gets screeeeeewed up. 
would not recommend"}
