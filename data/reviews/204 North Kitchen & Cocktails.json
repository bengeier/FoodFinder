{"text":"Kitchen and cocktails 204 North is amazing! Great customer service. I ordered the scallop risotto (sub shrimp) without difficulty or judgement, and then something came up and I had to leave. They rushed my order AND put it in a to go box for me. Everything was delish! Even down to the chili garlic buttered bread. Great stop!"}
{"text":"I am in love with this place. Great staff and meals. I don't like going to retardants but this please is different and I have and will continue to visit."}
{"text":"Excellent food AND service. My wife had the Atlantic salmon and I had steak. Both were amazing. I hate beets but these were the best I have ever had. I am now a beets fan as long as it comes from 204. For dessert I had the sticky bun and she had flourless chocolate cake with a splash of sorbet. It was a perfect match. I have been to a number of restaurants in Charlotte and rarely get blown away by the food AND service.  Will be back again and again."}
{"text":"A group of girlfriends and I went to 204 recently and the experience was less than stellar. The plus side was the pleasant attitude of the server and drinks. We all loved the drinks. They were fresh and perfectly made. 
We know it was fairly new when we went and I wasn't too surprised by the wait for our actual food to arrive but when it did, we would have been better off only ordering drinks. I ordered the trout and could smell it before it even hit the table. It reeked of fishy smell, and anyone who eats trout knows that it should never smell that way. My friend next to me, looked over and said \"you can't eat that.\" strike one.. My other girl friend ordered the pork belly appetizers and while the flavor was good, one of the pork belly could be better described as \"pork abs\" because you couldn't cut it with a knife. Strike 2. Another girlfriend got the calamari that was inedible. Strike 3. I returned my trout for the fried oysters which were tasty but a bit salty, so I'll call that a foul ball. Upon bringing these things to the attention of the on duty manager, he was extremely apologetic and rectified the situation on our checks.
However, a group of us left and went over to Capital Grille for a real meal. If you are looking for great drinks, definitely a must. But I may wait awhile before I try my luck with the food."}
{"text":"20+ party. Fast service, best table, server got everything correct without writing anything down. Coming from a NC native, this place is magnificent and Regina was the best!"}
{"text":"I ordered salmon medium and it came out barely seared, raw, and cold. The waitress took it back and a manager brought me back the same piece of meat with the missing section covered with greens to hide it; still not cooked to medium.  This means they took my contaminated piece and placed back on the grill for other people's food to also be cooked on. I called it out and it was not denied."}
{"text":"I only had dessert here, which was great.  The sticky bun and chocolate cake are both great choices.

The atmosphere was....boring.  There were about a dozen people in there late on a Monday night but it was so quite.  I love chill, relaxing places, but this wasn't that.  Maybe the music could be a little louder and not Adam Levine (love him but he doesn't fit this place).

I will say that it was nice to go somewhere late night that the Sip-type crowd was not."}
{"text":"Excellent location, service and food. I needed a last minute reservation (during restaurant week) for 5 people to enjoy appetizers and drinks before the Opera. Even though the restaurant was booked solid, they were able to figure out a way to accommodate our group. The food is fantastic - all of the appetizers are with ordering - especially the pork belly and fried green tomatoes. Service was quick and friendly. While a smaller restaurant, it's located in the perfect place. I would also recommend this restaurant for parties and large groups. Our company holiday party was here and the custom menu they created for us was incredible."}
{"text":"We live in Uptown, so we were anxious to try 204. Fortunately our initial impression did not follow through the evening. When we arrived, the hostess did not look up from her iPad. She stood sideways to us, no greeting, no eye contact, nothing. It wasn't until I looked at my husband and said,\"invisible syndrome\", did she even acknowledge that we were there. We told her we had reservations and she picked up 2 menus and walked away. We looked at each other, like, \"are we supposed to follow her?\" She turned around and looked at us, as if we should be mind readers. At that point I imagined the worst. Fortunately, it got much better. 

The decor is very nice with beautiful wood floors, brick walls, and an industrial feel. The music is at a good level so you can communicate without yelling. Our server, Mikaela, was pleasant, attentive, and helpful. We enjoy good food, and I have always been an adventurous cook, so we are pretty happy eating a good meal at home on the balcony enjoying the skyline. If we eat out, we expect it to taste good and be memorable, or what's the point?

I ordered the Mahi Mahi, and it was very good. The asparagus, rice, and fish were cooked perfectly, and were not over salted (one of my pet peeves). My husband had the meatloaf, and enjoyed it too and said the green beans and mashed potatoes were cooked and seasoned perfectly. We are not big dessert people, but ordered the key lime pie, which was not on the online menu yet... also very good and worth the calorie splurge. 

If I had gone by the unwelcoming attitude of the hostess, I would have just walked out and we would have missed a very nice meal. My husband, the nicest guy ever, said, \"she is sucky as a hostess.\" Sadly, if someone doesn't explain to this young woman how to be hospitable, there will be people who won't take the time to find out the potential this place has. I hope they do well, because it is always nice to have a reliable go-to spot you enjoy within walking distance."}
{"text":"Wife & I have been twice now...wonderful experience. You got to try the Trade St. cocktail, excellent and different. If you like lightly fried oysters you can't miss with the appetizer Crispy Oysters, they are tender and not so heavily breaded. BIG PLUS: at last you can go to a show in Charlotte and still have access to a full menu after 11:pm."}
{"text":"This restaurant is just ok. Their craft cocktails were not craft! Check out The Cellar at Duckworth for the real deal! The fried green tomatoes were too dry but the fried oysters were decent. I had the flat iron streak, which was cooked medium to my liking but my hubby's Mahi was a flavorless soupy mess. The sticky bun dessert was the best part of the meal. Atmosphere is cool but I'd stick to dessert and maybe a beer."}
{"text":"An awesome meal last night! The atmosphere and service were great!  We started out with the Spicy Garlic Shrimp-excellent, good crispy breading and the spice was perfect.  I had the Atlantic Catch which was amazing, Cooked perfectly and I'm a sucker for a good pesto sauce which it paired great with. My husband had the Strip and dug in so fast I didn't get a pic but it was great-cooked to a perfect Medium Rare and although he isn't a steak sauce person their homemade steak sauce was delicious!  We will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"Positives: good (not great) bourbon cocktail shorted in the glass; nice, affordable wine list but not enough selections by the glass; great flavor on pork belly appetizer; creative but limited menu for what is essentially a two-story bar.
Negatives: ambiance is a hot mess --- loud pop music overhead, faint odor of stale beer, uncomfortable metal chairs, cloth napkins but one fork & knife for entire meal; server pleasant but young & inexperienced; no menu specials.
204 North hasn't made up its mind whether its a bar with pretty good food or a restaurant with a trendy bar scene. Like the cocktail vibe, but that suggests a more sophisticated crowd that demands a classier dining experience than they currently deliver. It's almost as if the GM and the chef are not on the same page about what pays the bills. If they want to be great (one way or the other), someone needs to take the lead."}
{"text":"Since it's been opened I've gone twice for drinks. Working nearby has proven very convenient to grab an after work drink at this new place. The interior is very cozy and rich. I love the comfortable leather stools at the bar. The cocktail list is named after Charlotte areas/neighborhoods and is well thought out with the ingredients and neat. My favorites are the Ballantyne with the fresh strawberries and mint and also the Plaza Milwood with strawberry, mango, and spiced rum. They will switch out liquors if you prefer like vodka for gin. Cocktails are a flat $12 and is a great price considering the fresh ingredients used. I haven't eaten here yet but I know I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Loud, loud, loud.  Our party of 4 went to 204 North for dinner on a recent weeknight.  The restaurant was maybe 2/3 full, and it was so loud that we left before ordering.  We were literally shouting across a four-top to be heard, as was everybody else in the place.

Sorry if the one-star rating is cold, but extremely high ambient noise is just as impactful on a restaurant experience as bad food, dirty silverware and rude service.  Restaurant owners and designers need to figure this out -- it's better to provide a good dining experience that encourages conversation than to design hip-looking hard floors, walls and ceilings that reflect noise and make it impossible for customers to converse.

What's the future value of a local party of 4 that otherwise might dine at a restaurant 6-10 times a year -- maybe $5,000 over three years?  That's how much 204 North is losing from us because the restaurant design overtook common sense.  204 North management has no idea how many other customers like us they're losing because customers don't communicate that issue back to the owners.  But I guarantee that it's a big chunk of lost sales.  We voted with our feet last night, and we won't be back."}
{"text":"Great service. Delicious food. We started with the fried green tomatoes. The pimento cheese and chow chow were nice complements. I ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes. My mom got the flat iron steak. I highly recommend all three things we ordered."}
{"text":"I have been in town visiting a friend all week. We decided to stop in for dinner and drinks tonight, since she had never been here. Andrew was a fantastic bartender!! The food was the incredible! The drinks were phenomenal and they have an awesome cocktail list. You're missing out if you haven't been here! I plan to come back every time I visit Charlotte!"}
{"text":"Great environment , cocktails and food! 
Ordered the Quinoa risotto which is a good meatless option!"}
{"text":"The food is blah and the service was horrible. We waited over an hour and a half for our food and it was cold when it came out. I would never suggest this restaurant to anyone. The only reason they're getting one star is because the drinks were decent...and well Yelp won't allow me to leave less than one star. Definitely not worth the hype!"}
{"text":"I really want to like this place, but after giving it a second chance, I do not think I'll be back anytime soon. Pros- the space is great. Food was decent. Not a ton of healthy options, just FYI. Not terrible, but definitely not as good as Stoke or Essex, which are one block away. My largest complaint was unfortunately the service. I was a server for many years, and I completely understand when you're having a bad night, or the bar is backed up, and you're getting blamed for the lack of drinks, etc. However, our server, Regina, was rude from the beginning, barely acknowledging the table with more than a curt greeting. We were not provided any water until we were almost finished with out meal, even though we asked multiple times. And to top it off, when we asked for the bill, we just asked to split it five ways evenly, between the five of us. Easy, right? The systems that restaurants use divide the bill for you. She somehow managed to completely mess it up, coming back to the table and admitting that it wasn't done correctly, and had the audacity to not even apologize or offer to correct it. Turns out, she had only rung up three out of the five cards with the total tab, and out of those three they were not evenly split. I'm not even sure how that happens. As a server, I would never go back to the table with the bill split incorrectly, before finding a manager and fixing it. Mistakes happen. No big deal. But correct it. We spent the next 15 minutes venmo-ing back and forth to get it all straightened out. Not sure what happened there, but a simple apology would have really diffused the situation. Unfortunately we left there with a bad taste in our mouth, and along with the mediocre food, I'm not sure I would recommend this to anyone else. Sad, because I really wanted to enjoy this new spot."}
{"text":"I used to live in Charlotte and come back frequently to visit and I always try to make sure I have time to stop here! Building is beautiful, service is great (helpful without being annoying), and food is wonderful. Tried the Nashville hot chicken last time and it was amazing - I've had hot chicken in Nashville itself before and it did not disappoint. Must try!"}
{"text":"Good food but tiny menu and itty bitty servings. My meatloaf was great but my husband's flank steak was $26 and the size of a chicken breast. Also, the menu offered less than 10 items total. Lots of alcohol, though!"}
{"text":"Good food. Well made cocktails. Hip atmosphere. Downstairs has better vibe than upstairs. Sitting at the bar is great for a party of 1-2."}
{"text":"Great spot for dinner! We came in before an event and were greeted right away, our server was very polite and was sure to tell us about the specials. We started with the oyster deviled eggs which were amazing. I got the salmon which was cooked perfectly. We finished with the berry cobbler that came warm in a skillet. Overall great experience! Check it out!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in here for lunch with a coworker around 1 pm and were immediately greeted and shown to a table. We sat at a small two-top near the window, but I am excited to go back one evening soon and sit at the bar - the bar stools looked super comfy and the bar itself looked well-stocked. We both commented on how we loved the decor and the general feel of the place.

My friend and I each ordered the 3 taco lunch deal, which is 3 tacos and a side for $10. That price is pretty hard to beat and everything was delicious. Between the two of us, we tried all of the tacos. I especially loved that they don't skimp on the cotija cheese.

Overall the food and the service were both great. Looking forward to going back for dinner and drinks!"}
{"text":"This is one of the few places I found in Charlotte that serves amazing cocktails. The bartenders are very skilled and knowledgeable. I've mostly done bartender's choice and they've always nailed it. This is my favorite place in Charlotte to go for an Old Fashioned. The food is also really good. I had the smoked pork belly and it was delicious. The staff was extremely friendly and welcoming. I've only been here on weeknights, and it was not too busy and has a nice calm atmosphere."}
{"text":"Visiting from out of town and had 204 North recommended to me from a friend that had visited a couple months ago. It was absolutely great, the pork tenderloin was beyond perfect but the sweet potato purée was even better. On top the that the staff was extremely energetic and fun and the atmosphere was perfect for a Friday night. I plan on coming back every time I'm in town."}
{"text":"My husband and I came here this past Friday to get a drink and 'tizer after walking around Taste of Charlotte. 

The downstairs bar was full but we were pointed to an upstairs section and were able to grab two seats at the bar up there. This place is ginormous! 

I went with the Banker for my drink and my husband got a Wicked Weed Beer. The Banker was their version of an Old Fashion. Nicely made. We settled on the calamari as an appetizer. Nice portion. I liked that the calamari wasn't deep fried, as that is usually how I see restaurants serve calamari. Instead it was served grilled in a tasty sauce. 

Can't wait to come back here and check out more of what this restaurant has to offer!"}
{"text":"Eh.. I think they are trying too hard. The location sells it's self, the cocktails were over done as well as the menu. Trying to be too trendy.. had a drink and shared an appetizer and then went elsewhere for the main course as nothing seemed \"special\" on the menu. Have heard weekend brunch is nice so might give that a try"}
{"text":"Enjoyed the Elizabeth cocktail, although it was a little expensive at $12. Nice but not super unique vibes inside. I would go again if I were in the area."}
{"text":"Beautiful decor, good cocktails, friendly service but a hefty wait for food - I think they will figure this out in time as they have only been open a week. But the food is just ok. $7 for a side of fries (that are not even good) is absurd. We had a beet salad which was good but the crispy oyster appetizer was overpriced for the portion. My husband had the burger which he enjoyed but the rest of us got the flounder and the trout. Both dishes had zero flavor and I don't see how this could be a side effect of being so new. I'll go back to try other items bc I really want to like this place as places like this are much needed in Uptown."}
{"text":"The ambiance of this place was much better than the food itself. It just wasn't that great. Nothing exceptional about it at all. Which is a bummer because my husband and I were really excited to try it! I had the pimento cheese ravioli and my husband had the steak. Neither was anything special. The best part was probably my Caesar salad. Also the cocktails were not anything to remember."}
{"text":"One of my new favorite restaurants in Charlotte! Very cute and trendy atmosphere right in the city. The shrimp and grits and fried green tomatoes are amazing!!  The bartenders and wait staff are also very nice and welcoming.  Can't wait to go again soon!"}
{"text":"Love this place! Have visited for dinner several times and hosted a private corporate event. Cute atmosphere with a beautiful private space upstairs. Kristen and Tori on the event staff are amazing! Very friendly and eager to help. Drinks and food are delicious. The General Manager, Brandon is awesome and very passionate about his restaurant. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We made a reservation for a Saturday night; not sure we needed it (it didn't seem like they were on a wait) but we were seated right away either way.  Service was great and we really enjoyed the cocktails and food.  Nothing pretentious, but was great for a date night and we thought the service was superb.  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Where can I even start but to say the team at 204 North is an amazing group to work with for an event! My husband and I had our rehearsal dinner here, and we could not have been more pleased and impressed with all the hard work and dedication that went into making our night one to remember! 

Kristin, Sam and Chef Franke put so much thought into every detail of the decor, food and beverages. Sam crafted two specialty cocktails that our guests absolutely loved, and Chef Franke put together an incredible menu! Kristin even prepared a slideshow of photos of us that played on the TV screens throughout the night. Thanks again for being so flexible and fun to work with - we can't wait to celebrate with you all again and we will definitely be back for dinner and cocktails soon!"}
{"text":"This place just does not have good food. The only thing we had that was good was the spinach salad and you can't really mess that up. The oysters were also good but lots of breading...but those are the only 2 things I would order again. Calamari was one of the worst I've ever had, fried green tomatoes weren't good and cheese plate was average. The mahi was recommended as the best on the menu and it was super bland...ravioli was also super bland. Also tried the sticky bun which was good but the bun itself wasn't great the ice cream and caramel drizzle made it. Overall if this place plans on making it they need to do something about the food. It's also not cheap and service isn't great so I would not go back. Hoping it was a bad night for the chef or they get it together because they won't make it in Charlotte with food like that."}
{"text":"204 NORTH TRYON is an absolute must visit for many reasons. It's only 4 months old but it's growing up nicely. The atmosphere is simple and easy, and the staff is better than most uptown place.
If you love calamari, you must try it here. The meatloaf is surprisingly light and the chicken was really good  of mashed potatoes  and tasso au jois. I dare u to not LOVE the key lime pie.
I hope you ask for Allie she was a gem."}
{"text":"From the cocktails to the dessert I must say I was very happy. If you're a fan of bourbon, I strongly recommend the Banker cocktail. The shrimp tempura was delicious with the sauce taking it to another level (pictured here). 

The lamb loin was perfectly cooked as was the 204 burger. All of that said, my mother is vegetarian and we have eaten many places but her favorite has been the quinoa risotto. It was delicious. 

Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I came here for a work event and I asked for a fresh msrgarita and the bartender did not disappoint. It was truly a craft cocktail and absolutely delicious! Will definitely be coming back for drinks soon :-)"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I love this place. The staff is friendly and the bartenders are always very talkative and helpful. Our drinks are always made with care! Definitely recommend this place if you're in the area!"}
{"text":"The meatloaf and the wedge salad was decent. The vegetable pasta was disgusting. Not sure what's keeping that on the menu"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best restaurant in uptown. The pork tenderloin is absolutely amazing. Can't wait to go back and try more items on the menu. A must visit when in uptown."}
{"text":"The brunch was very underwhelming, especially for the price. I had coffee and their biscuits and gravy with a side of home fries. I'm not really a coffee snob but it tasted very watered down. The biscuits and gravy were fine but the potatoes had no seasoning. 

My friend had their avocado toast. It was not fresh avocado and instead was a pale green colored paste that kind of resembled store-bought guacamole."}
{"text":"They need an affordable and more of a variety of wines by the glass. 5 ounce pours for a $16 glass of wine is pretty pricey and not worth it to me. Won't be doing wine night here anymore."}
{"text":"I was in uptown on business this past week. One of my colleagues recommended this spot and spoke very highly about the cocktails.

So I headed there on Thursday night around 7pm. It was quite lively and I grabbed the last seat at the bar. The cocktail menu was quite impressive. Cocktails (aka libations according to the cool kids) were named after the various neighborhoods and suburbs in the Charlotte area. I had the Dilworth...quite refreshing gin drink. Then I ordered a small portion of the kale salad and smoked pork belly. 

While I was waiting for my food, the server, Molly, brought me some fresh made bread with this amazing fruit butter. Not that I needed all those carbs but I finished it all. The pork belly arrived; it was so delicious and I consumed it quickly. The kale salad was too salty and I could not eat more than two bites. I told Molly that I was not able to eat it. She was so gracious and took it off my check which I really appreciated it. 

Would love to come back on my next visit to uptown and try some more cocktails and food here!"}
{"text":"I just stopped in to meet some friends before a wild night out on the town.  I had already eaten, so we just went straight to the bar.  I liked the decor.  Bartender was friendly.  Drinks weren't cheap, but pretty much what you would expect for a classy looking spot downtown.  No complaints."}
{"text":"Trendy atmosphere, good food and we really enjoyed the custom cocktails BUT the service leaves so much to be desired. It took so long for our waiter to bring our drinks that we want to the bar and got them ourselves (we saw the bartender make them and the they sat there for over 10 minutes). Server would disappear for 20 minutes at a time and really put a damper on what could have been a great dining experience."}
{"text":"I can here for Yelp Restaurant Week. I'm glad I made a reservation. This place gets pretty busy on week nights. 

I started with a cocktail called Amazing Grace. It has spiced rum, strawberry, mango, peach, lime and black tea. I expected for it to be a little bit sweeter ( our waitress suggested it was one of the sweet options) but it wasn't. It had a nice flavor but I'd look forward to trying something else the next time. 

Next, I tried the calamari. It was good, I really liked that it came with peppers! It's a nice start to the meal.

For dinner, I ordered the salmon. It comes with beets but you can sub for any of the other veggies. I opted for the roasted brussel sprouts. The salmon was cooked perfectly and delicious! The mashed potatoes with truffle oil were delicious too! The brussel sprouts were a bit of a disappointment. They were a bit too crispy and dry for me. I love them roasted but these didn't do it for me. I'd absolutely order this dish again, just select another side. 

But overall, the service was good and the they have a great menu. I'm also looking forward to giving the brunch a try!"}
{"text":"Since I heard about the opening of 204 North in Charlotte, it's been on my bucket list to get there for eats and cocktails. They are all about the craft cocktail scene, which is one of my dining loves. 

The inside is stunning. It has a 20's, speakeasy feel type to it. There's a beautiful chandelier you can't miss upon walking in and walking upstairs that was custom made in Asheville.

As for the cocktails, I recommend the Ballantyne (Gin, St Germaine, strawberry, mint) and my husband recommends the Banker (bourbon, bitters, sugar, cherry). Our server informed us that they are the most popular orders. Upon trying the Ballantyne, I knew I didn't need to try anything else, I'd be fine with drinking that for the night. 

While waiting for your plates to come out, make sure to try the ciabatta bread with seasoned butter. The butter flavors change daily - we got to try a fennel orange butter, which was absolutely delicious. There was just a slight hint of orange - enough to notice, but far from overpowering. I'm hoping the next time I go I can try the strawberry rhubarb flavor!

For appetizers, we started with the fried green tomatoes with pimento cheese and a cabbage chow chow. The chow chow is a delicious vinegar topping with country ham mixed it that gave the tomatoes a bit of a sweeter taste. It was delicious and I could have eaten spoonfuls all by itself!. We also went with the fried oysters, which are soft fried, not greasy fried. They are served with quick pickles that are absolutely amazing, and the housemade buttermilk ranch is not to be missed. 

The pork chop was very succulent and flavorful. It comes served over a jambalaya type rice with black eyed peas. We also tried the salmon, which came with a fennel puree and glazed beets. The beets were very tasty, but the salmon had a little too much oil and needed some spices to tone it down. The price point at $22.00 is less than other restaurants though.

We went with our server's dessert recommendation, the sticky bun. The whiskey ice cream that comes with it was amazing, though I would have loved for the sticky bun to be served a little warmer. 

Definitely love the atmosphere inside 204 North. It's a great spot for groups or for a romantic, intimate date. They are still very new and will improve with time, but they have a great uptown location and definitely provide a different small plates dining and cocktail experience than other places off Tryon."}
{"text":"This place is a gem. We went for a girl's night out to celebrate a milestone birthday. Great cocktails, but they also have a decent selection of wine and beer. Everyone at the table raved about their meal. I had the Buffalo mac and cheese and side of roasted brussel sprouts. Simply amazing! It was so good I ate leftovers for breakfast this morning! We were put at a table in the window by the door. It could have gotten cold with people coming in and out, but they made sure to have a portable heater ready to go when we got there. Overall it was a terrific experience and I can't wait to go back with my husband for a date night."}
{"text":"at the time of this review, 204 North has 3.5 stars on yelp and I think it is deserving of at least 4, so I'm giving it a full-5 to help pump it up.

the cocktails here are really fantastic. it did take a while for the bartender to come and notice us with an almost empty bar. no eye contact upon seating, and slight attitude, but after killing him with some of my own hospitality, he switched his tude.

i wish i remembered our servers name, too, because we has on top of his game--honest, funny, water was never empty.

slightly disappointed in the lack of variety in the charcuterie plate, but it was a good size.

food all around was prepared well. good flavors. simple cuisine that is definitely worth a visit before a night on the town."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place. Great first impression when we first walked in on a Saturday night. Love the ambiance and it has a very chill vibe. The three of us were immediately seated upstairs. The first dissapoint of the night was our server. Her personality was more suited to someone working the drive through window at a fast food place.
My favorite drink of the night was the Ballantyne. I didn't care for the Dilworth. Really overpowering cucumber flavor. The pork belly app was just ok. Not bad but I've had better at other restaurants. The entrees were the burger, flat iron steak and meatloaf. Again food was ok but nothing to make me order it again. I assume the long wait for food was due to it being saturday night. The burger was ordered medium but arrived well done. When we asked the server she said their burger is too thin patties and only comes well done. Not sure why she would ask how we wanted it and then say after there is no option. 
I'm a huge dessert person so I was really really hoping they would pull through. Nope. The sticky bun with whiskey ice cream was turned down by all three of us. It is not at all the ooey gooey soft cinnamon roll you imagine. It's a plain hard roll that is drizzled in an over powering sauce. The ice cream was interesting but in no way made up for the rest. This is not a cheap place either so the bill was an extra sting given our experience. I might stop in for a drink because of the chill crowd it attracts but there a much better restaurants near by."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch on Sunday. Coffee was good. Food took forever. Ordered poached eggs which came soft boiled and tasting like vinegar. Grits were yummy. Sausage patties looked and tasted like something from the grocery store. Fruit cup was mostly melon. They should focus on the quality of their food as much as they do their image."}
{"text":"This place is cool with pretty interesting twist on traditional dishes. The cocktail selection is good and food is tasty. Cute atmosphere and deff will be back with friends."}
{"text":"I was lucky enough to be able to attend a soft opening for 204 North and I was impressed from start to finish. The interior is beautifully decorated and I could tell how much thought went into the design. The owner even put ample purse hooks throughout the bar and on some of the tables - awesome!

Every cocktail I tried was delicious. I had the bartender make me a drink based on my preferences and I would definitely order it again if it was on the menu. The Ballantyne was another personal favorite of mine and is sure to be a big seller.

Again, it was obvious that 204 dedicated a lot of time to the small touches that make an experience great. Right off the bat, we were given housemade ciabatta with a spicy olive oil dipping sauce. Sooo good. My favorite appetizer was the fried green tomatoes and housemade pimento cheese. The pimento really added to the dish and I love that they made it in house. All of of the entrees I sampled were delicious but I was really impressed by the chicken. It's so easy to mess chicken up but this dish was incredibly moist and flavorful. For dessert I tried the sticky bun. I was told that the restaurant has a pastry chef from Scotland so I look forward to trying more of his creations! 204 is a much needed addition to the area and I look forward to going back."}
{"text":"Alicia was amazing! Very attentive, personable and awesome!! Thanks for making our Monday a wonderful evening!"}
{"text":"The food, cocktails and decor are absolutely amazing. The drinks on tap will leave you in your chair wanting another \" Bulliet Exchange\" and more delicious food."}
{"text":"Disappointing.  That's the best word I can gather. RK and I came here for brunch while on long layover. Cheeseburger bun was old and stale. Fell apart as I ate it. I don't mind a messy burger when it's a great burger, but this one wasn't worth getting my hands dirty over. RK had chicken and waffles and realized upon receipt of plate it was bone in chicken - and cheap pieces like wings and thighs. Also made for a messy eat not redeemable by the flavor of the waffle.   Bloody Mary tasted like it was poured directly from a mix. Nothing special to season or add to the flavor. 

2 stars generous.  Keep searching.

********

UPDATE:  restaurant management emailed a response within an hour of this original post. Maybe you can look forward to a better burger and better experience while there. A fresh buttered and grilled brioche bun would have upgraded the burger tremendously. Boneless chicken would help the chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"Food was delicious. I got the Nashville hot chicken and it was great. The ambiance in the restaurant is beautiful. My only reason for 3 stars is that I was in a large group and the waiter accidentally charged my card twice. When I called the restaurant a manager was suppose to return my call and never did. I would still return to this establishment."}
{"text":"I loved that it was open late. The owners/managers came over to talk to us many times during our meal and the smart cocktails I had were awesome. 

The cocktails are named after areas of Charlotte, so that is fun too.

A very cool atmosphere right in the heart of Uptown that allows you to have great food and service after a show, even during the week.

Places in Uptown all seem to close at 9pm, that has always weirded me out. Every other big city, the places stay open until 2am and life doesn't stop. I am glad we found this place and were able to have a late night meal in style after seeing Heathers, the musical - which was awesome!"}
{"text":"I was not excited about the online presence or physical appearance of this place (it reads as super corporate and kind of bland, aka right at home on Tryon) but the food is really top-notch. The kitchen knows what they're doing with execution and seasoning. From a creativity standpoint, I give it a 7 out of 10.. the dishes were thoughtfully conceived without being mind-blowing. Service was very good; they handled our large party very well and graciously split the checks without being asked."}
{"text":"Had the calamari and it was disgusting. The mini potatoes were good that comes with it.   Total of 4 piece is calamari for $12. The bread is super hard but the lemon butter is flavorful.   We were kind of turned off by the service last night and will probably never come back.   Drinks were decent but some seem to be underserved or the glasses were too big. Maybe that the place has only been open for 7 days.    Still can't believe how gross the calamari was, very bland and super rubbery.  Definitely over cooked and even said that this was disgusting when the server came over but she ignored it."}
{"text":"Came for dinner and drinks before heading out for a night on the town. Great food and cocktails.  I enjoyed the buffalo Mac and cheese so much I had to bring the rest home as leftovers.  So many things I want to try on this menu.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"This place has great decor and great music. I asked the bartender to make me a Sunday walk in the park . I was not sure if he was going to make it right but he did an amazing job! It was delish. He was nice ,attentive and not annoying. The reason I did not give 5 stars was because I ordered the avacado toast and it was not at all what I expected. I usually order this at anyplace I go to for brunch. It was no where near as good as the drink. It is literal 2 pieces of wheat bread, and spread. I ordered it without egg. I'll get some thing next time. My bartender Andrew was awesome!"}
{"text":"Creative, delicious food and drinks. Friendly staff and a great atmosphere! A must go!"}
{"text":"Excellent choice for a Tuesday! Taco Tuesday 2$ each and I tried three different tacos they were all exceptional. Paul was our server and he was nothing short of being great. We had a few drinks and had a great selection to choose from. I would definitely recommend anyone to try this place out. Great atmosphere and good service, great selection!"}
{"text":"Had an amazing experience tonight. Great craft cocktails. Had the fried green tomatoes, fried oysters, and calamari for apps. They were all delicious. Dinner was delicious. Had multiple staff members ask us how everything was going throughout the entire dinner. Our server, Michael, was on point. We were there to celebrate a friend's birthday and they made it very special. Loved the vibe and will definitely return."}
{"text":"So I've been here a couple times for appetizers  and drinks and always had a good experience. The vibe is very cozy here and is welcomed to dress up or dress down. Recently I went here for a birthday brunch and the experience was as usual, great. We had a wonderful server, Orlando, that was great at accommodating a large table of indecisive girls while juggling other large graduation tables.
The food itself was great. I opted for their cheeseburger and it did not disappoint. It was cooked perfect and juicy with yummy parmesan fries to compliment. I have yet to try dinner but I look forward to it!"}
{"text":"Great brunch spot. Excellent service and awesome food. Loved the home fry skillet!  Reasonably priced spot- especially for brunch.  Thanks for a wonderful end to a fun weekend"}
{"text":"This an amendment to my initial review and lemme tell ya...it ain't good. Finally went for dinner with some friends. Saturday night, 8pm. Great beard of Zeus was it awful. The food was an absolute joke. My friend's pork chop was raw in the middle, sided with what looked like canned hop'n johns. My steak was way over cooked and the potatoes had about as much flavor as cardboard. The craft cocktails are the only saving grace for this place, but even those were subpar. Service was real bad. Our server argued with me over what drink I received (I ordered rum and got whiskey). The food took over an hour to arrive for four people. Completely unacceptable considering where you are located and the prices. Step it up guys! Uptown needs more good restaurants. 2 stars is overly generous, but my first experience was good, so I'm chocking it up to an off night?"}
{"text":"Small and quaint. Had the pork shoulder and risotto (quinoa). Both were excellent. Shoulder was cooked to perfection and the risotto was seasoned great. Price of food was not crazy. The sticky buns for dessert was prefect! Parking sucked but that is to be expected uptown at dinner time."}
{"text":"Jonathan and the Pork Belly were a dynamic pair during my midday break uptown!  Tasty local Blue Blaze recommendation was on point & the service was fit for a Queen! Kristin have that baby alreadyThis is an all around winner in every way!"}
{"text":"The worst. This place was recommended by a friend so I really had my hopes up for it. Based on all the reviews, I was absolutely ready to try the food.....too bad I didn't. The service was so horrible that I didn't even get a chance to taste the food. It took 40 mins for the server to even notice we were sitting down so when we moved to the bar to see if the service would be quicker the bartender decided to just give us a dumbfound look and continue serving everyone but us. As much as I would like to give this place another chance, I simply cannot and will not"}
{"text":"The 3.5 stars on Yelp is right on target. We decided to try it none the less.  We ordered an array of appetizers. The fried green tomatoes were really good. Calamari was extra chewy. The wedge salad was swimming in dressing. The oyster topped deviled eggs were not good. The oyster was overcooked and the deviled egg filling had absolutely no flavor. I was really excited about these but they were a let down.  You aren't going to have a terrible meal here but it's not going to be a good meal either."}
{"text":"Okay, I'm impressed.  This place is great.

They've got a creative menu, not the same-ole same-ole.  Even their trendier dishes (shrimp and grits, for example) bring a unique twist you won't find elsewhere.

Service is great, friendly and approachable.  They have interesting cocktails and good local beers on tap.  My colleagues and I all enjoyed our entrees, and my starter-salad was fresh and great.

Finally, I like the setting.  It's an old, repurposed space, and it looks and feels warm and great, especially upstairs."}
{"text":"On a recent visit we stopped in for an early lunch at 204... I will say I love the ambiance, the style and concept are great.. however the bathrooms were gross and the toilet didn't flush!! However the food was delicious, I got the hot chicken sliders and fries, super tasty lil bites! Only downside.. the drinks were overpriced and a lil too involved for my taste. I prefer 4 ingredients or less. But I will definitely return."}
{"text":"This is a Restaurant Week review and I warn this because I understand that this isn't always the best representation of a restaurant due to higher demand and limited menus. With that being said you always should completely fail... and I was quite disappointed with my experience. 

I'll start by saying we had a very stranger servers who I think had smoked some serious weed prior to her shift. She was completely spaced out and made some very strange and off putting comments. 

I was at dinner with two friends and we came to do the RW menu. We were interested in doing some wine and we were able to order glasses when the server came back because she remembered there were specials on bottle that night. We changed our order to a bottle and then the server disappeared for what felt like forever. When she returns she explains that the restaurant doesn't have enough glasses so it took her forever. (Over share from a server and makes the restaurant look bad) Then she realized one was dirty and left to find another one. We finally had the wine poured and placed our order. 

I ordered the fried green tomato app which was over sauced and the flavors clashed. I ordered a second course of Shrimp and Grits and when it arrived I had no silverware because mine were taken from the first course. The server took forever to come back so by the time I got silverware my food was cold. Then I had ordered creme burlee for dessert, as well as another gust at the table, but after dinner they told us they were out of it. I expressed my frustration because it was one of my main reasons for picking this restaurant. They brought me a menu to order something else but then two creme burlees showed up to the table. 

Needless to say when the check arrived it was split up wrong as well because like I have explained all aspects of service were pretty awful. 

I feel that this place needs to refine its food and service if they are going to try to play with the big dogs in Uptown. There are so many interesting fun places that are competing with them and they need to step up their game!"}
{"text":"We came in on a busy Sat night. The food and drinks came out very quick given the volume. Orlando was our server and as busy as he was, he was super friendly and attentive. We had a great time and will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Staff was extremely nice, but not very attentive.  We ordered the Ballantyne specialty cocktail, which was absolutely delicious, as were the shrimp and grits.  The other items we ordered were very \"meh.\"  The calamari (and yes, we knew it wasn't fried, but wanted to try it anyway.)  The sauce and accompanying potatoes were flavorful, and I would order that as a side alone.  The calamari itself was very bland and added nothing to the dish.  We also ordered the spring pea ravioli, and it was disappointing as well.  Nothing to pinpoint as awful, just not very good, and certainly would not recommend or order again.  As a carb lover, I appreciate a restaurant who brings a basket of homemade bread, but in this case, I'd rather save the calories.  

TLDR: go for the cocktails, and then somewhere else for dinner."}
{"text":"Atmosphere is great.  Exposed brick and duct work. Service is great.  Food taste like fast food.  Had the fish sandwich which was over fried.  Roll was good  Friend had burger which if they don't ask how you like it cooked...you know way your getting."}
{"text":"This place had a hipster vibe with a mix of rustic farm tables and metal chandeliers. The banquet gave it a soft touch and the big window overlooking Tryon brought in good light.


The lunch menu wasn't overly complicated. Several salads and sandwiches. I opted for the burger( grass feed beef, American cheese, heirloom tomatoes, bib lettuce, caramelized onions and house sauce on a brioche bun) which was  delicious however the bun had a weird texture on the outside. I would order again.

Service was fast, maybe too fast. Before we could sit down the waitress asked what would we like to drink. The fish was not available and instead of telling us politely and apologetically, we were told, \"we have shrimp instead of fish today\". Huh? Okay, try selling the shrimp and maybe offer some details about it. We also didn't get any refills on drinks until our meal was over. And our plates were taken w/o being asked if we were done."}
{"text":"I love this place. Came for a team dinner so was able to try a few things on the menu. For appetizers tried the and it was really good. For the entree I had the shrimp and grits it was good but wanted a little more shrimp but had a really good flavor. One of my coworkers had the meatloaf delicious, not what you would expect a little spice but not over powering, the green beans were crisp and the mashed potatoes were really good. I had a side spinach salad and it was so good! Was not saturated in salad dressing really fresh and just enough of the feta, grapes, walnuts and ham.. although it tasted like pancetta. And the Brussel sprouts loved them! For dessert I couldn't make up my mind so my coworker and I split the cheese cake and sticky bun.. he cheese cake was good but not what I expected no crust on it, had a really good flavor melt in your mouth.. the sticky bun and whiskey ice cream... well that was definitely a dessert left me wanting more. This is definitely a place I will be coming back to in Charlotte NC."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch was a hit! I attended for the first time for a friend's birthday brunch and there were personalized menus awaiting us at the table. Two very attentive servers handled our large party well. I had the chicken and French toast (subbed out the waffle), a side of home fries and several mimosas...very tasty! I shall return!!"}
{"text":"Delicious entrees, American style but with a twist. They have great cocktails and brunch. If you like something sweet, order an Amazing Grace."}
{"text":"Only thing better than the service was the food. Cocktails fantastic, fried green tomatoes appetizer was the best, entree was delicious and desert no words how good."}
{"text":"My first time dining at 204 was for brunch during the Charlotte pride parade and they were so accommodating and friendly when we kept adding guests to our table. The staff was extremely friendly and gave us great service even though our table was large and all on separate checks. 

We all started with drinks of course, and they did not disappoint. They have a slushy alcoholic drink in an actual slushy machine behind the bar that's delish and so stylish looking. They run drink specials too. 

I ordered the avocado toast and the mint chocolate waffles and I died and went to heaven. The waffles had so much flavor and were such a nice breakfast treat. The avocado toast wasn't my favorite, but it wasn't bad. My friend ordered the Benedict, and she said it was awesome. 

204 is a little fancier and more pricey for dinner, but brunch was reasonable. I had dinner  reservations here and their menu looked great, but had to cancel due to an illness. They were very understanding and followed up via email which was a nice personal touch."}
{"text":"This place is really, really nice. Decor, seating, staff, cocktails, beer list, are all top notch. It feels transplanted from another city. This place was described as slotting in the 'middle' for uptown in a lot of the previews and anticipatory articles. I'm not exactly sure what that means, but this place is much higher end than I expected based on that description. Food prices are as high as any other nice restaurant in uptown. We had the fried oysters, calamari, a burger (all very good) and saw plenty of other dishes pass by that looked great. Apps are $11-$12 and not huge portions, burger was good but at $16 it's amongst the most expensive burgers in town. Every entree is mid-$20's with no side. A la cart sides are $7. Signature cocktails are all $12; off menu cocktails climb from there ($15 margarita), beers are pretty much all $5-$6. So again this place is awesome; but I guess I was expecting it to slot somewhere just above Alexander Michaels and close to Sea Level or 131 Main, and while the drink prices I think hit the mark, the food is still pretty expensive and keeps it more in line with Roosters, Halcyon, Kings Kitchen, Mimosa, and the Cellar at Duckworths. Will be back for drinks often but not as regularly for dinner as I'd hoped."}
{"text":"Save your money.  Server couldn't think of one dish that diners loved so strike number one.  We decided on sharing the deviled eggs & spinach salad (eggs were tasteless) and I got the salmon while my friend got the hot chicken with coleslaw/mac & cheese.  Hot chicken was the way to go.....I picked off her plate and barely touched the salmon, which was just ok.  Here's a hint:  train your servers to be positive and show enthusiasm about the cuisine.   Gets two stars for wine Monday otherwise 1."}
{"text":"Have been dying to try this cute little niche for a while now and I finally made it...had to cut thru the parade to finally see what my social media frenzy was about. 204 doesn't disappoint and I can't wait to come back for more!!!"}
{"text":"I can only speak to a work lunch I had there so I'll have to try again.  I got the tacos and side dish for $10 which is a great deal they offer for lunch.  I thought the tacos were good not great.  More and more places are doing craft tacos now, especially in and around uptown, and these were not especially creative or tasty.  To be more specific I had the pork belly and steak taco and thought both were somewhat bland in spices while the meats were good quality.  I got the vegetable medley side and thought this was the best and tastiest thing I got.  Overall the service was good and the ambiance was very good for a $10 sit down lunch.  Definitely a great  place for a classier, more formal lunch setting complete with white table cloths.  I will return to try a few more items and update this review."}
{"text":"I got the fried chicken sandwich and the pimento cheese was cold and whatever sauce was on it did not work well with the other flavors. My Brussel sprouts were practically raw.  They charged me $2.75 for an unsweet tea that was empty for my entire meal. Not one refill.  To top it off, a friend joined us to get a to-go order and the server did not bring him his change assuming a $10 tip."}
{"text":"Alicia is wonderful!!!  We had a great experience b/c of her excellent service!!!  The food was great and her recommendations were on point!"}
{"text":"Great brunch!  Nice atmosphere and delicious cocktails. The menu is straightforward but with good variety. I ordered the sangria which was perfectly sweet with just enough tang. The deviled egg and fried oyster appetizer was super tasty- great flavor in the oysters. And my entree was choose your own breakfast- simple but each detail well executed. This places uses the freshest ingredients. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Just a follow up on my review. I got a call Tim Trainer(sp) a manager there. He listened to my story and apologized and said he hoped he could turn into a customer. He also acknowledged that the $24 was too high and blamed it on their computer system. Said he would correct it. He also said,\"we're new here\". Like that should matter???

 He said he would send me a gift card or something, to which I said, was not necessary but he insisted.

Just for the record, the gift card never arrived. Lost in the mail?...maybe. Doubt it!
Bad eats!!! These are not good business people. Stay away."}
{"text":"204 North is off to a decent start. A coworker and I stopped in a Tuesday night after work for drinks and food, and we sat at the downstairs bar. I immediately noticed and loved the atmosphere - dark, rustic, dropped lighting, etc. I also noticed the vast bourbon selection behind the bar!

The bartender was nice and seemed like he desperately wanted to be knowledgeable, but when I changed glasses of wine, he poured the new wine in the old glass. Ugh. He also told us the calamari and fried green tomatoes were their best sellers, so we took his advice. I gotta say, I wasn't too impressed. The calamari was pretty rubbery, and the fried green tomatoes were really heavily battered, so all they tasted like were breading. Thankfully, the pimento cheese on top helped save them.

I SO appreciated that the downstairs bar had hooks for purses, but I also found the stools pretty awkward since I kept sliding out of them, and they wouldn't turn all the way so that my friend and I could face each other. We wound up having to get up to physically turn the whole chair. 

I'll definitely give 204 North another chance since I desperately want them to succeed. Uptown needs a nice restaurant like this at this price point ($54 for 4 glasses of wine and 2 appetizers)."}
{"text":"Hubby and I took a weekend trip to Charlotte. 4 stars for cocktails but 1 star for food. We came 2 nights in a row because the cocktail selection was very good and made perfectly. We also liked the atmosphere and the bartenders. The second night we ordered off the wine list. Both enjoyed our wine selection. We also ordered fried green tomatoes which we typically love. However, they were not too appetizing. They were warm in some sections and cold in others. There was one little spoonful of a thick pimento cheese that was not as flavorful as I would have expected. It was topped with a small slice of deli style ham but would have been better if the ham was thick diced and caramelized or replaced it with bacon. In the end we decided not to order our dinner here. Would go back for the cocktails and wine any night."}
{"text":"We went on Valentine's Day, already expected service to be lacking because it's such a busy evening in the restaurant industry.  We had a very inattentive waiter who disappeared for 30 minutes at one point.  He didn't remember orders well, he never checked on us once we received our food (nearly 1.5 hours later),  didn't clear menus once we'd ordered, never refilled waters, etc.  My actual dinner was delicious (tagliatelle bolognese) and well worth $18.  My friends had one miss with a drink that was an unusual flavor (queen Charlotte punch?) but their new choices (Dilworth something and Ballantyne) were some of the best cocktails I've had.  A manager, Brandon, saw that we weren't thrilled and did a great job at asking what went wrong and trying to redeem the experience.  We'll all be back on another night because it seems like a good spot."}
{"text":"Good food, nice atmosphere. Chill place for Saturday brunch. Limited parking available but parking deck around the corner. Not mind blowing so no five stars, but very good anyway."}
{"text":"Food was really good. But the service was terrible. We had to wait forever for drinks. The waitress talked up the special \"Sunday Supper\" but when we ordered they were our of one of the salads..at 6:30 pm. The staff was not attentive at all and there were at least 4 waitstaff on the floor just standing by the bar. Sad because the food was good and it was our second time here. The service was so bad so we will not be back."}
{"text":"I am not hard to please.

This is the 2nd time I've been to 204 North. The first time was a week ago for lunch and although it was underwhelming (tacos fell apart, friend's salad had chicken on it that looked like it was chopped after being pulled out of a can, etc.), I gave them another chance.

I won't be returning.

Where to begin. The drinks were watered down on top of being overpriced. There were 20+ minute gaps where we'd order a new drink and wouldn't get anything back, sometimes not even a refill on the water either. The food was abysmal. We ordered the charcuterie and cheese plate, calamari, fried oysters, and sticky bun. Strangely, the sticky bun came out 5 minutes before everything else, and was so hard and cold that I could have thrown it through their window. When the other food items arrived, we didn't even have silverware or plates and had to ask for them when they rushed away without checking. Bizarre. 

I have literally never asked for the manager in a restaurant, but had to when we got the check that included all of the food (over half of which was sent back). They came out and gave us the typical sob story about being understaffed that night and sometimes you just have a bad day, blah blah blah, but after reading other reviews of this place I think it must be pretty commonplace. 

TL;DR version - do not go to 204 North."}
{"text":"Saw that there was Nashville Hot on the menu while searching online for a place to go.  Purposely went there just to try it.  It was actually a piece of chicken with some type of sweet brown sugar coating.  It was not good at all and did not resemble Nashville Hot in any way.  I would rename it \"Nashville Not\"!  Do NOT waste your time or money!"}
{"text":"We were really excited about this place. Great food selection and great flavors. Good pours on the wine and awesome cocktail selection. Under impressed with the service. We waited over 45 minutes for a table when we were told 15. Our waitress then didn't check on us until we were done eating. If they can figure out the service aspect and attentiveness and maintain their bathrooms better, this could be a real gem."}
{"text":"Solid spot for drinks and food. I've been many times for early evening drinks that feature a nice selection of cocktails and beer. For food, I've only eaten lunch here during the workweek. Simple menu with a focus on fresh ingredients. Great atmosphere with exposed brick, dark woods, and touches of prohibition era style.

Tip: $2 taco Tuesdays special is one of the best deals in terms of bang for your buck for fancier tacos"}
{"text":"Came by for a work lunch on a Monday. The staff was extremely accommodating for a large group (about 10) and got us in and out in less than an hour, way to go! I ordered the chicken Caesar wrap and a coworker got the pulled pork with pimento cheese sandwich, I was very jealous! My Caesar wrap was surprisingly tasty, with a welcomed surprise of sun-roasted tomatoes. Good flavors and my fries were top notch. Everyone seemed to be very pleased with their food. I will come update my review after tasting a cocktail or two. I was very jealous I couldn't indulge during the day! Loved the decor, especially the outside. Great addition to that side of town, I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Just now getting around to this review after a month. Service was slow on Valentines Day and it took forever to get our bottle of wine and order, even though it wasn't very busy. Our drinks finally came out at the same time as dinner...... But that's only the beginning because I ordered the lamb chops and was so excited all day to order them as I had seen a picture of them on social media and they looked great. As you can see in the picture I took, they looked great presentation wise when I ordered them too. Im a huge foodie and love trying new places. I eat out in uptown Charlotte every day. I ate my dinner, seemingly fine, leaving the restaurant to go home and enjoy our short night together. About an hour after leaving the restaurant, I was rushed with sickness and my Valentine's Day night was spent violently vomiting in my bathroom for the next 12 hours straight. I had to call out to work the next day because I had not slept all night long due to throwing up and intense stomach cramping to the point of almost fainting. My boyfriend was so upset that he made the reservation here and that I left with some sort of food borne illness.... this is a new restaurant that I was excited to start going to since it's a block from my work but I don't know if I can go back now."}
{"text":"This place is kind of awesome. I didn't have a cocktail I didn't love and the food was top notch. The dishes are delicious with local Carolina ingredients and they are different than traditional preparation - such as nonfried calamari. You can tell there's a southern inspiration behind their dishes which is a nice tribute to the area but they are also tweaked to doubly appeal to the Charlotte transplants. Fantastic location. Perfect interior decor with the historic brick and exposed joists. I enjoyed the staircase and appropriate chandelier at the entryway. 

Quick hitters:
-I love the Lake Wylie cocktail - bourbon based, egg white for extra body, with lemon and sweetness. Can't beat it
-House-made Caesar is really good and the croutons are from their bread we all love (genius)
-The house-made pimiento is great (fried tomatoes were a hit)
-Shrimp n grits are creamy for a change and awesome
-North Carolina Trout is soo good, chicken is as moist as I've ever had, and flank steak is money
-MUST GET: Sticky bun!! It's unbelievable. There's even a dab of ice cream on it! This is my new late night secret...which isn't likely to be a secret very long"}
{"text":"I've been to 204 many times since they've opened. For just drinks, dinner, and brunch. Hand down the best brunch in Charlotte. 10/10 would recommend!"}
{"text":"Some girlfriends and I checked out 204 North during Yelp restaurant week (March 2018). The atmosphere was really cute and trendy and the menu looked amazing. We ordered 3 appetizers, entrees and sides. The food was both a hit and a miss. Here's why:

Appetizers: Deviled Eggs with a Fried Oyester, Fried Green Tomatoes, Callimari

The appetizers were nice, but nothing extroidinary. The Callimari was the most dissappointing. No unique take or twist and the marinara sauce it was served with was definitely canned. The fried green tomatoes tasted good, and I love a good deviled egg. Theae did have their own twist with the friend oyester on top which we all really liked. 

Entrees: Salmon with Truffle Potatoes and Beets in Sorghum 

AMAZING. The portion was generous and SO delicious. The truffle potatoes were heaven and I could've eaten those beets forever. The salmon was a generous size and all in all this was the BEST thing. All of my friends agreed that their entrees were the best prepared amongst our orders.

Sides: Mac and Cheese and Brussel Sprouts

These were terrible. They both came out ice cold and were a total let down. The mac and cheese was not authentic and the brussel sprouts lacked flavor. We also felt that each of our entrees came with enough food and that nobody really needed the sides. A definite pass from me!

Desserts: These were our favorite part of our meal, however they are the only thing that 204 North doesn't make in house. The desserts come from Suarez Bakery which I definitely need to check out next. We had a sticky bun and carrot cake. They were out of the brownie and didn't have any other chocolate desserts (a bummer!).

So that's a wrap! Some things were ok, and others were major disappointments. There is no validated or direct parking for 204 North, but garages are only a block away."}
{"text":"Highly recommend 204!! Amazing location, great atmosphere and awesome good. A the \"must try\" restaurant this season. I like 204 more than the Cellar at Duckworth (if you're trying to decide). I will definitely be going back again soon!"}
{"text":"I'm in Charlotte on an evacuation vacation after escaping Hurricane Irma, so I decided to make the best of it! I had dinner at the bar here the other night, and it was fabulous!

Very lively ambiance in general. Great energy!

My bartender was Alex. She was so sweet and provided impeccable service!

I got 3 small plates because I wanted to try different things. Favorite item was spicy garlic shrimp. The sauce on them was amazing! The wedge salad was also awesome--very fresh ingredients. The deviled eggs were also yummy. Each one is topped with a fried oyster, so they were definitely decadent but well worth it!

And of course I left Alex talk me into the chocolate cake for dessert, although I honestly didn't need much convincing, and it was worth every calorie!

Had a really great time here, I'll likely make it back before I head home!"}
{"text":"Just came here for a work dinner. Overall, a really decent restaurant. The atmosphere is cozy, a bit trendy, but still very inviting. 

I ordered the Nashville Hot Chicken, which was pretty good - nothing to write home about, because it was a bit on the dry side and the chicken coating kept separating from the chicken.

The Mac and Cheese side was also pretty bland. Would not recommend.

The Brussel Sprouts on the other hand are highly recommended. They are very sweet, so be ready for that, but are really delicious! I would loved to have had 2 orders of Brussels instead of my Mac and cheese.

The beer and cocktail list is pretty extensive with lots of local beer options.

Overall a solid choice for a work dinner, but nothing to go out of your way for."}
{"text":"Stopped here for lunch and enjoyed the chicken and shrimp tacos along with the parmesan fries. The drinks were good and the service was pretty decent as well."}
{"text":"What a great addition to uptown Charlotte.  Popped in here for a quick mid-day bite to eat and to finally check this place out.  We were greeted by all smiles and sat at the bar for easy access and instant service.

I tried the deviled eggs (with a twist because of a mini fried oyster atop it) and the smoke chicken wings.  Both really well done and both hit the spot to tame my hunger.

In addition they had a bloody mary bar and a great selection of cocktails alongside draft and bottle beer selections to surely satisfy.

The interior is warm and cozy and trending along with other new locations by way of the use of tufted leather seating, wood and steel elements."}
{"text":"Disappointed, the menu was pretty boring with no interesting or standout items and what we ordered wasn't great.  Had heard good things about the cocktails but they were just OK. I was hoping for something with a little more cache, felt a little like a much weaker version of the cellar at duckworths (which is great)"}
{"text":"Good place in the heart of downtown. It's located right near some great bars and clubs so good place for dinner before hitting the town. I came in on a Saturday night for dinner and had a reservation. I was seated as soon as I came in. We were sat on floor one near the bar. The waitress was nice! She did an amazing job at checking in on us, timeliness of the food, etc. I had the spicy garlic shrimp for the app it had a nice kick to it. Presentation was nice. For dinner I had the salmon. Loved the beets! The potato's were super thick, but you could tell they were fresh. We ended up skipping dessert because we were so full.  The sticky buns people ordered looked good. My drink, southern slipper (I think) was tasty not too sweet with a good creep up on you liquor.  If you check in on yelp you get 20% off. My only hang up was the chairs. The seating at some of the tables are bar stools. Those stools hurt your buttons don't provide much support for your back! They need to invest in new seats ASAP."}
{"text":"Great food and awesome drinks. I checked out this place on yelp restaurant week but who cares about a discount when the food and drinks are this good. The deviled eggs are really really good and I'm not even a big deviled egg eater. The meat and cheese tray is easily made for sharing so order and enjoy."}
{"text":"We held my son's rehearsal dinner for 60, with a welcome reception of drinks for 30 more at 204 North Kitchen.  We had the entire upstairs to ourselves for the entire evening.  Tori was fantastic, responsive and answered most emails within a day.  She helped with menu suggestions, seating arrangements, and accepting flowers from the vendor.  She helped design and print personalized drink menus with creative drink names.  Stafford assisted with the day of the event, moving tables, getting candles for tables and coordinating staff.  There were plenty of bar tenders and wait staff to keep the buffet dishes filled, the drinks flowing and the dishes cleared. The atmosphere was casual but classy, and encouraged guests to mingle.  They even personalized the chalk boards for our event! Our guests loved the food, especially the meatloaf, shrimp and grits, Nashville chicken and brussel sprouts. I can't praise this venue and this staff enough.  I highly recommend it for your next event."}
{"text":"The shrimp sandwich and fries where good. Great atmosphere. what I would expect eating at a restaurant in the queens."}
{"text":"Food was very below average and drinks were ok. Service was decent. Overall I was disappointed."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I were walking by there Tuesday, stopped in for a drink and it was taco Tuesday. What a pleasure. We've been trying to find a bomb taco shop here in town for a while now and haven't had much luck. And this isn't even a taco shop. Dude, this place is doing it right. Had the pork belly and the steak taco gf had the steak and the chx. They were all amazing. Honestly I'm from LA and she's from Vegas and honestly we've been let down here with the taco seen and we've tried, southbound, Babaloo, Bakersfield. But this place is a hidden gem.  Thank you."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant! Food was delicious and the service was above and beyond. We went there for dinner on a Saturday and had a reservation but it wasn't super crowded so we probably would've been okay without one. The manager sat us at our table and started chatting with us when we sat down. She was SO fun and bubbly and we hit it off with her immediately. She brought us free drinks and kept checking in with us throughout the night. She gave us her business card at the end of the night so we could stay in touch. She definitely made the whole experience more fun and we loved chatting with her! Our waitress was very nice too - the service in general was fantastic. The food was also very good - I had the beet salad and I enjoyed it immensely. The calamari was also a hit, as was the salmon and the berry cobbler for dessert. I don't have a single bad thing to say about this restaurant; it was fun and delicious and a wonderful evening all around. 100% definitely recommend 204 North!"}
{"text":"We went here for a nice Friday date night. We had a 7:15 reservation, but it wasn't entirely necessary since there were a good number of open tables when we arrived. It only started getting busy around 8pm. The atmosphere was beautiful which exposed brick, repurposed wood, and Edison bulbs. Great space!

We started out with drinks and ordered the Ballantyne which was an excellently crafted gin and strawberry cocktail. Very refreshing! For dinner, I ordered the lobster Mac and cheese. It had huge chunks of lobster in it and a great breadcrumb topping, perfectly browned. The cheese itself was a little too \"orange\" for me, but that could just be my personal cheese type preference. It came with a side of roasted veggies which were well seasoned and a nice compliment to the cheesy main dish. We heard the sticky bun was a must-do for dessert, but we were pretty full, so they were kind enough to box it up for us. We haven't had it yet, so I'll update soon!"}
{"text":"I've only been once, but it was a really good experience.

I got the salmon with beets and mashed potatoes and loved it! I'm a big fan of beets but I'm really particular in how they are cooked. These were roasted and I think they had a sweet glaze to them; the consistency was just right. The mashed potatoes were great, but what isn't great if you had truffle oil to it? The salmon was good, too, but the sides really made the dish for me. 

My husband ordered the flat iron steak. It comes with a side of carrots and turnips, which he said he would've preferred to have been cooked a little longer. I liked them, though. They weren't raw by any means but definitely had a crunch to them. 

We shared an order of devil egg appetizers. If you try nothing else at this place, try those. They are topped with fried oysters which gives them such a nice flavor and texture. In our case, our server forgot to put the order in, so they comp'ed them for us. He was upfront about it and I almost told him to just cancel, since we got our entrees first. He convinced us to try them anyway and I'm so glad he did.

The service and vibe are nice. Everyone was very friendly. And aside from the mishap with the delayed appetizer, which worked out in our favor in the end and was clearly an honest mistake, it was fast. I like the design and layout of the place. It did a good job of feeling upscale-casual -- not snobby at all but feels nice enough for a date night, girls' night out, or even a work lunch.

I hope to go back soon to see if the service and food are consistent. I've seen a few negative reviews but so many factors can contribute to a one-time bad experience; I'm hoping those bad experiences are the exception and not the rule. I'd love to have a new 'go-to' restaurant uptown for when we catch a show at Belk Theater (that's why we were there) and so far this seems like a good fit."}
{"text":"I've only been for brunch, I wasn't throughly impressed because to me the prices didn't line up with quality/taste. The food wasn't bad, just uninspired. Lacked a lot of flavor. My eggs came out cold, though they did replace them it took a while to get them out. The fruit was fresh. They had great game day beverage options though, and that I could appreciate. The service was also decent. Just wish they'd work on the food a little bit."}
{"text":"A recent Restaurant Week visit to this popular Uptown spot left my wife and I very disappointed and wondering what all the fuss was about. While I loved the Wild Mushroom Ravioli I ordered for my appetizer, the Salmon I tried for my main course was dry and flavorless, and the Pork Tenderloin my wife ordered just wasn't particularly memorable. 

For dessert, my wife ordered the Turtle Cheesecake, which was just OK, and I finished off a forgettable Creme Brulee. The high points of the meal were the excellent service and the extensive beer and wine selection, complete with a number of local craft brews on tap. 

I really wanted to like 204 North, but unless our recent dinner experience was an aberration, I wouldn't recommend it for anything more than after-hour cocktails and munchies."}
{"text":"Great food! Great wine and Alicia is awesome!  Try the mahi-mahi and the Pinot noir!!! Awesome atmosphere- perfect for groups!"}
{"text":"Just had the calamari and the shrimp and grits, both were amazing but I think the highlight was the cocktails. Very well done !"}
{"text":"This place is FANTASTIC. The cocktails are exquisite, the food amazing, the staff is incredibly kind and helpful, the atmosphere is lovely. I can't recommend this place enough, they're just doing it all right. My boyfriend and I have been here several times in the last few weeks as it's across from my work, and it's been great every time."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by a friend so I had to try it out. I love the scenery and decor of this place, and great location. I went with friends to have drinks and dinner. The drink were great, we all had a different drink. I recommend the Banker or 4th ward. Now let's talk about this amazing Lobster Mac and cheese. Right now I would say it the best in town. Service also great."}
{"text":"This place gets three stars because our two servers were great. I was part of a dinner party with approximately 15-20 people. The host offered a prefixe menu and it seemed that the restaurant may not have been prepared to handle the large order. The food was good, but our entrees and desserts came out cooked very differently. For example, several people at the table ordered the sticky bun and several were over cooked (to the point you couldn't eat the outside layer because it was so hard) and a few came out undercooked. There was also a significant wait time between ordering and the food being served. I didn't try many restaurants while I was in Charlotte but suspect that you can find better options for dinner."}
{"text":"We came here for brunch, with advanced reservations that were clearly unnecessary.  The location was never full-up at any point.  Because we had a reserved table, we were in the front window right next to the entrance.  This is relevant because of three things.  (1) We were completely on display the entire meal.  (2) We were actually seated in front of the hostess podium where we could see the manager glaring at us to leave after we had finished eating, even though the location was 1/4 full and we ordered drinks.  (3) It was so very cold, both from the full glass window but also from the door opening and never fully closing and a general draft in the area.  Suffice to say, this may not be a good choice for people who specifically call in advance to let you know they are coming and want a pleasurable experience--unless you are trying to punish them for good behavior and discourage them from visiting in the future.

When seated, we were given four different menus, but no explanation.  When the server came back and asked to take our orders, I asked her to explain the different menus which did indeed have duplications.  There was a brunch menu with brunch cocktails, a special brunch menu with the same items and similar cocktails, and two drinks menus with--you guessed it, more cocktails (and other drinks, of course).  We ordered two burgers, an omelette, crab cakes Benedict, and avocado toast.  My avocado toast came out almost 30 minutes before anything else arrived.  Seriously.  Awkward.  Also, it wasn't very good.  I liked the bread they used and that there was really a good amount of mashed avocado.  But it didn't taste like avocado.  It tasted like lemon.  Pretty much exclusively like lemon.  And that's despite the egg and red pepper flakes on top.  So I really won't be doing that again.  

When the rest of the food came, the Benedict was my least favorite.  The crab cakes were tangy, super tangy, and there was no starch.  No muffin, no side, noting.  Turns out the waitress forgot to let me select a side, bringing out french fries pretty much at the time the eating was done.  So one item way too early, one item way too late.  I think we've got something to work towards here, 204...  The farmer's omelette tasted delicious.  But it got cold very quickly.  More quickly than anything else.  That was sad because I think it was my favorite.  The only thing I would change would be to do it with egg whites only next time.  The burgers were probably the best all-around choice, and the fries that came with the burgers were nice.

The checks were pre-split for us and brought to the table quickly without us requesting them, which wasn't necessary but we weren't going to refuse.  I didn't appreciate the manager coming up to the hostess podium just to glare at us for not leaving immediately when there were clearly other patrons around also sitting and chatting (it _is_ brunch) and also no one was clamoring for our table--or any table for that matter.  Was it really necessary?  No.  Nevertheless, we got the message and went elsewhere for another round of drinks.  They didn't kick us out for sitting and talking and patronizing their location and consumables.  

I didn't know about the yelp check-in deal (20% off), but for Uptown Charlotte, the prices were standard, maybe even a bit lighter.  That said, I don't see myself returning when other locations do brunch right and behave like they want my business."}
{"text":"This was our one and only dinner choice for the weekend. We weren't that hungry so we ordered appetizers and sides. Everything we ordered was great! The fried green tomatoes has a hint of sweetness. The Nashville hot chicken sliders were hot and sweet. The addition of Brussel sprits were spot on with glaze and crisp. Great place to catch up on some food!"}
{"text":"I'm the first to admit that expensive drinks are typically overrated, but I will also say that the cocktail menu at 204 North Kitchen & Cocktails ($12/drink) was absolutely worth the fun Saturday night splurge. 

My husband and I stopped here for a couple of post-dinner drinks at around 9:30 pm. The place was definitely buzzing but we were lucky enough to snag a corner seat at the bar. There was a private party going on upstairs but we were happy with the downstairs vibe - some people still eating dinner, but most mingling and drinking as we millennials do. (Not saying it's a bar strictly for millennials - I'll give a shoutout to some Gen Xers that were hanging out, too!!) 

We both loved The Wesley Heights cocktail -- seriously delicious. The \"secret sauce\" as dictated by the menu is magical - leaves a slightly sweet, slightly spicy aftertaste. The cocktail menu overall is a fun read with the nods to different areas of CLT. 

Around 10:15ish, the vibe changed to more of a club atmosphere (lowered lights, loud music, but great picks...can't complain when Justin Timberlake is played multiple times in the first 30 minutes). People were dancing and having a great time, but it never felt overly-crowded. Overall, will definitely be back to 204 for a fun night out."}
{"text":"Beautiful design and laid back setting.  We started off with the Fried Green tomatoes.  They were really good and the side of pimento cheese and chow chow was a nice combination.  

We ordered the meatloaf and pimento cheese ravioli for entrees, but they were out of both.  I will give them a pass...hopefully it's because both are really good.  Our backups were the seared Steak and Lobster Mac n Cheese.  Both were good, but didn't blow us away.  The Mac N Cheese comes with a delicious corn side..my only complaint is that there wasn't more of it.    

The desert was by far the best part!  Their warm sticky bun with butterscotch ice cream is worth the trip itself!"}
{"text":"Like others have said, went for dinner & drinks...should've kept it to just drinks. 
The drinks were great. No argument there at all.
The fried green tomatoes tasted \"meh\", but more memorably, they came out looking like cafeteria food. Horrible presentation...laughable really. 

We both ordered burgers. The kicker was that we had to ask the manager if we could place an order. Our waitress just didn't seem to have any sort of grasp on timing. We also had to ask for our check at the end of the meal...after our table had been cleared and drinks finished. She came by and \"checked on us\" but seemed totally caught off guard when we requested the bill, like it never even occurred to her that we'd be ready to go.

Lastly was this weird light thing. Periodically thru the meal, there was this random strobe light above us that would flash. Thankfully no one had a seizure.

Will go back for drinks, but that's it."}
{"text":"We slipped in right before the kitchen was about to shut down and the servers were really gracious about it. Food came out hot, fresh, and as-ordered. Chicken sliders and The Banker cocktail hit the spot. The pork belly was fun too. Plus, they were playing Seattle music. Bonus!"}
{"text":"Gah. Shame on me. Came here once before and got a few drinks, pork belly appetizer, and dessert. The drinks were overpriced, appetizer wasn't very good and was a tiny portion, and dessert wasn't memorable. The only thing memorable was a gigantic cockroach crawling up the wall next to us. The server ended up taking care of our bill so we left a nice tip and thought we'll try it again after it's been up and running awhile. Came here for Queens Feast on a Tuesday night. They still have a condensation problem on the pipes because I kept getting dripped on the entire night. The service was super slow. We were there for 2 hours and 45 minutes... I got the fried green tomatoes which were surprisingly good. Also got the salmon which was under salted but the other 2 people that got the salmon thought it was over salted so maybe they salted theirs instead of mine? Ordered the sticky buns but by the time they brought out dessert they had run out so I got the peach shortcake which was really dry and didn't have enough cream to compensate. Also they had balsamic dots to plate which I thought was chocolate. The balsamic decor did not go well at all with the shortcake. Overall food and service was underwhelming."}
{"text":"We went to 204 specifically for the cocktails. It's next to a busy club offers a more mature theme. 

My girlfriend suggested we visit after a work outing. When we arrived we were welcomed and sat right at the bar. Charles was our bartender and he took good care of us. He helped us pick from among their selection of drinks and even had a few of his own concoctions. 

He was very personable and knowledgeable. The bar has its own kitchen. I had a burger and we shared some pork belly. They have bar and high top seating.

The cocktails were delicious and are among the best in Charlotte. We will definitely return and sample more of their creative cocktails."}
{"text":"Finally this place is open and is ready to serve Charlotte. 

The interior is like nothing you've seen in Charlotte. True character. 100+ year old brick and exposed beams fill the massive space. I love the wood tables and the incredible chandelier. 

The drink menu is straight forward and creative. All drinks are $12 which is a good price and easy to not have to chase down prices. I had the Ballantyne and Myers Park. Both were expertly made. 

Staff was super friendly and while it was a soft opening, everyone seemed to be hitting their marks. This place will provide uptown with a \"middle\". Not a gross college/bro bar (like every bar that surrounds it) and not a uber high end place. Glad to see its finally open and delivers."}
{"text":"I love this little bar and kitchen.  Cool bartender, although he took a few minutes to warm up.  2 TV's though they weren't sure how to change the channels yet.  Nice selection of liquor and I like that the names of their specialty cocktails were based on Charlotte neighborhoods... no Eastland though.

This little bar is actually quite large with a separate bar/tv area with dining on the 2nd level with some larger tables overlooking the street.

Decent music playing as the bartender has some control over that and was playing some good blues music when we were in.

Tried the taco trio and out of all of them I'd say go with the pork belly taco.  The fish one wasn't crispy at all and the steak and chicken ones were just ok flavor.  I definitely want to go back and try some other stuff though and I'm looking forward to it.

They've only been open about a month or so, but I think it's a nice addition to the area and a nice vibe."}
{"text":"I went for Mother's Day brunch this morning and it was delicious! We had the deviled eggs, they were incredible! I ordered one to go and I've been looking for a recipe every since I left. I had the Butcher's omelet with caramelized onions instead of jalapenos and omg! So good. My mom got the farmer's omelet and she loved it as did my dad with his home fry skillet. Orlando was our waiter and he was incredible! Very nice and attentive to his tables. If I lived in town I would already be back for dinner!"}
{"text":"We arrived about 12:45pm on a Sunday, were seated quickly,  but then the wait began. We sat for 15 minutes while the manager and hostess had a pow wow right by our table. Finally, a waitress asked if we had been waited on. Her name was Gina and she did an amazing job taking care of us. We both had the 204 Omelet, no flavor, barely any cheese, very disappointing. The table next to us had the same issues so it seems this place seats tables but fails to let the waitresses know."}
{"text":"Came in tonight with some of my girlfriends for a quick app and bev before heading out for dinner. Because of the AMAZING staff, we ended up canceling our resos at another local establishment and planted ourselves here! The decor is fun, and cozy. Just the kind of place you want to find yourself hanging out and enjoying time with friends without having to scream over bad music....gross. As for the food..........LIFE CHANGING! I mean I'm not one to slap a MAMA but the shrimp and grits where \"slap your MAMA AMAZING!\" WARNING...... come and get them ASAP before I eat all that they have! I have never been one for crazy cocktails but thought what the heck it's girls night ill give it a go so I ordered the Amazing Grace. Not only is the story behind the cocktail so great but the flavors came together perfectly. Moral of the story I had dose. Thanks for the great night 204! Your staff is so much fun! Us ladies will be back next girls Night!"}
{"text":"It was Yelp restaurant week so we decided to try this place. When we first arrived, we were sat at a high top small square table. I am petite so sitting on a bar stool for dinner does not work well for me, my feet dangle, (DON'T LAUGH) and I need a place for my purse. I asked to be moved to an actual table with regular chairs and the server was hesitant at first. There were several open tables  not sure if they had reservations to come in but she eventually moved us. For the app, we ordered the calamari. It had fried peppers in it too. be careful if you don't like spicy. Also the marinara to me tasted like tomato paste not marinara, I didn't use it.

For my main meal i ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes and regular corn. When I tell you this was so good. I wish it didn't end. I would order this again. I will say I wish they validated the parking. Parking in the garage is a a little weird to get to the restaurant when you park. It was impossible to get street parking. Other than that, no complaints. Give it a try!"}
{"text":"So rainy night ran into first cool looking spot and was greeted by Alicia.  Dazzling smile was matched by her great service and outstanding food served! Deviled eggs and Meatloaf on same menu is a statement!  Was not disappointed!  Check it out and ask for Alicia!"}
{"text":"After a happy hour we walked around uptown trying to find somewhere to eat.  204 north popped up on my Yelp feed but I was a little nervous about going here because of the 3.5 star review.

We were seated immediately.  We ordered drinks and an appetizer.  The waitress promptly brought out our drinks and bread with the most delicious homemade butter!  For an appetizer we split the cheese and charcuterie board between four people.  It was expensive but a good portion for the value.

I was craving something unhealthy so we split the buffalo chicken mac and cheese.  It was good!  The portion was enough for us to split.  

This restaurant is farm to table which is a plus because there aren't many places like this in charlotte. 

This is a Good Friday night date spot!!!"}
{"text":"I have been for an event, but never to sit down and order off the menu so I decided to try during Yelp Restaurant Week. I was surprised how busy they were on a Wednesday night. 

We started with the deviled eggs topped with fried oysters and shared a side of Brussel sprouts. My boyfriend got the Nashville Hot Chicken with Mac and Cheese and Coleslaw. It was pretty good. The best item we had was my 204 North Cheeseburger. I have to say that was probably one of the best cheeseburgers I have ever had. I would not normally pick  American cheese for a burger, but the cheese they used was melt in your mouth. Paired with good quality bread, it was an amazing burger. My fries weren't fresh and didn't have much parmesan, but I am sure when they are made fresh they are great! 

Good service, atmosphere and drink selection. Will definitely be back for that burger!"}
{"text":"We tried 204 before a concert and it's a great location uotown. Very convenient. Loved the vibe of the bar and the decor of the restaurant. The charcuterie plate was very good. I don't believe the waiter explained what all of the elements were which is helpful with those. 

I had the Nashville Hot Chicken with Mac and cheese and that hit the spot on a cold and rainy night. Perfect amount of heat on the chicken. Mac n cheese was creamy and cheesy. Highly recommend if you love hot chicken. Glad to find that in Charlotte."}
{"text":"Excellent. Not sure what is better the food or the service. Alicia rocked our dinner with excellent suggestions tempura shrimp. Great place highly recommend. One last comment excellent music."}
{"text":"Great food.  The Supper Club was a great deal.  Matt the bartender was my server and he was knowledgeable and really helpful."}
{"text":"Great dinner last night. Hostess and servers were attentive and very friendly. Tuna tartare and salmon were delicious. Some cool cocktails too. Definitely returning soon."}
{"text":"Rarely do I give a 5 star review but I definitely had to for this restaurant. I'm not sure if it was the time of day or or it's just how the restaurant runs on the regular, however I was VERY pleased with the service my mother and I received yesterday (2.17.18) when we went to this spot. We arrived around 2 p.m. The restaurant wasn't super busy however they did have a large party and a few other tables to serve. Initially when we walked in I was a little irritable because NO ONE acknowledged us, not even the servers or bartenders as we waited at the hostess stand. However, after a minute or two the hostess finally arrived back at the stand and took us to our table. Everything after that was perfect. Our server Mike was outstanding. He had the best smile and he kept checking on us (but not in an annoying way). Appetizers and food came out speedy, fresh and hot! Our drinks were outstanding! They were so fresh and had plenty of alcohol. I think prices are super reasonable and the atmosphere is so cute and cozy. Between my mom and I the bill was 106 and I left a 20% tip. We had 5 cocktails between us, two appetizers and two entrees. I will DEFINITELY be back. My only recommendation to this restaurant would be to make sure guests are greeted upon arrival."}
{"text":"Had dinner on Sunday night here and the beet salad was tasty! Even more delightful was the salmon I added to the beet salad.The Brussels sprouts are definitely addictive so I had to combine myself not to return the following day!"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped here for a drink while in the city. We were able to sit at the bar upstairs before it was closed for the evening. I love how the cocktails were all named after different neighborhoods in Charlotte! I ordered the Lake Norman and he ordered the Ballantyne. The Lake Norman is your typical vodka cranberry with a twist of Cointreau and lime. It was strong, but refreshing, and it looked gorgeous! I'm not a fan of gin, but my husband let me try the Ballantyne and it wasn't too bad! He really enjoyed it though. They used actual strawberries and mint in his drink so it tasted very fresh. Our bartender was very sweet! She was getting ready to close, so we didn't get to talk too much, but she did give us suggestions for places to visit while in town and gave us a sample of her favorite beer (which ended up being our favorite beer of the trip!)."}
{"text":"Possibly the worst service I've ever had. Waiter took over ten minutes to greet our table, checked on us twice, once to get our drink/food order...and the other to bring us the check. Someone else brought the food out. 

Ordered the skillet (without cheese and gravy), it came out with only potatoes and egg, when it was supposed to also have peppers and bacon. Grits came out luke warm at best. 

Another table next to us was sat, and waited for over ten minutes without being greeted so they got up and left."}
{"text":"What an amazing lunch!  I had the 204 cheeseburger with fries and I have to say this was one of best burgers I've ever eaten. Good for lunch, crowded without feeling frenzied and the waitstaff is friendly. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Overall the place is good but it seemed they were better are certain things versus others. We had 4 of us and seated ontime. They have speciality drinks but thought odd some were on draft and their mule was better hand made versus the way they would typically serve. We got meat and cheeseboard which was lacking quite  bit. Not much on it and nothing special on the cheeses. We got fried green tomatoes and were terrible, the tomatoes were falling apart and soggy and the breading was falling off. I got the Bolognese which was actually great and had homemade pasta, took a chance and was worth it. My husband got the nashville chicken which was really good too, Brussels awesome, Max and cheese super dry and not flavorful. Other two ppl got the short rib which was tiny and over cooked, shrimp and grits were average I was told. I'd come back and try again."}
{"text":"Great stop on our exploration of uptown charlotte.  Shawn was great and very attentive.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"I brunched my mom here on their very first Saturday! Staff was awesome and the food was even better. Great location uptown and excellent addition to our city! Anthony, you've done a fantastic job, congrats on the success!!"}
{"text":"What a treat for a first time diner. My buddy and I love trying new restaurants and this is where we landed at her suggestion for Saturday brunch. It wasn't particularly busy at 2:00. No shocker there. Our waitress was patient, as we had no idea what to order. She suggested vanilla French toast when asked her choice between Chicken & waffles OR Shrimp & grits. You read that correctly.

After careful deliberation, my friend ordered shrimp & grits. I had the chicken & waffles. Friend wasn't impressed with the SGs. Only 4 shrimp and too many peppers to make up for the lack of shrimp. The Tasso gravy was creative.

I liked my chicken and waffles much better. The chicken was Unique in taste and seemed to have been marinated in a pickled flavoring overnight. It was a sweet vinegary taste in the meat. However, the skin was its own combo of spices. Nothing spicy. Waffles, (3 quarters of a waffle.... Thought that was peculiar) were basic.

Friend had the Ballantyne cocktail. VERY good. Tasted like a less sweet daiquiri to me. Great service. Nice venue. Give it a shot."}
{"text":"Pros:
Great service.. really friendly and accommodating staff
Quick seating (make a reservation!)
Great cocktails 
Great food with good flavors 

Cons:
If you're seated upstairs it can be noisy it there is a party going on. 

Would I go back? Yes! It's really great if you're going to a show at Blumenthal since it's right next door."}
{"text":"Drinks and appetizers are amazing! The upstairs bar is a great, casual hangout. Ask the bartender for drink recommendations!"}
{"text":"Cocktails were fantastic and the bartenders were very friendly. Atmosphere was nice with a great crowd. Looking forward to coming back!

*this review was for the bar only not the good."}
{"text":"Good place for drinks with a large selection of beer. With most of downtown Charlotte pretty quiet during the week, this place seemed to have the most liveliness. Unfortunately, the service was pretty lackluster. We sat at the bar and were having trouble getting the attention of the bartenders for our second drink. They didn't seem very busy, but were avoiding looking up an taking our orders."}
{"text":"Great drinks. Wish weren't 12$ each but good selection and fast service. Comfortable and relaxing bar upstairs, open and not too loud. Good crowd, nice bartender."}
{"text":"I'm sitting in the restaurant pondering what all I must say. This restaurant needs some tips that's for sure. The bread was hard as bricks and burnt. I looked around and I felt like this place is upscale. You don't bring out burnt bricks. On to the food, I ordered the NC organic chicken served with a teaspoon size of potato puree, extremely hard turnip roots, a carrot slither, and two mustard jus. The veggies were so hard that I couldnt eat them. The chicken was seasoned to perfection and moist. The veggies could have been great if I could chew them. Hard as rocks! I paid $22 plus tax for chicken and the teaspoon of potato puree. My friend ordered a burger that came with fries. I took the fries too eat with my meal. The water wasn't filtered and tasted like dirt smells. I rarely EVER write a two or one star review. Overall, the restaurant can be great or even fabulous by making corrections on the above problems. The inside is very pretty and right now I feel is it only good for getting drinks."}
{"text":"Well, that was disappointing 

I've been watching as 204 was built and finally got in business. It's a beautiful space with warm wood and industrial accents, but what it looks like doesn't pay to keep the lights on.
My wife and I got there today just at opening. We were first if the day. That should be good, right? Fast service, fresh food, etc. But none of that happened. The service was ludicrously slow, taking a very long time to actually be greeted by our waiter. Drink orders in and we waited another very long time to get them. Our waiter told slush that the unsweetened tea had not been made yet but he got it started. We ordered lunch. She, a chicken Cesar salad. Myself, the trio of tacos with a side kale salad with white balsamic vinegarette. Another long time later we got our food. The Caesar salad was \"okay\" but the chicken is sick very small and the flavor was generally absent. The tacos were a mess. Though a pretty mess. I am under the impression (I am a food service professional so my impressions are from a place of knowledge) that I got last night's meats. After such an extended period of time between ordering and service, I would have expected the meats to be very hot, they were at best tepid. The steak was tepid and kinda tough, the chicken was tepid and the same as the meat on the salad, and the pork belly (which I was SO looking forward to) was tepid and somewhat dry. No delightful fat pockets that pork belly is known for. No super smoky flavor. Just there. As we almost finished lunch we got our unsweetened tea. Told by our waiter that he had spilled the tea he had made and this batch was just now done. Thankfully they did charge us for tea or I would have had a fit. Finally, the white balsamic vinegarette had no flavor at all! I scooped out what I could of my wife's extra Caesar dressing to help. 
And, considering the waiter seemed to be the only service guy until the bartender finally hopped out to help.on the floor, our change took a ridiculous time to get back. This was a not-good-at-all trip. Sad."}
{"text":"What a place. The Nashville Hot Chicken had caught my eye on their menu outside so I couldn't wait to give it a try. It seriously exceeded my expectations. When I took a bite, I had to stop and just pause. You just had to drink up the deliciousness. The outside was the perfect crisp and kick, simply outstanding. My friend had to give it a try as well and shared my enthusiasm for the Chicken. Loved the Brussels sprouts lightly fried as well and tasty. Such a cool atmosphere and a great location right off of Tryon. This one goes on the rotation for sure. Bravo."}
{"text":"Went to lunch there today. Got the tacos...2 of them weren't what I ordered and the 3rd was steak which was tough.  Service was average.  Had to wait a while for my refill. Will not go back."}
{"text":"The menu looked promising. And this could have been a really good dinner. But. The food was tailored to someone that eats at McDonald's. Wayyyy too much salt, butter and sugar. I had salmon and ordered a side of vegetables. I think i could have consumed less calories if I had a burger and fries from said McDonald's. 
Nice venue and wine deal on Monday though."}
{"text":"We were seated at a table by the bar on stools.  We asked to be moved and they said the open tables were unavailable. Waters we already poured on the table (before we got there), as if someone else just left this terrible table. We decided not to stay. They should NOT take reservations for bar seating w/o disclosure."}
{"text":"What a cute place and great food.   I hosted a dinner for a few of my customers there.  The Cesar salad had to be the best I've had, who would have thought a tomato in it would be so good.  Flat iron stake was grilled to perfection. Bread was mouthwatering and OMG don't get me started on the sticky bun and homemade ice cream."}
{"text":"I had never heard of this place until some friends brought me here for lunch the other day.  We started off with some drinks, and I got the Moscow mule.  My friend told me it was on draft, which I had never heard of a mixed drink being on draft.  It was delicious - a good mix of alcohol, ginger beer, and lime.  Everything on the menu looked good, but I need up ordering the burger and fries as recommended by our waitress.  The burger tasted fresh, was well cooked, and had a delicious house sauce on it.  I wish the fries had been cooked a little bit more, but I loved the parmesan on the top for added flavor.  The price is super reasonable for the type of restaurant it is.  The drinks and food were great, but my favorite part of the restaurant was the atmosphere.  It's definitely a good place for those trendy 20s and 30s in Charlotte!"}
{"text":"This was a gamble. Reading past reviews, I was going into this week's date night with The Lady a little wary, aware of the amount of \"meh\" that was in previous reviews. But...I came here anyways.
And I'm really glad that I did.
We walked in at 7:15 on a Friday (with a reservation), and there were plenty of tables available. The space is gorgeous, with a super cool chandelier and leather and wood and all that cool trendy stuff. Whoever designed this place knew what they were doing.
We went up to the hostess stand and were offered our choice of high top upstairs or booth downstairs, and we chose downstairs.Our waitress showed up quickly, and helped us make cocktail decisions. For me, the Wesley Heights (a delicious and well crafted dark and stormy with some secret sauce? Still don't know what that is....) and The Lady got the Ballantyne (Thanks, Yelp! She loved it!). The cocktail menu is extensive and creative, and there's even one with absinthe (so you can enjoy your meal with the green fairy).
For dinner, I got the Pork Chop that was served over some sort of corn/bean mixture. Everything was amazing. Warning to those who order, the center of the pork chop is on the verge of rare, but it's warm and perfectly tender.
The Lady ordered the Lobster Mac and Cheese, which she described pretty well as \"heaven\". HUGE chunks of lobster. So worth the price. 
We were stuffed, but we took the suggestion of yelp to get the sticky bun, so we ordered it to go.
I'd give this place a 4.5 if I could. Our waitress was wonderful, water filled and very attentive, and food was delicious. No hesitations on trying out 204 North."}
{"text":"Tried 204 North with friends tonight. We're all attorneys and came in after a long day at work. The service was okay, although the waitress seemed disinterested. At a couple of points in our visit we were in the middle of speaking to her and she just walked away.

I'm giving this three stars because the wait was very short, the prices are somewhat reasonable, the location is great and the food was okay. We all really enjoyed the fried green tomato appetizer. It was flavorful and had a delicious topping that included pimento cheese. I had the meatloaf and was able to substitute Brussel sprouts as the side instead of green beans. The Brussel sprouts were delicious. The mashed potatoes were pretty good, and the meatloaf was just okay.

The absolute worst part of the meal was the dessert. My friend ordered the sticky bun which was served cold as if it came directly out of a store bought package. I had the salted caramel brownie dessert which was also cold. I asked the waitress why the brownie wasn't warm and she said \"sometimes they serve it warm, and sometimes they don't.\" That made no sense to me. For a dessert that costs 8 bucks, I would expect it to have better quality than a little Debbie's snack cake, but it didn't.


I wouldn't eat here again."}
{"text":"Great staff, great drinks, great food.
Rare that a bartender is so responsive to your requests when they're specific. Ordered a Pink Dahlia for my girlfriend who doesn't like sweet drinks...nailed it. Flounder was fire too, expect very good things coming back! What a spot right uptown, most of these spots have an heir of arrogance and the food sucks. Not this spot. 10/10"}
{"text":"Came in late night and shared almost all of the items on the late night menu which all turned out to be excellent! How do you go wrong with fried mac and cheese fritters at 12am. You should just order one of everything and don't forget the pork belly egg rolls. Chicken wings could have some better flavor. Overall though, I recommend giving 204 a try! Well done, Anthony and team."}
{"text":"Went for Yelp Restaurant Week. Really enjoyed the Shrimp and Grits and the Garlic Shrimp app. Drinks were solid. 

Bartenders Jim and Heather are great and made it a fun night. 

Will be back!"}
{"text":"Visiting for Christmas dinner and everything was FABULOUS. Dinner was affordable and delicious. Drinks were amazing. Such a nice experience. Alicia was one of the best waitresses I have ever had."}
{"text":"Cocktails: 5 Stars  -  Food: 3 Stars

Visited twice. One time when they first opened, and second time was mid week during an off peak hour. The place is so cozy, and the staff was very nice both times. 

I tried both the burger and meatloaf. The meatloaf was excellent. It is very uncommon to find a high-end kitchen that services such a homemade taste meatloaf. The burger on the other hand tasted was okay, nothing special about it.

They have really good selection of Cocktails and beer, which made both experiences really good. The cocktails are really fantastic. I ended up trying 3 on my first visit.

In conclusion, It is a really nice place for a work lunch, or casual date. Nothing special about the menu, or the food. I am sure you will find something you like on the menu. However, if not for the food, you must go and try the cocktails."}
{"text":"I came here recently for a work lunch and was very impressed with the interior design, a trendy yet comfort feel.  A hostess stand greets you upon entry with booths along one wall, a bar with seats and some high top tables.  
We arrived around 12:00pm and shortly after every table was full.  Service was a little slow, but our waiter was very friendly.
Having heard good things about their fried chicken sandwich I had to give it a try.  Fried chicken breast, pimento cheese, quick pickles and onions on a roll.  The chicken was amazing, fried to perfection, crispy and not greasy.  The pimento cheese was a little heavy for me and definitely had a kick to it.  Unfortunately I had one onion on the entire sandwich and the roll was very soggy due to the amount of melted pimento cheese.  A little messy, but overall very good. The fries were good, nothing special.
Overall my visit was good and I would be interested in checking out their dinner menu as they offer a variety of other items that aren't offered during lunch."}
{"text":"Exceptional food! We started off with the fried tomatoes and homemade pimento cheese, which was Stellar. Then we shared a beet salad and it had a strawberry vanilla dressing which was super yummy. For the main course we shared the shrimp and grits which were to die for. We had Ali as our server and we were very impressed with the service. She was very accommodating and consistent....wish I didn't live so far from Charlotte. Definitely will be the first place I stop at when I return!"}
{"text":"Just went for drinks but smelled some food coming out and it smelled delicious. But our drink experience was wonderful. The Bartender was very knowledgeable, made a great suggestion for a different bourbon, and my wife loved the cocktail he made. Good conversation and relaxing, comfortable atmosphere although the seats were a bit uncomfortable over time. But I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"It's was dead inside, but it was on a Thursday night. The shrimp and grits were cold. The burger was tasty even though it was a tad burnt. I love fries but there were no Parmesan anywhere near these. Maybe this place would be better on the weekend, it has potential."}
{"text":"We went for brunch. Get the avocado toast it was delicious. The burger was okay a little greasy and salty but overall solid. The salmon burger was a unique option for brunch. The grits were really good. Bloodys were good also."}
{"text":"Good vibe, decent waiter, decent drinks at mild price. 

I wouldn't send someone here as a must go, but great for a night out or date night for sure. 

Our waiter made it available to us to sub side, then he double charged us on the bill......"}
{"text":"First off, can we all take a moment to appreciate a perfectly crafted cocktail this drink was so tasty with a great hint of minty freshness  My main course was a perfectly seasoned and prepared mahi mahi paired with local Carolina gold rice with lump crab then garnished with a juicy and spicy pineapple sofrito. Also, the atmosphere was very rustic and quaint . If you've never been it should definitely be on your to do list! #charlottefood #craftcocktails #clteats #goodfood #charlotte #foodblog"}
{"text":"During CIAA, we were short on time and ravenous.  As walked past this restaurant and saw available tables, I didn't need another second to decide to go for it.  We were quickly seated (high top table with stools) and I discovered there was no place to put my purse, nor my coat.  The waiter came and hung up my coat (we passed it near the front) and I pulled out my handy purse hanger to hang it from the table.  We were in a hurry and quickly ordered.  I had a glass of the Stonecap cabernet and the Spicy Garlic Shrimp.  The spice level was above medium and delightful without burning my lips.  We also shared the Salted Caramel Brownie served with vanilla ice cream.  It was delicious.  Overall, this was a quick, convenience, and tasty option before a show.  I will definitely visit 204 North Kitchen & Cocktails again.  

Note: They have a fully stocked bar!"}
{"text":"Been here quite a bit and I will say I've had mixed reviews but the most recent times have been better. I've had really slow/mediocre service and then I've also had good service. The food overall is really good and they make great drinks. The first few times I went they were out of everything I wanted but that doesn't seem to be an issue as of lately. They are located in a very great location in uptown and surrounded by a lot of other cool places that makes it an ideal spot to bar hop and grab a drink. The Moscow Mule on tap is really good. The do offer lunch, dinner and brunch on the weekends which makes it a good place to grab a bite before a show at the Blumenthal theater before or after a show. I've had quite a bit on the menu including all of the starters and a few of my favs are  the Deviled Eggs, Rack of Lamb, and Avocado Skillet"}
{"text":"My boodle and I went to 204 North last night to celebrate our very first wedding anniversary, and I could not imagine going anywhere else to celebrate. Last night was our first time at 204 North.

Cocktails - YUM! I ordered the \"Call Me Maybe,\" a tequila, berry, jalapeno beverage. It was delicious, with a kick, and pretty unique. Would definitely order again.

Food - I ordered off the Supper Club menu, which includes a salad, entree, and dessert for $35. This is a really great deal, and every part of it was delicious. The wedge salad comes with chunky blue cheese dressing. I ordered the 6 oz fliet. It was cooked to perfection and full of flavor. It came with mashed potatoes that were fresh and smeared across the plate.  The presentation was phenomenal. There were also carrots and root veggies that came with that, both seasoned well and tasty. For dessert, I did the rice pudding. This is a little different that I was expecting. It was a creamy, rice-y consistency that was sweet with a hint of lemon. The flavor was amazing. 

Parking - It's Uptown Charlotte, so you can make your own assumptions about parking...

Service - Leon was our server and he was great! If I go back, I hope to see Leon again. He was incredibly attentive without being overbearing, and he was enjoyable to chat with. Thanks Leon for being awesome!

Atmosphere - 204 North is well decorated. It's trendy, but it can be a \"dress up\" and a \"dress down\" place at the same time. Their menu offerings definitely suggest it's fancier, but the atmosphere suggests it can be casual. Love that about this place."}
{"text":"I had been here once before on their Whiskey Wednesday for a liquor promotion, so I didn't have the opportunity to try any of the beautiful cocktails the bartender was preparing.  I instantly noticed the beautiful interior, clean open space and farmhouse chic feel.  I came back here on a Friday night to kick off girl's night out with a great meal and cocktail.  Overall, we were underwhelmed.

My girls ordered simple cocktails, gin & soda and vodka and cranberry, and neither of them had any complaints.  I tried their \"La Reina\" as I typically like Mezcal.  The presentation was great - the drink was a beautiful cherry orange color with a cinnamon covered orange as garnish.  However, it was pretty smokey for my liking.  It tasted like they had poured liquid smoke into the drink, which is great for some, but I could've gone without it.  It may have been a certain type of Mezcal I've not had before, but in the end, I paid $12 for a drink I had maybe 4 sips out of, and neither of our waiters asked if it tasted fine or if I'd like something different.

We decided to split a few small plates.  We ordered the Carnitas Mac-n-Cheese, Parmesan Fries, Roasted Brussel Sprouts and the Cheese and Charcuterie plate.  The Mac-n-Cheese boasted a gigantic bowl of cheesy pasta, with tiny scraps of meat you had to search for and a tiny bit of pico de gallo on top, which was the main draw on the menu description.  The waiter promptly brought out an extra side of pico when I requested one though, and it's a good thing because it really makes the dish.  The lime flavor on the Mac was a great flavor combo.

The Charcuterie plate was beautifully put together, and it had a great selection of drizzled oil, hummus and sauce to dip the items in.  There were two different stronger marbled cheeses, thin salty meats, grapes walnuts and candied pecans.  Overall, it was pretty great.

The Brussels were covered in some sort of a sweet sauce and were delicious.  They weren't as crispy as some I've had, but they were a hit at the table.  The Parmesan Fries were nothing to write home about.

Overall, it's a beautiful venue and the waitstaff were friendly, but the food and drinks weren't as special as we'd hoped and we probably won't be back to dine here often."}
{"text":"We came with a birthday party of 11 and we got to the restaurant at the reserved time of 8:15. We were sat right away and ordered drinks which did not come until 15 min later (water took 30 min!!! IT'S WATER!!!!). We then had to wait almost an hour to order our food because our waiter did not come over to our table at all but went to every other table around us. When we finally ordered it took us 1 1/2 hours to get our food which then came out cold. Not luke warm...COLD. We had to send a few things back and didn't even bother with the rest because the wait staff was obviously annoyed with us. The Mac and cheese may look good on photos but beware. They make a large amount of it and it just sits under a heater all day so it is dry, crunchy, and not good at all. To be honest the food and service were less than mediocre and I will not be coming back. STAY AWAY!!"}
{"text":"We stopped here for some drinks and food before a concert. We split the cheese plate which was a perfect amount for two. My friend really enjoyed her dirty martinis and my glass of Cabernet was great (and a healthy pour, I might add....definitely got my money's worth.) 

The restaurant was FULL of uptown businessmen/women on a Thursday at 7 and it was LOUD near the bar. That, of course, is no fault of the restaurant, but I do no recommend going here for meetings or catching up with friends after work. The patrons were literally yelling (yes, yelling...no exaggeration ) over each other. 

I would love to come back at a time when people aren't so obnoxious to try other items on their menu...the food I saw looked delicious!"}
{"text":"I scoured Yelp & TripAdvisor for a local, [somewhat high-end] wedding anniversary dinner and landed on 204 North after a recommendation from my coworker.  (Furthermore, this was one of the only places I could narrow day that was open on a Sunday evening.) I made reservations at 7pm to be safe, but there were plenty of open tables when we arrived at 6:45pm.  We were seated right away and were given the choice between a high top or regular table.  Our server was attentive, informative, and very friendly.  My husband and I both ordered the wedge salad- which was amazing! Delicious blue cheese dressing (which is a major thumbs up in my book). My husband doesn't like blue cheese or crumbles and the server happily substituted the dressing.  He went on to order the hot chicken, which he said was \"good\". He validated by saying he would order it again. I got the meatloaf, which is typically out of my wheelhouse but thought I would try something new. I was pleasantly surprised! It comes over a bed of mashed potatoes which I almost substituted for macaroni and cheese but opted for the potatoes after some guidance from our server. (I'm a huge mac-in-cheese girl and have some pretty steep expectations. After tasting some of my hubby's mac, I'm very glad I kept the potatoes.  Not bad- just not amazing.) The meatloaf comes with a light gravy, which again- isn't something I normally go for, but it was the perfect touch...it really complemented the meat! We wrapped up with another glass of wine(for me) and craft beer(for him) and a brownie to-go. The brownie was obviously good, but probably would have been warm and more decadent had we eaten it during our meal.  We were just so stuffed! 

My hubby and I are ALWAYS looking for local restaurants that balance a good atmosphere and good food, and 204 North has certainly achieved that balance.  It felt very \"Charleston\"-the way the exterior is tucked very discretely within the heart of uptown- with exposed brick, and a southern inspired menu. We will certainly be back and honestly am considering hosting a party upstairs some time! Lovely experience!"}
{"text":"Delicious craft cocktails, priced fairly for the area. Even if you only go in for one of their signature drinks--it'll be worth it. Gorgeous interior, very helpful and attentive staff. They have a great happy-hour special on foods, but their lunch is reasonably priced regardless. 

We ordered the tacos--three for $10. We got the chicken, shrimp and pork belly. All three had a distinctive flavor, and you could tell they were made fresh. We were blown away by how good the pork belly was. Highly recommend ordering that!"}
{"text":"Terrible cocktail. Food marginal. No real health choices. Will not return. This was 2nd visit after same experience first time. Thought I'd give it another chance. Would never recommend this place."}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying that I am usually pretty frugal and will buy whatever drink is on special even if it doesn't sound good to save a buck. With that being said, their $12 cocktails are worth it. 

I was able to check them out during their soft opening, which allowed us to sample quite a few dishes. Below were my favorites:

Cocktail: Ballantyne - but also don't hesitate to tell the bartenders what you like and let them get creative. This isn't one of those bars where they roll their eyes when you say surprise me. They enjoy getting creative and making off menu drinks here. 

Salad: Beet salad. Comes with an awesome strawberry vanilla dressing. Nice and light but good flavor. 

Appetizers: Fried green tomatoes. These changed my opinion about thinking I did not like tomatoes. Homemade cabbage chow chow and pimento cheese on top. 

Entree: Shrimp and grits. Super creamy. Will get the clean plate award any time you order these. If you are looking for something a little lighter I suggest the trout. Not usually a huge fish fan, but it was super moist and flavorful. And not fishy at all. 

Dessert: Sticky bun, duh. Even if you order it for the table to split. You must find room in your belly for this at the end of your meal."}
{"text":"Came for a solo lunch during the work week.  I'd say the place was pretty \"slow\" but I was greeted warmly and had my choice of the bar or a regular table.  I chose the table.  The dining area is nicely done... wood and pallets line the walls and there is a cool/comfortable vibe to the place.  

It took a while for my server to come out, and that pretty much set the tone for my lunch.  By the time they came to me to give me water, I was ready with my order and he took it down.  Given the order (Caesar wrap & fries)  I didn't think it would take that long, but it did.  Poor guy, kept coming out and reassuring me that it was coming up.  Don't know if it was a kitchen issue or not, but the lack of people in the dining room makes me wonder.

No worries.... I will give this place another shot, I just hope the service improves a bit.  Maybe I caught them on an \"off\" day.  Their location is great and I think their menu is simple enough to set them up for success.  I think their bread and butter are their signature cocktails... maybe brunch.  I'll try again on another occasion.

There seemed to be an upstairs... maybe for private parties.  I did notice there was an event planner meeting clients for what I could guess was the upstairs space.  I was waiting for my food long enough to sit through the latter part of their meeting and exchanging of pleasantries."}
{"text":"I came here with my dinner group. This is more of a bar than a restaurant but the do serve southern comfort foods.

The seating on the first floor is mostly pub tables and a long row of regular tables on the left side with bench seating against the wall. There is a bar in the back. There is also an upstairs but we didn't see how that was laid out.

The menu consists of things like shrimp and grits, salmon, scallop risotto, a burger, salads and things like that. I ordered the salmon which came with beets and mashed pototoes. I also ordered a caesar salad. The salad came out first. It had tomatoes in it which was a nice change but the dressing was sweet when I prefer it tangy. It would have been nice to have more cheese on the salad as well.

The salmon was good but the portion was small compared to the pound of mashed potatoes. The beets were good but I didn't think the meal went well together. 

They do have a good local craft beer selection so I'll give them that but foodwise I was slightly disappointed. I think you can get better southern food at better prices elsewhere in the city."}
{"text":"While visiting my daughter in Charlotte I stopped at 204 North for lunch. I had the salmon sandwich with homemade potato salad. The food was excellent!
My server, Mary was amazing! The inside is beautifully decorated! Will definitely go back on my next visit.  Great food and fast, friendly service!"}
{"text":"I made the mistake of coming to the restaurant during RESTAURANT WEEK. I can understand the staff possibly being tired, and having had a long day. But some of the things I experienced during dining here was unacceptable. I made the reservation for 8:45pm (because thats the most reasonable time they had available). We started our meal with calamari and spicy garlic shrimp. The shrimp were great, but the calamari was poorly prepared and extra chewy. Almost like they had been refried.... it was super greasy... I wouldn't have served it. When it was time to order dinner I chose the 3 course RW option.. starting with a Caesar salad, which was wilted when it arrived. I attempted to order the Flat Iron steak option... they were out of it (like many of the other things I tried to order) but the server informed me that they would be preparing filets in place of the Flat Iron steak.. with the same set up. I ordered that. I attempted to order a glass of red wine with my meal, and they were out of the first 2 things I attempted to order. I had to settle for a Zinfandel. My steak (which was cooked okay) came out with none of the things listed on the descriptor! I got a plain filet with cold mashed potatoes and cold broccoli! No chimichurri in sight. This was supposed to be my friends birthday dinner... so I had plans of ordering dessert in ADDITION to the Turtle Cheesecake I was supposed to be getting (per my 3 course option). I pulled our server to the side asking about birthday options. He assured me he would do something nice (and told me it would be free). He brought 4 mini desserts to the table. A bowl of MELTED ice cream (As in.. completely melted.. not just a little melted), a brownie with semi-melted ice cream on top, a hard sticky bun, and a decent carrot cake. WHO BRINGS COMPLETELY MELTED ICE CREAM TO A TABLE?! Not to mention he only brought 2 forks... there was 4 of us at the table. He told us he would be right back with 2 extra forks (which he didn't bring until he brought the damn bill) Notice the 4 desserts I listed? Yeah... no cheesecake. When I inquired about the cheesecake I was supposed to be receiving... he said \"oh ma'am sorry I forgot to tell you we were out of the cheesecake!) WHY SHOULD I HAVE TO ASK YOU ABOUT MY DESSERT I WAS SUPPOSED TO GET ONLY TO BE TOLD YOU'RE OUT OF IT. YOU WEREN'T EVEN GOING TO SAY ANYTHING UNTIL I ASKED. Not to mention he charged me for my dessert! The lapses in service are  inexcusable.  We won't be back."}
{"text":"Came here for cocktails on a Saturday night. It wasn't very busy for a new bar in the heart of uptown, but apparently it was still before their official grand opening. In any event, it wasn't awkwardly empty either and we appreciated finding an open table upstairs.

There was a nice selection of cocktails to choose from, but they were a bit pricey at $12 per. I limited myself to two whereas my friends did quite a bit more damage. I ordered the Amazing Grace and the Cotswald. The amazing grace was delicious...the peach purée really stood out. The Cotswald was enjoyable but not as unique. The Ballantyne was a big hit with my friends, whereas the Plaza Midwood was the least popular."}
{"text":"This is a very cute little space tucked away in uptown Charlotte next to a great bar. When walking in it gives you a bar feels but they have tables for parties. I was surprised it wasn't more crowded when we went for Brunch, but it may have just been the time or specific day. The interior is clean and spacious and the wait staff is tentative to your needs. I ordered eggs with bacon and potatoes as well as French toast. The food was amazing and came out pretty fast, but I would have thought it would have been faster considering the amount of people eating at the time. The portions were good and everything was well seasoned and hot. If they had a nice mimosa special I would give them a 5 - obviously mimosas at brunch are a necessity for me lol. Across from the. At they have a chalk board with all the specials beautifully written and a story about the drink named Amazing Grace. When you read it l, it will truly touch your heart. Oh and whatever you do - GET THE FRIED OYSTER DEVILED EGGS!!!! They are the best thing since sliced bread and if you eat here and don't get them are you really even eating ?!"}
