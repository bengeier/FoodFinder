{"text":"the spicy tofu pizza is wonderful- as are all the snack sized portions. Fast delivery and quality food! Hard to come by when ordering Japanese, unfortunately.  They also listen and acknowledge food allergies. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"We enjoy everything we ordered here last night. The food presentation was excellent! We special ordered lobster sashimi & raw oysters which was our fave because it was super fresh!!! I just posted 6 photos today. The spicy salmon is so spicy & so good!!! It's very special to be on a green leaf like a wrap.   My toddlers are picky eaters, but they cleaned off their plates! They especially love the miso soup....it's so yummy!  The service is amazing & asked if we have any food allergies.   Will definitely come back & wanna try ordering delivery too."}
{"text":"There were two charming Japanese gentlemen running the restaurant. Both of them were really cheerful for been guys, they said goodbye to us in such a friendly and happy way that I'm thinking about going there if one day I feel unloved (they also gave me a business card with a free Gyoza app for next time). They do know how to threat their customers.  They have a lunch menu, and a bigger one with several interesting rolls.  We ordered a Miso soup which has been the thickest one I've tried, definitely not made from an envelope.   The Gyozas were pretty good looking girls, the dough was crispy crunchy, can't complain about the texture and flavor of the filling.  If you enjoy spicy food, love juicy-smokey salmon, and don't care about trying a bit of eel and garlic sauce, then you must ask the Torched Sensations Roll. The salmon was really juicy, the avocado gave an even greater buttery sensation that contrasted with the freshness of the crab and the heat of the jalape√±o. An interesting combination of flavors.  I also liked the Hurricane Roll, my friend wasn't impressed because he doesn't like cream cheese in rolls. I found the scallops perfectly cooked, maybe a bit of sauce would've balanced the dryness of the cooked shrimp & fried scallop.  They have a good deal for pitchers of beer.  Ohh, I almost forgot, they also deliver."}

{"text":"This place had decent sushi, but it was super expensive -- two adults and one child, a couple of drinks, and it set us back $100 before tip! The food was good but not worth $33/head, especially when one of those heads was 11 years old.  We were the only ones in for dinner too, which was a bit strange. What was stranger was that the waiter just stood about 10 feet behind us, staring at us, watching us eat the entire time."}
{"text":"Formerly KoMe sushi and saki house they have renovated and changed their name but almost the same menu.   Service was excellent, very friendly over the phone (we called ahead for take-out). Food wasn't so great though.  The cucumber inside the rolls we ordered tasted kind of soft, and the tuna in the spicy tuna roll was a bit fishy.  The vegetable dragon roll was decent. Salmon sashimi was fine.  Overall it was just average. Not terrible but not great. For 4 rolls, two salads, and some sashimi $50 seemed over-priced."}
