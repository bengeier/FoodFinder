{"text":"First time at this location and I have to say that I am completely flabbergasted. From the waitress directing us to sit by the cold window in an almost empty restaurant (1 other table) to leaving hungry and unsatisfied. I decided to order the fried chicken and waffles...It arrived with an overflow of what they call their syrup/gravy and chicken fingers, yup I said chicken fingers! Phil's restaurant claims to only use the freshest, finest ingredients but I can assure you none of that was happening. Not only did it take the waitress forever to comeback or get the attention of, did I already say it was near empty? But there were 2 other wait staff just hanging out, talking and laughing and looking over at us. Blows me away that servers expect a tip when they behave like this. Finally, our server came over and I pointed out to her that it appeared to be frozen chicken fingers from a box. The waitress confirmed that they were in fact frozen and from a box and that they don't prepare them in kitchen. Oh and by the way same with the waffles. I am not sure how any self respecting restaurant could have the audacity to charge almost $20 for this 'fresh from the freezer meal'. BTW the waitress confirmed all of the above and even went as far as to say that she has told the owners/managers! Asked if I could order something else...well that took almost another ten minutes just for her to grab me the menu. And, honestly at that point I had enough and left. 
Do yourself a favor and go to McDonald's...At least then you know what your getting."}
{"text":"Best skip the dishes breakfast I've ever had delivered. Nothing was greasy, everything tasted fresh and that is super impressive for smoked salmon eggs Benedict!"}
{"text":"Not at all impressed. Seated close to the door in a mostly empty restaurant. Subjected to blasts of cold air every time the door opened. Mentioned to server, did not seem to care. Ordered eggs Benedict it came with some greyish turkey flavored gravy. Told server. She chose to argue with me rather than make it right. No offer of something new, no discount for the inedible meal. No chance of me coming back. Terrible all the way around."}
{"text":"Surprisingly good steak, enjoyed the meal with backed potato.  Overall a good place for food. A bit pricey food for what it is, but still a good option."}
{"text":"I probably eat Phils like 5 times a month. It's my favourite breakfast and one of my favourite restaurants. I would recommend Phils to anyone, such a wide selection on food and is always good!"}
{"text":"Service was so so, food was ok, coffee pretty bad. Not impressed by the location. Overall there are way better options around but they are usually way busier than Phil's where you should find a table without waiting."}
{"text":"Consistently delicious!! 

I frequent this Phil's because it is a block away from my house and there is NEVER a line. Well there has never been a line when I've been there anyways. That might make you worry that the food is sub par, but their food always exceeds my expectations. 

I normally get the bacon and eggs with hash browns and toast. I also love the fact that they offer shredded AND chunky hash browns. Some days I need chunky, other days I crave shredded. Also their eggs are good quality, the yolks are always a nice yellowly orange, vs the very pale yellow eggs that you know are cheap. I always get over easy eggs and they always come out perfectly, with the whites cooked hard and the yolks so runny. 

Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Ah good old Phil's diner. The branding to this location is trying to break away from the 60's diner theme but seems stuck somewhere in a late 90's office cafeteria or office meeting room.  That being said, the food is also no nonsense close to home cooking you can get.

If you're tired of going to trendy brunch places with huge lines and hipster prices then Phil's is the place to go.

They have a vast selection of breakfast, lunch and dinner options on the menu. Staff here is friendly and quick. My only gripe was that my eggs came out over easy when I asked for over medium (not a big deal but still something to improve upon).  Also, you can tell they skimped on the menus as the pictures aren't professional at all.

We will be back to try it out again!!"}
{"text":"Recently they have changed the coffee, this was not a Sound Decision. Somebody has fucked this up badly, I am really disappointed in this place. Of all of the things a breakfast should be good for .....COFFEE. I am sorry if you have the most amazing breakfast in the world but Nothing to drink with it what is the point."}
