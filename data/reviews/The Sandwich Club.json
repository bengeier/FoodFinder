{"text":"I eat here often for lunch. The sandwiches are great and they have lots to choose from. They also have a wide variety of chips as well. Overall, the food and service are good, so despite the frosty bag lady, I'll keep coming back."}
{"text":"Ruthlessly efficient and unfailingly consistent.  I work in the area and eat here about twice a week when I want a quick, dependable sando. (This is probably the only place where I've successfully redeemed one of those \"buy 5 get one free cards\"...although here it's buy 5 and get $5 off, which is not quite as good).  The dude that runs the show (I should know his name by now but don't) is nice and is damn good at his job, keeping it moving during the busy lunch crush.

The menu is big but not overboard, and there's always something that suits my mood.  Decently good value for what you get.  A couple of my favorites include the Gobbler, the Veggie Burger, and the Vermont Peddler (love that sharp cheddar on the roast beef with slaw, Russian dressing on pumpernickel!)"}
{"text":"I've eaten lunch at this place more than any other place and must say they have what I am looking for i.e. fast, friendly service cobined with decent food at a decent price.
When I say decent price I refer only to the sandwiches / burgers. Everything else is just a cash cow for them.
The veggie burger is definitely a favourite however the weekly speacials are also nice.
Have tried the entire chicken and turkey selection and the choices are good. Some items obviously are better than the others but it is a place where the chance of going wrong is remote."}
{"text":"Went here for lunch. They have a large selection of sandwiches and chips. The sandwiches taste pretty good and they use Boar's Head meats. The bread was okay but not memorable. During lunch, the line goes out the door, but the workers are very efficient and take your order as you wait in line. So by the time you get to the cashier and pass by the large variety of chips, your sandwich will be ready. The wait was around 15 minutes but I think it was worth it. The seats in the courtyard make for a nice outdoor lunch.
They also offer great breakfast sandwiches."}
{"text":"This is the best sandwich place in CLT, and would get five stars but for the fact that its staff literally have no personality (they are not rude - it's just like getting your sandwich from a machine)(on second thought, they are a bit rude), and the cost (around $11 per meal) is about a dollar or two too high.  

That being said, the sandwiches are solid.  In particular, they have one called the \"Vermont Peddler\" that is delightful."}
{"text":"This place is in the Odell building, around the back near the atm machine. They have a large selection of deli style sandwiches, and you can also get one custom made. 

My personal favorite is the Balboa--a roast beef and horseradish sandwich on rustic bread. The chicken cutlet sandwiches are also good, with the cordon blue style my favorite of those. 

Lunch is pretty busy, and the ordering process is a bit awkward. You order at one end and give them your name, then everyone sort of congregates around the cash register at the other end while waiting for their name to be called. It works well enough, though, and the wait is usually no more than 5 minutes. 

They close at 3pm. Overall it's a nice place for a quick, quality, deli-style sandwich."}
{"text":"At a trade show at the Charlotte Convention Center and found this place across the street.  Excellent!  Every person in our group ended up going there and all had great food."}
{"text":"Good reasonably priced sandwiches...and I like the consistency in taste/ingredients. Gets pretty busy around lunchtime, but has become a reliable lunch spot for me!"}
{"text":"I thought this place had to be good, since there are always long lines going out the door... not so much the case. 

$7+ microwaved sandwiches just doesn't cut it. I tried the Chicken Grille, and it was bland and dry- even with the condiments. 

Not worth the hype!"}
{"text":"Had several sammiches here, and can't complain about one of them.  It's obvious they use quality (Boar's Head, I believe) meats and cheeses in the sammiches, and the menu is a shmorgasboard of creatively constructed sammich creations.  They definitely aren't shy about layering the meats thick, either.  

Service has never been overly friendly, and many times outright rude.  I won't let that deter me from enjoying a quality deli sammich though, especially since this place isn't a sit down table side service deli anyways.  If you can put up with rude service for 30 seconds, you're golden!"}
{"text":"Ok.Had the Italian, bread was stale, little flavor to sandwich (spreads were extra apparently). As others have noted, it was the epitome of a 3-star place. 

Would I go here again, Yes...but maybe only because it's in the building I work in. Otherwise, I'd probably try and locate another sandwich place/"}
{"text":"One of my favorite lunch spots in the uptown area. The sandwiches are purely delicious and made to perfection. There is a reason why the line is usually out of the door. 

There are different specials on a weekly basis and there is also a massive menu with a variety of sandwiches to choose from. I would highly suggest anything with their homemade Russian dressing!"}
{"text":"The menu looks great, but the chicken cutlet on the chicken cordon bleu wasn't very good. It just wasn't as crispy as it should have been. The selection of chips is on point though"}
{"text":"Veggie burger was fantastic! Excellent texture and flavor! 
Everything is a la carte and most sandwiches seem to be $6.50 and up, which is why I went with 4 stars and not 5 - they are a little pricey for my tastes. 
Go early - I was there for 5 minutes and the line was almost out the door!"}
{"text":"This place epitomizes a 3 star rating for me. A tad pricey, but a solid sandwich every time I've been.  I'm a cheapass when it comes to lunch because I go out so often, but I'll splurge on this place every so often.  I usually opt to get one of the built to order sandwiches and it runs me a little over $7.  You'll be hitting $10 with chips and a drink.  I'm a pretty big guy and this'll hold me over for my mid day meal (with other small snacks throughout the day of course).  They've also got a decent loyalty card where you buy 5, get $5 off."}
{"text":"As luck would have it, my constant pregnancy craving has been turkey sandwiches. Of course, pregnant women aren't supposed to have deli meat. But the craving is impossible to resist. Enter The Sandwich Club. 

Long lines at lunch point to something great, and TSC is that something. I could gush over the flavor of almost all of their turkey sandwiches -- quality meat and cheese, creative combinations, and always served with a smile. Good specials, too! And they have a frequent customer card that earns you $5 off your purchase after you buy 5 sammies, so you feel like you're working towards a goal when you eat here 5 days in a row. Also, they heat up their sandwiches on request, so no worries about listeria for this preggo!

Another thing: you've never seen so many varieties of kettle-cooked potato chips in your life as you will find at TSC. So far, I haven't found a dud among the mix."}
{"text":"WORST customer service I've ever experienced!  Not worth it to even try waiting in line for this establishment when they treat your customers rudely and horribly.  I don't recommend this place to anyone!"}
{"text":"Stopped here late morning, before the lunch crowd and am glad that I did. Tried the taste of honey turkey sandwich and loved it.  I ordered it as a I was intrigued at the description \"drizzled with pepper honey\" (not the run of the mill mayo or mustard).

There was no wait and my sandwich was ready in no time.  The ingredients were fresh and the 8 grain bread was hearty and tasty.  The quality of the sandwich was worth the $7.  I would definitely get the same sandwich again."}
{"text":"I went with ole faithful today.  #7 Carolina Crunch Wrap.  Perfect blend of crunchy, sweat, and tangy.  I typically eat here at least once every week or so.  Good food at a good price.  They also have the rewards program.  You get 5 punches and you get $5 off your next purchase.  The line at lunch is typically out the door but they seem to move you through pretty quick.  Not much seating.  Also have an overwhelming amount of chip options."}
{"text":"I've finally had it with this place.  It is right by my office, and due solely to its proximity I have visited quite a few times.  I initially had a number of bad experiences with stale bread (unacceptable in a sandwich joint) and wrote this place off but some coworkers encouraged me to give their Veggie Burgers a try.  I will admit, their veggie burgers WERE pretty good.  I say \"were\" because, as I learned today when I went for lunch, they have discontinued their veggie burgers.  I thought about just leaving after finding that out but decided to stick it out and try something else, which ended up being the Eggplant Mozzarella Sandwich.  Big mistake.  The eggplant was severely undercooked and still had that rubbery texture that only uncooked eggplant can have.  In other words, it was inedible.  I also bought a lemon bar (which was overpriced to being with at $2.25) that featured a crust that tasted like raw dough.  Shame on me for giving this places so many chances, but after essentially throwing $10 in the garbage today, I'll never be back.  

And while the terrible food is bad enough, I haven't even brought up the dismal customer service.  The two front of the house workers that are usually there will barely communicate with you--and you can forget a smile.  It is off-putting but something I could forgive if the food were good.  But it is not.  I hate to help send a business down the river, but, in all honestly, the sooner this place is out of business and a decent place opens up in its stead, the better."}
{"text":"I keep trying to like this place, I really do. But it fails more times than not. 

Today they had a special and I wanted pickles instead of cucumber, but they wanted to charge me extra for pickles. :(

I asked for extra mayo because they are SO light handed with their condiments. It is not even on half the bread. :(  The pickles were only on one half of my sandwich, of course not the side with the mayo. 

Sadly, I did not notice until I was leaving that they had a rating of a 90. If I had seen that before, I would have just gone elsewhere to begin with. 

Some of the people working there seem almost annoyed that customers are there. The man who either owns or manages it is pretty nice, but he is not rule, he is the exception. 

Now that more and more places are opening, including Panera, where you can get exactly what they have for the same or lower price and have a better end experience, I would say Sandwich Club is a place to go if you have to...and if you do not mind a poor cleanliness rating. A 90 is pretty bad, IMO!"}
{"text":"Let me start out by saying the sandwich was super delicious. I ordered through YelpEat24 and had their #17, The Gobbler (it's like a thanksgiving meal on a sandwich - I added Havarti and had it on Sourdough). I walked from our local office to the restaurant, which was inconveniently located inside of another building, passed a security guard, off of Trade St. When I arrived, they said they had not received my order, and made me pay in cash. I had to work with YelpEat24 to get my money back, which they refunded in whole. When Yelp contacted the sandwich shop, they said I ordered it from the other location - WHAT? How would that even happen when I'm new to the area, ordered online, and followed the ON FOOT directions to your shop. 1000 nopes. When I arrived in the store, the cashier was not very friendly and was too busy flirting with the guy in front of me to assist me immediately (probably why she didn't \"receive my online order\", she barely listened to me). The sandwich itself was good and I received my order after only 2 minutes - SPEEDY (unless this WAS my order from online). The flavors were delicious, only thing was they could've spread the sandwiches ingredients out over the whole sandwich rather than throwing a scoop of stuffing in the middle and praying to the sandwich gods to spread it for them. I would give them a lower rating for my crappy experience, but the turkey was super fresh - so I cannot. 3 stars they get from me, could easily be 5 or 1 - I guess it depends on the day."}
{"text":"Their sandwiches are good. They offer gluten free bread.
They give you plenty egg on the sausage, egg and cheese breakfast sandwich, and plenty meat on their ham sandwich."}
{"text":"We stopped in to share a sandwich and we asked the guy at the counter what he recommended. He recommended the #13 - Roast Beef Italiano. Yum, Yum and Yum.... yea I know that's not explaining the flavors this sandwich had but lets just say it was delicious. I'm not a sandwich person and I kind of wish I would have gotten my own and didn't have to share. 

I was surprised this place was a 3 star, but I definitely give it a 4. Also try Joe Chips - Jalapeño... delicious and a perfect spice."}
{"text":"I came here with my co-workers today around 11:50am. The line was out the door, but there was a lady taking orders in advance so the line went pretty fast. The menu is huge and consists of maybe 30 different sandwiches (surprise). Most of them include meat, but because I'm currently being a 'vegetarian' I decided to build my own.

I got the oat hoagie bread with pepper jack cheese, lettuce, tomato, avacado, sprouts and spicy cilantro ranch. The hoagie was huge and the amount of cheese on my sandwich was unreal. I had to remove half of it. I literally had 10 pieces of cheese on it- it was insane! My other co-workers got the special of the day and another BYO. Everyone's toppings were loaded and they seemed to really enjoy their sandwiches. 

They also had a HUGE variety of chips to pick from. The options were endless! My coworkers and I were going crazy looking at the different flavors (who knew they made a moscow flavored chip!). They also have a refrigerated section that includes pies, hummus, fruit and other desserts.

Our total for 4 sandwiches and chips came to $39. Not bad for lunch...

I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I work really close to TSC so I eat here once a month at least. I greatly appreciate that you can order from an on-line app ( I can't leave my desk for long) and you can pay when you get there.  I've eaten almost all the sandwiches they have, some more than once.
I love that the chicken cutlet is...a cutlet, not a dried out, too big breast portion.  The deli meat is top notch, fresh and tasty, just sometimes the amount is a little lacking.  The chicken salad is good, not a mash of vege's and hardly any chicken, they could ease up on the mayo just a touch.
The reward card is great, 5 stamps and $5 off your sandwich.  Awesome!!
They just stopped serving soup, I guess because the weather is warming up but the soup was quite tasty.
All in all, the food is good and the price for a sandwich is fair.
My only complaint is they offer sprouts but haven't had them anytime I've added them to a sandwich...and I paid for non-existent sprouts.  Oh well."}
{"text":"One of the best places to get a lunch sandwich downtown, and reasonably priced. Great bread options, fresh ingredients, nice people."}
{"text":"I didn't know this place existed despite two Uptown locations. Then my co-worker started bringing a sandwich back to the office every day and they looked so good.
I finally went and found the line pretty much out the door. How had I missed out on this?
The menu, while well organized, actually looked overwhelming because there were so many good looking choices. I just went with the #1 Parkside and had no regrets. It was delicious! They also use Boar's Head meats which are top choice.
Now I get to go back and decide if I want to work my way to some of the other tasty looking choices or stick with the goodness I had. Regardless, I'll be back.
They also have a punch card and I think after 5 or 6 visits you get $5 off. Not to bad seeing as most places require 10 punches for a free sandwich ($6-7 off)."}
{"text":"Definately an all around 3 star rating.   The bread was decent and the vegtables are very fresh.  I am a vegetarian and I like sandwiches with lots of vegtables.  However, charging extra for every vegetable brought my sandwich to $10.50.  No meat just vegtables.  That was not ideal for a salad with bread.  Long wait and my friend who is not a vegetarian got the Italian sandwich with extra vegtables and his broke $11.00.  We did not order chips and drinks.  Not my ideal place.  There are other sandwich shops that we can get better vegtables sandwiches for $3 - $4 less.  It's nothing special for a vegaterian, just an average sandwich shop.  If you like lots of vegtables, I would go someplace else.  

However, my friend said the Italian meat was very good.  He would also give it an average rating though.   Sorry but, just no wow factor."}
{"text":"Was that a gunshot??? NO that was the sound of the bag lady at the Sandwich Club!!!  YES they have a great variety of sandwiches and CHIPS of all things.....My coworkers and I were here today for lunch.  I have been here many times despite the frosty service.  I love the reubens and the veggie burgers.  If you start going regularly get the card, where if you buy five you get one free.  

The veggie burger is very good, you can get it on a pita instead of a big bun to make is a little healthier.  Delish!!!

One reflection on today's fruit:  I was laughing when my coworker threw her $2.95 fruit cup out saying that the cantelope tastes like dirt.  How could she be so finicky and silly?  But then I tried mine, yes she was right.  Blah.  I have to say the fruit is not always dirt-esque...I have had it before and it has been 'fine'.  Just beware.....on this day it was a total waste of money.

So what on earth is up with the bag lady?  I have only been able to get her to smile once, it was a fleeting experience.  But the most remarkable experience about the Sandwich Club is to watch her bag the sandwiches.  When the sandwich comes out of the kitchen, she rings you up and bags your sandwich (snapping the bag open with one hand with a GIANT SNAP).  It is quite the experience, and the food is reasonable, but be prepared to wait in line for a bit if you get there at peak times.  :-D"}
{"text":"This was a great little sandwich shop.  Great service, quality product, at a very reasonable price.  Located close to the convention center, so if you are there for a meeting, and get a chance to sneak out for lunch, check this place out!!!"}
{"text":"This is one of my ideal lunch spots even though it's the longest walk away. With a simplistic concept and an efficient assembly line, The Sandwich Club is perfect for on-the-go sandwiches. A sandwich + chips might cost you up to $10 so don't be alarmed when you hit the register. Moreover, the chips, parfaits, drinks, and cookies will surely tempt you while you wait in line. How strategic of them.

The kicker at this joint is the customization that's available to you. It's like Starbucks, but for sandwiches. You could have your 'wich any way you like. The menu isn't restricting. They have several different mustards, toppings, and spreads. And they load the meat on the bread - like a real deli! 

The quality of the fillings are of a high quality too, that's for sure. Everything tastes fresh and the bread just barely holds the filling. I like #27, their signature Sandwich Club, which includes BLT + Chicken Salad. I add dijon. It's a pretty filling order and I'd say a good 800 calories after licking up the remaining crumbs. 

If you're into gorging at lunch time, they have a number of \"cutlet\" sandwiches which are basically fried filets of chicken in sandwich form. Chicken Parm and Popeye's are pretty delicioso. 

I don't see the need to comment on service since it's not a sit down place. Plus at lunch time, these people are working hard, I'm always going to cut them some slack. After all, they're running a business, not a meet n' greet. 

Yet another strictly sandwich deli for you to try out :)

4/5"}
{"text":"Nothing wrong with this joint, just nothing to it either.  Very limited inside seating but the plaza right outside works if the weather is decent.  Otherwise you might as well get something to go.  My assumption is that most people that eat here obviously work in the building.  I don't think people are driving in or walking down Tryon to get to this place....hahaha.

I'm not knocking their food, actually it's pretty good.  They have a few great selections and I've never really had anything bad.  Ok, scratch that, their coffee stinks....lol.

They are only open during breakfast and lunch.  Not sure when they close down but I know at 5pm they aren't open.

Service is strange, I can only describe as passive aggressive style service.  It's like I know they don't want to serve me but they do it anyway.  I try to joke around with the people that work there considering I'm there often but I feel like they really don't want the interaction....:(

If you work in the Odell building...eat here....if you don't.....keep it movin'"}
{"text":"Ever since the office moved to the new building, there were complaints of nowhere to eat. Wrong. Plenty of places. One of them is The Sandwich Club. 

I would only give it 3 stars, even though the Eggplant & Mozzarella Focaccia was the best ever. A few reasons:

* Lines get very long during lunch time, so if you are in a hurry to grab something before the meeting, forget it. The orders are taken pretty quickly, however, they are fulfilled painfully slowly! If they only hired another person to prepare the orders, they would not be losing so many customers who are in a hurry (and I tell ya, being one of them sucks!)
* There are 50 different varieties of potato chips on display. None of them are \"baked\" variety. 
* Very much empty space. I understand that the ownership wants to fill it with customers waiting for their orders, but still. A few more tables would be nice.

Overall, good experience. You can buy your food there and eat in the park. By the way, they are putting the Ice Skating Rink there right now! Yay."}
{"text":"Egg salad sandwich is good here and what I got for this visit.  If you go, their daily specials tend to be very good and a bit cheaper than the standard price.  Another punch on my card....and on my way to a free sandwich."}
{"text":"The food here is only ok and at lunch time the line is very long. For the time spent waiting in line you could have a better sand which right next door. The saving grace for this restaurant is the breakfast. It's never crowded and is a decent breakfast sandwich."}
{"text":"So happy I found this place during a trade show I was working at the convention center as their food is way better than anything in the convention center. The sandwiches are all hand crafted as you order them, the line moves quickly, the food proportions are perfect for lunch and the price is reasonable! 
The staff is quick and efficient to keep the line moving during the lunch rush. I experienced the garden medley and the healthy choice, both were really great and kept me satisfied all day."}
{"text":"This review will be a very mixed opinion - I've been here for lunch a number of times, and I always had good sandwiches and walked away very content with whatever I had ordered. That changed with my last visit when I continued my reuben adventure around Charlotte with a stop in at Sandwich Club. I had high expectations based on all my previous experiences - I left extremely disappointed.

The sandwich was bad from the first bite - it was cold in the center. Like right out of the fridge did they even toss it on the griddle cold. The corned beef lacked flavor, The cheese wasn't melted, the kraut was sweet instead of tart, and the one good thing was that the bread was at least average rye. The bread had seemingly been tossed in a toaster, which helped make sense for why the sandwiched was lukewarm on the outside and cold on the inside. It was an all-around unpleasant experience, and the other person with me couldn't even make herself finish the sandwich.

If you go to Sandwich Club and order a majority of what's on the menu you'll leave quite happy. Just avoid the reuben - for whatever reason it's nothing like the rest of their sandwiches."}
{"text":"My coworker and I kept noticing the long lines during lunch, so both of us thought \"place must be good\". We were both wrong.

The menu at face value looks awesome. I got the impression that it was a deli with fresh ingredients, airy bread - overall quality food.

We ordered the chicken cordon bleu and the chicken grill sandwiches. Chip selection was awesome with a range for every taste. The sandwiches were, in a word, forgettable.

My breaded chicken cutlet was popped in the microwave before it was put on my sandwich, making the breading mushy and not appetizing whatsoever. Pair that with semi-stale bread and the sandwich was a lost cause. I only ate half of it before throwing the rest away. With the sandwich, chips, and tea coming to 10 bucks and some change, you can say I was a little disappointed.

Lesson learned that you can get a much fresher, more appetizing sandwich somewhere like Panera, for less money."}
{"text":"3 stars really captures this place.  Not quite at the level of a 4 star, but definitely not 2 stars.  I liked that they were fairly quick, had a nice broad selection, and used good meat.  

It definitely lacks that oomph that would push it beyond the levels of medicrity it currently resides in.  I had the Italian Cut being a fan of salami, pepperoni, etc. and it was a good sandwich utilizing Italian bread!  Also, just enough Italian dressing to keep the bread and meat altogether.

Would I come here again? Probably, it's a fine sandwich place and nice go-to for mixing it up instead of the same old places.

They got my order relatively quickly and I didn't wait too long to receive it either. The cashier wasn't over pleasantly, but again it was during the DNC. A little too much dressing and high prices, but I would try it again."}
{"text":"This place is a wonderful escape from the Subways, JJs, and other typical sandwich joints.  Great cuts of meat and cheese!  They allow you to customize any sandwich and other excellent chip choices.  

They could work on their personable skills but the food speaks for itself.  It's real good!!  Give it a try!

-Ian M."}
{"text":"The Sandwich Club is a great go to spot for lunch uptown.  Although the line can be deceiving it moves pretty quickly. They offer a variety of pre-made sandwiches and of course you can create own. As my previously review said I am huge Boar's Head fan, so still love that! 

I typically create my own turkey sandwich and every time my sandwich is made correctly and they are huge! Overall a great spot for a grab and go lunch, and definitely deserves a star increase from 2013."}
{"text":"Flavorful sandwiches that are done right. Not super boring.

I wandered into this spot after walking down the green space.   It was around 1pm so I knew there would be a lunchtime rush.  The line was to the door, but the wait was not bad.  They take your order right away at the front, then you shuffle down the line with mounds of potato chips bags staring you in the face.  They beg to be eaten and you give in and snag a handful.

They have a bunch of different sandwiches, none of which sound boring.  Its a good spot.   Take the food and go eat outside."}
{"text":"So many choices of good ingredients like sprouts, avocado and many more. All kinds of breads, wraps and other choices. The menu has over 40 different pre selected choices and you can also make your own sandwich. I usually take a look at the special sandwich of the week - which you can find posted just outside the entrance and by the counter where you order. 

Even when there is a longer line, I find that the wait time is relatively quick. Typically I will pull out my phone and check a few emails while I wait, though I usually don't get very far. 

Finally, this place has one of the best stamp card deals in uptown. If you work in the city and eat out frequently then you should take advantage of this. Get five stamps and get $5 off your next order. While it isn't completely free, most places are 10 stamps before the reward."}
{"text":"Across the street from the convention center. 

Excellent sandwiches, all can be made into wraps.
Taste of honey sandwich is the fav so far
They have Sanpellegrino!"}
{"text":"Lunch.  Usually the pinnacle of everyone's day and how you plan for it to make the work day go by can be key.  Working in Uptown has its perks, there is no shortage of places to go get \"lunch.\"   One of my go to favorites for lunch is the classic sandwich - and it's even better when you can get someone else to make it for you.

The Sandwich Club usually has a long, moving line during peak lunch hours.  I like to go on an off hour to skip the line and have that much more time to enjoy my sandwich.  With 33 different sandwiches to choose from, you can't really go wrong at this place.

Pretty simple set up.  Come in, place your sandwich order, move on down the line, pick up chips (if you want them), pay and wait for your name to be called out.  There are a couple of places to sit and enjoy your lunch, or take your sandwich out to the Green and enjoy it outside (hopefully with good weather)."}
{"text":"Hey! Three stars is nothing to be sad about!  I had the Italian, the bread was good, there was ample meat, nothing special, nothing horrible.  Actually the service was great, we were up in the area for the Carolina Fest - Labor day celebration - which was a part of the DNC week in Charlotte.  They didn't jack their prices up at all, and even though it was standing room only it took no longer than getting a sandwich at any other sandwich shop.  In fact it was still probably quicker than Penn Station.

If you are in the area (right off the green) and have a hankering for a quick bite you should try it.  I'll be back and I'm sure I'll have to up my rating to four stars."}
{"text":"Love this little sandwich shop just off of The Green.  This is sadly the last location standing, as the locations in the Odell Building and 121 West Trade have both closed over the years and created a longer walk from my office in Hearst Tower.  The sandwiches themselves are the redeeming quality of this place, which I suppose is good seeing that it's a sandwich shop.  As expected with Boar's Head ingredients, the food quality is amazing (particularly their roast beef) and their breads in particular are delicious.  Along with closing their 121 West Trade location earlier this year, the business recently pared down the menu, and while I haven't had all of the sandwiches still on the menu, I've yet to try one that wasn't super tasty and the weekly special is usually good as well.  Fairly large variety of side items, from an array of chips to more healthy options.  Try to go later in the afternoon as the line during peak hours can seem endless, but they usually manage to get you through fairly quickly and with a minimum of fuss.  No one who works here will ever be accused of providing friendly customer service (if the older gentleman is behind the counter, you'll be lucky if he bothers to acknowledge you when you pay), but their goal is to get your order and get you out quickly with a tasty sandwich, and that's exactly what they do."}
{"text":"Visiting the area and thought I would try it out. They advertised the weekly sandwich as a Parmesan chicken with sauce and cheese that absolutely sounded delicious. The truth ended up as a large hunk of bread with some mushy breaded chicken, the smallest amount of some sort of sprinkle cheese, and perhaps some marinara. (I couldn't really tell, but the bread was a little reddish). McDonald's would have been more flavorful."}
{"text":"Always long lines at prime lunch hours but they generally move pretty quickly.  The menu is a sandwich lovers dream but, the overall execution is at the A-OK level only.  That's not bad, I mean there IS the option of 1 or 2 stars BUT there is also the option of 4 - 5!

The quality of meat is good (Boars Head) as is the quantity on the sandwiches.  The breads range from good to \"used to be good but now it's stale\" and there is no excuse for selling a sandwich on stale bread!  The Club is close to my section of cubeville so, I generally make it there once a month or so but, if it were just a wee bit more consistent and a wee bit cheaper, I would definitely up the frequency of visits."}
