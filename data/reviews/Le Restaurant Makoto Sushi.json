{"text":"busy on a weekend night, but received excellent service
no english spoken, but japanese dish names transcend many cultures
situated in a humdrum strip mall, on a busy street
cozy inside, even romantic
the tobiko was so fresh, it was congealed
they must have just scooped it out from mama
c'etait excellent!"}
{"text":"Went there a couple times in the last few years. The food was fine but not memorable. The maki rolls are reallly big, but there is too much rice in them for my taste. The salmon teriyaki was good, perfectly cooked. Would go back for the teriyaki!"}
{"text":"Good sushi, fresh ingredients , wide selection including set menus . Specialty rolls are huge, i like the dancing Eel full of flavour and the lobster salad just phenomenal,  some rolls are average but overall one the good sushi in Laval, friendly stuff and nice ambient. Definitely recommend it."}
