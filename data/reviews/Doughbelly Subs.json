{"text":"This is a small store but the service when i was there For lunch was above and beyond. All the meat is real natural products not cold cuts, the pretzel bread was absolutely amazing and there were so many decisions for available sides I almost couldn't choose!!! the brownie I got was rock hard but the rest of my lunch made up for it. The staff checked on me several times during my meal and (I believe she was the manager) even took my tray and garbage from my table while my husband and i finished our lunch date!!! While I admit they are usually not very busy the experience was amazing! We are definitely coming back!!!"}
{"text":"Yummy food :) there is an option of getting the sandwich as a wrap or salad too.. But I like the pretzel bread"}
{"text":"Was not expecting much when I was home visiting my parents--food options in Mahomet have never been great, and it's attached to a gas station.  But my Mom insisted we try and so glad we did!   Fresh roasted turkey (chunks--not sliced) with a terrific seasoning, soft pretzel bread (I actually ordered white bread, and it came on pretzel--lucky mistake) and delicious fresh potato chips with individual seasoning (chili lime was great).   Papa Del's and Zorba's (my mainstay lunches when we visit) have strong competition now!"}
{"text":"This sub shop actually gives you real roasted whole meats like smoked ham and roast beef. How many sub shops offer that? They also offer quality breads like pretzel bread. The restaurant itself was quaint and clean and the staff was friendly and efficient. I think this restaurant has excellent potential and is timely with trends toward more natural, less processed foods. Overall I really liked it!"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, therefore I tried it twice before writing this review.  First the good points.  The restaurant is small but it is extremely clean and inviting with two flat screen televisions.  The staff is friendly and accommodating. Also I have not tried the subs, therefore since subs are their primary food, I give two stars with some reservations but the thing that made me try Doughbelly's is the television commercial that advertised their \"delicious\" Fried Chicken special.  I want Fried Chicken to be hot.  I don't want chicken that appears to have been cooked yesterday and that is exactly how the chicken tasted.  I could have gotten better chicken from out of a box in Walmart's frozen section.  I could tell that it would have been delicious if they would fry to order but I was in and out in about 6 minutes with my hard, tasteless chicken special in hand.  This place was empty both times that I went there, absolutely no other patrons.  IF YOU WANT TO STAY IN BUSINESS .  1.  Change your name  2.  Cook the food to order including frying the chicken after the order is placed.  People will wait for good food.  3.  Have two or three flavors of chicken i.e. mild, extra hot and Cajun.  Do something different.  No one will come unless you do something unique.  I'm so sorry but  I will not be back unless the suggestions above are implemented however, I do wish you success and hope that you stay in business.  Good Luck."}
{"text":"Now, I'm not that much of a fan.... I've been there three times since my initial visit and have been disappointed two out of the three times.  This last week, I did drive-thru --- ordered my go-to-sub which was the ham and swiss with an order of chips.   Got home, the sandwich was covered in at least half a jar of mayonnaise.... I'm not exagerrating either.  I had to take a knife and scrape off the mayonnaise from everything.  And by that point, the bread had soaked up a bunch of it and I was left with an inedible blob of yuck.   And the chips weren't even cooked through.... they were translucent, flacid and soggy.....and they had no seasoning on them. I had planned on splitting the sandwich with my 3yr old and 1yr old but wound up just throwing a bunch of it away.   I wish I had taken a picture.... I knew something was wrong when they handed my a greasy paper bag.   If I didn't have two screaming, hungry, agitated kids wondering where lunch was, I would've jumped back in the car and drove back to Doughbelly's, but since Lake of The Woods Rd is closed for construction, it takes a good 15 minutes to drive there (then I'd have to complain, wait for another sandwich to be made and then drive another 15 back home.... so it wasn't worth 40minutes of my time for an $8 sandwich).   But I did call and complain.  The assistant manager was super apologetic and offered me two free meals..... he took my name and number down and said that next time I come in, to just talk to a manager and they would look up his notes.....I very much appreciated the offer and they seemed to really care about the customers.

Fast forward to three days later.... I walk in with my 1yr old..... I explain the situation to the girl at the counter.   She goes and gets a manager.   The manager looked at me as if I was speaking Swahili.   He leafed through a notebook and had no idea what I was talking about.  My name wasn't even in the book.  He said, \"So two free sandwiches?\"   I didn't really want two meals...so I asked if I could have one now and then come back some other time for the other.... then he said, \"So how about a combo now and you pay for the sandwich.\"  Huh?!  Isn't a combo a meal?  Why do I have to pay for a sandwich?  At this point, I didn't really care... I was just hungry.  So I said, \"Sure I guess.\"  So I ordered a steak sandwich with chips.  I paid $7..... then I looked at the board and saw \"Upgrade to a combo for $1.50\".    Oh gee, you comped me $1.50??   Wow, I spent $11 on an inedible mayonnaise sandwich and raw potatoes..... and you comp me $1.50?   This next sandwich had better be good..... yah, it wasn't.  It was so salty --- like licking a salt block..... and the steak was over-cooked and rubbery and it was just not very good.....I guess those first few months of yummy goodness and midnight craveable sandwiches are down the toilet.   

So Doughbelly's.... you can keep that extra sandwich or combo or whatever you were going to comp me.... I'll take my business to Subway or Jimmy John's.   At least they're consistent.  I'm not looking for free handouts.... just accountability and decent food."}
{"text":"Stopped to take a break from driving and walked over to the other side if the gas station and saw this place. Figured I would try it out because we hadn't eaten and didn't want to stop again before Chicago. This place had some good sandwiches, I will be stopping again!"}
{"text":"Its a sandwich shop. The meat is butcher block style, not lunch meat which is cool. Chips were good. Pretzel bread was my favorite part. Service is OK, they are still training staff to get things figured out. I wouldn't go out if my way to go back."}
{"text":"Doughbelly came onto our radar because we were unable to find a place for brunch and time had rolled into craving lunch food. Boy did we hit a great place to fulfill that need. 
Rather than thin measly deli meat, the Doughbelly provides butcher block cuts of roasted meat. So very fulfilling, especially if you are hungry. We got Doug's Club and Buffalo Chicken, both of which was delicious. Though Doug's Club was an obvious specialty.
In addition we got the D-B French Fries, which has the special D-B seasoning. Yup that was good. Lastly we had a small side order of wings, which was good. That was the only thing I would not say is exceptional. 
The decor is what you'd expect from a sub restaurant: simple, clean with two TVs. 
If you are in the area, check this place out. The subs make it so worthwhile."}
