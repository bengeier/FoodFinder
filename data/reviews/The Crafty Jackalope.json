{"text":"Always looking for good local spots when we are away from home.  The Crafty Jackalope is a winner.  Sort of a bar/ restaurant.  Warm decor, and clean.   We stopped in on a Saturday evening and it was about 70% full.  There was a Penguins game on and many seemingly regulars on hand atvthe bar to watch.  We never felt out of place or unwelcome.  The staff was very nice.  She did a solid job.  The food was very good.  I had wings, which were huge.  My wife had the brisket sandwich, and loved it.   Daughter had a wrap.  Food was above ave, facility looked good, staff was good.  Worth going to."}
{"text":"I've rarely seen a more hard working, dedicated owner of a business before. He has successfully built a business built on quality and excellent customer service! He is a huge part in the success of the Bridgeville business community and greatly appreciated. Thanks Ron!"}
{"text":"So glad this place popped up on Maps!!  Quiet, classy little bar with gourmet food and a nice atmosphere.  We brought 3 kids (6mo - 7yrs) and it felt appropriate.  No kids' menu, but mine will eat wings.   Husbandy and I had the German specials for Octoberfest - better than Hoffbrau House!!  Potato pancakes required no enhancement and the potato and kraut mix was superb ... oh yeah, the wurst was good too, ha ha ha!  Started with chicken nachos, so we weren't able to finish, but can't regret the nachos!  Even the picky boy ate them!  Park around back and enter through the back door.  That's where the outdoor seating is."}
{"text":"Excellent beer selection. Bison burger was amazing.   I used to come here when it was Senor Frogs. Other than the familiarity of the location I'd have no idea that it was the same place. Excellent remodel/refresh.   Great service at the bar (Kara). The outside bar was super relaxing and the vibe was chill. Tres Lads was playing inside which was great but didn't interrupt outside."}
{"text":"First time we came here we were blown away by the quality and freshness of the food we ordered. Everything was made from scratch, and made to order.   The prices are great, the food is great, and the employees are nice. We will be coming back here on a consistent basis."}
{"text":"Bar food, and not that good.  I'll stick with Burgh's across the street."}
{"text":"The service started out ok and then got worse as the night went on. Going there during a pens game and wing night was a bad idea. Half of the wings weren't cooked all the way and the waitress was very inattentive. I would go back just to try out the good food everyone raves about just not on that night."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. My wife and I ate here and had macaroni and cheese skillets. They also had good beer selection. I recently ate up the street at \"Mac and Toz\" which also has mac and cheese skillets, and I actually prefer the \"Crafty jackalope.\" Also this is a little less pricey than \"Mac and Toz.\" The atmosphere is alright, definitely better than when it was \"castaways.\" The only thing I didn't like was parking. Parking is not great in this area around dinner time. I will probably stop here again soon."}
{"text":"We went to a movie in bridgeville and thought we'd try a new place to eat so we went to crafty jackalope. We both got the wing special . They were really good. Nice size good flavor. We also had frys they were also very good . The waitress was very attentive and the atmosphere was nice. I would definitely return here in the future"}
{"text":"Very good bar food and even better help clean place. different place to eat that isn't to far off the intestate as in not a chain lots of tvs"}
{"text":"Update--- Sorry to say it's been 10 days and I have not received a gift card. This makes me feel that  management is not that concerned about a customers bad experience."}
{"text":"We had the Chipotle BBQ wings and two different types of burgers. All of the above were exceptional. Cool atmosphere, plenty of parking, and lots of TVs to boot. Well worth a stop on our way to the outlet mall."}
{"text":"This place was a nice find! My family and I were in the area looking for a place to eat lunch that wasn't the typical Applebee's, Texas Roadhouse, etc. We decided on The Crafty Jackalope, and at the end of our meal, we were so happy that we did. My mom ordered the Drunken Mussels as her meal instead of an appetizer. At first she was worried it may not be \"meal size worthy\", but there had to have been at least 25 mussels on her plate for only $7.99. They do not come with bread, so she ordered toasted bread on the side which was an extra dollar, but it complemented the meal nicely. My dad had the BBQ Beef Brisket sandwich which was very tender with a touch of sweetness. It was served on focaccia bread instead of a bun which allowed it to not get a soggy as a bun normally would. I had the Classic Reuben, which for a classic, was top-notch. The bread was perfectly toasted and it wasn't swimming in thousand-island dressing. This allowed for more flavor to come from the bread, meat, and sauerkraut. We also decided to try to beer sampler for $7.00. Each glass is a decent size and it's a great opportunity to try a new beer without committing to an entire glass or bottle. The one downfall is that it's a bit loud, but it is a sports bar-esque place, so it's expected. If you're in the area, give it a try!"}
{"text":"Great place. Nice selection of beers. Chef came out and was very personable. Made recommendations and offered to customize our orders. Had pan seared ahi tuna. Amazing. Wings were fresh, hot and crispy. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Great food. Ate here with a Groupon and was pleasantly surprised how good the food was here. The fries are seasoned with a garlicky-parmesan seasoning, and my western wrap was delicious. My girlfriend's ribs were done perfectly and the sauce was magnificent. Service was about average for a busy night. Would definitely recommend coming here to have a bite with or without a coupon!"}
{"text":"We had a nice experience at this restaurant. The service was quick and the food was very tasty. We also liked the outdoor heated seating in the wintertime as well as the general atmosphere of the establishment. I will definitely come back for both food and drink!"}
{"text":"It's not pretentious and it doesn't try be. It's an honest hometown bar environment with surprisingly good food. Prices are fair, service is normally good, and food is great."}
{"text":"Traveled all over the US..and found this hidden gem when hubby wanted to check out the game..so happy we stopped in! food was amazing..from their burgers..nachos..and different twist on bbq pork nachos...are something Im craving ...their fried cheesecake....dessert was spectacular..I urge everyone to try this place out..guarantee you will NOT be disappointed. Thank you to the great service..and next time we are in town we will definitely stop in!!!"}
{"text":"This place has come such a long way. If you've only been here before the remodel, give it another chance! Amazing food, great drink specials, refreshed interior, and nice outdoor seating. Loving it!"}
{"text":"Wonderful burgers and excellent wings!  I wish the beer selection was bigger, but the food is really amazing and inexpensive.  I highly recommend."}
{"text":"This place is a great find. We visited it originally in the summer, but kept wanting to go back, and finally had the chance for a dinner. Since it is in winter, we decided to stay inside and not try the covered patio (Besides, the patio is the smoking area, and we are non-smokers!)  There is parking directly behind the restaurant and at various locations around Bridgeville which are a short walk away. The front of the bar fronts to Washington Road and as busy as that is, there is no place to park. We walked in through the back door and were immediately taken to a table. Much to our surprise, most of the tables by the back entrance were occupied by families that included younger children. At a bar? Anyway, the inside of the place is rather dark. The bar dominates the center of it and there are tables around one end of it. There were a bunch of young guys at one end of the bar, who had clearly been having a good time for a while, as they were rather \"enthusiastic and loud\". However, except for the loud discussion they bothered no one.  The menus were quickly handed to us and even before we had a chance to look them over, one of the employees handed us a sample bowl of the soup of the day with two spoons and asked us to try it. We did. It was delicious! Looking at the specials board, it was a Basil Mushroom Soup. We ordered a bowl of it! It was even better in the full bowl! Talking with the woman who handed us the sampler, we found out she was the manager who has a soup-making hobby and that was her latest creation. We complimented her on it and found out that she has a recipe book of around 150 different soups and she rotates through them at the place regularly. If any of the others are as good as that one is, you must try any soup she makes!  Previously, we tried the burgers, so this time we tried several appetizers and the Pittsburgh Wrap. All the food was standard quality bar food. The one outstanding (as in MUCH BETTER than most) was the soup. When we go there next, we'll probably go back to the burgers as they were very good.  Our waitress was very capable and cheerful. She stopped by many times to see if we needed anything and any requests we made were quickly attended to. Quite good.  The beer list is quite long and varied. They have their own brews as well as collections of others. The two that we tried from their own portfolio were very good. Turns out we came out on a good night as they had a half-off appetizer deal going (for which the soup qualified) so we have a very inexpensive meal. Bang for the buck was very good!"}
{"text":"This was my third time here, and every time has been a great experience! Though it doesn't look like much from the outside, it's definitely a hidden gem! The servers are always very attentive, and the food is super reasonably priced but very yummy! They have a great draft selection and a huge bottle selection with a really nice variety! We have been able to please both craft beer/IPA lovers here, as well as \"traditional\" beer drinkers. We've also been able to please non-drinkers here, as there's a pretty good variety food-wise and everything we've ever tried we've really liked. We have loved sitting outside in the summer, but were happy to see they enclose the outdoor sedition for the winter and still offer that as a seating area.   We have had their wings in the past and really enjoyed them, but this time we opted for full size meals. My wife got the buffalo mac and cheese - it was not only a generous portion, but quite delicious! I tried a bite and definitely plan to get that next time! I had the Verde wrap and it was super flavorful!! We forgot how good the food was, especially for the price! I plan to add this to the list of places we patronize often!!"}
{"text":"I have been coming here since they opened.. Love this place and the atmosphere! All the bartenders and waitresses are very nice! They now have a new mexi section and this is the 2nd night in a row I got the shrimp tacos! Highly recommend! The tacos come with beans and rice. I really don't mind beans and rice, but I've heard it great with the tacos."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times with work friends for trivia. Our most recent time, we had 6 adults and no options of tables because they were reserved. The waitress and manager so kindly set up a table for us by the bar so we could sit together and participate in trivia! It was so kind of them to do!!! I ordered the spicy ranch wrap with fries. It was really good! I know we will be back for more trivia nights cause we have a great time when we are there!"}
{"text":"Food is consistently good, and so is their service. Their wings are amazing, especially the Honey Jalepeno!  The drunken mussels are to die for. The beer selection is the tops and if you like wine, they do the Pittsburgh pour!"}
{"text":"Pretty decent bar food although it's moderately kid friendly. Waitresses are very nice and they have a kids selection. But the crowd is mostly adults and the atmosphere is more bar related. Good beer selection too"}
{"text":"Great restaurant!!! Great atmosphere! Great service! Great food! If you like wings then you will like these wings that they serve here.These are some of the best wings that I have had in the Pittsburgh pa region of Pittsburgh!!Thumbs up all the way!! There shaved ribeye sand which is killer good also! I have only eaten here once,but I loved it! Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"Great outdoor space...makes you feel like you are an the beach!! Actually i guess you are on the beach of Chartiers Creek. Good and affordable food...happy hour 5-7. Live entertainment...only bad thing its a smoking bar. Ruins the atmosphere and your dinner when someone is smoking and its blowing in your face. Go outside the establishment...thats the norm today. I am surprised there isnt a statute on the smoking policy."}
{"text":"Haven't been to this place since it was called Señor Frogs, and decided to check it out tonight.  It was a beautiful night, and we sat outside on the patio along the street.  There was free bingo going on, which was fun and kept us entertained while waiting for our order.  Had a really nice server named Alisha who did a great job recommending our dinner choices, we each had a chicken wrap and they were tasty.  Nice, relaxing, clean place to stop in for a drink and quick dinner.  We will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Excellent, wings are way better  than burgh ,s and half the price everyone  it told to try this place loved it give it a try"}
{"text":"Great service and great food. Came here for a last minute birthday party. The manager welcomed us at the door and made sure we were seated. Service staff was very responsive and went above and beyond for our party. Food was very good and priced reasonably. We will definitely be a regular customer!!!"}
{"text":"The servers were great. Their selection of craft beers is really good compared to other places nearby. My favorite part is the outside bar. It's great for watching sports and having a few cold drinks."}
{"text":"Excellent casual place to have a drink and a bite.   Roasted jalapeño peppers stuffed with humus were amazing!   Will definitely return next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Love the Jackalope!  Introduced to this place when my band, Verdict, played here on Feb 4, 2016.  Now under new management, Jason has done a fantastic job.   My band returned on June 16, 2106.  Today, I stopped in for lunch and the Southwest Chicken Sandwich and Fries were perfect.   Sorry to hear Fri daylight hours were going away, and looking forward to returning with my band sometime this fall or winter.   Thanks again!"}
{"text":"Yum yum yum. Good food and good drinks. Hopefully they will stay in town longer than the last 2-3 owners."}
{"text":"Since Sauce closed Jakalope has re-vamped their menu - they now have Sauce's mac and cheese options!!! YEAH!!  Equally great.  Some different add-ins, also great.  Very excited.  I love the South Hills love of mac and cheese.  Weird, I know. But for me, mac and cheese may be an obsession and Jakalope delivers.  So now I have a great wing place and a great mac and cheese place.  The brisket is very good as well.  Hubby loved the steak salad.  I still haven't gone through the entire menu, but the meals are consistent.  I like consistency.  Good."}
{"text":"We decided to go here one night to try out a new place with awesome reviews. I thought the food was really good. We got stuffed banana peppers as an app. I thought the sausage may not have been completely cooked but it wasn't raw or anything. I was surprised their house salad was actually mixed greens vs the typical iceberg. I got a lent special meal it was good but I thought the salmon was a little more fishy. Overall I was impressed for the quality with low prices. I give it four stars because of the iffyness and atmosphere. I would go back..:"}
{"text":"My wife and I were in Bridgeville browsing some antique shops and decided to stop here for lunch.  We hadn't been here before.  I had the spicy bison burger and my wife had the fish sandwich.... both were delicious and huge.  The menu has sandwiches and some nice entrees.  They also have a nice selection of beers, draft and bottled.  We'll definitely go back."}
{"text":"I had the cilantro chicken dinner & it was inedible- sadly the most expensive item I picked. The taste was as if alcohol had not been properly cooked off and the chicken was not cooked properly. I had two items missing from my order so I cannot review the sweet n sour coleslaw or french fries, but fish sandwich, buffalo chicken dip, boneless wings and french fried zucchini were good enough for 3 stars. I'm not sure I'll give them a second chance with the other options in the area."}
{"text":"Tried this place out once...sat at the bar for 25 minutes and not a single person waited on us. We got up and left, no desire to go back."}
{"text":"This was our first visit and definitely won't be our last. Our waitress was extremely attentive to us and there wasn't much of a wait for our food - however I will note is was a very rainy day and the place was only half full. We ordered the fish sandwich, BBQ Bacon burger, and shared the pretzel bites. The pretzel bites were good, nothing truly amazing, but they went well with our beers. The fish sandwich was great, piping hot on focaccia bread. Their tartar sauce is the second best I've ever had, and has onion in the sauce. My wife really enjoyed her burger, it was juicy and just the right amount of BBQ sauce. We definitely will be back, we definitely want to try their wings next time."}
{"text":"Had no idea where to go or what to do when my boyfriend and i had arrived, went inside to see if the bartender (who had literally 1 person at the bar) would give us any insight on the place and we weren't even acknowledged. walked outside and took initiative to get a waitresses attention myself. she was nice, and the outside seating was very comfortable with the fire pits late at night, but the service was extremely slow and the bar drinks were questionable as to if there was any alcohol in either of the ones we ordered (margarita/martini). safe to say id only visit for the atmosphere and i would absolutely only order bottled beer just so i knew i was getting what i was paying for."}
{"text":"For gluten free people ...add this place to your list of go to bars!  They had cider and gf beers.  I had the blue burger and gf bun. Delicious!!!!  Nice atmosphere.  This was our first time here and we will go back.  This is a little spot that has been renovated in the last year.  The wait staff was great. We sat at the bar and the bartender was delightful.  Prices are reasonable   Give it a try."}
{"text":"We love the crafty jack! We regularly go over for the quick lunch or after work beer. The outside area in the summer time is so fun! There aren't many out door restaurants in the area!"}
{"text":"We frequent Crafty and have never had a bad experience. Other reviews on the mussels are spot on - they are terrific!  Wings are outstanding. New Mex offerings are huge portions and delicious. Beer selection keeps me coming back!!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service! Try the Mac and cheese!!! The beer flights are also a great bang for your buck. I will be back."}
{"text":"The crafty Jackalope is an awesome spot if you are looking to grab a drink, or high quality food. Their beer selection is HUGE. Food selection, awesome. I've been coming here for many years and can only think of one poor experience. Also, super bummed they got rid of their couscous salad - it was amazing.   Four stars because of a few reasons...  Smell.. eek. I feel like they used to allow smoking in main dining room and you just can't get rid of that smell.  You are allowed to smoke on the enclosed porch in the outside eating/drinking bar area.   Is it a Friday/Saturday night and you don't mind coming home smelling like smoke.. or is it a weeknight and you are just trying to grab a drink and  a sandwich?   Also, trivia... IS AN ABSOLUTE BLAST!  Highly recommend this place for a fun time..    Curious- -- Can I bring my pup here to sit outside on the deck in the warmer months? That would be a game changer. Would bring in a good crowd as well, especially with the Montour Trail being so close."}
{"text":"Underwhelmed. We stopped in to watch a Penguins playoff game.  The place was moderately busy - not every table was taken, and they had seating both indoors and outdoors. We clearly were our waitresses only table in our section based on the frequency that was saw her.  The layout and actual restaurant was nice.   The food was average. I had the chicken salad wrap, and it was just that, an average chicken salad wrap. My dining partner had the shaved ribeye sandwich and assessed that there was no way he was actually eating ribeye (and it was really greasy).  He said his sandwich wasn't worth the money.   The drinks were good... definitely the best part of the meal. Overall, average food and below average service. We were hopeful for a new spot to frequent, but I doubt we'll be back."}
{"text":"Pre-ordered wings for takeout. Had to wait over 15 minutes at 2 different bars to get my order. They overcharged for sauce on the side (supposed to be .35 cents per sauce, was charged .75) and there was no ranch with the order."}
{"text":"So it was Sunday and it had an outside seating area which I thought would be great. Here's a tip. If you're not from here don't bother stopping here. The \"waitresses\" are terrible I'm not sure if they are working for tips or not but after the girl walked past me six times after I even said \"excuse me\" three times, I just went to the bar myself Not once, not twice, but every single time I needed a beer Then I started to notice every table she actually stopped at she knew everyone at the tables. Then all the locals at the bar made it really uncomfortable just standing there waiting for a drink. This place has been about six different things in the last few years and they were all the same Do yourself a favor, and just drive up to 31 or Rumfish must better service."}
{"text":"Some good specials on certain days. Nice and clean environment. Dart boards and outside bar/patio is very fun for place."}
{"text":"Great drinks........horrible service basically ignored paying customers on a Saturday night?!?!?"}
{"text":"Sat out on the patio with friends tonight. The craft beer selection on tap was good. But the food was just ok. Not great at all. The service was slow, even slower than expected on a busy Friday night. And all the waitresses seemed pretty clueless.   I don't expect to be coming back. Not for the food anyway. My friend got boneless wings that were more hard crusty beading than actual chicken. I got a grilled chicken salad wrap that wasn't very good at all. Another friend got fried zucchini, she didn't eat much.   We were all pretty disappointed."}
{"text":"I was truly blown away! The drunken muscles were to die for! I love on the lenten menu there is a spicy burnin burger. For those who will burn in --- for eating meat on friday. Haha Our waitress was perfect. The food delicious! There is so much on the menu that I still want to try. Awesome place. Can't wait for warmer weather when you can sit outside."}
{"text":"Still a fan and SUPER impressed with their seafood. I normally wouldn't get seafood at a bar, but they had a picture of their seared ahi and although neither of us thought it'd look exactly like the picture, we tried it and the shrimp kabobs... The seared ahi DID look just like the picture and was delicious. So were the shrimp kabobs AND the muscles (another thing I wouldn't normally order in a bar, but they did such a great job with the ahi and shrimp, we tried it). They have good happy hour specials and service. Definitely a great place to eat."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised! Great food and very cool atmosphere... One of those places where there is enough room for everyone there to enjoy what they like at a bar: tv's , darts, music or hanging on the patio . food was very good...had wings, fries and the bbq burger loved them all.  Definitely a great summer spot. The service could have been better , server was friendly but  not knowledgeable/alcohol  about the menu or attentive. Definitely a gem in bridgeville and will be back"}
{"text":"I can cross this off my list. Four of us had dinner there. I had a Ruben that might have been good if it had been served promptly. The fries that were the side were luke warm smothered in salt. How hard is it to serve fresh crisp French fries?  A glass of lemonade that my husband said they must have squeezed a lemon over a glass of water... Fish tacos for my daughter and husband with a disgustingly over cooked rice.  Will I be back? Hell no!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a place with great wings this is the place to go but only if you want them with a side of awful service. Food doesn't come out in a timely fashion, it comes out at all different times, wing flavors are wrong, aren't able to get drinks because they are too busy, asking for a glass of water seems to be a struggle for them as well. If you tell then the wing flavor is wrong they will tell you you are wrong and then become combative with you  (I'm talking ownership and management). One of the worst experiences I have ever had with customer service."}
{"text":"Good food, good beer selection, good staff, BUT they allow people to smoke so it ruins it for us."}
{"text":"Stopped here randomly after the Tanger outlets and it was REALLY great. We got the BBQ burger, spicy ranch wrap and the shaved rib eye. The chef even came out to chat. Everything was excellent, I would definitely stop in if you're nearby. Great place."}
{"text":"I've been to the Jackalope probably 8 times.  The outdoor space is fantastic, the food is pretty good and the beer is cold.  The service is generally subpar, the staff seems confused, you wait longer than usual for drinks and food, and it seems to take them awhile to clear tables.  Tonight was a beautiful summer night and a bunch of tables outside weren't cleared because no bussers were there. And the service was really bad even as the crowd thinned out. Maybe they were understaffed.  This all has led me to conclude that the management must be terrible.  You can't even get a busboy to show up to work - even a sub?  Is the reason the waitstaff looks confused constantly because no one is giving them direction or taking corrective action when needed?  Come to think of it, I don't ever think I've seen a manager on the floor there keeping things under control in plain view and that's telling.  They have a great spot and outdoor space which is useful for about 4 months in Pittsburgh.  It's a shame because this could be a great place if they got their act together with some good leadership."}
{"text":"Interesting name, interesting crowd, but overall we liked it!  We checked out TCJ for happy hour (M-F, 5-7, 1/2 off appetizers, $1 off drinks.....something else related to beer but sorry I can't remember) and we were not disappointed!  So first of all, right or wrong, but I judge restaurants by how tasty their ranch dressing is.  They passed the ranch dressing test, if you are curious.  The other food we ordered was pretty solid!  I feel like I missed out though by declining the French fries...I pulled a snob move and asked if they were frozen or fresh cut, and when I learned they were frozen I declined.  However, I tried my husbands and they were really quite good for frozen fries as far as texture and taste!  They also season them with some kind of ranch-flavored seasoning.    Our waitress was really nice, the food was brought out quickly, and the drinks were as expected.  My husband ordered a beer without bothering to ask to taste it first and didn't like it, but the waitress offered to get him a new one. Which was nice of her.  So overall service was a plus too!  One negative - why is it so dark in here.  Yes, I should wear my glasses more often since my eyesight is questionable at times, but why the cave-like lighting people!  I still like this place and would go back and sit in the cave...or just sit close to the front door where natural light helps counteract the darkness (which is where we sat).  Or wait until the weather is nicer and sit outside because they have a patio!  Can't wait for that!!"}
{"text":"Love the wings here! Starting to be a hang out! Great menu and the food is fantastic. Good beer selection too!!"}
{"text":"Great beer selection. Got the Burning Burger and it had the best ghost pepper sauce I've seen.  Lots more good stuff on the menu. Need to go back."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch with the crew from work. It's excellent, good service, good food. As we like to say at work \"This one's going on the rotation.\" I would recommend you put it on yours too."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere, friendly staff, and good food.   Try the deep fried cheesecake for dessert!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, amazing service, and great prices! We went on a Sunday night and didn't know what to expect. Both got burgers and they are the best in the area! The draft list looked amazing! So excited to go back to watch a sporting event there!"}
{"text":"Great outdoor atmosphere!  Nice beer selection and a tasty menu!  Gluten free beers and food to order."}
{"text":"I love love loved this place! I have a new love and appreciation for the locals of Pittsburgh. They were so friendly and welcoming. The food here was good and the cocktails were delish! Thank you Pittsburgh"}
{"text":"Great service and food! I ordered the special, Shrimp Po'Boy.  It came out with grilled shrimp and was made perfectly.  Great beer selection and fresh brewed iced tea is not bitter."}
{"text":"This was my first time here at the Crafty Jackalope even though I live close by and it's been open for some time now. We stopped in on a Saturday evening for a few drinks and something to eat. We sat at the bar and the service was fine. They have a decent selection of beer on tap, but nothing too crazy.  Had the Buffalo chicken dip as an appetizer and chicken tenders for the main meal. Everything was fine but nothing to write home about. Around seven or so a one man band came in to play. Apparently this young man has quite the following of what only can only be described as very enthusiastic music loving ladies who very much enjoyed (him?) his show.  Anyways, since this really wasn't my bag baby, I decided to bounce on out and find a different place to continue my beer d'jour! Not a bad place at all and the service is fine. Maybe I just need to pick a different night, either that or check out this guys my space page to see when he's going to be there."}
{"text":"A Saturday afternoon.  Wing and beer special. Burgers and wings were yummy.  Service was great! We will be back!"}
{"text":"Service usually sucks but the food is always good. I wish they had arsenal cider in tap. The outside patio is nice too with the new fire pits. I also wish they'd open it for fall."}
{"text":"Great low-key inexpensive place. The owner/chef is really making an effort to provide well prepared meals with fresh ingredients and the results are impressive!  Excellent beer selection and a laid back vibe.  Service is friendly although not fast.  Not a gourmet restaurant, but certainly a go to place for a good meal at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Awesome inside/outside bar with a small town local feel but a very nice beer selection and the food was very good! Service was also quick and very personal. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Great service. Slow on a Monday evening but enjoyed sitting outside. Food was very good. Lots of beer on tap. Certainly worth a try."}
{"text":"Can be crowded at the \"typical\" times, but my wife & I discovered this place over a year ago - haven't tried anything on the menu that wasn't amazing. So, it's a bar, but they've got a comfort food gourmet in charge of the kitchen. Any sandwich with the focaccia bread = win (BBQ brisket, Roasted Veggie, etc), burghers are superbers, specials like the lobster mac & cheese and meatloaf just taste so SATISFYING. (Update: Buffalo wings are amazing, spicy and actually buttery too) Everything is their own recipe. They also have a fair drink selection, music nights and a karaoke night.  If you come as often as we do (about weekly), the staff get to know you too and come to see how you're doing."}
{"text":"The Crafty Jackalope is great bar for anytime of the year. Their food and drink specials are fantastic. Not to mention their staff is friendly and attentive. The patio is great In the summer for happy hour and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"You walk in, its an average setting, not alot of seating, not much in the way of a modern vibe. An older feel, needs updating, but the food more than made up for the ok atmosphere, which is more important anyway.  Hot Cajun wings for the appetizer. Great flavor, decent sized wings. Friend had the French Dip, gave it a good rating. Beef was tender, melted cheese on a Mancini bun. Au  Jus was very good. I had the Shaved Steak sandwich, with grilled onions and peppers, cole slaw and melted Provolone on Foccaccia bread. I loved mine, generous portion of steak, very tender and juicy. Side of Parmesan fries, made for a great meal!!"}
{"text":"A place I would definitely go again. The food was good and the service was attentive. Enjoyed the outdoor patio for much of the dinner and some drinks then moved inside for some fun karaoke. Overall the place seemed reasonably priced and more than worth the visit."}
{"text":"We decided to come back after liking this resteraunt and only having been there once, a couple years ago.   I am not a big burger eater but decided to order the burning burger since I love spicy foods.  When asked on how I wanted it prepared, I advised medium.   When it arrived, it looked delcious.  I cut it in half since it was a decent size.   As I cut into the burger, it was completely raw.  This was not safe to eat and my table agreed.  ( my husband and sisters boyfriend both prefer their burgers rare, but agreed this was not cooked at all inside) We told the waitress and she looked at the burger, and could tell she agreed. She was apologetic and  said it would be about 6 minutes before the new one came out.  The burger took a little longer than 6 minutes,  because when it arrived , my table was finished eating.   When I cut into this one, it was extremely rare but more cooked than the first one.  This time, it may have been considered rare, but definitely not medium. It was red inside and not pink at all.   My sisters boyfriend and husband did say they would have probably ate it but I could not.   At this point, I was really embarrassed to send this back again. I have never sent food back to the kitchen before let alone twice in a visit.   After deciding what to do, the manager came over and asked how the burger was.  She was very sweet and once again she was very apologetic.  She said she was going to take it off the bill, and I could order whatever I wanted. You could tell she geuiniely cared and wanted to make up for the mistake.  (She also explained burgers are tough because they are handmade) I decided to switch to something else, so I ordered the chicken wrap. (Which was good!)   Just a couple of comments regarding the waitress. We did have to ask for a side of ranch 4 times. By the fourth time, it was getting embarrassing for us to even ask.  When we received the final bill, the wrap was not taken off.  We had to tell her that the manager did say she would take it off.   We we received the correct bill, my sisters boyfriend paid with a card.  He did not leave a tip on the bill since he was going to pay with cash.  The waitress saw the zero tip on the bill , stopped and turned around, and asked him \"Wait, are you going to leave cash?\" He just looked at her in awe and replied \"yes\". It was very uncomfortable.    In summary, I'm only knocking two stars off. The prices here are good and so is the food. The manager was very professional and sweet. If I return, I will not be ordering burgers."}
{"text":"We went there to listen to a band play that I wanted to see. Thought we would try the food too. The reviews over all made it sound better than it was. We ordered a few appetizers,  the peppers with hummus, and the drunken  mussles. The peppers were interesting, and not at all what I expected. More like pickled jalapeños with hummus on top. Good flavor etc, interesting idea, just I was expecting more like a jalapeño popper.  The mussles had good flavor and were well cooked. Saw some sandwiches come out to other diners that looked ok, but nothing there said 'wow'. They did have a good selection of beer, and it had a nice atmosphere, and a huge deck. But the deck is also the smoking section... and we don't smoke.   Not bad for what it is, I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could, but definitely not 4."}
{"text":"A delightfully unexpected 5-star experience! First time at this fun clean restaurant. We came on a Tuesday which was $.30 wing nite. Their wings are so delicious and perfectly crispy, comparable to Wings Suds & Spuds in Moon. We enjoyed fried pickles and warm cheese filled pretzels for appetizers. The service - excellent! Our waitress was attentive as well as the manager who introduced herself to me and told me how much pride they take in service. We will absolutely be back!"}
{"text":"Went on a Sat night and sat at the bar. The staff was disorganized, inattentive (and it wasn't that crowded) and messed up our order. Food was subpar. I was surprised after reading so many positive reviews. You are better off at Burghs Pizza and Wing pub across the street."}
{"text":"We are from out of town and were excited to try this place when we read the awesome reviews.  The bar was set too high.  The muscles would have been great if they were hot.  The rest of our meal is was below average and the service was terrible"}
{"text":"Stopped here for the first time with my wife for lunch. We grabbed wings and I have to say they were cooked perfectly. They were crispy and there was a wide selection of flavors. Service was great but the place was rather slow, so I can't comment on service when it is busy. That being said, we highly recommend giving the Crafty Jackalope a shot."}
{"text":"Pretty cool spot in bridgeville, the patio is super cool! I really reallly wish they didn't let it be a smoking patio until a certain time like 11 or 12. A few friends and I had a table in the back and every time the three ladies next to us would decide to chain smoke again I couldn't get away from the smoke. Something kinda annoying especially when I was eating. Nachos were yummy and so was the BBQ brisket flat bread, Forsure ask for light onions"}
{"text":"My second visit tonight to The Crafty Jackalope in Bridgeville,Pa. It was delicious. I had one of the specials. I had Ribs and Chicken coleslaw and fries and a homemade corn muffin. Everything was very good hot off the grill. I especially loved the coleslaw and the fries. A little hidden gem in Bridgeville. Prices are great too!"}
{"text":"Went for wing night after a day at flight with the kids!!  Wings were delicious,  but most important our server Courtney was the best! She never once cringed as she seen 3 hungry kids at the table!! Very great service!!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner on Tuesday.  Wings are the special of the day $.30. So we tried a couple of wings.  We started with some homemade soup, Bean and ham, that was very good.  Then had some Hot Garlic Parm and some Honey Jalapeño.  Both were good, but we like the Hot Garlic Parm better.  Thought the Honey Jalapeño were a little to sweet.   The wait staff was super friendly and gave us a sample of the soup prior to ordering.   The have a list of the specials that don't seem to change, $30 wings on Tuesday, Monday there is another special and there is Karaoke and Trivia nights.  Would like to come back in the warmer weather and try out the deck."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is cozy and clean. Friday for happy hour and drinks? Sign me up again please! A group of us came after work and happy hour didn't start until 5, NBD! We enjoyed ourselves with their already fair prices and $3 shots of fireball on Friday?! Yep, 3 of your hard earned dollars to start your weekend! Wheee! We had two simple apps-- chips and salsa and fries, did I mention they are also half off during happy hour?! The bar staff was super friendly and fun! I look forward to going back and trying a meal."}
{"text":"The \"Black and Whir Ahi Tuna\" was the best ahi tuna my husband and I ever had! Great selection of beers and our bartenders were super friendly and accommodating. We also had gyros, philly steak wrap and xangeo?? Everything was great! Try a sampler of what's on tap!"}
{"text":"Your favorite local dive bar + great craft beer selection + full food menu. You can't go wrong at the Crafty Jackalope.   Check out the beer list, there are tons of awesome choices on tap and plenty more bottles and cans to choose from. Try the Bye Felicia - it's fun to say, and so yummy - as long as you like passionfruit and IPAs. If you aren't a beer person, there are some honey meads to choose from and a full bar of course.   As far as food goes - definitely start off with some wings or nachos to share. If you want something a little more like an actual meal, I got the western wrap with chicken and a side of veggies. the wrap was warm and filling and delicious, and the veggies had too much oil but were also very tasty.   ALSO - download the app on your phone! You get a one time $8 off an appetizer or drink just for downloading the app. And of you present it each time you come after that your server will put a code into your phone, after 10 visits you get a $15 gift card! TOTALLY WORTH IT!"}
{"text":"Several months ago, I left a review complaining that they had changed the menu, especially since they'd removed my favorite salad in Pittsburgh. The restaurant owner messaged me, thanking need for my opinion, and inviting me back tonight, when they were bringing the old menu back. Although they aren't going to change the menu until the end of the week, the manager asked me about the dish that I missed, and she had the chef put it together for me. You have to love that level of service!  This place still has the excellent service that we're accustomed to, good prices, and tonight, bingo. So glad that I can come back for my favorite dinner!"}
{"text":"The absolute best food and service in the tri state area. The best kept secret in western Pennsylvania."}
{"text":"Extremely tired of the same chains over and over again, we decided to give the Crafty Jackalope a try...I had been here on a Saturday night when it was a previous business so I was curious to try it again. We stopped here on a Friday after work while happy hour was still going on ($1 off drinks, half price appetizers) so we tried the fried pretzel bites which were so good. Nice and crispy and cheese filled. I ordered the cilantro chicken which comes with 2 sides, it was two nice sized chicken breasts and I got the fries and creamy coleslaw as sides. Their fries were so perfectly seasoned that I didn't even need ketchup and the chicken was delicious. My boyfriend ordered the surf and turf. As he was cutting into it our waitress said \"that isn't medium well\" and took it to fix it...he didn't even say a word, he hadn't even looked at it. Then she came out and said they were out of steak and asked what he would like instead, he asked to just put it back on for a couple minutes which she said they normally wouldn't do but he was fine with it. We were comped for his meal and given a gift card to return. Honestly he probably wouldn't have even said anything and just eaten it but that was a really nice thing for the restaurant to do. I am always impressed when a business goes above and beyond. Their prices were good, definitely competitive with other places in the area. Domestic beer is $3 a bottle regularly so $2 with happy hour prices, it looked like they have a decent beer selection too. They have a really nice patio area outside and the inside isn't stuffed with tables like some places are, just a nice relaxing atmosphere."}
{"text":"Went tonight for the first time.  Awesome!  It used to be the dark horse saloon, which we went to last year--just ok and lousy service.     The Crafty Jackolope was a pleasant surprise.  Started with the pretzel bites. Cheese filled pretzels deep fried... Very good.   My dh had the brisket sandwich which he loved.  He especially commented on the very fresh focaccia bread it was on.  I had the grilled chicken wrap and it was excellent.   Thick bacon, cool cucumbers and lettuce with carmelized onions ... And they make their own ranch dressing to dip in it. Even my side salad was very fresh .. All green no iceberg.  $2 miller lite on Saturday sweetened the deal.   Our waitress Kristina did a nice job.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"My girlfriends and I went here for another trivia night on a Thursday evening. We enjoy coming here to catch up once in a while. Trivia is supposed to start at 8, but for some reason it didn't start until much later which was around 8:40pm. They have a nice selection of drinks on the drink menu and the food is pretty decent too. I ordered a few ciders and tried a dirty shirley temple. Sadly my shirley temple had zero vodka in it and when I sent it back, it still came back pretty lack luster. I'm really not too picky with my vodka either. So, I stuck with beer after that and the rose angry orchard tasted great. I also ordered fried pickles and buffalo chicken dip which is my go to, and this tasted pretty good as well. We had a lot of fun at trivia and will definitely be returning. Always expect a busy crowd on Thursdays and get there early if you want a seat! We couldn't find any seating left, but the manager was very kind enough to bring us up an extra table to seat all seven of us. He was very accommodating."}
{"text":"This was my third time here, and every time has been a great experience! Though it doesn't look like much from the outside, it's definitely a hidden gem! The servers are always very attentive, and the food is super reasonably priced but very yummy! They have a great draft selection and a huge bottle selection with a really nice variety! We have been able to please both craft beer/IPA lovers here, as well as \"traditional\" beer drinkers. We've also been able to please non-drinkers here, as there's a pretty good variety food-wise, and everything we've ever tried we've really liked. We have loved sitting outside in the summer, but were happy to see they enclose the outdoor sedition for the winter and still offer that as a seating area.   We have had their wings in the past and really enjoyed them, but this time we opted for full size meals. My husband got the buffalo mac n cheese - it was not only a generous portion, but quite delicious! I tried a bite and definitely plan to get that next time! I had the verde wrap and it was super flavorful!! We forgot how good the food was, especially for the price! I plan to add this to the list of places we patronize often!!"}
