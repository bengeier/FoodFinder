{"text":"The  food, wine, and service are outstanding!!!  Well done Frank!!!!
I Often go for lunch and dinner - always fresh, always great quality.   I also went to one of their wine taste testing dinner events for Zenato wines.....  Zenato himself was there in person !!!"}
{"text":"Excellent. . Beautiful al dente pasta! Great meatballs! 
Nice place.. Clean and friendly.  Loved it!"}
{"text":"I belong to a foodie group and this was actually the worse in almost everything.  We went a group of 15 before Christmas and I kept getting up to get the menus, ask for water etc...... and the waiter was giving me attitude instead of doing his job.  At the end he even picked a verbal fight with one of the members.  When I ask to see the owner, he said he was. Oh, Wow!!  So unprofessional!  I looked at him and told him the place should be CLOSED.  The worst service and the food really was not great.  It was not worth the price we were paying.  Sorry guys, I'm not expecting this place to stay open until next Christmas."}
{"text":"Amazing food and service but prices have gone up. Regardless of that it's a great welcoming restaurant and family friendly!"}
{"text":"Ce soir je retourne avec 13 personnes dont je pourrais vous donner un vaste choix de ce que nous avons essayé à ce soir"}
{"text":"As usual the food is good and fresh, very welcoming stuff, however i did notice an increase in prices , with that i may not come as regular as i was before. 4 star for the food and stuff , 3 stars for the prices"}
{"text":"Cuisine authentiquement italienne.  Quoi de mieux qu'une bonne soupe minestrone comme entrée! Les pâtes qui accompagnaient mon filet de morue étaient très bien.  La présentation était bien aussi.  Si vous cherchez un endroit tranquille ou pour des conversations discrètes.  C'est un endroit tout indiqué."}
{"text":"The more I spend time in Quebec, the more I realize how many wonderful restaurants there are here.  

This is an Italian restaurant with an absolutely wonderful and authentic Italian cuisine.  Everything from the rolls and garlic bread, to the veal parmigiana, the wine and espresso were perfect.  I couldn't complain about a single thing including he service.  

I will most certainly be back as often as I can and with more company.  :)

Enjoy!!"}
