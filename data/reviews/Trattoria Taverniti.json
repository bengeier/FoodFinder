{"text":"Très bon, tagliatelles au presto et chèvre pour moi, mes amis pizza carne et pâtes aux crevettes/tomates cerises/persil MAIS la quantité pour les pâtes compte tenu du prix est insuffisant, excepté pour la pizza ou c'est correct, nous restons sur notre faim, dommage :( service très bien également."}
{"text":"We opted to try the place despite some of the bad reviews. The place is very quaint and sets the mood. The tv didn't bother me as I had my back to it. We had the lasagne and squash ravioli. Both were amazing!  Best food since we've been in Italy! Good size portions. The brusetta was fresh tasting and the bread crispy. The waitress was from Venice and only in the country for three weeks. She was attentive and the service was great. Worth a visit."}
{"text":"Solid classic Italian fare in line with what you would expect with red checkered table cloths. Food was all hand made and very good. Atmosphere and people are all very nice. Problem is the price. This place seems to have the same issue as most Italian places on College St, overinflated for what you get.   Bruschetta was delicious and fresh, starter salad was basic but good. Pasta arabiatta was also fresh and nicely spicy, but just pasta and sauce, no accompanying sides. 4 cheese pizza for one was good, but for the price I probably wouldn't order again. This dinner for two was over 50 bucks, no alcohol included. With tip, over 60 is a lot for a what you get.   Shave 20-25% off the prices and I'd be a regular."}
{"text":"This is a great little spot in Toronto's little Italy. We really loved the exposed brick walls, checkered table clothes, and old wood decor. It's a family owned restaurant opened in 2011 and they make everything from scratch. The menu is also very decently priced, my friend and I had 2 drinks an appetizer and 2 entrées for $60  We had  Arancini - Homemade rice balls stuffed with mozzarella, parmigiano  It had a crispy crust, perfectly season and cooked to perfection. I've had Arancini in the past that was under seasoned or the rice was undercooked, I will most definitely be ordering this again  Parmigiana di Melanzane - Layers of breaded eggplant baked with parmigiano, mozzarella, in pomodoro sauce  The Taverniti Pomodoro sauce is amazing, they need to jar and sell it. The Pomodoro made this breaded eggplant was one of the best I've ever had.  Ravioli di Carne - Handmade ravioli stuffed with all ground beef in  pomodoro sauce  Perfectly cooked, and stuffed with love. I was very impressed by this dish. I usually find ravioli to be boring, but this dish was packed with flavour   Overall this was a great experience the food was fantastic with great service, we will be back again very soon."}
{"text":"First the good. The service was good, mostly attentive and caring. The bread was fabulous   The bad. Too much of everything. Too much dressing on the salad even after sending it back. Too much salt in the red sauce. Too much money. $18 lasagna was overpriced. And what Italian restaurant has what we call \"shaky cheese\". Nothing seemed fresh and modern. This is Italian from 1970's Orillia."}
{"text":"Decor was very nice and food was decent (only slightly overpriced), but our server was terrible and ruined the experience."}
{"text":"This lovely Italian restaurant promotes itself as being top quality while being unpretentious. It achieves this with a fantastic mix of great food and friendly staff. The two dishes we had - the penne arrabiata and the gnocchi - were delicious! They could do with a few more vegetarian options though. The service is quick, prices are good and you can get food up until late which is great for tourists making a big day of it in Toronto. They're quite happy to let you sit and enjoy a long chat after your meal without rushing you at all. I would highly recommend this place and would definitely come back again."}
{"text":"Polite staff, maybe a little too polite asked for another minute with the menu got another 10. Cute spot good location.   Pesto pizza was very good seafood pasta was WAAYY too salty couldn't finish."}
{"text":"Came here after walking by it a million times while on college st. treks. Nice and cozy, very friendly wait staff and reasonably priced. Food was good and portion sizes were perfect. To start me and my date had the prosciutto e melone which was delicious. For entree I had the tagliatelle alfredo, and my date had the gnocchi with a fresh tomato sauce. Small but good selection of wine. I'd definitely go back and try more of the pastas and give the pizzas a shot."}
{"text":"Came recommended by a friend. We came out here for dinner.  Ordered the mozzarella, argula and procuttio pizza. It was nice and thin, just like what you might find from the streets of Italy."}
{"text":"Great place for classic homemade Italian food! Fast and friendly, perfect for families or date night."}
{"text":"The BEST pasta I've ever had. Seriously so delicious- I got the fettuccine. I can't explain for amazing it was. Others I went with got the seafood pasta special and veal parm, everyone loved their meal. The decor is really nice and the service was amazing! Very knowledgeable, friendly, nice and attentive staff. Definitely my new favourite spot, can't wait to try the pizza next time."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Italian restaurant!  My first thought was, \"this tastes like my neighbor's nonna's cooking!\" Turns out all of the pasta, sauce, etc IS made from scratch by a sweet Italian lady.  Wait: Usually very busy but we got lucky when we went for lunch and were seated right away.  Ambiance: Exposed brick, checkered red tablecloth, small but very comfortable.  Service: Both times that I've been here the service was excellent. This time I brought my infant son and was very hesitant that the staff/guests wouldn't appreciate that, but we were treated very well!   Food: AMAZING! I am already wanting to go back and try more dishes! The portions were huge! I thought I would take home leftovers but it was too good that we ate everything.  The first time I went we had:   Penne alla Vodka: Perfect sauce! Perfect ratio of pancetta to sauce   Calabrese Pizza: Tomato sauce, mozzarella, hot soppresata, n'duja, black olives, drizzled honey.  This pizza was delicious and all of the flavors complimented each other very well! I've never had honey on pizza and it was a really nice touch.  The crust was perfection- thin and delicious.  This last time we had:   Prosciutto and bocconcini pizza: Tomato sauce, mozzarella, prosciutto, and bocconcini  My husband and I both agreed that this was the best pizza we've ever had. I can't wait to go back and get it again.   Fettuccine Bolognese: Amazing sauce, pasta cooked to a perfect al dente. I'm still dreaming about this sauce.   I highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"Hearty, Italian comfort food made with great care and tradition.  Taverniti is a rare find in an age where food can be more style than substance. The excellent, family restaurant reminds me of what I grew up with in Brooklyn.  The staff was very friendly.  We were treated to a table-side visit by Rosina, the family matriarch - a wonderful lady who clearly loves her food and for others to enjoy it.  Bruschetta were fresh and well seasoned with lightly toasted bread.  Polpette were delicious and served in fresh, tangy marinara.  My only nit - the meatballs could have been larger.  My friends ordered the rigatoni bolognese and spaghetti which they liked very much.  The veal parmigiana with penne marinara was excellent.  Just the right amount of cheese, tender veal.  Perfect.  The three were hearty portions.  Good chanti framed our meal.   I shall return next time in Toronto!"}
{"text":"I can honestly say that the people who wrote the first review must have gone on a bad day because this fantastic little restaurant is absolutely the best place to go in LIttle Italy. The atmosphere was great with the checkered tablecloths and brick interior, it reminded me of cooking in the kitchen with my grandma. The pizza was just fantastic and the waiter was great to talk to. Our whole family was eyeing the calamari at the table across from us which looked amazing as well. Once you enter the restaurant you are surrounded by the smells of homemade pizza and italian pastas. If you're in the mood for pizza this is the place to go. I haven't tried the pasta, but from the looks and smells of the dishes around us, I will be soon."}
{"text":"Cute restaurant food was decent  Service is bad constantly need to ask for things they won't clear your table unless you ask bring you bread or cheese for your dish unless you ask first and very absent  Would recommend 4 cheese pasta"}
{"text":"I look for two things in a restaurant. Great food and owners and staff who genuinely want you to be happy. This place has both.  This is a family run place with heart. Mrs Traverniti is from Calabrese. Authentic delicious home made food. Sophisticated simplicity. Tomato sauce is delicious. Meatballs stand out. Home made Gnocchi in pink sauce and the wood fired pizzas are truly great. To the reviewer who said his was burnt , I would suggest he politely ask for another and I know they would do so happily. Good house chianti and fresh Calabrese bread.  I love good Italian wine and find it hard to find a good house chianti in most places. Like I said sophisticated simplicity. They take every aspect of the meal into account.  The spinach cannelloni special had so much delicious spinach in it vs the gooey cheeses versions I often see. The Italians in the neighborhood eat here.  Its not a perfect foodie paradise like some reviewers require but it's real and special. They now know me and my kids by name and we feel like we are in Mrs Travernitis kitchen vs some cold typical Toronto restaurant. Can't pay enough for a feeling like that."}
{"text":"Ironically it is almost impossible to find good Italian food in Little Italy. I always suggest this place when people ask for a spot in the area. The food is traditional and tasty. Service can be a little slow and scattered but the staff are so nice it didn't trouble me. It's busy and crowded is a positive way. You get treated like a person here, I like the place a lot. Best to go when you can linger over your meal with good company."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, place is very quaint and cozy. We asked if it could be quick. Said it would be no problem considering we wanted pizzas. It took 1 hour and 15 for our meal. We were asked our food order on 3 different occasions before it arrived. Food was served after about 45 minutes. Asked for the bill when the pizzas came. They came 20 minutes later, and we were served  the wrong bill and then asked for 4th time what our food order was. Disappointing considering the amazing reviews."}
{"text":"The two of us came in just before the Friday dinner rush, at about 5:30. We were quickly greeted, seated and had our orders taken. I ordered the special of goat and ricotta cheese medallions with figs and oil. My wife ordered the small pizza (definitely more than enough for one person) with onions, gorgonzola and proscuitto. We also ordered a fairly tasty and cheap bottle of wine ($28). So our whole meal after tax and tip came to $75, so its not an every day sort of restaurant.  Food came very quickly and no complaints about it at all. I'd recommend this place."}
{"text":"Looking for some good Italian downtown on a Saturday night on the spur of the moment, we found this restaurant rated as #3 in the city by TripAdvisor, based on thousands of reviews.  Despite it's' small size (seating for approximately 30-40 I would guess), we got a reservation for four at 8:30pm after calling at 7pm - not sure if this is indicative of demand, as the first two higher rated couldn't fit us.  Anyway... the people were pleasant.  When we arrived, although our booth was a bit tight, it is a cozy space with a somewhat rustic, minimalist feel.  I will say that the night was one of the first hot evenings of the season, and it was quite warm in the restaurant, so it seemed like this might be a really good spot for those cold, winter evenings, but less suitable for the warmer weather.  Moving on... the service was very friendly, but there was one hitch:  our waitress had a strong Italian lilt, but seemed to have a bit of trouble with English.  No worries, as that could add to the ambiance, but she often seemed confused.  After we had been sitting, quite warm for approximately 15 minutes, the other server, who one would guess is the experienced and senior member of the staff, came to our table and asked if her colleague had told us about the specials (yes) and offered us water (we had requested it 15 minutes earlier) - whether accurate or not, our impression was that she was \"checking up\" on her.  Anyway... we did eventually get our water, but only four small glasses, instead of just leaving us with a water carafe as they did later.  The appetizers that we had ordered earlier with the water came probably 30 minutes after we ordered them, which seemed a long time for bruschetta and some stuffed risotto balls.  In the intervening period, we had ordered our mains.  Anyway, the appetizers were good quality - not fantastic, but solid, good food.  Now... before I outline our main issue, I should provide one caveat:  on the menu, there is a note that food can take time because it is all hand-made from scratch.  Having said that... our mains did not come until more than an hour after we had sat down, and we did not order a long list of apps - just a couple of things to share.  By this point, we were hot and famished.  Despite the menu warning, it is a little bit surprising to find that a restaurant can not handle dinner for four in a quicker fashion, when there are approximately 10-20 people in the restaurant who seem to be not already in mid-meal.  The mains were again very good, solid quality - portions not overly generous, but not skimpy either.  My wife actually ate her entire portion (seafood pasta) which is a rarity, and a good sign.  By the time we had finished our mains, rather quickly I admit since we were famished, we were still hot and simply did not want to chance another lengthy period for dessert or aperatifs.  it was the right decision because after I asked for the cheque, it took another 15 minutes for that to be executed.  I should add one final note:  none of us ordered the pizza, but three of them passed while we were waiting for our food, and while I should warn you that our hungry state would have made kraft dinner appear as a delicacy, the pies looked really yummy, and I am tempted to go back at some point just to try one.  Perhaps I'll look into whether they do take out and order in advance to avoid the wait.  So... in summary:  nice atmosphere for cooler weather, good quality food, and very good looking pizzas.  Worth a try, but unfortunately can't be highly recommended at this point."}
{"text":"We visited Trattoria with a group of ten friends. We had a great time and delicious food. The waiter was very personable and told us everything on the menu was good. After our visit, we had to agree. The atmosphere was very sleek and modern, and the staff and owner were warm and friendly. We will be back to visit."}
{"text":"I was craving some penne alla vodka and came across this local spot. I headed into the restaurant which was busy and asked the waitress if I could place an order for takeout. She confirmed my order and told me it'd be about 10mins. I waited and waited as they turned away several customers because they had reservations booked until closing. Again I waited some more. Then I saw the cook place the takeout bag on the counter hoping and praying it was mine. For about another 20mins I stood there waiting; zero eye contact and complete avoidance while the waitresses brought other tables their food, handed out several bills and cleared the tables by literally turning the used tablecloth over-not cleaning or wiping anything down-the waitress with cockeye had the audacity to tell me my food was ready and tried to discretely hand me the takeout bag that had been sitting on the counter for 25mins! I confronted her and told her it was beyond unacceptable to have someone waiting there for 30+ mins all the while their food is ready, ignore me and acknowledge all the white clientele and tell me a bold face  lie about how she was having trouble printing the bill, but had given three tables their bills right in front of my face. She made every excuse in the book and even told me to just take the food to which I refused. I told her she should've communicated something to me. I will never eat at this establishment and hope people take note of this poorly run restaurant. I wish I could've rated them -10 stars. Beyond disappointed and disgusted!"}
{"text":"Went to check this restaurant out with my mother recently and was very satisfied. The restaurant is a small, cozy spot on college street in Little Italy. The food accurately represents the taste of Italian cuisine and has every signature dish you would hope for. We had the special risotto that was featured for the evening and a pesto fettuccine dish. Both dishes were full of flavour and greatly enjoyed by both of us. The bar in the restaurant is quite small, with only Stella on tap and the rest all wine items, which you would expect from an Italian restaurant. I would definitely go back to taste the other dishes they have to offer!"}
{"text":"So I went here on a. Friday night and our eyes caught on to the authentic Italian cuisine sign outside. My girlfriend and u decided to give this a try... It was relatively busy but we found seats at the bar. The food was good decent portions and quality ...what made this place feat however was the great service and friendly people. For Italian cuisine trattoria taverniti has pretty decent prices.  Would definitely go back.  So CONGRATS Trattoria Taverniti you are TooTuff Approved!!!"}
{"text":"Man I want to love this place but it just fell a little short. I've walked past Taverniti for the last 15 years and never went in. We finally checked it out the day after Hallmark day. I ordered the seafood linguine and my partner ordered the spaghetti carbonara. After about 5 mins the server informed me they had no seafood (Somewhat understandable I guess after V-day) so the options were fresh fish or mussels. I went with the fish....or did I? The food arrived about 20 mins later. Mussels.....so many damn mussels! My partner was served a ravioli and I asked the server if she had the right table since my plate was wrong as well. She said \"You ordered the mussels not fish right\" Well no, I ordered the fish but it's all good because I do like mussels and I was ready to eat the flower on the table at this point. She apologized and took the ravioli to another table. So now we have a standoff. We have two tables with two people at each yet only one dish per table. This is getting tense. Who will receive their dish first so eating can commence? Did they mess up the tables or the dish? Not wanting to be a rude ass, I patiently wait for my partner's plate to be delivered. It comes out about 4mins later piping hot...we won against table three! They obviously got the order wrong.  Anyways the pasta was cooked perfectly but I thought the portion was quite small (compared to the amount of mussels which were tasty) I looked back in the kitchen and saw the problem. The dude was on the phone...twice. No phones in the kitchen Anthony! It's a distraction and unhygienic. I will return here to try their pizza as it looked good. Hand made pasta in a cozy setting. I want to like this place.  P.S. Get rid of the damn t.v.! It's not a dentist office. I don't need to see the weather on CP24."}
{"text":"We very liked the place and experience. It's a very original Italian place. We had pizza and pasta and both were great. When we left, everybody in our group was happy."}
{"text":"Hard to find a restaurant like this in the city now a days, you don't feel like you are in Toronto once you go inside also you can definitely taste the care in the food making.   Will go back for sure and tell all my friends."}
{"text":"Amazing carbonara! Really authentic and a very intimate atmosphere"}
{"text":"I was there for dinner tonight with my family and we will definitely be back very very soon!  From the wonderfully helpful, friendly staff, to the incredibly delicious food (every bite was SO amazing), the whole experience was memorable and we look forward to becoming regulars at your restaurant.   Thank you to everyone at Taverniti for the amazing evening!  See you soon!  Grazie :)"}
{"text":"Good Day: Thank you for taking your time to read my review.  This restaurant does make reasonable Italian food.  What they do not do is take care of their valued customer base.  I always make reservations and I prefer restaurants that take reservations.  I reserved a table for two at 8:30 hrs.  We arrived 15 minutes before our reservation and we were greeted at the door by staff who told us that they did not have a table for us.  I explained to the staff that we had a reservation.  It did not seem to matter.  I asked if they could accommodate us at the bar until there was a table available and all we were given was an \"icy stare\".  I asked to speak to the manager who was \"absent\" during the time we were there.  They offered no apologies or explanation.  I have been a patron many times in the past, but that did not matter.  We left and crossed the street to Cafe Diplomatico for dinner.  We were so well taken care of, it was unbelievable!  A private dining room was opened for us and Tina and Fabrie were Excalibur in their service to us.  The repas is delicious and we have never returned to Trattoria Taverniti.  I suggest that the owners of this establishment, cross the street to Cafe Diplomatico to witness how incredible customer service is delivered!  Govern yourself accordingly."}
{"text":"Let me start by saying that this review is mostly based on service. The food itself was alright.  The restaurant was pretty much empty. The server took our order without writing it down. A good 15 min later our wine still hadn't arrived. We tried waving her down but she never looked at us. She then came to our table to ask us what drinks we had ordered because she couldn't remember. Which means she hadn't punched in our order yet. That's was over 15Minutes after we ordered. At that point, two guys sat on a table next to ours and received their food way before ours. I spilled my wine on me, the waitress saw and never came to give us napkins or anything. Then my pizza came in with a wrong topping. I asked for eggplant and I got mushroom. My boyfriends food arrived around 5 minutes later even tho the place was empty. She never came to do a quality check.  Really not impressed with the service which kind of ruined the whole experience.   She did remove our glass of wine from the bill since it took so long, which was kind of nice. Only reason we still tipped her 15%....  The other server that was on was really nice."}
{"text":"kept hearing good things about this place so finally tried it.    ATMOSPHERE: authentic with a positive vibe. it's like you walked into a popular resto in italy!  It can be romantic in a booth, fun with friends at a larger table, or go for drinks at the bar or patio. i'll def come back with friends.  SERVICE: there were more than enough waitresses to serve all the tables so no waiting longer than you have to.   FOOD: had 2 apps (Figs w/goat cheese/prosciutto & cheese/olive/cured meat plate), a bufalo mozz pizza and gnocchi in tomato sauce. the tomato sauce is divine!  im italian and have made hundreds of jarsbefore...it actually tastes fresh and like nonna's sauce. Apps were creative and absolutely delicious.    believe it or not every single gnocchi has hand rolled grooves! (like nonna taught me). the pizza is amazing and a different style from the floppy terroni pizzas.  the crust is thin yet stays firm.  and again...that tomato sauce!    DESSERT: we were so stuffed we only had cappuccinos.  OMG...that had to be the best cappuccino i've had. ever. including what i had in Italy!  LOVED the experience and the food.  I don't normally review restaurants but it wouldn't be right in this case not to 'cause it deserves credit for all the care put into the quality of the cuisine.   VERY IMPRESSED.  100% favorite restaurant in Toronto."}
{"text":"We really wanted to like this place, the atmosphere was warm, there was cute checkered tablecloths, there were candles going, and its decently priced italian food in our neighbourhood!  However, the waitress dressed in a sweatshirt couldn't answer questions about the menu, or why the price of a pitcher of beer (1.5L) is more expensive then 3 glasses of beer (20 oz. each x 3 = 1.7L)... she did NOT recommend the spaghetti and meatballs, so my husband ordered the special (listed on the sign outside as Steak, potatoes and salad) and I ordered a pizza. His meal comes and the steak is about the size of a business card and not much thicker, doused in oil. The potatoes are fries, and the salad is what looks like a pile of tasteless unidentifiable warm greens that may have been leaves at some point. The pizza also tastes like a frozen - and -reheated grocery store item cross bred with a piece of cardboard.   When we got around to paying, the waitress drops off the little credit card doohicky and disappears, so we had to print our own receipt and sign it with a pen I found at the bottom of my own purse. Not a big deal, but it was an irritating ending to a bad experience."}
{"text":"Food was fresh, flavorful, and absolutely delicious! Waitress was very kind and personable; great location in Little Italy, Toronto.  Charming  street-front atmosphere with reasonable prices."}
{"text":"Spent four great days in Toronto and stumbled upon this place on our way to the airport to fly home.  It was by far our best meal of the trip.  This place is the real deal.  Fresh, delicious food, checkered tablecloths, and Nona!  We were only disappointed that we didn't find it earlier because we really wanted to try more dishes.  My husband had the lasagna and I had pasta with pancetta and cheese.  We weren't starving when we walked in but it was too good to not clean our plates!"}
{"text":"Very good experience. Excellent \"family restaurant\" ambiance, but cozy enough for a date night. Excellent service from the waitresses."}
{"text":"This place is absolutely amazing. 5 stars is not enough. My traveling partners started with glasses of Pino Grigio that they said was the best they've had. The bread that was served was incredibly fresh and the oil and balsamic for dipping was delicious. One person ordered lasagne that had the best red sauce they've ever tasted. Another had the carbonara that was delicious. I had a special that was penne with ricotta, basil and cherry tomatoes. Absolutely AMAZING."}
{"text":"I went there yesterday with my hubby and we both though this place was very authentic.  First off, the old lady which is likely the owner speaks some English, but definitely Italian. The staff speak Italian together and they seem to be family.  We ordered the arancini for starter and then the dominico pizza as a main. They were both very good and fit well with the Sangiovese red wine we ordered.  The place is pretty small and the decor is modest, it's quiet so I would recommend it for couples or small groups."}
{"text":"I've been there once, and I spent almost $100 dollars por three people, my spaghetti was over coked and greasy, the pizza had a tiny slice of cheese and the dough was raw, the service was so terrible. bad experience there."}
{"text":"We went to this trattoria to celebrate my mom's birthday. We had a good time there. :) I love the pizza and the gnocchi. My mom really enjoyed the zucca agnolotti. I ordered a rigatoni bolognese, wasn't too impressed with it. I always love the vibe of little Italy. It's like dining in your Italian trattoria, relaxing, intimate and warm."}
{"text":"Great little place on College for simple pastas and delicious pizza. Quiet ambiance with plaid table clothes and friendly service. Penne alla Calabrese was great and they accommodated changes happily. Good value. Will be a regular spot to satisfy my pasta cravings."}
{"text":"Really thought this place would be great; it was not ! Hot white wine , and could 't get an ice bucket with any ice . The food arrived : cold and dry, followed by a small fire that left the place smoke filled. The main courses arrived , a sad mess cold tasteless and the pizza , burnt. Now we know what the fire was about!   This place was over priced and so disappointing on so many levels. How it got any good reviews is a mystery."}
{"text":"Sometimes you find the best wonderful little treasures when you are just wandering around an area looking for a place to eat. On one of my many visits up to Toronto from the New York City area yesterday evening I was walking through Little Italy and just happened to walk by Trattoria Taverniti. It is a small place, but had the look of a place I might have bumped into wandering in Trastevere in Roma or perhaps in a small town in Calabria. It was busy, but I was pleasantly greeted and offered one of only two seats at the small bar. Once inside and gathering that  the owner was in the kitchen with an apron on and his young daughter was helping with tables I knew a special meal would follow and I was not going to have to ask that the macaroni come out perfectly al dente!. A pitcher of water was placed on the bar for me and I had a nice glass of Valpolicella wine...served in a wine glass one might be served in when visiting in a friend's back yard. I started with some prosciutto e melone and was very pleased with the choice. The melon was fresh and the prosciutto sliced nice and thin and of high quality. The owner's daughter twice checked in with me to see if I was pleased with the quality. Now, came the big treat of the evening! I was thrilled to see that they had Cacio e Pepe on the menu. It is one of my favorite parts of visiting Roma but it is extremely hard to find in North American Italian restaurants. In fact, in my many, many visits to some of the traditional Italian restaurants in New York I don't believe I have seen it on a menu there. When the macaroni arrived and I took the first bite with the perfect blend of cheese and pepper a big smile came to my face. The last time I had this dish was in Harry's Bar on the Via Veneto in Roma last fall and at less than half the price Taverniti's version was every bit as good, and better. In a few seconds Dominic, the owner, came out of the kitchen to check with me on the quality of his little masterpiece of a meal. He also checked on the quality of the waitress and his daughter's service (they got an A+). Despite being busy in the kitchen Dominic came out a few more times to chat during the meal, adding to the welcoming touch to it all. I closed the meal with a nice glass of grappa. Though I have eaten in many \"fancier\" restaurants my experience at Taverniti's reminded me why why the best experiences come in places just like this....a legit Italian meal in a warm and welcoming atmosphere delivered with clear family pride. A little slice of La Dolce Vita in Toronto."}
{"text":"Was hoping to have some really delicious homestyle Italian food but came away disappointed. 2 pasta dishes were middling in taste and quality. Sub-par Caesar salad as well. I've had much better Italian food! Service was ok but waiter looked like he was doing us a favour by taking our order."}
{"text":"Hands down the best Italian food! Authentic, fresh, home made! We even had the pleasure of meeting the master chef Signora Rosina! Small, quaint, excellent!! Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Holy hell do I love this place. Simple, fresh, reasonably priced, and oh-so-delicious. The funghi parpadelle will blow your mind. Service is wonderful and decor is quaint and charming. Perfect date spot."}
{"text":"The service was slow and I felt completely forgotten about while they were checking in with every other table. Food was just ok. I asked for a minimal amount of cheese that didn't happen and the pesto was bland. Big disappointment based on the other reviews. I definitely wouldn't ever come back."}
{"text":"Lively and consistently outstanding food.  The pastas are on point and the pizza is truly amongst the best in town.  Casual and immensely satisfying!"}
{"text":"We came across this amazing little gem on Saturday after wandering around Little italy. It was recommended by a local as one of the best. She was right! From the moment we walked in, we knew it was going to be special. Exposed brick, red checkered table clothes, and packed! We were lucky enough to snag the last table and happily settled in. The food didn't disappoint. We've never had the type of crust they use for their pizza, it was absolutely the best. The dough is from Calabria, Italy. So it's nowhere else to be found in the entire city. Also had the homemade eggplant parmesan, it was fantastic!!!  The service was polite and prompt, lots of smiles and attention. Highly recommended little spot, we just can't say enough good things about Taverniti!!!"}
{"text":"The cook and owner is the sweetest grandmother-esque Itallian women you will ever meet! The food is AMAZING. Wonderful food at a very reasonable price."}
{"text":"The carbonara was wonderful.  Worth a visit on its own.  The margherita pizza was fantastic. The crust is amazing.  Love the corn meal on the bottom."}
{"text":"We were so pleased with the food, atmosphere, and service. We loved the $5 bowl of olives and the mushroom tagliatelle was perfectly done - truffle with restraint. We'll be back."}
{"text":"It turns out the founder of this restaurant is from the same region of Italy (Calabria) my mom originated from, who was an extraordinary cook.  So I may be biased - but I loved it.  We had arancini, rigatoni bolognese and the gnocchi Venezia.  I want to comeback to try everything on the menu."}
{"text":"This restaurant was a random but wonderful choice for five hungry people at the end of a long day of visiting Toronto's tourist attractions. (I felt a teeny bit of pressure as my guests from Michigan have Italian heritage and were keen to see what Little Italy has to offer!) The proximity of a gelato bar (The Mad Italian) factored in our first idea of getting dinner at Tavernitis, but the friendly waiter who saw us loitering outside looking at the posted menu kindly gave us menus to look at more conveniently, and the selection of salads, pastas, and pizzas drew us inside. The cozy atmosphere and aroma of Italian food reassured us as we made our way to our table.  The restaurant isn't large, but it is charming, with exposed brickwork, and cheerful red checked tablecloths. Our waiter was even more charming - an Italian newly arrived in Canada. He was patient with us (two adults, two teens and a child) as we asked about menu items, helped us arrange tables to accommodate our party, and he made useful recommendations about food and drink.  We were craving pizza, and ordered the carne (pepperoni, Italian sausage, bacon) and primavera (artichoke hearts, black olives, red peppers). As we waited, we noted that dishes at other tables looked very good - we wondered if our decision not to order an appetizer was wise, after seeing the bruschetta and calamari at the next table! We were very happy with our pizzas - thin crust, with a nicely flavoured tomato sauce, perfectly baked, and a good mixture of cheese and toppings. The toppings themselves were high quality - the pepperoni and sausage were much better than I am used to seeing on pizza.   We all enjoyed the food ... the adults enjoyed the wine, too! The prices were reasonable and the service was excellent. (Our experience couldn't have been more different than A.B.'s!) While there are lots of Italian restaurants to choose from in this area, I wouldn't hesitate to go back."}
{"text":"This place is a cute little gem and one of my favourite Italian restaurants in Toronto. It's small and cozy and has an authentic family-run feel to it. The owner even came and checked on us to see if we enjoyed our food, and had little conversations with each table.   We ordered the N'duja bruschetta to start, which was so delicious. It was the perfect balance of sweet and spicy and really hit the spot. I ordered the Gnocchi Venezia and it was hands down the best gnocchi I've tasted.   I've tried a couple times to make reservations to come back, but they're always pretty booked up a couple days in advance."}
{"text":"1. Food- Authentic, light yet flavourful. Decent portions. Variety of options for appetizers, pasta, and pizza.  2. Price- Fair, below average for the area.   3. Service- Only one server on the floor. Server was friendly, however he seemed inexperienced (slow and forgets requests), but that didn't bother us.  A possibility that they may be understaffed.  4. Atmosphere- cozy and welcoming, but the seatings were a bit tight (small restaurant fitting only around 10 tables).  Overall, it was a great experience. Will return to try out other items on menu!"}
{"text":"I've been here before, the food is really good. Though yesterday we dropped in, they said it would be a 30 minute wait and said they would call us. No one ended up contacting us all night which is pretty annoying and could have ruined our night"}
{"text":"Been here at least a half dozen times and the quality has always been consistent. Sauces have always been full of flavour and never watered down. The atmosphere is definitely more intimate than most, better for special occasions or dates then a night out with friends."}
{"text":"Went to this place after I had terrible gorgonzola pasta elsewhere and a friend recommended Trattoria Taverniti's gorgonzola pasta and boy were they right...  We had the risotto balls, the gorgonzola pasta and the mediterranean pizza and everything was delicious: the risotto balls' breading was DELICIOUS (light and cripsy) and the inside was really tasty and filled with gooey cheese; the gorgonzola pasta was LOADED with gorgonzola and walnuts and the pizza had a delicious thin crust and fresh toppings.  An overall successful experience! I'll definitely be going back."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this restaurant when we were looking for a place to eat.  Made a reservation through Open Table.  I would suggest that you make a reservation because the restaurant is very small.  Being small, they take their time in preparing wonderful dishes.  Our appetizer, entrees and dessert were excellent.  Fresh pasta, fresh cheeses and fruits, if I had a bigger appetite I would have ordered one of their pizzas because they looked delicious.  I am giving them 5 stars because I would definitely take family there and recommend to friends."}
{"text":"very nice pasta and great olive appetizer. the restaurant is tiny and we saw a bunch of other parties get turned down because it was so busy..."}
{"text":"Good service for this small Italian restaurant.  Very authentic Italian food at a more than fair price.  The owner is a wonderful chef making fresh pasta and gnocchi.  We loved it!  If you are expecting soft cushy booths in a quiet setting this is not your place.  If you want authentic Italian in a small restaurant in the heart of a vibrant city, then this is your spot."}
{"text":"We had a good dinner. We had a small cheese plate, arugala salad, arancini, pasta in gorgonzola sauce with walnuts, and cocktails. The food came out fast. There was plenty of wait staff. It is pretty cute inside the restaurant. It all tasted quite good. Worthy of a visit."}
{"text":"Lovely small romantic place with Great fresh food. Pizza's are amazing, and you can find a lot of creative pizzas - which you cannot find elsewhere. Cannelloni was also great. Great Wine selection, and very friendly service. Highly recommend it, especially for a date night."}
{"text":"Why go to an Italian when you can make it at home? Because there is only a few of us talented enough to make food as good as Trattoria Tavernitti. I have been here twice and it is excellent food for good value. Penne tomato sauce is exquisite, lasagne is mouth wateringly good and service is always on hand in this delightful corner of Toronto. Definitely worth visiting if you appreciate your Italian food."}
{"text":"The best adjective to describe this place is \"homey\". It's small with brick walls and checkered table cloths...and Nonna is there making sure you are happy. It's a family business and she mentioned 3 generations involvement.  Two of us ordered pizza. They were cooked perfectly and were delicious. I had the Calabrese and I would recommend it. The best gnocchi we ever had was in Taormina Sicily. My wife ordered the gnocchi tonight and it was excellent,  second only to Sicily and the best we've had in Toronto. There was a penne with tomato sauce ordered and it was good but not great. We went early on a Wednesday so had no problem getting a table but I can imagine it can fill up fast and be noisy so be prepared. We will be back for pizza and gnocchi and we will try another pasta sometime too."}
{"text":"Great food.  We had the window seat.  Good view.  Nice ambience. Fair prices.  Couldn't ask for more (well maybe the waitress could have come around more as I had to flag her down for second drink)."}
{"text":"3 stars for service, 5+ stars for food.  We came at an especially busy time, but we had to wait more than an hour for our food, even the salad!  The waitress tried to be helpful, but there is only so much you can do when crowds are large and the kitchen is small ....  But the food was EXCELLENT. The best carbonara I've ever had - light and peppery with subtle flavors.  The pizzas had a crispy texture, good sauce and crunch with a slight rosemary flavor - very good.  The lasagna was also good, very saucy.    I would go back, but not on a weekend evening in the summer or other busy time."}
{"text":"Had their lasagna. It was really good. One of the better lasagnas I've had here. Seems like a family-run business and it had great service. The portion was quite big. Had to ask for a doggy bag, which I enjoyed the next day. Will definitely go back for some other items on the menu, such as the pizza and the ravioli."}
{"text":"Great selection in menu. Staff is friendly but under staffed, took too long to get some attention.  Did was outstanding and hot. No complaints about quality and freshness. Presentation was neat and simple.  Will definitely come back again"}
{"text":"We went here tonight with my family for our anniversary. The restaurant is small and you should make a reservation. I have to say everything we ordered was delicious. Lasagna, gnocchi, spaghetti, pizza. The chef came out to great us. Please give this little gem a visit."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this cute little gem after a drive through little Italy. We found a street adjacent to the restaurant that we were able to park on for free (after hours). The service was great we were promptly seated upon arriving. There was only one table for two left but I think they were saving it for a couple as we were seated at the bar.   My cousin and I decided that we would order a bunch of food and share everything which was great! We ordered the original bruschetta and it was delicious! There was Parmesan cheese on top and perfectly season tomatoes with a crispy baguette bottom. We also had the calamari which was lightly battered but very flavourful. As a main we ordered a pizza with salami and carbonara pasta. The pizza was really good I loved the crispy crust and the thick layer of cheese. The pasta was good but I've had better. We left with full bellies and had a great evening out. I can't wait to come back and try some other tasty items off the menu!"}
{"text":"I am always craving Trattoria Taverniti, which sucks for my boyfriend because every time he wants to make Italian food, I just rather go to Trattoria.   Everything they have to offer is incredibly delicious and reasonably priced. The staff is sweet and the decor is beautifully quaint. Trattoria Taverniti is filled with loads of charm and is perfect for a nice, relaxing night out. If you plan on going during the weekend, it may be a good idea to reserve beforehand so that you don't have to wait for a seat considering the place doesn't fit many people!  Their wine selection isn't that great but good enough for a glass to accompany your yummy Italian food. It just breaks my heart that they do not offer a cool wine list from their specific region of Italy (I would literally be there every night if that were the case).   I hope you enjoy this lovely restaurant as much as I do!"}
{"text":"A charming little Italian gem on College Street. The service is fast and friendly. The food is authentic Italian home style pasta and pizza. I went with a large group and everyone's plates arrived at the table within a few minutes steaming hot and ready to mangia! There was a good variety of choices. Something for everyone. I went with the Bauletti di Zucca, pasta pockets with a light squash filling in a rose tomato sauce. Very nice. The portions were generous just like nonna dishes it out. A nice place to grab a little comfort food."}
{"text":"We initially came at around 6:45pm on a Thursday, it was already busy. We left our number and got a missed call about 10 minutes later. We came back and waited about 10 minutes. The ambience of this restaurant is homey. It is quite cramped though given the size of the place. They give you bread and balsamic vinegar to start. We were able to ask for more bread. I got the carbonara which tasted fresh and creamy. Although, I felt like mine was a little bit on the al dente side. The owner checked in with us during our meal. The tiramisu was also delicious. We had to get their attention a few times though. However, I would come back."}
{"text":"Got a recommendation on this place while visiting Casa Loma. True to promise the food was delightful.  The menu did warn that all pasta and entres were made fresh so we settled down for a little wait.  Took a little over a hour which I think even surprised our server. But the food was worth the wait and it never hurts to actually talk to your family so the time was well spent. Had the Fettuccine Alfredo, Spaghetti with shrimp in a white wine sauce, and the lasagna.  Food hot and tasted great. The lasagna was the most ordinary of our three dishes.  Wait staff was friendly but clearly they needed additional servers as it was a little lacking on responsiveness.  Great place for a romantic dinner."}
{"text":"I was in Little Italy this cold, February morning for an appointment and decided to grab some lunch with a couple friends afterwards. I'd heard mention of this restaurant before and noting its proximity, decided this would be a great opportunity to check it out.  The first thing I will note is that we accidentally showed up at the restaurant 20 minutes before they opened (noon), but our server (Natasha) was kind enough to let us in early. She seated us and brought us water and menus promptly. This was much appreciated considering it was a bitter -25C outside today!  The restaurant itself is cozy and quaint, with exposed brick walls and red-and-white checkered tablecloths. It is simple, but very welcoming. To my knowledge, the restaurant also has a patio area out front during the warmer months. While we perused our menus, Natasha brought us a basket of crisp, warm bread and a olive oil & balsamic mixture for dipping. Throughout the entire meal, she was very attentive to us (although we were the only table in the restaurant) and made us feel well taken care of and comfortable.  My friends ordered the gnocchi venezia and pizza mediterraneo. I myself, being a fungi fanatic, had to try the agnolotti al funghi. I was not disappointed. The pasta was cooked perfectly al dente and the agnolotti pockets were filled with amazing umami flavor from the wild mushrooms. I was in heaven! The sauce itself was very creamy and delicious. I tend to prefer red sauces to white, but this Alfredo is so, so flavorful with bits of sweet/peppery basil scattered throughout it to keep things interesting. I am usually pretty good with cleaning my plate when I eat, but my friend commented that she half expected me to pick up my plate and start licking it. If that is any indication of how good my dish was, I don't know what could be!  I will definitely be going back in the future to consider bumping this 4-star to a 5."}
{"text":"I am Italian, and my extended family owns a restaurant, and this is by far one of the best Italian places I've ever been to. A total hidden gem, small little place with only a couple tables and a very small outdoor seating. It is very clear that it is authentic Italian- simple ingredients, wood fire pizza, even (very sweet) Italian waitresses!"}
{"text":"We went on a Saturday night after a show at the Royal Theatre across the street and walked in without a reservation. The atmosphere was warm and inviting and felt like an authentic Italian taverna. The staff were very friendly but very disorganized. They were not familiar with the items on the menu, brought the wrong orders to our table and brought me a completely different dish after I ordered off the specials menu. At that point they informed me they had run out and I had to wait for another dish to be made while the rest of the table ate their dinner. We also had to ask them to bring bread to the table. To their credit they tried very hard to make things right and comp'd us a free dessert for the trouble which was a nice gesture and made this an average experience from what was shaping up to be a bad one. The calzone was enormous and the food was good but not exceptional. I would go back there again another time in the hopes we caught them on a bad night."}
{"text":"The oizza was OK here.  Not awesome but good.  The crust was a little thicker than I had expected but still relatively thin crust. The overall flavour was pretty good but it was missing something that would make it a 5\" star.  Maybe next time I will try the pasta.  I do really like the indie of this spot,  a real nice feeling to it and the staff were great."}
{"text":"If you are familiar with South Italian cooking you may think this place is great. There are some very positive reviews and thats what brought me here. First interaction was awesome; friendly waitress/hostess, nice cozy booth for 2, immediate menus and water service, nice. The waitress was the highlight of our dinner. I didn't get her name but she was the only one there, next to Nonna who was floating around the bar, serving customers Like my daughter said, \"you know a place is authentic when there's a Nonna behind the bar\". And authentic South Italian it is. The menu is full of comfort foods: pasta, pizza, and many things with red sauce.   But there lies the first problem. The tomato sauce was very salty. Unfortunately I ordered the aranchini and polpette (rice balls and meatballs) and both dishes were heavily laden with sauce. Somewhat tasty but too salty.   The seafood pasta noodles were cooked perfectly al dente but then slathered with the same salty red sauce. I read the pizzas were awesome and I would loved to have tried it. Maybe next time, although I'm not sure that will happen. There are so many great Italian places along College that I can think of several that I prefer.   The interior is very small and the problem with that occurs when there's a couple of loud guys at the bar drinking and laughing it up with Nonna. You can hear that loudly throughout the whole restaurant which doesn't make for a nice experience."}
{"text":"Amazing pizza. It did not disappoint. It's a small cute restaurant as well. Friendly staff and great service."}
{"text":"Get the bolognese. Great housemade pasta.  Their olive oil mix with balsamic vinegar was yummy and a nice addition to bread."}
{"text":"This is a cute little restaurant. We ordered arancini to share with the table. These arancini weren't the best nor the worst arancini. It was a solid B+. It was hot, crunchy and cheesy so it'll definitely satisfy your arancini craving if you have one.  I got the penne salsiccia. Again, I would give it a B. It's a step up from a chain restaurant but I wouldn't say it's the best pasta I've ever had. The sausage was a bit dry and the sauce wasn't the most flavourful.  There are so many Italian restaurants around the area, I would probably give those restaurants a try before returning back to this one."}
{"text":"Less than impressive.  Food was basic and service below that.  Another one of those places which overcrowd an area and rush you, robbing you of the experience of being out and enjoying a meal."}
{"text":"Great pizza place for sit down pizza meal! Service is good, pizza amazing, nice location, and very charming interior!"}
{"text":"What a lovely Italian restaurant. Great pasta and service. The gnocchi is stunning and so are the other options. Good pizza. Very cute place. The owner is the chef. She will come out to say a quick hello. Honest and simple.  Go for it. The real little Italy gem."}
{"text":"Nice little spot in Little Italy.  Casual relaxing atmosphere. Simple menu, not overbearing.  Washrooms small but clean. Disappointed that they did not have 6 wine glasses... Strange when part of their logo is \"Vino\".   Service was good but kitchen slow.  Plates dud not come out at the same time (there were 6). One in our group was the birthday girl and her food came last.  We all waited for hers to come.   We had to ask for bread... Is that normal?  Portions were a good size and wine very good.  3.5 stars.   I recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"I live in Ny and this is the best Italian food I've ever eaten. I ordered a penne a la vodka and it was so fresh. My five year old devoured his pepperoni pizza and there was still a good amount to take home. It has an intimate environment with a lot of character. Gets busy fast so maybe make reservations? Service was great they were super warm and the owners mother adds a special touch to the experience. It really is a taste of Italy in the heart of Torontos little Italy. Next time we're in Toronto we're totally going back."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant during the Taste of Italy festival.  They had a limited menu which is understandable and all their dishes were plastic BUT they did have pizza options.  I chose to go for a pizza because I noticed all the pastas were pre-made.  I ordered the Gorgonzola pizza and thought it was fantastic.  We also ordered the Cabrese salad and a fig dish and it turned out excellent.  I really felt bad for the staff though...they had a few rude customers who were impatient.  They did not understand that bc of Taste of Italy, their pizza orders would take awhile to cook and noticed a couple took off without waiting for their food which is not right.  :( The staff members did handle it professionally.  They did what they could do for a busy weekend.  I would definitely come back and try their full menu."}
{"text":"Three of us went here tonight and we each absolutely loved our dishes! The dishes were all very freshly made, homemade noodles, and incredibly flavorful sauces. We got the fettuccini with vegetables in red sauce (forgot the name), the chicken parm and the spaghetti with meatballs. Great customer service, wonderful food. I would highly recommend this Restaurant to anyone looking for a homemade Italian dish."}
{"text":"Great pizza and pasta, including gluten free. Everything was well prepared and the portions were generous. Cramped interior means groups larger than six should call ahead.  Recommended."}
{"text":"We has cheese pizza and it was fantastic. Thin crust and full of flavors. My daughter has meatballs and spaghetti she said the meatballs were great. We also has the sangria. Also great. A great stop."}
{"text":"Exactly what you want from and old school Italian restaurant, right down to the checked tablecloths!  So many 'so so' Italian spots on College now so this is a must if you are looking for giant helpings of pasta, traditional Salads, and to-die-for veal parmigiana!  Everyone loved everything we ordered, the service was great and it was a cozy spot for a cold winter eve!"}
{"text":"Incredible Italian and I'm Italian. Best Eggplant Parm I've ever had. Small, quaint, authentic. Great arianchini balls!!! I would eat here every Sunday if I lived here."}
{"text":"Unbelievable pizza! Great, cozy atmosphere and food was delicious. Definitely recommend this place if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Enjoyed a great meal in this fantastic family restaurant.  The pasta was perfect!  The service came with a smile.  Rosina is a joy!  The tiramisu was a great way to finish the evening.  The place is small, but that's part of what makes it special."}
{"text":"I really like the food here. I enjoyed the kitchy rustic traditional Italian decor and the intimate setting. We had cesar salad, meatballs and margarhita pizza. My only feedback is that the pizza needs more basil but other than that it was delicious. And we really need to talk about the tomato sauce and meatballs. Let's really talk about it. It it so simple yet sophisticated and the meatball was moist and flavourful. I took one bite and told my partner to try this, the sauce will blow your mind. It did. The service is attentive. I really enjoyed my time. I will be heading back."}
{"text":"I crush on all candlelit yet casual Italian joints. I just do. Tavernitis (which reads like an infection in English, let's be honest) fits the mold.   This place is so quaint it hurts, and is located on the main strip in Little Italy on College. It's a good place for a reasonably priced date, and their pizzas are the star of the show. The four cheese was simple and perfect. Thin crust, but not so thin that it got soggy when I was eating my buds' leftovers.   I however, went with the veal parm and was greatly disappointed. The pasta on the side was 'plain tomato', but tasted like it could have come from a jar. Bummer. I started with the lentil soup, which I really enjoyed, though. So, you win some, you lose some.   I choose not to comment on the service. A cornucopia of minor disasters and mix ups, but they were very busy and both servers seemed sweet. But like, they never brought my friend a fork... fork that. Oops, I guess I commented.   PEPPER POINTS: For the red and white checked table cloths. So cute.   15/30"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! Great service and Italian food, cozy and intimate. The prices are fair. Would definitely recommend."}
