{"text":"Good fresh food. Service is always friendly and efficient.   Great value for your dollar. I love this place."}
{"text":"Ordered wings, mussels and pizza.   Wings were mediocre, baked, nothing to write home about. Mussels were over cooked, not fresh and seasoning does not work.  However pizza made up to it. Thin crust, burnt edges, sauce was great and topping was good.   Maybe just come in for pizza and skip apps."}
{"text":"We'd like an order of wings. How'd you like them done? What do you mean? How do you want them cooked? Ooh! Well done I guess.. And half an hour later we had one of best chicken wings I've ever had. Why? Because they cooked them in the same huge stone oven they use for pizzas!! Brilliant cozy restaurant. Lovely pizzas, great draughts."}
{"text":"Amazing food!!!! We are new to the area and needed to eat as we unpacked and got our house ready. Within one week we chose to eat here 3x. Still, there are items I can't wait to try! Excellent..: highly recommend"}
{"text":"Have been only once.  I had thought the only options were pizza so had never visited before. On the advice of a friend I decided to try it.  I was very impressed. I had a salmon dish rather than pizza and it was cooked perfectly and the entire dish had such a wonderful flavour. Was not dry/bland like many places. Hope to go again sometime soon.  Oh and our server was so very friendly!"}
{"text":"I know, who comes to a pizzeria and doesn't order pizza, right? Well I've been to Play a couple of years back and had their pizza, and although it was great, I'm not usually one to pass up a deal like $5 pasta night ($5 for pasta and sauce, and $2 for each topping). So penne with tomato sauce, grilled veggies, and Italian sausage it was. And it was really good! For the price, I was expecting a smaller portion, but I was pleasantly surprised to find myself tucking into a hearty meal. With lots of grilled veggies, and some really tasty, and nicely spicy sausage.  I was also impressed with the service. There were 3 of us meeting here, and we all came at different times, but the staff was attentive enough to get us whatever we needed, but also content to let any of us sit and wait and take up space until we had all arrived.  And then they didn't rush us out, even though we were there for 2 1/2 hours.  All in all a great experience, and I will definitely be back"}
{"text":"This is not the first time I've visited Play and even though I'm not keen on American football or baseball I adore this place! They serve great beer, the bake decent pizza and when it comes to service - it is amazing! You can talk to anyone at the counter and discuss anything starting with nasty weather and ending up with Hillary vs. Trump failure elections in the U.S.   I recommend this place with all my hands up!"}
{"text":"Food was average,  service was pretty rough.  Our server was very rude and didn't seem to care at all. Our family is usually very forgiving but even we felt like we \"bothered\" the establishment.  Stay away.  I'd never visit again"}
{"text":"Food and service was fast and friendly pizza was a thin crust and lots of toppings. It's definitely not football pizza but a solid fancy pizza pie"}
{"text":"My friend recommend this restaurant so I decided to check it out. I ordered one of the burgers and was pretty unhappy with it. I found it difficult to eat because the bread was thin and fell apart. I actually had to eat it with a knife and fork. My friend ordered a pizza and that was pretty good. The drcornis nice and the washrooms are clean. We also ordered the callamarri and I found it to be pretty gross. It came with olives and tasted bland. I probably wouldn't visit here again."}
{"text":"We finally tried this pizza place before we went to see a movie one Sunday afternoon. The ambiance, service and food were excellent. I had my usual pizza: pepperoni, mushroom, onion (I may have taken a choice from their menu and added onion to it). It was excellent - the perfect amount of cheese, the crust was perfectly crisp and the sauce was especially tasty. Kudos to the chefs and the bartender (my double shot of rum with Coke was also especially good!) I'm planning to return to this restaurant with a group of friends very soon."}
{"text":"Good food, service is great. And prices aren't too bad. For the quality of food you get it's worth it being on the pricey side for pub/pizza food. The chicken and mushroom penne was fantastic. The panzos are loaded. Tried the mussels, and 3 of us finished them in no time. Very yummy! Their apps seem to be pretty big, good for sharing.  The only downside is their pop tastes off. Had to change my drink twice, and it still didn't taste right.  I'd go back to check out their summer menu!"}
{"text":"This was my first visit to this place. It is pretty non-descript from the outside, and it's located in the quieter section of a large strip mall complex. It calls itself a pub, but I think that's misleading. The pizzas (from the stone oven) is higher quality than any other pub I've been to. The layout is full on \"restaurant\" and the staff is also higher end compared to anything I've encountered in a pub. The only thing pub like is that they have tvs showing sporting events and the music is louder than your standard restaurant.  This place is a hidden gem... a comfortable restaurant for the family, or a nice dinner with friends. I'm glad I stopped in."}
{"text":"This is a great low key restaurant and everything comes out of their wood fired oven, nothing is fried.  As I'm trying to watch the waistline lately I was able to order pasta with a quinoa noodle.  The way they cooked the quinoa noodle was outstanding and the pasta had mushroom, onions, garlic and chicken.  I wasn't crazy about the chicken pieces as they were dry but he sauce and veggies were delicious.  We started with the edamame which is a must order. Also tried the grilled octopus that had olives and sundried tomatoes.  The flavours were there but a tad chewy.  It's always difficult anywhere though to get a perfectly cooked grilled octopus.  Their pizzas look outstanding so next time will try that."}
{"text":"This has now become my Go To place in Aurora for a nice beer.  I love the Beau's beer.  I brought my parents here to try the pizza and they said it was some of the best pizza they have had in their life.  (and they ain't young... so that's saying a lot... har har har).   I love this place.  They always have great pizza, and cool new thigs to try."}
