{"text":"A diamond in the rough. Great place. People and are very inviting. Food is home cooked and fresh. Job well done. Keep it up."}
{"text":"Well based on the reviews I read here decided to try it, but these people obviously don't know truly good Italian food. Gnocchi are the size of golf balls and that's not how they are suppose to be!! Sauce was okay. Atmoshere is awful. I want to dine out in an inviting atmosphere. That's part of the fun of going out!  The garage setting turned my stomach. Thank god we had great wine....byob!!  Will not be back, sorry!"}
{"text":"Some of the best Italian food I have eaten. Claudio is the perfect host. I think the d√©cor just adds to the experience. Every item I have eaten there had been outstanding. I just love this place."}
{"text":"Absolutely awesome! Just picked up a couple paninis, gnocchi and beans/greens for lunch and everything was great.  Drove by this place hundreds of times...wish I would have stopped sooner."}
{"text":"The food is awesome, all of it, pizza to entries.  The service is outstanding.  We asked for chocolate milk and they sent someone out to buy it since its not normally on menu.  You'll be treated like royalty."}
{"text":"Great food at Claudio's - enjoyed the gnocci and foccacia pizza!"}
{"text":"I used to LOVE Claudio's. One of my favorite places for pizza and great pasta. The past few times, however, have not been great. I am currently eating gnocchi that is too big and gummy. I've had it there before, and it was perfect. The sauce is only okay, when it used to be amazing. They didn't give me bread like they normally do. They used to take credit cards and now it's cash only. So I had to run to an ATM to pay almost $20 for one order of bad gnocchi. I'm very disappointed. This will probably be the last time I order from there, and it makes me really sad."}
{"text":"This is hands-down the best authentic Italian food I've had in the Pittsburgh area. Claudio really knows how to create an at-home feel in his restaurant. I ordered the gnocchi and chicken pastina soup, both were incredible, and served with fresh baked bread, with olive oil and cheese. I recently moved to California from Pittsburgh and Claudio's is always a beautiful carb-filled treat for me when I visit."}
{"text":"Gnocchi was some of the best I have had as has a light consistency yet is very filling.  One order fed two adults with leftovers!  Bread was baked fresh and the tomatoes  for the caprese salad surprisingly good considering it is February.  Great for pickup as not much in the decor department."}
{"text":"Ordered a large pizza to go last night and it was my first time trying this place. SO GLAD I DID!! First, the pizza was absolutely delicious!  A perfect napilatano style pie, with thin crust that is crispy on the bottom and chewy on the inside, a great sauce that wasn't sweet like most places , and and excellent cheese.  Second, the owner couldn't have been a better guy. I don't want to go into specifics but this guy made me feel like I had been a customer for 20 years, or even a family member. I can't wait to try some of the other menu items as they are all traditional Italian dishes that I love. I will certainly be a return customer."}
{"text":"After hearing several friends rave about Claudio's, I finally tried it yesterday.  To say I was not disappointed is an understatement!  From the Chicken Pastina soup, to the garlic bread, to the gnocchi - all were some of the best I've ever had (don't tell my grandma!).  The gnocchi in particular were perfection, light and fluffy, not at all gummy or chewy.  Loved every bite!"}
{"text":"Amazing pizza... crisp fresh crust and southern Italian sauce that does not have too much oregano - a huge problem I MO with Mineos and other Mt Lebanon pizza places.  Fresh, good, yum!"}
{"text":"I had dinner with my wife and kids here, It was very good. We were a little taken back when we first walked in as it used to be some sort of garage and the decor is definitely not the selling point of this place. That said, we loved everything else about the place. Great service! The gnocchi was the best I've had and the fact its BYOB makes this a hit for the wife and I. They made to order our kids meals when we asked if they had a kids menu, they loved their food and ask to go back, which will be soon and often!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for original, authentic Italian Food, then this is the place for you! When you drive past you will not give this place a second thought, but trust me, it's sooo worth the stop!! I was skeptical at first, but after we ordered, I was sooo glad we did... the pizza boxes where stuffed full, and were super heavy with delicious dough, homemade sauce, and loaded with pepperoni!! The crust was even super crusty and oily, and was also delightful!! I also ordered some gnocchi, and was equally impressed as well! They were super heavy and doughy, and tossed in homemade sauce!! Served with a side of homemade baked fresh bread with olive oil, and either soup or salad!! If you are in the Mt Lebanon or Near South Hills Village, call and order! You won't be disappointed!! Trust me! Don't let the outside sway you!!!:)"}
{"text":"Best food in south hills.  Claudio is straight off the boat from Italy.  His food shows it. I love this man and his food."}
{"text":"A charismatic man who obviously loved his work made me one of the best pizzas I've had in the area! Go in and support a small business, you won't be disappointed"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza shop in the Pittsburgh region, and you gotta try the other dishes as well, such as beans & greens, soups, pastas, breads, all excellent.  I love Claudio, he is a character, and I have known him since I was a child at his former shop in Greentree  He was also head Chef at Abruzzis too, so he knows his way around the kitchen . . . Mangia, Mangia!!!!!"}
{"text":"Omg....soooo good. My husband belongs to an Italian men's supper club, go figure....he's Serbian...any way...he came home after one of their jaunts and started singing the praises of Claudio's. He said you'd love the food, but I'm warning you it's in a GARAGE! Now, I may be from Ambridge but I do put some stock In ambiance. We finally had enough wine one night to get me there. Holy cow, shut the front door...the pasta with calamari...the homade bread, the salads, the deserts....all to die for. You know what, the place looks like I would imagine a joint in Italy would look. It was so good I dragged him back the following week to try the Pizza...wonderful! It is byob..another perk. Ahhhh Claudio ...I'm in love."}
{"text":"Loved it! Been here twice. Took my 3.5 year old daughter both times. This is an unpretentious hidden gem in Pittsburgh that actually has homemade pasta at reasonable prices. Met the owner - very friendly guy who loves his Italian music (streaming from the counter). When you walk in, each table has seasoned oil and a bowl of freshly grated Romano for the bread (that they make themselves). Homemade gnocchi is amazing! Also got some pizza and chicken parm to go.  My server noticed I had my hands full and walked me out to my car...carrying the to go food and leftovers since I had my daughter to hold and put in the car. Great customer service! This is my go to spot for Daddy daughter dates!"}
{"text":"Really great tasting deep dish pizza. Anything that has to do with dough is awesome here since it's all home made. I recommend buying a loaf of bread to go. Definitely worth checking out even if parking is challenging!"}
{"text":"What a awesome meal! The chicken pastina was served hot and serving size was big, enough for 2 meals. The lasagne was a large portion and perfect temperature!! The atmosphere was not your every day restaurant, when we walked in there was fresh baked bread cooling on the tables! It was delicious!"}
{"text":"Have ordered take out pizza a few times recently.  One of the better pizza's in the area!  Have always enjoyed the food and the pizza is very good as well."}
{"text":"Well I hate to give a place one Star...I like the pizza,but twice when we picked it up the guy cooking it had a cigarette hanging out of his mouth,and was talking as the ashes fell down on the pizza!!!!\" The place is dirty. Sorry"}
