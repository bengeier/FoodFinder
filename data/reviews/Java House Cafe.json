{"text":"Was so baffled by my experience that I had to just leave, instead of pointing out that the latte with an extra shot of espresso that I had ordered was literally just a cup of steamed milk... strangest coffee house experience I have ever had. Definitely will not be returning."}
{"text":"Java House Cafe is a true Gastonia gem! There are two locations, this one on Main Avenue and a new one on Union Road.

Java House Cafe has the authentic vibe of a big city coffee shop, with the buckets of charm of a local establishment. The owners, brother and sister duo Adina and Josh, have a real knack for creating spaces that manage to be super cool and comfy at the same time.

Java House Cafe is conveniently located by the Rotary Pavilion, so customers can enjoy their purchase on the benches in the lovely park. Besides just java, Java House Cafe offers an extensive menu and FREE delivery within 10 miles of either location.

The breakfast menu features several amazing options, including the highly recommended bagel sandwiches. This is not your regular run-of-the mill coffee shop food menu. Everything is scratch-made with extremely high quality ingredients.

For the rest of the day Java House offers \"From The Grill\" items including burgers and chicken. They also have wraps and salads. They also have incredible Hershey's ice cream!

Java House Cafe is an amazing coffee shop and restaurant--I highly recommend it if you find yourself in Gastonia!"}
{"text":"As a new yorker this place reminded me of home. Great coffee and friendly baristas. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Second time visiting this business today. I was greeted warmly and friendly by Adina when I first walked in. Gotta love that about a business when they genuinely appear to be happy that you walked into their establishment. After being here today, I told myself I need to frequent more often. They've upgraded their menu and now they deliver for free. Definitely going to be taking advantage of that. Always looking for great places to eat in Gaston County. I ordered the white chocolate mocha coffee. Delicious. One recommendation I'd make to the owner is to upgrade to better coffee cups. My cup seemed flimsy and it was too hot to carry. I didn't see any cup sleeves - it's possible I missed them."}
{"text":"As I am sitting here eating my yummy lunch.. crunchy tater tots and a buffalo chicken wrap, I am very happy my nephews seen the icecream sign and wanted to stop. Adina is very sweet and welcoming. Her kind nephew and my nephews are outside playing. Very clean inside and the bathrooms are clean as well. So many great and classic lunch options and there's also Art for sale. I will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"Great little spot in downtown Gastonia. Told Miss Adeena that I needed a strong cup of coffee, and she did not disappoint!"}
{"text":"The manager here was extremely rude to me and I will not be back unless it's to pour hot coffee on her head :)"}
{"text":"This is my go to spot in Gastonia!  Friendly staff plus good quick food choices.  Try the Death Wish Coffee - very smooth.  Tasty ice cream as well."}
{"text":"Good looks amazing.  You can call or text your order (704-670-5592).  They close at 6 so You can stop by after work and pick up food to take home. I'm going to eat my way through their menu!  Stay tuned"}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here able the service was very friendly both times. I ordered the White Chocolate Cookie Dream frappe and really enjoyed it. The sitting/lounge area is small but comfy. I just wish they didn't close so early because that's the only thing that's stopped me from visiting more often. They close at 6pm and aren't open at all on Sundays. Hopefully that will change soon."}
{"text":"The vibe is so uplifting in this downtown spot, they should bottle it as a mood enhancer. I'm not a coffee drinker, but there are a lot of beverage choices. Small, but creative breakfast and lunch menu. Good keto-friendly choices, including chicken tenders that are also slap-your-pappy delectable."}
{"text":"This is a great little spot. I try to get by as much as I can but with my schedule it can be hard to do. But I make it a point to get there when I can."}
