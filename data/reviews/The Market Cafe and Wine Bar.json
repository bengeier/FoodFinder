{"text":"If you've never been here for lunch it's definitely worth checking out.  The atmosphere is pretty nice with different food stations (paninis, soups, salads, pizza, seafood, burgers) and there's a decent yuppy crowd.

They go for the recycled park picnic table style seating indoors which is nice if you're into that sort of thing.  In fact, you might daresay this is a trendy place...

Never made it for breakfast.  It also seems like an ideal spot for a good happy hour, as it is a wine bar, but I've unfortunately never seen it hopping after business hours."}
{"text":"The Market Cafe is a very average lunch spot in the Huntington Bank Building. The nice thing about it is it's easily accessible from the inside of the building. The decor is very trendy and has a warehouse feel to it. The food is served at several different stations, which makes things kind of confusing. There's one for burgers and other entrees, one for pizza and pasta, one for sandwiches and salads, and one for pastries. The food selection is nothing special; there's nothing that seems special or anything. I ended up having a turkey panini with a side of potato salad and a berry parfait. The sandwich was pretty good. There was bacon, cheese, and lettuce on it and it was on whole grain bread. The potato salad was just okay. There was way too much mayo on it (I'm not a big mayo fan, so for those who love mayo, this is a good side for you). The onions helped. The parfait was good, although there wasn't enough granola on it in my opinion. Overall, while The Market Cafe isn't horrible, there are better lunch options Downtown."}
{"text":"I work downtown and end up eating here about once a week.  There is a very good selection of food and everything I've ordered has been awesome.  They have a free water-fountain so you can skip buying a drink a get as much water as you want.  My favorites are the Market Cafe Burger, Pizza and daily pasta side dish specials.  Nice vegetarian and vegan choices for area available daily!  I like to get there early to avoid the lines..."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and lunch! Speedy service! Fresh food cooked to order"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch one day at work. The sandwich was fresh and delicious. They had a kale, quinoa, and sweet potato salad that was so good. I'm dying to get the recipe. Healthy food, quality ingredients, innovative dishes. I felt like I was doing something good for myself eating clean and nutritious food. Great spot!"}
{"text":"I have been 5x already and it's pretty delicious/unique.  They are partnered with Bon Appetit catering services and they follow a local ingredient philosophy, which is refreshing. I always get the entree special or the fajita salad from the kitchen at the very back of the restaurant.

Some of their special entrees are better than others and they change weekly, if not daily.  It's nice to get a little variety in their offerings, although I do miss some of their dishes.  I have been disappointed with their Fig Stuffed Chicken breasts with mashed potatoes.  The chicken was dry and lacked any real flavor other than the sweet figs.  The mashed potatoes were so-so, the potatoes was slightly dry and didn't have any seasoning.  

The Crab Cakes were a bit more delicious and flavorful than the stuffed chicken breast.  

Their Parmesan Crusted Chicken with Cauliflower Puree was AMAZINGLY GOOD.  It didn't need the typical tomato sauce on top, it was ridiculously delicious on its own.  It was served with a side of pesto to go with it, which I poured all over my cauliflower pure.  It was remarkable.  

If I don't end up getting their daily entree, I usually go after their shrimp fajita salad.  The shrimp skewer is nicely seasoned.  Good, but not the best.  The fajita salad is a large portion with a nice amount of fajita topping to go with the shrimp.  I think the only thing I don't like about the salad is that they don't de-skewer the shrimp and I have to de-skewer it myself.  

I really want more of that Parmesan Crusted Chicken! 

The only real downside is that sometimes the portions for the daily special entree can be a bit small for the 10-12.00 price tag.  However, it is definitely worth a check out, especially the daily entree.  

They post their daily menu on their website FYI, in case you want know what the menu is before you trek out there."}
{"text":"This place is starting to cut corners and for the price of food thats rediculous!
I have seen the cooks actually arguing with eachother while cooking my food on 
more than one occasion.  
I went there today to grab my lunch. I was at the salad bar and the \"mixed greens\" is suppose to be leafy GREENS no romain, they have very little to no GREENS and mostly romain in their \"mixed green\" option.  I mentioned that to the guy behind the counter and was very rude and said thats why its called mixed. That is not what a Mixed green salad is at all. I queston if the people working know anything about food.
The staff could be more friendly, less socialble with one another and more efficient."}
{"text":"Excellent lunch spot. Wide variety of really good dishes at reasonable prices. If you can't find something you like here, it's on you. Ingredients are very fresh and many of them are local (if you're into that.) If there's even a slight issue, it's that the crowds result in long lines at peak times. High-class problem."}
{"text":"Great place to grab a quick bite for lunch! It sometimes gets busy during the week, but the lines seem to move fast. 

You'll notice lots of shared seating at long tables. If you're not ok with overhearing the people next to you, or you want to enjoy a more private setting for conversation, maybe go somewhere else. 

I typically grab a small salad, which is plenty of food for lunch, and is only around $8. The make your own salad bar has great options like roasted sweet potatoes, salmon, edamame, and local meats and cheese. If you're not a salad person, they have plenty of sandwiches, pizza and hot foods too! You can appease even the pickiest of eaters at this place.

The service is also pretty good. Cashiers and the people preparing the foods are typically pretty friendly."}
{"text":"I've never been let down by The Market Cafe - i usually go when I'm in a soup/salad/sandwich mood because they always have delicious soups and really fresh ingredients in their salads and sandwiches.  One day I tried the tacos they had - the pork tacos were AMAZING!  Local ingredients, pretty quick service, good food, cheap prices.  

Definitely a place worth going to check out!"}
{"text":"Fresh farm to table market ... Everything made the same day from fresh food .. Tasty and the people from Samantha to Bryan treat you great .. My favorite breakfast and lunch in downtown"}
{"text":"Really nasty Asian lady with an attitude behind the counter. Food mediocre at best.  Really disorganized. Go the extra block to Heinens."}
{"text":"I've been here on a number of occasions, previously.  This is not my go-to place, but it will do.  I usually head toward the salad station.  Nice selection of fresh ingredients with your choice of greens.   Employee prepares your salad (6 items+greens), based on your selection.  Large salad (no meat), was $8.00+ with tax.  Adding protein boosts the price to $10.   The salad was satisfactory, but probably not worth the price paid.   The place has a nice layout and a decent selection of food options, just not a big fan of standing in line for food at these prices.   This is a nice place to venture to, occasionally."}
{"text":"A great place to grab a quick bite. Food tasted good. Have no complaints about the service or the place."}
{"text":"GREAT food that is surprisingly inexpensive! $6.50 for a 12\" pizza that fed me all day long and even made it to dinner!!!
The sandwiches look sumptuous!!! 
The salad looks fresh and inviting!
And beer!!!!!!  Wish I wasn't working cause I'd grab a beer and head outside to the patio and enjoy the BEAUTIFUL weather in our fair city of Cleveland!!
If you find yourself downtown go try The Market Cafe and Wine Bar!!!!!"}
{"text":"I am ecstatic to see that a place in downtown CLE gets packed for lunch! With all the problems we have retaining people in this city - heck yes - Market fill up and make some dollars! 

The Market Cafe reminds me of the hustle and bustle of a market in NYC. It's crowded - BUT bonus - it's crowded with friendly mid-western folks. Even the bankers and lawyers crack a smile in this place. The food is consistently good! 

It's a great place to go with a group, because there are many option including salads, soups, sandwiches, pastas, pizza, entree options - etc! As a first timer, you may feel the pressure of deciding on what you want (since it is so crowded), so follow the lines, ask around, and people will help you out. 

I've landed on the salad. It's all fresh produce, and a good deal for what you get! The large is HUGE, so I always get a to-go box on the side to bring back some extra to snack on later. 

Try the Pecan Bar ... Heaven!"}
{"text":"Overall, meh.

Stopped in for breakfast and wound up waiting in line for close to 10 minutes, even though there was only one person in line in front of us. The cook seemed to continually forget to make people's orders, so a couple people in our party wound up having to reorder two or three times before getting their meal.

The food was decent - pretty much on par for diner breakfast. I had the breakfast wrap, which was tasty but disturbingly greasy - probably more so than a McDonald's breakfast. The coffee was decent.

It seems like this place would be better for lunch or dinner. Most of the staff seemed focused on setting up for the lunch rush, so maybe the quality just goes downhill in the mid-morning."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE their salad bar! I started going to this restaurant when I worked on East 9th street and even though I have moved locations downtown I will still drive or walk over. Their salad bar is build your own with a huge assortment of toppings. They limit you to 8 scoops of toppings, but this is plenty. My favorite items are the roasted sweet potato and roasted cauliflower. Never had these on a salad before I come here. 

The restaurant also has various stations with made to order food (sandwiches, pizzas, etc). And all of the ingredients are farm fresh. They just need another location downtown!"}
{"text":"Since it's attached to where I work, I eat here every day for lunch, and there's enough variety so it never gets old! Great quality food, good portions, and super friendly staff."}
{"text":"I always come here for lunch when I'm in town. I love that they use local meat and produce and the people who work there are so friendly. They make great panini's and a nice hummus platter, but my favorite thing to get is the large salad. You get six topping included in the price, which is a great deal. The toppings vary day to day but sometimes include edamame, broccoli, banana peppers, red peppers, sweet potatoes, carrots, and so much more. I'm surprised it's not busier during peak lunch hours!"}
{"text":"Not even a wine bar. First of all they close at 2:30 every day except on Thursdays. We went in with a big group on Thursday and the wines that they had were very very limited. Several things on the menu were not available. I would say don't get your hopes up."}
{"text":"I miss working next to this place. I enjoy their iced coffee, salads w tons of topping options and rotating pizza selection.They also make a mean tuna fish sandwich. To this day I ALWAYS put diced jalapenos in my tuna salad if I make it at home because of The Market.  Only complaint is this place definitely has the hustle and bustle of a real market so the lines can be long and the dining atmosphere loud if you eat in. As for the prices, they are at the top limit of what I am willing to pay for lunch BUT as long as they don't go up and they continue to use local ingredients, I am OK with the price point."}
{"text":"I really want to love this place, because it's not like anything else we have for lunch downtown, but it's very inconsistent. I usually pick up a pre-made salad (they're doing one with fruit and a lemony vinaigrette that's quite good) or sandwich from the to-go cooler, but one day I come in and it's virtually empty (at 11:45) and the next it's full at the same time. I'm confused. I do like their hot entrees, but prepare to fork over $10 or so. Veggie quesadillas are pretty great, too. They have a lot of creative salads. I give this place two thumbs up for the food, but the logistics are a bit hard to figure out at first (lots of different lines), and the prices are a little high. You do have to pay for quality, though. It's not McLunch."}
{"text":"Market Cafe is one of my standbys for weekday lunch -- it's fairly quick, priced decently, and the salads are really, really good. It's a reverse salad bar concept -- the person behind the counter tosses your choice of lettuce, several toppings depending on the size you're ordering, and dressing (interesting ones, like ginger viniagrette). And you go on your merry way. Try the salad, it will not disappoint!

Sandwiches and grill items are also good, although I stick mostly to the salad.

This place usually gets packed at lunchtime although seats do turn over pretty quickly. The booths are prime real estate so if you can claim one, do it!

Salad!"}
{"text":"My all time favorite lunch spot when I worked on E 9th. Great sized portions, and everything is organic, local, and fresh! The food is just absolutely amazing. Great salad bar, pizza station, Mexican station, and sandwich station! They cater to every taste. In the evenings, they do wine tastings and craft beers. Great place to take a client."}
{"text":"I don't get the bad reviews. Lots of affordable options, locally-derived ingredients, great staff, and nice atmosphere. I recommend the pizza bar - less than 7 bucks for a pizza that can last two meals. And the yogurt parfaits, when they have them, are must haves IMO. I like that they get their meat from farms in the area instead of you know...Tyson."}
{"text":"I thought it was a pretty decent place to get lunch downtown. I like the atmosphere and variety, although it can be a little confusing for first-timers. It's really got that \"market\" feel. The reason I gave it a mediocre score was because the food wasn't really up to par with the price. Overall, I think that everyone should at least try it. Although I won't, most likely, be back myself."}
{"text":"If you value your intestinal health you will have lunch elsewhere. I have seen the cashier wipe her nose in her hand and without excusing herself to wash her hands, continue to serve food without the use if a glove and then handle money. No wonder last week I became I'll after having a salad for lunch. My coworker ordered the hummus with pita bread and also became ill. 

The meat entrees are very overpriced, nine dollars for a small 3 oz chicken breast and a few twigs of asparagus? No thanks.

Their only saving grace is the coffee at breakfast, that they can't screw up."}
{"text":"Farm to table fare, relaxed environment where you order and pay for your food at the counter and then find a table. Grated steel and warm woods make a cozy trendy environment. The food itself is fantastic!!! I had the blended burger (1/2 local beef, 1/2 mushrooms), kale and sweet potato salad, couscous, and a (nonalcoholic) drink for $10. Really fresh and exploding with savory flavor! Great place for lunch!!!"}
{"text":"I go to lunch here a lot. The salads are great. You get to pick 6 toppings on a small for $5.50. There are a wide variety to choose from. Chicken is $1.00 extra. The dressings are house made and very good. One of the downers is all of the people that eat there. There are a lot of lawyer types and bankers. I held the door open for some guy the other week and he walked out without saying thanks. I was pissed. It still gets me mad. There are a lot of people like that. Punks. The salads keep me coming back."}
{"text":"There are options for everyone, I often head to the salad station where you can pick a small or a large salad with your choice of protein.  Six toppings and you're out the door in less then 5 minutes.  I think it's a great place to stop by and get something for lunch on the go."}
