{"text":"It does not get any better than this! 
A great local bar and grill with a super staff, reasonable prices and great food.
This is the kind of place that you call home and a place where you go to meet friends and family.
Highly recommend the Friday Fish and, by all means, the MONK BURGER!
Nice selection of beers and the local personalities are a hoot!"}
{"text":"The best fish fry and priced right!  Not many seating area so take out is another option! They have the best coleslaw I have ever had, it should be patented!"}
{"text":"Loved this place. Great stopping spot when traveling through town.

Sadly, they are now closed."}
{"text":"Nothing like wandering around your small town to find this small hole in the wall bar thats as cozy as it can get! I started off with their special cole slaw, that is as refreshing as it is addicting. Then I tried the Reuben with Fries and I was in love. Then I finished it off with Pumpkin Pie. I'll definitely be back, and most likely a Sunday regular when its not very crowded. If you're in the area, you owe it to yourself to give it a shot."}
{"text":"Since leaping off the vegetarian wagon a year ago, I've made up for a lot of lost time (10 years!). I've started my quest for the perfect reuben and ate every steak that gave me a sidelong glance. But the Midwest institution of Friday Nite Fish Fry  had yet to capture my gastronomic imagination.

No longer! The Monk's Retreat in Cross Plains has it! Wow, who would think that battered and deep fried cod could be so delicious?! I'm beginning to think that Madison cuisine doesn't really have that much to brag about! (Save so many SE Asian joints that they all begin to seem the same) Do yourself a favor when you're in Madison. Make the 20min drive to Cross Plains and you'll be rewarded with crispy batter, juicy and firm cod coupled with the best coleslaw I've had this side of the Mason-Dixon.

Be prepared for a wait though. It gets busy and the quarters can be a little cramped. But if you're looking for a great fish fry, this would definitely be my recommendation!"}
