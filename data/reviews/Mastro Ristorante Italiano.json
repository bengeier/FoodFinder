{"text":"Order the Veal Parmigiana with spaghetti and meat sauce, instead of potatoes on the side. The pasta is cooked perfectly and it isn't overwhelmed or overshadowed by the sauce.   There is very little parking in front and service is not fast during busy times. Be prepared for those two things. Service is especially slow during times where there are many private parties in the restaurant.   Price for a veal dinner is about $23 before tax.   I could only eat here everyday for the rest of my life and I'd be happy."}
{"text":"Noticed a 15% of coupon while I was nearby on a business trip so I stopped by for a Sunday lunch.  WOW am I glad I went.  Mastro's is a small family operated Italian Restaurant that has been around for decades (from what I was told).  The inside is not fancy but very cozy.  I discovered that the lunch menu is only on weekdays so ordered the chicken piccata entr√©e ..best piccata I have had in years with fresh bread, steamed veggies and grilled potatoes!  The wait staff was very friendly and quick.  I am surprised that I am the first to review Mastro's, but I know I will not be the last.  A hidden gem within walking distance to Bombardier and Flight Safety."}
{"text":"I've come here a few times and the food is ok. Service is lovely and everyone is nice. However this last time I went with family I was totally turned off. We ordered a bunch of appetizers and food for the table (meats,cheese, pizza, potato, and roasted vegetables) there was a lot of food and it was just ok. There was a lot of left overs and when they were taking it away we asked if they were going to throw it out (we would have loved to take it home) and the server said that they reuse the food. First of all, that is DISGUSTING. There is no way we would have ordered that if we knew that we could be eating someone's leftovers. Secondly, if they are serving leftovers, we definitely should not have been paying $100 for some veggies and meat slices. I was so grossed out. It was an awful experience."}
{"text":"Came for the lunch buffet with a client, based on reviews. The owners have been here 52 years, and they will say hi and hold the floor for you, like family. They check in on you like family. Service was lovely.  The buffet is not. The mussels were dry and inedible, the pasta that wasn't in sauce was cold and flavourless. Kind of boring choices for warm foods. Dessert was excellent.  Can't say I'd return, food just isn't good enough"}
{"text":"Great restaurant with fun atmosphere amazing service and very authentic Italian home cooking! On special days music is often provided. Been going here since a child"}
{"text":"Above average experience! Food was pretty good, service was awesome and overall a good experience. But the only problem is that they do not have accessibility bathrooms. They only offer a port-a-potty. So if you are disabled from the waist down, you will not be able to use their bathrooms which are about a flight or two downstairs  ALSO-parking is limited."}
{"text":"I got some gift certificate for Mastro.  So I took my family there for one of the birthday.  We went there on a Saturday night.  There was less than 10 parking spaces in front of the restaurant.  I was supprise to find only 3 other table there since the parking lot was full (plus it's a Staurday night).  I guess everybody who works there has a car :p  The decoration is great.  The food taste good.  Meal for 5 of us coame at about $150 + tips.  And we didn't order any drink or wine.   They definitely needs more parking"}
{"text":"Great food, but more importantly amazing service.  You're treated like family from the second you walk in.  The only reason for no 5 star is the outdated decor.  But, even though it is a bit old it ads character and feels homely."}
{"text":"Mastro's is an excellent choice for dining out or for celebrating a special event. The food is outstatnding and the waitress's are nice. Parking is limited but many spots can be found at nearby apartment buildings and lots. Also, their $20 buffet is a steal. Theu serve tons of food that is tasty and well prepared. Its an offer you cant beat. Overall 5/5."}
{"text":"I wish I could rate 0....we were there this past Saturday for an event. They over booked the rooms, and unfortunately waiting over 90 minutes to get the room which was still very dirty.  Waiters and waitress made the horrible experience better....but the meal was horrible.  Also, the manager forgot to include the vegetarian meal, so 3 people had to watch everyone eat meat while they got a plate of green veggies.  Their meal came out with dessert.  HORRIBLE EXPERIENCE OVERALL...DO NOT GO THERE!!!!"}
