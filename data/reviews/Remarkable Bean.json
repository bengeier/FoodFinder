{"text":"Excellent coffee, fresh roasted!  Delicious treats like the gluten free brownies and butter tarts.  Very nice ambience...

I recommend they use the air conditioner and keep the flies at bay.  Otherwise, a very mellow choice for a respite during the day."}
{"text":"I was excited to try this place out as I had heard great things about the branch in the Beaches - although I had never been.

I'm not usually a fan of baked goods in general,but having heard about their tasty homemade treats, I couldn't resist a cinnamon bun. it was absolutely delicious! Very fresh even though I visited late on a Sunday and reasonably priced at 2.25. The other baked goods, and the breakfast sandwiches, looked lovely also. 

My Americano was superb and I enjoyed reading their menu descriptions of the various types of coffee beans they have on offer.

The barista was a darling, very friendly and helpful. There was a really nice community feeling to the cafe even though it's only new.

Would recommend!"}
{"text":"If you are craving hot & strong cafe to wake up your motivation, this place will get you half way there. Consistent internet but the cafe was warm and not very strong. There is room to breathe at this location without losing a \"comfy cafe shop\" feeling."}
{"text":"Cozy and cute! Free WiFi. Such an amazing staff - super friendly and helpful. Perfect place to catch up on your reading on a boring Sunday afternoon. They're open till 10pm, which is more than great!"}
{"text":"Ordered the rocket fuel latte, which ended up being the regular brewed rocket fuel (a full bodied dark roast coffee) with steamed milk. Didn't have the punch that I was expecting from the name and, combined with the milk, ended up being a pretty weak drink overall. On top of that, the roast was bitter. Bleh.

I don't think I would go back for the coffee, but all of the items in the bakery cases looked AMAZING. If I were to return, it would probably be for the cakes and pastries."}
{"text":"Good espresso roasted at the other (Beach) location, and baked goods.

Not as funky as the other location & cleaner look to it, pleasant Leslieville vibe. Has less of a 'locals' feel."}
{"text":"Compare and contrast: Remarkable Bean in Beaches and Leslieville
Like most people in the Beaches, I've enjoyed many a coffee and loungey afternoon at the Beaches Remarkable Bean. 
I'm glad that Leslieville will have its own version of a family business that shows its respect for the neighborhood it serves by providing fresh and unique snacks and organic and fair trade coffee and tea.
I'm not going to compare the two locations, partly because the Leslieville edition has only begun to evolve, and partly because I have only spent two hours  there, earlier today on a wet and windy day when a comfy coffee shop just hits the spot.
An array of baked goods are made right at the premises, which makes for a subtle but nice aroma.
The music is mellow, sort of CJRT Sunday night Big Band style jazz, perfect for the crowd that was there, working away on their computers.
The atmosphere is very pleasant and suited to people who come to work, not lounge around in their oldest and most comfortable clothes (my bad; I said I wouldn't compare this to the Beaches shop!!).
The place is very airy, with mirrors to accentuate the openness and brightness. Old yellowed bricks line one wall; wood is very prominent throughout. It's a hip and casual feel.
And the coffee -- just as you'd expect from one of the shop's pioneers of home-roasted organic and fair-trade. You can nurse it as long as you want.
I'm looking forward to see this place evolve into a unique place all its own, part and parcel of its new neighborhood, just as it did in the Beaches. As I argue in my e-book, Food for City Building, every 'hood needs its \"third place,\" planner talk for a place (somewhat akin to the old TV show, Cheers) which comes third in people's day, just after work and family. Coffee shops, the pubs of a generation that likes to talk or work in a sociable space, fulfil that necessary role in any neighborhood."}
{"text":"Nice addition to their Beach location. Same coffee from the beans they roast themselves (fresh enough for ya?) and great pastries, quiches, etc. Bigger, brighter space than the original, with a comfy patio out back. Nice!"}
{"text":"Very cozy coffee shop in the heart of Leslieville. My coffee had a beautifully bold flavour. It paired wonderfully with their deeeelicious lemon loaf. Service was friendly and very chill. Great place to go if you have a lounging day and are not rushed."}
{"text":"Gluten-free review:

I used to love going here for their gluten-free brownies until I became very ill from them. I had been eating their brownies for months without any problems. Then one day I went in to buy a brownie and double checked with the person behind the counter if the brownies were gluten-free. They confirmed it was. I always ask this just to be sure. So I take my brownie home and dig into it. 

This time I noticed it was slightly less dense than normal, but I was in brownie heaven and literally scarfed it down. And then...uh oh...my insides started to die a very painful death. I mean holy shit, I had forgotten how bad my reactions were to eating gluten because I've been pretty good at avoiding it. After the firey, stabbing pain to get that bastard out of my body, I was out for the count for the next two days. 

After I recovered I sent the store a message letting them know that their brownie made me very sick and they should double check to make sure that their gluten-free products are actually gluten-free. They have yet to responded, and it's been over a month. The vibe of this place is great and the people are friendly, but I will no longer go here. I cannot risk my health or support an establishment that doesn't care when they poison their customers. 

TL;DR: The gluten-free brownies are not always gluten-free and will kill your insides. AVOID!"}
{"text":"Love the Bean; it's a new neighbourhood staple in Leslieville. Great drip coffee, friendly service, and TO DIE FOR baked goods / pastries. I read on a few other reviews that the Bean's TO DIE FOR baked goods are due to copious amounts of butter... which is likely accurate. 
Go here for coffee, a treat, and a cozy book / afternoon of work. You won't find many 'healthy' options on the menu :) (but they DO cater to vegan & gluten free!)

Particularly, my husband and I are fans on their big wooden tables -- super great when you have a solid afternoon of work ahead of you (sturdiness counts)."}
{"text":"I've been to the Remarkable Bean in the Beach, so when I found out they were opening one in Leslieville - I was pretty excited... just another coffee shop to add to Leslieville's repitoire... cafes, bakeries, local establishments, just what I love to support.

I know they are known for their baked goods and my initial visit didn't disappoint. I had previously walked by and watched the gentleman at the counter bring out coffee beans to a woman who couldn't go inside because she had her dog with her. That's pretty awesome customer service.

Lucky for me, I ran into the same guy at the counter today who was cheery and fun, being oh so patient with me as I could not decide between the cranberry lemon loaf or the oh so decadent carrot cake... we went back and forth and he was trying to see if I would change my mind but I caved with the carrot cake... at $4.80, I wouldn't say it's cheap or worth it... ok.. maybe a little bit worth it after a good run.

Although I took the cake home with me, the interior is roomy,  but a little bit stuffy. There are about 8 - 10 tables of 2s and 4s that you can set up your laptop, bring a good book and stay all afternoon.

The cake was moist, and really tasty... did not disappoint at all. cake was fluffy, full of flavour and the cream cheese icing was delectable.

This could really be my go to spot for baked goods.... i'm a sucker for them."}
{"text":"Friendly service

And so much seating available (we had a party of 7, and we got a great spot that was super roomy too)

I ordered the brewed coffee and it wasn't bad at all. 

Came for a night cap after dinner at Descendants across the street

I'd definitely comeback if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Great place to work! Baristas are friendly and the desserts are awesome.  Coffee obviously is freshly roasted and so it tastes great.  The americano always has a nice cream.  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"I used to love close by and now I drive 45 minutes each way to pick up coffee beans.  They are that good.  I highly recommend the El Torro.  If you are hungry, the quiche is great.  If you happen to be there early enough to see almond croissants, do yourself a favour and grab one.  You will not regret it."}
{"text":"I was so impressed. The service was top notch; REMARKABLE! The staff were very friendly. Offering so many personal touches that really made my experience pleasant. The nice (Irish?) fellow topped my drink up w/ steamed milk, offered a fork/box for my to-go amazing, creamy, cocoalicious, freshly baked brownie. The matcha was legit - the music was a hit. Blues version playing right now of 'That Thing' is mellow and soothing. I will be back!"}
{"text":"i am no expert in coffee in anyway shape or form. i also ordered a hot chocolate so i think it's unfair for me to review a coffee shop for it's hot chocolate.
the hot chocolate however, was pretty good. my mouth is quite sensitive to heat so usually coffee and hot chocolate will burn my tongue if i drink it as soon as it's served but this was just fine for me. probably not for other people though lol. i also like that it wasn't overly sweet. sometimes you drink hot chocolate and you don't even want to finish it because it's so damn sweet. this one? good.
i also had a sandwich. chicken club i think? that was good too. and the bread wasn't as hard and dry as it looked. nice place to have been to."}
{"text":"Leslieville just keeps getting better and better. This is a fantastic café, the staff is friendly and the warm décor makes you feel like your at home. This little café has some sinfully delicious treats for starters; their gluten free brownie is to die for. I bit into this brownie and had no idea it was actually gluten free until the staff mentioned it. It was so dense, chocolaty and moist; I thought I had died and gone to brownie heaven. I have had other gluten free brownie's and I could always tell they were gluten free, they had that gluten free cardboard taste to them. But this brownie was amazing. I visit this place on a weakly basis and while I'm there I also get the rocket roast coffee. I'm not a java girl but after having a sip of the rocket roast coffee it keeps me coming back for more every time. If you like cranberries then you have to try their cranberry squares they are tasty and satisfying. This treat has just the right amount of sweetness and the tartness from the cranberries balances everything out perfectly!!! This café has two locations Leslieville and the beaches which is just steps from the famous Fox Theatre. Folks you you've got to try this place you won't be disappointed!!!"}
{"text":"Fantastic service! Te Aro is just always busy so I ventured eastward and fell in love. It's a simple coffee shop with really good pastries. There's good coffee. And there's sandwiches! 

I did end up staying for hours with a book. Actually studying. But not a textbook! It was peaceful and the coffee was good. The barista actually took the time to explain each bean to me, from harvesting to drying to roasting to flavour profile. EACH bean!! He made sure I picked the right one."}
