{"text":"Yes, it is expensive. But it is very, very good. I am willing to pay for Indian food that has that level of excellence.
Yes in some big cities you can get decent Indian food for much cheaper, but it does not hold up to this or any excellent Indian food.
But, their lunch buffet is very reasonable, and different every time. I think one of my best meals there was at the lunch buffet.
The large window overlooks ugly, but nothing is perfect."}
{"text":"Just alright Indian food located in the basement of an office building on the east side (for real).  Must be the scarcity of Indian food in Cleveland that made this place packed on a Friday evening at around 8:30, because the food was nothing special.  I had my usual, the malai kofta, and my wife had her usual, mattar paneer, but found that both were a little too tomato-y for our liking.  The samosas were fantastic and the duo of sauces they bring out (the seemingly traditional tamarind chutney and then the mint-cilantro-onion green sauce) were exceptional, especially the mint-cilantro-onion sauce.  It was chunkier than most other Indian places I've been and had just the right mix of spice and coolness that I spread it on my garlic naan.

  Outside of the samosas and sauce, nothing really to write home about.  The service, while pleasant, was painfully slow and we sat for between 15-20 minutes before the waitress came over to our table.  We'll continue to look elsewhere in our new hometown for the go-to Indian place."}
{"text":"I feel like I've been to two different Saffron Patches in the same restaurant. I went once for the lunch buffet. It was so poor, that I vowed never to return. I never could understand why people raved about this place. Granted, I grew up on Indian food, so maybe I made the mistake of comparing it to my childhood and young adult experiences. 

Anyway, some dear friends were going for dinner and begged me to come. I was very hesitant, but am so glad I did. The a la carte dinner totally made me revise my estimate. It was solid Northern Indian restaurant food. Given my first experience, I can't give it more than 3 stars in good faith. But I'll go back, and if it relives my last experience, I'll bump this to 3.5 stars with a warning to only go at dinner time."}
{"text":"Hard to find location in back of building. Went for lunch and waited to be seated, was completely ignored. Decided to glance at the lunch buffet and it was not impressive, very little to offer - including a few curries and some sad looking iceberg lettuce. So I made a quick decision to leave."}
{"text":"Marvelous Indian food, great portions. I've been there many times and the food has never disappointed, its always good. I will be back! The restaurant has an elegant ambiance, and isn't all that crowded."}
{"text":"It was an ok place. First of all, the service was horrible. We had asked for raw onions and lemons, which is served at almost all other Indian Restaurants, or is easily given if asked for, and we received it, five minutes before we left. And if that wasn't annoying enough, we were charged $2 for it. And don't even get me started on the staff. They were just horrible"}
{"text":"Only after trying many other Indian restaurants did I fully appreciate how good Saffron Patch is. Between the great food, great service, and comfortable and charming atmosphere, I would argue it is the best Indian restaurant in Cleveland."}
{"text":"Best Indian food we have had in Cleveland. It was recommended to me by an Indian colleague and now I see why. They have a delivery system which is great too."}
{"text":"I always thought this was pretty good but my token Indian friend thinks it's garbage. Just goes to show how easy it is to fool Americans."}
{"text":"This review is for the vegetarian buffet on a Sunday night, priced a little on the high side at $14.25 per person. The polished inside of the restaurant certainly is worth the price though, if the atmosphere is something very important for your meal. Definitely seems like a good place for a more upscale (but still casual) date or business meeting. (That's assuming you can find this place, on the ground floor of an office building without much exterior signage.) The food is decent, but appeared to have been sitting on the buffet trays for a while, understandable given that it was a slow night. For those more particular on tastes, ordering off the menu may be wiser when the place is relatively empty late at night... There were about eight hot dishes on the buffet, plus salad and two soups and fruit and dessert. Popular dishes including chickpeas, lentils, and spinach can fill one's stomach quite quickly!"}
{"text":"Initially I lost the way as if you come from charge in you will not see the restaurant as it on the other side if the building so after call by phone I get there
The atmosphere is fabulous it is really quit nice clean with excel land greeting 
They bring the kids drying in regular glass with out cover 
The appetizer sampler was great and devious I order the Karahi chicken and my wife get the veggie korma I i order chicken biryani too and Nan & brata 
The food portion  is enough specially the brainy can feed 2 person the nan came hit from the oven you can eat it alone the good arrive immediately without delay and we eat all but we could not finish it all so we left with 2 boxes was prepared by the waters 
The stink as it juice it was not free refill but with it low price of $2 it is worth to order more the price is excellent for the quality if food and it was wonderful Indian night"}
{"text":"Wow. These people have some guts. 

2 experiences - 

1. I just came back from a fairly average lunch buffet, having paid $19.75 per person. The food and the ambiance was fairly average and I would have ended up paying $12/13 for this at any comparable restaurant. We were a party of 6 people (mind you, not 8 as would be at other places), and they charged a gratuity of 26%; and that too, for service in a buffet (where you serve your own food). 

2. Dinner a few months back - We arrived at 9.15pm and got the first round of our order served at 9.35ish. When we ordered more bread, we were told that it is the closing time and their chefs had gone home (probably around 9.40pm). Mind you, there was no last call before they closed their kitchen.

In short, alright food, mediocre service, and greedy management.
Never going there again."}
{"text":"The food was great !! we loved it. The \"Dinner for two\" in vegetarian course is the best you get to taste among all of their best dishes. I loved the Naan and its curries. 

Though its bit harder to find this place, we eventually managed to locate it and the day we went was totally crowded yet they managed to accommodate us for the dinner. And the service is fast and quality of the food is excellent.!!"}
{"text":"Full disclosure: I am from Delhi, India.

I went to this restaurant, because it seemed to be the highest Yelp-rated Indian restaurant in Cleveland area. I will start off by saying that I had a bad taste in my mouth (literally) after returning from there. Now I will explain why.

I had ordered a Mango Milkshake to start things off. My immediate reaction to my first sip was that it was not made from real mangoes. It definitely seemed from artificial mango syrup; it had a weird chemical taste to it. Bad start. Surely, it couldn't get worse; or so I thought.

Our entrees Tandoor Chicken (Full) and Seekh Kabob made a very grand entrance on sizzling plates, and actually smelled quite good coming in. They came with a single big plate of rice, a very small bowl of matar paneer (a tomato-based curry of peas and indian cottage cheese) and a very small bowl of mixed vegetables (dry dish).
- First thing, the menu doesn't accurately represent what's going to come on your table. It says 'saffron rice and vegetable curry' as accompaniment for both the dishes. Clearly, dry mixed vegetables is not a curry and is a bad accompaniment with rice.
- Next thing, rice. Indian cuisine is famous for its nice and flavorful long-grain basmati rice. Instead, what was served here was a dump of rice that was full of broken pieces, unflavorful, very lukewarm and not-so-fresh.
- As some other reviews have mentioned, the tandoor chicken was extremely dry (and overcooked) and under-seasoned (with a lot of red color though!).
- Seekh kabob was the only dish that was decent on our table (still not as succulent, as it was probably again overcooked).
- From what we saw at the table next to ours, you might want to skip the biryani as well (it looked more like a pulao).
Granted we did not try any of the curries, but from the quality of something as simple as rice and their technique for cooking meat, I wouldn't expect much. Completely over-rated on Yelp IMHO!

PS: The decor and service was decent. As others have said, it is on the ground floor of a tall office building. The restaurant itself is on the side of Northfield Rd instead of Chagrin Blvd."}
{"text":"Average Americanized Indian food. Somewhat bland for my taste. Have been here twice and not seen a single Indian patron. Service is hit or miss. Odd location at the back of an office building. Plenty of parking."}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian restaurant in Cleveland, and when I have a craving for Indian food I go here exclusively. The mutter paneer is amazing and my husband loves the chicken tikka masala. The naan is delicious. The wait staff is friendly. Half of the time we get carry out just for the convenience. Look for their entertainment book coupon, it's a good deal. Their prices are so reasonable anyway for the amount of food you get and the flavor."}
{"text":"The food is tasty and the buffet is generally high quality. My major gripe is that you need to have a backup plan available if you want to go on a weekend. THREE times, we have tried going for the Sunday buffet only to see a sign on the restaurant door that they're closed for a private event. 

Each time, we've either gone to Choolaah in Woodmere or the Taj India Palace buffet in Richmond Heights."}
{"text":"Take out May 2916. Solid Indian food. Nan is good. Chicken tandoor a bit dry. Tina Masala tasty, made as spicy as you want. Plenty of parking (restaurant is in back by ramp)."}
{"text":"We are new to Cleveland and decided to try this restaurant. Food is not authentic at all  service was poor, it took long to get the order, one of the dishes was not what we had ordered and it took a while to get it corrected. To top it all, the prices are very high. Coming from Chicago that has great indian and Pakistani food, we were very disappointed."}
{"text":"Hands down, one of the best Indian food buffets I've ever eaten, anywhere.

Pricey, but worthwhile!"}
{"text":"I've been told this place is not very authentic from quite a few Indian friends, but I still like it.  The Saturday buffett until 2:30pm is only 10 bucks and is pretty good."}
{"text":"I've always really enjoyed The Saffron Patch, it's generally pretty empty and the service is fast. I guess it's a little overpriced for what it is but I can't change that. Anyhow, you should check it out"}
{"text":"I had never tried Indian food before eating at Saffron Patch and I am so happy my husband convinced me to try it. It is now one of our favorite restaurants and we love the laid back atmosphere and service. The lamb melts in your mouth and I love the chicken tikka too. It is fairly expensive but it's quality food with an upscale atmosphere. Please do not judge on outside appearance because it is in a funky location (bottom of an office building) it is a MUST try especially for a Cleveland eastsider!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite Indian in the world.   Always good.  Always delicious.   But please ... bring back the weekly vegetarian buffet."}
{"text":"I came here with very high hopes with the other reviews recommending the lunch buffet, but wasn't impressed.  I am lucky that where I have spent the last ten years (Columbus), there is really good Indian, but am still on the search for somewhere in Cleveland after my visit here.  
The first turnoff for me was the fact that almost everyone I saw was reusing the same plate every time they went up to the buffet, and the servers said nothing about it(pretty sure it's a law, and should be a rule anyhow).  Even more discouraging, was in my second (and final) visit to the buffet, I got the last large plate, and not only didn't they replenish them, they took the small plates away from the line as well, even though there were still twenty minutes left until their 2:30 end/ lunch closing time.  
The best thing on the buffet was sadly the veg pakora which are deep fried, so its kinda hard to screw up IMO, but they were out of the green mint/cilantro sauce that I always put on my pakora, and never refilled it during my entire stay.  The buffet wasn't too big, but sadly they didn't even use the whole thing.  The second half was just some cucumbers, onions, and a bowl of rice pudding was the only dessert they offered.  The best part about the buffet is that they said the offerings on it change every day.  I must have chose a bad day to visit if thats the case.  They had chicken and lamb curries, which weren't bad, but pale in comparison to anything in Columbus.  The naan was downright burnt, which is a cardinal sin at any indian place, and the tandori chicken was as dry as could be.  The best dishes it pains me to say were the vegetarian ones, which make sense for an indian place, but for a meat lover, it was a sad day.
I wish yelp gave out half stars, as I usually end up rounding up when I have to decide between them, but in this case couldn't give them the three stars I would be forced to.   Granted I am not Indian, and do not know what authentic Indian food truely is, I know here in America, I have eaten my fair share of it, and if its more authentic, then I don't want to go.  Next time I get indian, I will just wait until I go back to Columbus unless someone can convince me otherwise!!"}
{"text":"I had the lunch buffet today and really curved my craving for good Indian food.  The people complaining about the staff must have been here before the management corrected it.  Even though I had the self serve buffet, the staff was attentive to clear used plates and refill beverages at all the tables.  The food was tasty and I look forward to the full dinner menu."}
{"text":"We have eaten here for years, but recently have started eating the lunch buffet.  The selections are very tasty and seasoned perfectly.  There is always a good vegetarian selection.  Some of the chicken and vegetarian entrees are their staple selections, but they do change around several dishes each time we have gone.  We haven't tried the Sunday dinner buffet (which I believe is all vegetarian), but we will one day.  The buffet prices are excellent for the variety of food you receive.....the taste consistency is always very good.  Only once, was one of the chicken dishes too salty for my liking.  Some dishes can be higher in the heat and spice category, and there is nothing written by the item to let you know.  I don't like things too hot or spicy, and so far everything for me, has been adequately spiced.  But still, if I'm not quite sure of a new dish, I just take a sample size serving first"}
{"text":"My boyfriend & I have been here twice now. Once for take out, and this evening we dined in for dinner. The food is good, it's probably a little overpriced. The atmosphere is not so great as the prices go......all the tables are just sort of sandwiches in a room. Which makes it noisy. 

I was dissatisfied that the server added gratuity for a two top. They tipped themselves 21.5%..... the service is probably more in the tune of 15%. I assume he does this because people using a Groupon may tip after the discount? That's not fair, I understand. If the service was better, maybe he would not have to. 

I think this restaurant will have to be more competitive once the Van Aiken district is up and running. I assume their staple customers will be there. We most likely will not."}
{"text":"I am fan of this place for many reasons. 

Ambiance is awesome. It truly feels like a very good restaurant unlike small Indian places. It has a nice interior and seating is very organized. The staff is very good and courteous. 

The most important thing is the food. This place has one of the best Indian food on the east side. I have enjoyed most of their vegetarian dishes. I have came here on Sundays for lunch buffet. They have a nice variety and for the price I think it is a reasonable lunch. 

I will be a regular at this place."}
{"text":"If you knew Saffron Patch back in the early 90's you would have hated it.  My family and I always felt like the staff were always rude, especially towards Indian people.  But things have changed.  I really do not have much experience with the restaurant itself but my dad has dealt with the catering at Saffron Patch a numerous times for Indian weddings in the Cleveland Area.  I recently got married this past September in Mentor, and of course, my dad wanted Saffron Patch and George to cater for us.  And I was not disappointed in the least.  When we came in for our tasting, the staff was so welcoming and kept us pretty entertained with drinks until the caterer, George, was free.  George sat down with my family and fiance and explained why he choose the menu for us.  At first I was skeptical in the fusion types of food he came up with, but one taste and I was sold!  George catered our wedding lunch, reception, and also our get together the night before the wedding. Every meal and every dish was amazing and unique.  I am still getting compliments on the food to this day.  The ideas and creations that they came up with was so delicious and well presented.  It did help that George knew my dad pretty well, but that still did not stop him from making sure our menu was what my fiance and I wanted and no one else.  George and his team at Saffron Patch did wonders for our wedding and it's because of them my wedding was even more perfect.  I always say, you can have the best decorations, the nicest china, the prettiest cake at your reception, but if your food isn't good people will always complain!  Thanks, George and Saffron Patch, for making my wedding even more special that it already was!!"}
{"text":"I started working in a lab, since then I have been introduced to Indian food from all over Cleveland and our resident students have all given me their take on their authentic Indian food Restaurants. I really like this place. We drove in from Downtown Cleveland and the drive was the scariest part. The part that the restaurant is in, is not too bad. Anyways, it is located on the lower level of an office building. So if you see a tall office building, you found it on Chagrin. The atmosphere is very nice inside, it has indian flair and is simply relaxing. You get your water refilled continuously and that made it all worth it to see them pay that much attention to us. I ordered Chicken Vindaloo and Tandoori Chicken ( at a 5 spice level--indian hot) The servings were really good in size and for our table of three, we were given a HUGE platter of rice with saffron and other items in it. Most tasty it was! The Chicken Vindaloo had good spice and the Tandoori chicken was brilliant tasting ( however the BomBay Sitar in Canton has it beat) but none-the-less totally worth it. The fun part, my vegetarian friend I was with ordered some type of veg ball in this tasty tomato paste. This paste had nuts in it, and it was warned on the menu. I am allergic but still tasted a small bit. I loved it, the sauce was too good to not get some for the rice. I ordered a side of that ( was not charged, another plus) and I asked for no nuts specifically. I waited and waited and I never got the paste. So I asked and the waiter was frazzled that I had not yet gotten it, so she ran back and got some. I ate it like it was no ones business and it was sure tasty. The nuts made it taste so good...... It had nuts in it and I had a really fun drive. I was rather sick, but its my body and not the restaurant. Overall, a little pricy for a family trip and just right for a trip with friends like I had.

{"text":"Strange location but awesome food.  The service was impeccable from a slightly older gentleman who was both knowledgeable and cordial.  I ordered the chicken tikka tandoori and the boy ordered the chicken biryani.  He ordered a level 2 on a scale of 1 to 5 and it was really spicy.  I love level 5 hot and so even I was surprised the level 2 was as spicy as it was.  The naan with herbs and mint was divine and the chutneys are not to be missed.  This is as authentic as it gets.  Dinner for two with drinks was $58 including tip.  A winner."}
{"text":"Da"}
{"text":"I am an out of town visitor and dined here with two coworkers who consider themselves foodies. I had the tandoori which was delicious and everyone loved the meal. My companions were a bit difficult to wait on but the wait staff did a great job accommodating them. The only reason I didn't give a 5 star review was that the decor needed some improvement. If in town again I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"Saffron Patch, Beachwood Ohio,

My experience of Indian restaurants can very greatly. Most of which have been mediocre food, shabby decor, and buffets that are a borderline health violations. 

The saffron patch takes Indian dinning to another level. 

Tucked in the basement of a commercial office building, this restaurant is hard to find and you really have to know where to go to find it, but when you do you will be well rewarded. 

The entrance brings you to a small bar area and Host station, always clean and organized. When your greeted they escort you into the dinning room which has a small buffet area large ceilings and a private area in the back. The décor is updated, and stylish decorated with a touch of business formal and a hint of ethnic theme. 

On the weekdays they offer a lunch buffet which opens at 11:30. The buffet consist of Indian staples such as, Tandoori Chicken, Mutter Paneer, Chicken Makhami, Chicken Kheema Masala, Masala, Alu Gobi, Maingan Bhartha, Dal, not forgetting the delicious Naan bread, and Rice. 

Items on the menu change daily. Some of my favorites are the Vegetable Pakoda, Somosa, Paneer Pakoda, Matka Gosht, and garlic Naan. The buffet is always well presented and offer a sufficient variety.  

I would have to say that one of my favorite things about a good Indian restaurant, is the vegetarian selection. Although I may not be a vegetarian, I do however love to eat well prepared veggie meals. If I could have such great veggie dishes prepared for me everyday of this caliber I would be a full blow vegg fanatic.  I have tried many vegetarian dishes from California to Kolkata, and there are no vegetarian dishes I love more than Indian cuisine, and the Saffron Patch has to be one of my favorites. 

They also offer a variety of Indian deserts, \"sigh\", not to many I'm a fan of.. I do however love Indian style rice pudding, or Kheer. They also offer, Badam Burfi, Gulab Jamum, Gajar Halva, and Sooji Halva and fresh fruit.

Out of all the Indian restaurants I have dined in the U.S., I would have to say my favorites are located in NE United States, 1 - Raj Mahal in Erie Pa., and The Saffron Patch in Beachwood  Ohio.

I rate the Saffron Patch 7/10

P.S. The parking lot leaves a lot to be desired. They have designated parking but I think workers of the office complex steal them.. You can park in the neighboring garage but it will be a little walk."}
{"text":"Good food, good service, didn't receive 5 stars because i have ate at a better indian buffet before."}
{"text":"Great lunch buffet! They do their spices right, which is very important when eating Indian food."}
{"text":"Awesome food, good service. Food was out fast and has great portions. A little hidden, but I guess it's a hidden treasure."}
{"text":"My husband and I are both big fans of Indian food, and this is where we head for a fix.  It's not the most fabulous that I've had, but it's the best I've had in Cleveland.  It's a little expensive for what you get on a lot of the dishes, but we tried sharing the vegetarian thali and both left quite full.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The food was mediocre. I had the lunch buffet and I came around 145 so about forty five minutes before they close to get ready for dinner. I would expect that there would still be some food or it slightly replenished. It was decent though, the biggest issue i had was i couldnt get a server to get me a drink or napkins. When he did walk by after helping the only other table in the restaurant o had to flag him down. He seemed annoyed i bothered him. When i got my stuff he seemed more friendly and pleasant. If youre looking for great this place isnt it but if youre looking for average with little or no service because you really want Indian food this place will do. I might be able to revise my review coming in at a busier time but so far this has been my only experience."}
{"text":"Serviceable Indian food, possibly in the top five in Cleveland. Meat dishes are good, though the vegetable dishes are not as good but okay.  I always get the rogan josh for the meat dish, with maybe some chicken biryani. The lamb is always tender, and chicken in any of the dishes never too dry. For the vege dishes, usually the chana masala (they call it something else here, so ask for the chickpeas) and the saag paneer. The paneer is good, but nothing off the charts. 

Four stars for Cle, but probably would get three stars in any of the other places Ive lived. If you have not had indian food before, it is quite good so I would recommend it. The ambiance is nice, and they have large private rooms for birthdays etc. Also, BYOB for a minimal corking fee, which I always take advantage of.

For first timers, you should try to part in the back, as the layout could be confusing the first time you come."}
{"text":"This place is pretty good. I've been here for the weekend lunch buffet and dinner a la carte. The lunch buffet has great variety, and on Sunday they make fresh dosas.

Tip: buffet prices are higher on Sunday to account for the dosas... worth it IMO.

Buffet items included both meat and vegetarian and are substantial if you are looking for either. Lots of variety but staples are the tandoori chicken, dal and paneer dishes, chicken tika masala, etc. Usually there are two sweet items offered in the buffet and multiple sauces and chutnies to go with the meal. 

I also went on a Friday night for a la carte because I was craving Indian food and I don't know of any buffets in Cleveland open for the evening (fill me in PLEASE if you know any). We ordered the vegetarian meal for two which was very substantial and left us with plenty of leftovers but was a little pricey for vegetarian. Came with appetizers and dessert as well. Basically, this platter features the vegetarian items from the buffet, but for double the buffet price for two people. So I would recommend buffet over this. Also, we got lamb korma, which was good, but lots of connective tissue in the lamb. The portion size was very small for the price ($17 I think). 

Overall, I would recommend going for the buffet, preferably on the weekend. A la carte was okay, but not worth the price IMO. 

Tip: ALWAYS call before going on the weekend for buffet because sometimes they are closed for a private event."}
{"text":"Undoubtedly the best Indian food in Cleveland. Coming from an Indian, I think that should count as a big compliment. As close to authentic as it can get. Add to that quick service and friendly staff and you just bought yourself a nice evening."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from one friend. Service was good but the buffet was not up to the mark."}
{"text":"We had a dinner today and unfortunately I am not very satisfied by Saffron patch. I would not recommend it."}
{"text":"Spice, flavor and a great staff?  This place is great all around.  As others have said, the location is a little on the strange side (street level of an office building)... take the time to find it, this restaurant is worth the search!

The wine selection is decent, but let's be honest, that's not why you are coming here.  I highly suggest the garlic naan, it is delicious and a great accompaniment to the meal.  I must confess... I'm still an indian food novice; so I still stick to more standard fare.  I have enjoyed the chicken makhami and chicken tikka masala many times, and have always thought it was wonderful.

When I'm looking for Indian food in Cleveland... this is always where I go.  Delicious.  Flavorful.  Affordable."}
{"text":"I was at Saffron Patch a few weeks ago, the food was decent, the drinks were terrible."}
{"text":"Food is tasty but expensive....service is OK.
I'd rather stick to the lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Upscale, dim lighting, candles -- you know the drill.  I'm still making my way through all the various South Asian venues, but this one has had me come 3 times already.  Why?  Because I can get them to make it spicy... and not just spicy hot!

There are more things to curry pastes than chili, and, relative to the other experiences I've had in Cleveland, they keep their food pretty zesty.

I'm a sucker for a good Saag Paneer, and their Paneer is quite delicate and fresh, at least the 3 times I've been.

I miss having indian fast food around my pad, but I'm here in Cleveland now, and must make do with what's here.  Saffron Patch has become my go to for a curry fix.

More Mutter Paneer please!

Make it 7 out of 5 Spicy!"}
{"text":"I really like this place.  It's nice enough for a couple's date, but can accomodate families as well.

good food & service."}
{"text":"A good Indian restaurant for a casual eat out.  Food is good, not great,  nothing to write home about. Our paneer pakoras were hard and did not have much flavor. The malai koftas were good,  but I have eaten better. The naan and kulcha were good though. We felt the place lacked the value for the money we paid."}
{"text":"Ordered carry out tonight and the food was inedible. Had to throw it away. Don't go here, don't waste your money."}
{"text":"Food was good , nothing extraordinary and fairly priced. I have tasted better indian food than this. Service was good and interior was clean and tastefully done. 

I did read the reviews before going there and still was not sure of. Since most reviews are written by the people who are not very much acquainted with indian food delicacies and they dont know much difference between authentic and ok food.  Being an Indian, I know instantly if its really how the dish needs to be cooked and tasted. Anyways In my ratings, above average and I would go back."}
{"text":"Officially done coming to Saffron Patch. This was once my favorite restaurant, but the past three times I've tried to come here, they've been closed for a private event. I usually have obligations on Sunday nights that prevent me from coming to vegetarian buffet night at Saffron, but tonight I did not, and I spent my entire day, literally 9am to 6pm, looking forward to eating here. I should have known better after the past few attempts at eating at Saffron, but, shocker, was turned away again. I'm done trying. I recommend not wasting your time either! On my way to Cafe Tandoor. 

Also, they don't provide rice for vegetarian dishes, you have to pay extra. Because we vegetarians don't like rice?"}
{"text":"AMAZING!  I have been to Saffron Patch several times and have never had anything less than EXCELLENT!  The service is always top notch and the food is wonderful.  I am a strict vegetarian and I have a vast amount of options to pick from.  I generally order my food semi-spicy which is a perfect balance of heat and flavor.  I thoroughly enjoy going out to eat and Saffron Patch has been and continues to be one of my favorite restaurants in Cleveland!"}
{"text":"I've been hard-pressed to find a go-to Indian place in the Cleveland area, but Saffron Patch has ended up becoming the Indian restaurant I dine at most frequently (likely because it's located just a few minutes from my house.) While their entrees are on the pricey side, the lunch buffet is reasonably priced (around $10.) The buffet dishes are prepared fresh, served in small batches, and are refilled regularly, so you never have to worry about eating food that's been sitting out all day. They do a nice job of making sure that the buffet has a variety of dishes -- the dal, matar paneer, and aloo gobi are all delicious. Though the buffet is light on appetizers, the vegetable pakora are fantastic (especially with the tamarind sauce.) If you like your Indian food spicy, the buffet may disappoint -- the dishes are all very mild. If I'm ordering off the menu, my favorite dishes are the shahi paneer and the butter chicken. 

The service at Saffron Patch can be a bit hit or miss -- I've had great service there, but I've also had waiters who seem to forget I exist as soon as I've been seated. I find that I have better service experiences when I'm there for dinner as opposed to the lunch buffet (maybe there's an impression among the waitstaff that buffet-goers can fend for themselves?)

I do wish that the prices at Saffron Patch were just a little lower (if their entrees were in the $12-15 range as opposed the the $15-20 range, I would likely end up dining there a little more frequently), but the presence of the buffet is generally enough to make up for the pricey entrees."}
{"text":"So, I love Indian food, and after having so much Indian food over the past few years, I think I am a good judge when it comes to Indian cuisine! 

Since moving to Cleveland, I have been looking for good Indian and most places didn't have great reviews so I never bothered going. Saffron Patch came recommended by a friend, and so we decided to go together. 

The restaurant is located inside a building with other businesses which can be hard to find if you don't know that going in. The place itself is cute, modern, and there is an area designated for larger groups and parties. The staff is very friendly and accommodating, not too much but not too little, just right.

Now onto the food! We ordered the Chicken Makhani and the Chicken Tikka Masala, two dishes we both seemed to be very familiar with. I was less than impressed, ordered a spice level of 3, on a scale of 1-5. There was spice to it, and it was an accurate 3, but the flavors were just so bland, it tastes like the first time you ever try making a dish and you realize how much tweaking there is to do. The chicken was kind of rubbery in my opinion, and I really needed to aggressively use the knife to get through and get it into smaller pieces. This was with both dishes, so I really did not like that. We also had buttered naan, and it was kind of hard, which happens so I didn't really judge that too much, but the main dish was where the points were lost.

Overall the food was less than average but service is great so that gets an extra point. I am not sure I would come back, unless it's a buffet and I can try their other dishes without committing to one thing specifically."}
{"text":"I've only be to Saffron Patch for the lunch buffet (so far!), but I keep coming back because the buffet features some delicious food and it's always different. The BEST chicken tandoori I've ever had is here, and that's one thing that doesn't change about the buffet. It's the best because it is EXTREMELY smoky! If you loved that smoky taste, you have to try that chicken. 

Service has always been great and I can't wait to come back for dinner! 

The only weird thing about this place is that it's in an office building. Parking is VERY difficult during the day. Apparently people who work in the building take all of the restaurant parking spots during the winter so that they don't have to walk very far...? That's what I was told by the restaurant staff. There is a parking garage that is very awkward and bizarre to get around in unless you have a teeny tiny car but once you figure it out it's fine. 

And though it has an odd location, the vibe of the restaurant is very nice! I'd recommend Saffron Patch for the lunch buffet, and I'm sure the regular menu is even better...I will be back for both."}
{"text":"I was very pleasantly surprised by the Saffron Patch on all counts.

Saffron Patch is a tiny bit hard to find since it's in the lower level of an office building. Once you get past the scavenger hunt, it's all good. 

I'll begin by saying that the ambiance was exceptional.... \"for an Indian restaurant in Cleveland.\" Let's be honest here people, most Indian joints around here just look terrible and make you want to order take-out. (I said MOST, not ALL. Simmer down. I'm not trying to be offensive. Just honest.)

We had a reservation for my sister's birthday. They put us in an intimate little room with glass, pocket doors. Those doors really came in handy because the place was almost packed and it was very loud in the main dining room. When the doors were open we could barely converse. The acoustics seemed to be a bit dodgy. 

The food was very good. I sampled at least 7 different dishes and none of them were a disappointment .... save for the Tandoori Chicken but that's not the restaurants fault. (It's just a boring dish that people order when they're not sure what else they should be ordering. Again, no offense.) 

The best thing about the meal was the spice factor. They go on a scale of 1-5. I can handle quite a bit of heat but wasn't entirely sure how hot my food would be so I played it safe with a 3. My nose was running a bit with the 3! Others in our party went with a 4 and all were very happy with their respective levels. I think I'll try a 5 next time. 

Only downsides to our meal were that we ordered garlic naan but received plain. And also, the food here seems to be pricier than other Indian establishments. We're probably paying more due to location/high rent factor. Sad face! 

Overall, Saffron Patch was delightful and I'll surely return."}
{"text":"SP is an upscale Indian restaurant located in the most random location ever on the corner of Chagrin and Van Aken in Shaker.  Do not let this location fool you.  Just look for the big building on the corner, park in the lot and go to the first floor.  Once you enter the restaurant, you'll realize this isn't your standard Indian restaurant.  You know what I'm talking about: the place that seems slightly shady where there's like 10 different waiters who never make eye contact who seem to come and go at random times...Hell no, this place is relatively classy.  So if you're looking for the authentic experience, perhaps not what you should be looking for.  You'll notice a very modernized decor which is somewhat soothing, or at least I think.  

The service-tends to be good the times I have been here.

The menu-relatively extensive with bias towards North Indian cuisine.  Nevertheless, many classics are on the menu and you should find something that will appeal to you.  Tremendous vegetarian selection.

The actual taste-amazing.  Just make sure you spice it to what you can handle.  If you're new to Indian food and can't handle the heat, don't go above a 5.  

The price-slightly expensive for Indian food.  Definitely worth it though for the quality that you get and the environment in which you get to enjoy your food.

Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Below  average... I am definitely not going back...
 Update:
I went back for their lunch buffet and that was much better. So guess don't order a-la carte"}
{"text":"Saffron patch catered an event for my residency program. We ordered naan, rice, and three entrees for 30 people.

First and foremost, working with the manager and the staff was wonderful. Each person we interacted with did a fantastic job of accommodating our needs, and the staff also helped us carry food out to my car, which was extremely helpful. The manager even allowed us to order shrimp vindaloo, which isn't even on the menu.

Moving on to the food itself, all of the dishes we ordered were absolutely delicious, and the quantities were enormous. About half of the food was left over by the end of the night, and I guarantee it will all be eaten by the end of the week. The shrimp vindaloo was spicy and flavorful, the chick pea dish we ordered was rich and well seasoned, and the rice and naan were well cooked and perfectly accompanied the other dishes (I don't eat meat, so I can't comment on the mango chicken dish, though it seemed to be quite a hit as well!)

I will absolutely recommend saffron patch for catering for events, and I am delighted with the experience we had. I hope the next batch of food is as good as this one!"}
{"text":"The buffet is great the tikka Marsala is awesome, came her for dinner it was a nice environment good service all around good place to eat .. The lights randomly dimmed when we where here place might be haunted lol but cool atmosphere ."}
{"text":"Yes, it's hard to find on a dark snowy night - look for the glowing blue elephant, but you'll be well rewarded.  

I started with Samosas which were pretty typical, but the green sauce was amazing - fresh chopped and full of flavor.  

I had Chicken in Vindaloo sauce at 4 of 5 hot:  They do Potato or Lamb Vindaloo on the menu, and were willing to make it with chicken for me...  and it was great:  Hot yet flavorful (as Ferdinand H says). A Generous portion, and high quality white meat chicken.

Accessorized with Naan  (\"trinkled with butter\" according to the menu) and I was too full to consider dessert.  

Loved it - will be back again."}
{"text":"This is our place for Indian food. Amazing authentic indian food. Good and fast service. Sizable portions. big menu for vegetarians and even vegan.
My favorites are Samosas, Lamb Seekh Kabob, Malai Kofta, Paneer Pakoda is also very good and don't forget the Naan!!"}
{"text":"The Saffron Patch is an easy place for myself and colleagues from work to grab lunch quickly when we don't have a lot of time for lunch. It's a very convenient location for us that's less than a five minute drive from our office - their location is on the South side of Chagrin right before Warrensville Center in an office tower right behind the Howard Hanna Real Estate Office.

The food is always fine, as is the service, not we generally get the buffet meaning that I've never experienced what the kitchen can really do. In fairness, I need to go and order off the menu then write again. Until then, I'll stick with 3 stars for a reasonable lunch buffet."}
{"text":"Alright so I try this place out as I had seen such good reviews here. I decide to do a take home as I was tired from a long day.. It took me almost 40min to get my order of malai kofta... I go back to my hotel and see that it is chicken curry. Now being a vegetarian, i was not going to have this, so I had to drive back to Saffron Patch and request malai kofta. I understand that you are busy, but this is not acceptable. I finally get my malai kofta which was not at all spicy as I had originally ordered... 
It is not the most authentic food I have tasted but it is passable. The naan was soft and fluffy.
It is difficult to find this place.. :)"}
{"text":"Great food.  All the dishes I've had are so flavorful and delicious.  I can't think of any other type of food that has such bold and perfect seasoning and flavor.  I've been to dinner twice here, both times everything on the table was excellent. 

I really enjoyed the mango chicken.  The lamb saag was excellent, but be prepared, it really has that lamby/gamey flavor which may or may not be a plus for some people.  Next time around I'd probably opt for the chicken saag.   Service both times has been great.  The location is a little strange as it's tucked away in a office building, but they've done a nice job with the interior."}
{"text":"I would say 3.5 Stars. Having lived in the Middle East countries where indian restaurants take major part of the restaurant business and are being very competitive, I am critical of indian food. 
I  enjoyed the dining experience at Saffron Patch. I felt I finally found a place to enjoy a decent  indian food in this town. 
But, price is ridiculous. 

Seafood and meat dish are served with rice.
All the vegetable dishes are around $10 but they DO NOT come with rice nor naan so you have to add another $3 bucks to that. That would be over $13 just for a vegetable curry, which I think it's bit pricy.

(Butter Shrimp curry) was a great choice, although it's very pricy ($18 for curry!!)..
If you like a creamy rich curry with shrimp,  you would love this one.

(Lentils and chickpeas curry) All the ingredients are mashed and it's more like a thick soup than a curry. I expected for a curry with chickpeas, so i did not like it while my partner seemed to like it because he likes a thick lentil soup. This dish is more like a thick bean lentil soup.

I had an impression that they use frozen begetables in the food. When I oredered some vegetable curry dish, carrots and green beans were frozen veggies.

(Lunch Buffet) When I went there for a lunch, they had 3 different kind of curry. Two of them were chicken. If you are a meat lover, it would be a great deal.

I had a real dissapointment when I purchased a restaurant voucher for Saffron Patch @ restaurant.com. This is $25 certificate by paying $10, you have to Dine-In only with minimum $50 and the worst part is that 20% gratuity will be automatically deducted. So in the end i only got $7 off.
And they provide a Printable 15% OFF coupon on their Saffron Patch website, so this has been better than purchasing a certificate:-(

The location choice for the restaurant is a real mystery and their decor is a major miss. The dining space is unusual for restaurants and it is just like a room in community center. Nobody would noticed this place being located in an office building at the rear of Chagrin Blvd. They will do much better business if they relocate to somewhere like Cedar/Fairmont or near hospitals and change it up for contemporary style."}
{"text":"Been here twice - the first time about 7 years ago - and I can report that at least they're consistent: somewhat decent Indian food for the price, nothing extraordinary, and good flavors offset by widespread overcooking.

Right off the bat I will take issue with their overcooking.  For example they burnt both pieces of garlic naan ($3/piece) we ordered.  You can imagine what burnt pieces of garlic taste like in bread!  Also, my Tandoor Mix Grill ($18.00) was delicious except everything, including the wonderfully large shrimp, was beyond well-done.  I tried rescuing them as soon as they arrived at the table, sizzling away on the 500+ degree plate, but alas... they were already DOA!  The tandoori chicken on the same plate - dry, should've been juicy.

The Assorted Platter ($11.00) we started off with was decently-sized to share (although only 1 samosa) and tasted good.  My wife's Malbari Vindaloo (lamb w/ potatoes, $15.00) was tender, although (again) slightly overcooked.  She ordered a spicy level \"3 out of 5\" and said the heat level was just right, right at the limit of getting too hot for her.

At dessert time, they ran out of Ras Malai.  *Pout* since I was really looking forward to it!  So I settled for their Rice Pudding ($4.00) and the wife had their Kulfi (pistachio ice cream, $5.00) - no complaints there.

Our server was very friendly and understood the menu. 

We noticed a popular attraction was the vegetarian buffet.  Several of the tables were partaking in it.

The decor, wobbly tables, and worn carpet doesn't detract from the obviousnesss of the restaurant's first floor office building location.

By the way, don't think that I'm unable to give an Indian restaurant 5-stars (see my review of Flavor of India)!  Unfortunately that 5-star Indian experience is about 800-miles away (both literally and figuratively!)...

Total price for our dinner for two: $66.90 (before tip). 

So bottom line: would we go again?  Meh... middle of the road on that one..."}
{"text":"Great food, though I've been told it's not the most authentic in the area.  They fooled me -  Each time I go, I truly enjoy myself. 

The main problem with this place is that it's very hard to find the actual restaurant.  It's in the basement of a Office Building.  If you do find it, enjoy!"}
{"text":"Hands down best Indian food in Cleveland. Upscale environment unlike the other Indian restaurants in Cleveland. I love the chicken makhani. They do a good job catering events...have used them countless times. Two thumbs up."}
{"text":"The Saffron Patch is just like others have described; a little hard to locate, friendly staff, and average food. 

My GPS took me to an entrance right behind a gas station, you can follow this up around and down so that you can park in spaces by the first floor where the restaurant is located. Or you can park in a parking deck and just walk down some stairs once inside. The restaurant is clean and tidy, but not much in terms of decor. Restrooms are located outside the restaurant in the main hall area. 

We had a young man wait on us and I thought he was friendly and attentive, I never had to call him over for anything. And while he seemed a little nervous he was pleasant. 

For food I got the Chicken Tikka Masala with spice level 1. This was pretty bland compared to other places I have been to. Just because a dish does not have heat, does not mean that it should lack flavor as well. Portion size wise, I would say you could eat this all in one sitting, do not expect to have leftovers unless you got appetizers with your meal. My date got the Lamb Biyani with a spice level of 3. This was a much bigger portion and you could definitely tell it had a kick to it. A side of Garlic Naan was nothing special. 

Overall, It was okay, I probably would not go back, but that is because I live closer to India Garden and Namaste which I really enjoy."}
{"text":"Clean and nice veg selection, Try the vegetarian buffet on Monday evenings."}
{"text":"Mind officially blown.

Before Saffron, I wasn't really into Indian cuisine, nor have I been exposed to it more than once or twice in my life. I've had this place mentally bookmarked for a long time as something new and daring to try, and after putting it off several times to try other, \"safer\" restaurants, I finally forced myself to go. All it made me do is wonder why I waited so long.

I went for the Sunday lunch buffet. The decor was very welcoming with clean tables, burgundy walls, and very large windows letting the sun light up the dining area. They let us sit wherever we wanted, and we were immediately given the green light to head to the buffet table.  The next hour or so was pure bliss. I had so many reservations about an Indian buffet (Is it clean? Fresh? Is it going to be meaty enough? Is there enough variety?), and after my first plate, they were all answered with a resounding \"YES.\" I wish I could remember all of the dishes, but the ones that stood out to me were the chicken curry, another chicken dish (karahi?), alu vindaloo, malai kofta, and the samosas with red sauce. I have no idea if the sauce was intended for the samosa, but I tried it after seeing a regular do it, and it improved tenfold. The green chutney was also good--it tasted just like pico de gallo.

I wasn't as impressed with the tandoori chicken or saffron rice, both of which were dry and tough. I opted for the endless naan in place of the rice, and they were cooked to warm, doughy perfection. Last thing to note is that everything was mild, spice-wise, which can be good or bad depending on personal preference. I would have liked a little more of a kick, but nothing to make me break a sweat.

Since Sunday, I've been craving and yearning to go back every single day this week. 4.5 stars rounded up for Saffron Patch."}
{"text":"Absolutely great Indian food, I wasn't expecting quality food from a buffet but they below my mind. So glad to have been recommended to trying this place out. I have recommended this place to multiple people already! We love! Just the right amount of spice is what I rate them!"}
{"text":"I checked out the lunch buffet offered here and was quite satisfied!  The buffet offers naan, rice, a few vegetarian appetizers, and a variety of curries and other sauces, with a good mixture of meat vs. vegetarian options;  The spiciness of the different sauces was varied, with several dishes being quite mild and a few that were a bit spicier.  The chicken was tender, and the sauces were flavorful and delicious.  In addition, there was a small salad bar and a few desserts offered.  I had the rice pudding, which was good.  My main criticisms for the buffet itself were that it was a bit smaller than many other Indian buffets that I've been to.  Also, as far as meat offerings went, it appeared that only chicken dishes were available.  However, the taste of the food was good, better than most of the places I have been to in Cleveland.

Other thoughts:  The lay out of the restaurant was fine, I suppose fairly standard for a restaurant located in an office building.  The waitstaff were nice.  One other criticism I have, though, is that the location was a bit hidden, and there didn't seem to be enough parking available.  I did not look into dinner prices, which I hear can be a bit more pricey, but I thought lunch buffet was fairly priced (perhaps just slightly on the expensive side).  Otherwise, I had a good meal and was quite happy to get my Indian fix at Saffron Patch"}
{"text":"There are certain dishes that are amazing here.  The lobster curry, saag paneer, chicken tikka masala, and aloo gobi are excellent.  The buffet is pretty good but a la carte though pricey tastes better.  Fresh naan is incredible.  They do a great job catering large events."}
{"text":"Let me first start off by saying I've been to Saffron Patch about 5-6 times. I usually go for the lunch buffet, which is pretty-dang-good in my book as far as Indian lunch buffets go. This is why this place is getting 2 stars from me instead of 1. That and eating their Malai Kofta is like riding a creamy wave of umami from heaven down into a warm, calm ocean.

Yesterday I went for dinner with a group of 6, and it was a memorably bad experience. First, the waiter, who had ONLY US as a table, was awful. He would check on us maybe every 25 minutes or so. He forgot drinks that we'd ordered more than once, and he also forgot the naan I ordered with my meal. They were out of vodka, they were out of whiskey. Other servers were attempting to come to his aid, but dude was struggling to perform the basic tenets of his job.

My table ordered varying spiciness of dishes, ranging from 1-4 on their scale of 1-5. Everyone's food was basically a 5. This is coming from a group of seasoned spiciness professionals that put red pepper flakes on everything, grow a variety of peppers, and make their own hot sauces. In some cases the food was inedible.

At the end of the meal (that took nearly 2 and a half hours because the service was so slow) we received the bill, split it into our individual amounts, and waited to cash out. Waiter guy never came back. I ended up getting up to find him hanging out at the bar with another waiter guy. 

Waiter guy first ran our cards for varying amounts, THEN pointed out that our calculations were short because none of us had accounted for the 18% gratuity that was automatically added to parties of 6 or more. We asked that it be removed from the bill, as we all wanted to leave our own tip amounts. (Despite this waiter's crap-turd service, we all probably would have tipped him more than 18%, as our group had 4 retired service industry folks in it and we're empathetic toward other servers.) The waiter declined our request, which was okay, but its customary to do that when a party requests it.

We recalculated the amount and we were short $35, so we added $40 cash to the bill. The waiter came back yet again with a giant calculator from oughteen forty two, insisting we were another $35 short, but that was like, impossible. By now, we had been cashing out for nearly 45 minutes and the rest of the waitstaff was sweating us because they were ready to go home. Dude ended up with a 40% tip for doing basically nothing. Well played, atrocious garbage waiter! You truly outfoxed a group of women who were so worn down by a combination of painfully spicy food and the vortex you created in the time-space continuum that we basically gave you all of the cash we had in our pockets."}
{"text":"My wife & I enjoy Indian food and visit many Indian restaurants in the Cleveland area.  We have been to Saffron Patch many times.  The people working at the restaurant are always friendly.  On our recent dinner visit, we did have some concerns. In the past, rice was always complimentary with an entree. Now you have to pay extra for rice.  Rice should be part of the meal, not an extra money maker for the restaurant. My wife ordered her spice level as hot; I ordered mine as mild. Both dishes came with hot spice levels.  The decor is pleasant, but I would like to see the décor reflect India's beautiful culture.  By walking inside, you would never know it was an Indian restaurant. The food is always flavorful, but then again, there are many Indian restaurants in Cleveland with flavorful food."}
{"text":"Good food. This place is on the first floor of a tall office building behind a BP gas station. It's a little hard to find and could use some more signs."}
{"text":"Okay, I gave this place another try with my friend for lunch. The food is definitely up to snuff and proportionate to the cost, 12$.
I had a better experience this time around and will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place was good not great. The food was fine but nothing really memorable.  Is was a little hard to find the restaurant and it is also a little on the pricey side."}
{"text":"When traveling on business, it's hard to find decent places to eat. First, even at the best of times, convincing three team-mates to try something they've never heard of is a fight. Second, after ten hours with clients, who wants to think? (These things are related.)

Fortunately there's Yelp. And with my team scattered for various reasons tonight, I could use it to explore the suburban wastelands east of Cleveland.

Saffron Patch is, indeed, hard to find. After your second circuit of the unremarkable office building containing the restaurant, just give up and park somewhere that doesn't look prohibited.

The place looked a little drab, but as it was later than Suburban dinner time on a weeknight, it wasn't bad in context. The service was on point (despite my server having to deal with a difficult customer at another table). The food was quite good. I'm spoiled, living in Chicago, for excellent Indian food. This place didn't disappoint me.

I had lamb vindaloo, with \"4 out of 5\" spiciness. This is the Ohio 4, though. If you've eaten and enjoyed really spicy Asian food before, just go for 5, because 4 is pretty mild. I also had a tasty, well-prepared (but also kind of mild) samosa.

Again, it's not Devon Street, but it's considerably better than the chains that surround the hotels nearby. I will go back, and try to convince my team to come with."}
{"text":"We had dinner at Saffron Patch an authentic Indian restaurant located in Beachwood OH, the ambience of the restaurant is excellent and the restaurant is well staffed.  Unfortunately the praises end here.  Their chicken appetizer is bad, it tastes like chicken pieces thrown in ketchup.  The Mango Milkshake/Lassi is too diluted and doesn't taste or look like any mango drink I have ever tasted. I grew up in India and have lived in Cleveland for 8 years so I know what Mango drinks taste like.  
The entrée \"Chicken Tikka Masala\" was pretty much a repeat of the appetizer.  The meat was chewy and the gravy was to say the least \"Unique\".  Can't debate with the chef on how an entrée is made but all I can say is that I have never tasted Chicken Tikka Masala like that.  Then came the Naan, which was burnt, (not Well Done which gives it a good crisp taste and feel), this was charred and tasted burnt.  When we pointed out to the server how bad the chicken and the Naan were she was prompt in agreeing to replace the Naan and made an alternate suggestion for the chicken.  
Alas this is where it went from being a bad meal where we didn't like the taste of the food, to a meal where the establishment just doesn't care.  The Naan that came back was still burnt, we had four orders and three were burnt just like the last time.  The chicken gravy was a lot better but the meat was still really chewy.  (The kind of chewy chicken gets when you leave an open bag in the freezer for too long.)
We weren't able to speak to the Manager/Owner, but the server was kind enough to comp off the Naan and the original chicken (We were charged for the alternate chicken we were served).  She did offer free dessert; but I wasn't ready for another (mis)adventure.  
In Summary the recipes are far from \"Authentic\" and as far as customer service is concerned they just DO NOT CARE.   Enjoy the $57 that's the last time you got any from me or my friends."}
{"text":"Worst experience I've ever had in any restaurant ever. Our entire table of 3 got sick immediately after eating here, this place needs to be reported to the health department and closed down."}
{"text":"Closed for a private party on the one night of their vegetarian buffet. Owners said we could come in before the party and eat but we were turned away by the hostess. Taking back two stars, one for each of those reasons. Wish they would have kept their word. We're probably going a back up plan every time we consider eating here again, just in case this happens again. Sucks, because the food is fantastic."}
{"text":"Very good Indian restaurant, randomly housed in the first floor of an office. building, like many of Beachwood's finest eateries. If I worked above the smell of this delicious food all day long, I would get the buffet every day, be morbidly obese and happy. As it stands, I'll just be glad that I work pretty close to this place."}
{"text":"Went here Sunday for their lunch buffet and have been here in the past for dinner, as well as for their Sunday night vegetarian buffet.  The food is always solid.  They have a very good and spicy hot sauce that you have to ask for."}
{"text":"Service was terrible. Waited 50 mins before our drinks were ordered. Food was delicious, though not as spicy as expected. I'd give it one more shot in hopes they were having an \"off\" night."}
{"text":"I am going out on a limb giving them 4 stars - but I feel obligated to.  We have ordered probably once a month since we moved to Shaker including an Uber Eats order.  Each time the food was perfect.  Exactly the same as the last time - no variations whatsoever.  As for the food, it is a milder Indian, probably tamed down a bit for us Americans.  Even their spicy isn't that spicy because they probably feel we can't take it.

Their lunchtime buffet is always good too, pretty reasonable for what you get.  

I would say my biggest gripe about Saffron Patch is the pricing - it ends up being about 12 -15 bucks more expensive for the same order elsewhere.  All that said, it's a good place we will continue to frequent as long as their quality holds up."}
{"text":"First time trying Indian food. Yes yes, I know. I'm such a \"foodie\" yet I hadn't tried actual Indian cuisine until this weekend.

We went on a Friday night and were immediately seated. We ordered an appetizer platter and garlic naan to start us off. Amazing! The flavors were just so strong and spicy and over-the-moon tasty. 

I ordered the mango chicken. It's basically a mango-infused curry sauce on big cubes of juicy, white meat chicken with a side of saffron rice. This dish alone is worth going back for.

My other half got the lamb korma. The flavor was smokier and had more spice. Another amazing dish.

The service was top notch, and the wait for all of our food was very short. They are on top of making sure their customers get the ultimate experience, and for that, I'm grateful. We even had leftovers for the next day.

I will definitely be hitting up Saffron Patch again. Worth the drive from downtown Cleveland."}
{"text":"Even though the staff is very friendly, the buffet was very ordinary!! It was missing that Indian charm and was not at all close to authentic taste."}
{"text":"I really want to find an Indian restaurant on the east side that I can get excited about, but until I do, Saffron Patch will have to do. (I've been to Cafe Tandoor on S Taylor once and that was one time too many.)

Great:
-Malai Kofta
-Garlic Naan

OK:
-Maharaja Biriani
-Lamb Vindaloo

Needed some serious help:
-Peshawar Cholle, a chickpea dish, greeted my tastebuds with a strange mineral flavor. I couldn't quite place it, but something just tasted off and out of harmony about this dish.
-Service (except for the bus boys/food runners, who were very attentive)

I will return to Saffron Patch on the strength of the Malai Kofta and Garlic Naan alone, but the mixed quality of the other dishes and the bad service really hurt this restaurant. I would like to describe my experience with the hostess. When I walked in the door the hostess area was totally empty. Just me and the hostess. All alone. At first I thought maybe she was a little blind and didn't see me so I stepped closer to her podium. Still, she did not even so much as look at me. She didn't say hello, she didn't tell me she would be right with me. Instead, she mumbled something and walked away. Really? How's that for a first impression? Eventually, one of the bus boys came and asked me if I needed anything and showed me to the table where my girlfriend was sitting.While I'm on the subject I should say those bus boys were the only competent members of the service staff. If it weren't for them I don't think I could bring myself to go back. Later, I was telling my girlfriend's parents about my experience with the hostess and they said she did the same thing to them. They also noticed that nobody said goodbye or thank-you as we left. Sadly, that's what I'm going to remember most about this visit, not the food."}
{"text":"Late Saturday night and my sister and I were starting to get hungry, so we headed to Red Lobster.. Wait what? That's right, we went there for endless shrimp. Unfortunately (fortunately?), the wait was too long so off we went to Saffron Patch!

We got there right at the end of the rush, and were seated immediately. The menu is extensive so we perused a while before I suggested we just get the \"Dinner for Two\" option under the vegetarian dishes. Two appetizers (samosas and papadum), three curries (names of which I have no idea), other random items (dal, naan, ect.), rice pudding, and a pickle dish (which was disgusting) came with the meal. WE WERE STUFFED and HAD LEFTOVERS!

Service was lacking slightly for what I would consider a classy looking restaurant, but no matter. We were pleased! My personal favorite was the curry that had some sort of cheese and veggie ball. It looked and had a similar consistency of a meatball. The sauce was a creamy pink color and spicy. I wish their website menu was up to date, it would make it easier to recall the dish names :("}
{"text":"Tried this place on a recent business trip to Cleveland with some colleagues.  I can say as an Indian food expert, this is one of the better Indian restaurants I have been to.  The staff was very attentive and checked on us quite frequently to ensure our drinks were always full and our food was to our liking.  Much to my surprise, one of people I was dining with had never had Indian food before and even he was impressed with the quality and taste of the dish he ordered.  I stuck to my usual Chicken Tikka Masala and was not disappointed in any way.  I will say as an out of towner, the location was easy to miss as it is not labeled very well and is inside an office building."}
{"text":"I went here for dinner, and while the food here was alright, the prices= ouch!  $3 for a single piece of naan!?  I guess I'm used to paying San Francisco and Arizona prices for Indian food, where Indian restaurants are plentiful so prices are lower because of competition.  On the upside, the atmosphere is nice, and the service was good.

Update:  I went here for the lunch buffet, and while there was a limited selection, the food was really good (Maybe they were having an off-day when I went here for dinner).  They even had freshly made dosa (made while you wait even), which earns a star in my opinon.  

Lunch buffet (with tax): $10.75
Included: naan, appetizer, 3 vegetable dishes + fresh dosa, 2 chicken dishes, salad and 2 desserts"}
{"text":"I give Saffron Patch a 3 1/2 stars, the atmosphere is nice and warm but a bit pricey.  The service is very professional but the portion is small.  We have group of five and celebrate one's birthday.  We order four Mango Lassa but they give us the fifth one for free.  We share the Assort Platter for appetizer. We like the vegetable Pokoda and Rashmi Kobob the best.  We order two Naan: Garlic and Onion, both are excellent for all the heavy sauce dinner plate:  Tandoor mixed grill, chicken masala, lamb korma and shrimp & Scallop jal farezi.  The tandoor grill is bit dry but the vegetable curry came with it is very good.  We like the sauce in the seafood dish and the Lamb korma.  The chicken masala is just OK.  They give us a coconut ice cream dessert with candle for the birthday girl is a nice touch.
The dinner portion is bit small and the food is pretty pricey.  Overall it is one of the better Indian food in Cleveland area."}
{"text":"I honestly just don't get the hype about this place. I didn't think that the food was anything special. The naan we got served was cold and the food was mediocre at best. I don't think I'd visit this place, but I'm left wondering if I just had a bad one time experience considering all the positive reviews other yelpers have left."}
{"text":"Lunch buffet is great, the ambience is great, good vegetarian selection.  I strongly recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"We went there with a lot of expectations and were disappointed. We went for buffet where I had things like chicken tandoori, something close to malai kofta, dal makhani these things were not good at all. Rest I managed to finish. I hope it was bad just for that particular day."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed my first trip to Saffron Patch!  I wish I had discovered it earlier because it is so close to home. I am not well versed on Indian food so I don't have many places to compare flavors and ambiance.

We tried the fried cheese for an app - can't go wrong there! We had a chick pea curry, black lentil special and a chicken masala. All were excellent - asked for medium spice - came out just spicey enough, but won't knock me down. 

I plan to return again (and again) soon. Maybe for the lunch buffet!"}
{"text":"Easily the best Indian around. Found it through Yelp and became a regular for eating in or taking out. It's easy to miss this place that's tucked in an office building, but I'm glad we found it!"}
{"text":"Hard to find, but worth the search. I was in Cleveland for training and a large group of us (I think twelve) decided on Indian food. Before the meal I asked the waitress the dreaded question: can we have separate checks? She said it was no problem and didn't even roll her eyes. 
Food was amazing and we pretty much ordered everything on the menu. I couldn't narrow down a dish, but all were amazing. I truly enjoyed the chicken dishes, chicken is easy to dry out, but they managed to serve a perfectly juicy chicken in each dish I had. 
Service was great too.I'm always impressed when a single server handles a large group and doesn't make a single mistake. I wish I remembered my servers name, but she was top notch.
I would definitely return."}
{"text":"Came here on a weekday for dinner with some co-workers. The place is definitely tricky to find if you didn't know it was under an office building.

We ordered some samosas and 3 main dishes - aloo gobhi, chicken tikka masala and mixed vegetables with a few naans (there were 3 of us so 1 entree dish per person is a good amount of food). Overall the food wasn't impressive and wasn't worth the money.

The good: the samosas were very good and came with a couple of chutneys. It was cooked really well and was pretty soft.

The bad: the main dishes were all below average and the vegetables seemed undercooked for the most part. The potatoes and cauliflower in the aloo gobhi were still somewhat hard - a pretty easy fix if they had actually cooked it long enough. The chicken was kind of dry and tough. 

Overall the food wasn't terrible but definitely not worth the price. I would probably not go back, and recommend Choolaah to my friends as an alternative, even though its fast food."}
{"text":"Service was mediocre. We had a private room or a larger party and sat without menus of any type for quite awhile. Food was good, but small portions. Some of out party asked for extra spicy and it wasn't done, so we had to have a spicy sauce made to be added I the dishes.  Due to the long wait for service, our waitress said appetizers were going to be free, but they were on our bills and we had to ask for them to be removed.
Parking is weird, you have to go through the business building.  Restrooms were locked when we went to use them, staff did not mention keys to them. 
This was my first time at this place, and I don't think I will ever return."}
{"text":"The Biriyani definitely needs work. It tastes more like pulao, than Biriyani. Everything else is excellent. My favorites are the Tandoori chicken (grilled chicken), Murg Malai tikka (Grilled chicken in a creamy sauce), Chicken madras (chicken curry from the south), Chicken tikka masala and the aloo gobi (potato-caulifower curry). Great food, friendly staff, and good service !"}
{"text":"An excellent place for Indian food.  The food is pretty good and you get decent portions.  The restaurant itself has a simple but pleasant ambiance.  The only negative is the service.  The service is slow and not always very good.  They even make fun of it themselves on their menus (eg. best things comes to those that wait, etc.)

It is a little hard to find as it's actually underneath a tall office building.  The best way to get to it is from Northfield Rd."}
{"text":"Saffron Patch is my FAVORITE Indian food joint in the area. I usually go to the Akron location. The vegetable korma is literally one of my favorite things on the planet Earth. I honestly have never tried anything else in the many, many, many times I've eaten here and ordered take-out because it is everything I want and more. Mmmmmm."}
{"text":"First time dining here, thanks to a great deal on Restaurant.com. Overall, really nice decor (trendy, hip, fancy but no muisic), our food was very good but our service wasn't. Overall value (even without the gift certificate) was good.

For about $50, we got an appetizer (recommended by the waitress), two entrees (Chicken Tikka Masala & Lamb Rogan Josh), a generous portion of Saffron Rice, 3 orders of Garlic Naan (get at least one per person, we got an adtl for the leftovers) and 2 Mango Lassi (sweet drink to balance out the spicy foods). Everything tasted great.

We ordered a spice level of 3 out of 5...we both like it medium spicy - mine was a bit too tame for my tastes, so I asked for the hot pepper paste on the side...a few dabs and I could dial in my desired heat.

Our food tasted fresh, well prepared and rich. But Cafe Tandoor (Aurora location) is tough to beat, and Cuisine of India (Parma Heights) isn't far behind.

My only real complaint was that our service was incredibly slow, and kitchen service seemed slow as well (even for Indian food)...had the waitress been back to check on us, refill our drinks, etc. the wait may not have seemed like anything at all.

That said, I would come back, possibly for the lunch buffet, and at ca. $15 a dinner entree, we could split a good meal, add some naan and lassi and still come out around $25! Not bad for a place that nice."}
{"text":"Was at Saffron Patch for dinner the other night and it was great as usual! I've been there many times but I brought some friends from out of town and they said it was the best Indian cuisine they've ever had. The food and service was awesome, I highly recommend Saffron Patch. Oh by the way you must try the Kheema Naan when you go."}
{"text":"Great food, a little on the expensive side, but worth it.  I can also recommend the lunch buffet, and I'm not really a buffet person.  The decor and atmosphere are nice, not so formal that you need to dress up just to eat, but formal enough to take people you want to impress, like maybe a rich out-of-town uncle or a local television celebrity."}
{"text":"Really good Indian food here!

Stopped in this week with several co-workers in search of some good Indian food...and we found it!  We were given a private room, which was awesome.

The food was served in sterno pans on a table, so the presentation wasn't great.  The selection was also minimal.  And I had no idea what they call this stuff.  However, the quality and taste of the food was excellent!

I do remember square chunks of tofu in a delicious orange-colored sauce.  The sauce was spicy and delicious and the tofu was rich and creamy.  This was the best tofu I've ever had.  Really, really tasty!

The spiced vegetables in sauce were also off-the-hook delicious.  I am sooo freaking glad I have found and befriended Indian food.  I can't believe I have been missing these amazing, unique, spicy flavors my whole life.

We went on lunch and the only negative point of the experience was the slow speed of the staff and the payment process.  We each had to go to the bar and pay.  We were not told that the tip was included, the guy just said 'twelve fifty'.  Then I tipped him too.  Then I found out the tip was already included.  Anyway, I didn't mind the double tip, I just didn't like not getting a receipt and having to walk to the dark bar to pay.

Good luck finding this place.  The only reason I found it is because I was with people who had been there before.  It's located in an unmarked tall building."}
{"text":"Poor food quality, bad taste, and also not a lot of variety. Below average restaurant. Also, the food was not warm enough in buffet. I won't recommend to any Indian. It's not at all an authentic Indian place."}
{"text":"The food was five-stars, but the atmosphere was three.

We started with the samosas, which were stuffed with delicious potatoes and other veggies, and served with two delectable dipping sauces. A great appetizer before a meatier entree.

I had the lamb korma and my dining partner had the chicken tikka masala. The korma sauce was great and the lamb, while tasty for the most part, did have some unwanted gristle attached. I usually prefer chicken korma, but since it wasn't on the menu I chose the next best thing. 

The tikka masala was great as well, and I'm happy to report it was very flavorful without being sweet. I've had over-sweet tikka masala sauce before, and it's disgusting.

The basmati rice and naan were welcome additions to the overall dining experience, and we closed with a pistachio ice cream. It was nice to eat something cold and creamy after the spice and heat from the dinner, but it wasn't the best dessert I've ever eaten.

This was my first time at Saffron Patch, and I'm already excited to return."}
{"text":"I think this place is a little over rated. if it weren't for the 10 dollar per person lunch buffet, I prob wont come here again, but $10 is dirt cheap for all you can eat, so ill give it a four star.

first of all, this place is REALLY HARD to find! you have to turn into an office building area then find the correct parking lot for the restaurants customers, since there are many other offices in the same area. then the restaurant parking lot is super small and all the spots were taken so we had to go to an abandoned garage, which is under construction, to park at a reserved spot. yes I did not like that but that was the only parking place I got to allow me to eat there. then you walk into the building, which is supposed to be the east tower, I don't know if there's a west tower or somehing, then you need to go downstairs to find the restaurant. very annoying..

the restaurant itself is pretty nice looking. however one of the waiters who seated us was not that enthusiastic about his job. there were probably 10 entrees for you to choose from, including vegeterian appetizers rice and naans. my favorite is chicken masala. the lamb was pretty good too but I personally don't like lambs flavor. their entrees are a bit on the spicy side, especially the vegetable entrees. they also have yogurt and salad for you. I would also highly recommend the two desserts they have. one is a kind of a rice cake thing and the other one is like rice soup or something. don't really know what they are called but they were pretty good. not too sweet. overall, I would come again if I want to eat a ton of Indian food without paying too much but I hope the parking situation will be better next time. it makes me worried about my car getting towed the entire time. :("}
{"text":"Best Indian buffet within the orbit of Mars. Really great quality food. All vegetarian (the buffet, that is--not the full menu) but great for anyone who loves Indian food. Best paneer I've had in a restaurant. Slightly pricier than some, and well worth it for the quality.

I have only 4 complaints:

1. No pickle in the buffet.

2. Buffet is only Monday night (but it's nice to have a dinner buffet, most Indian buffets are for lunch). Or is it Sunday now? They seem to be closed Mondays at the moment. (I have been told conflicting info on whether there is a lunch buffet or not--I'll have to call them for the latest buffet schedule.)

3. They won't split checks. Shouldn't that be standard practice? But they will divide one check among multiple cards, so it comes to the same thing... just not as conveniently.

4. I'm here typing this instead of at Saffron Patch feeding my face!

They're on the ground floor of the giant office tower. Park behind the tower and enter the restaurant from the main hall/lobby."}
{"text":"I have been visiting saffon patch for long time. Food was always okay, not that great, but neither awful. But recently they are more eager to host private party by closing the whole restaurant, than running the business. In last 6 months it happened with me twice, last on Sunday 15th April, 2018. Who wants to drive in, only to find out restaurant is closed for private party. I was so angry and dissatisfied, not going back."}
{"text":"GF loves Indian food.  She says that it's some of the best Vegetable Korma that she's ever had.  She loves this place."}
{"text":"I can't believe how great the food is here. Everything is so tasty and spicy and wonderful. It's probably the best Indian food I've had. The buffet is amazing. Everything is the perfect amount of heat and flavor. I would eat here every day if I could."}
{"text":"From all the reviews, I had some expectations for this place.  With the exception of it being a nice looking restaurant, none of these expectations were met.  

Granted I wasn't the driver, the place was slightly difficult to find.  We had a tandoori mixed grill and the lamb saag with some naan.  The tandoori is dry dry dry.  Not good at all.  The lamb saag was okay, but it didn't really have any lamb flavor so I might as well have ordered chicken saag.

If you want to eat subpar indian food at a nice restaurant, this is the place to be.  If you want great indian food, but can stand eating at a hole in the wall with subpar service, try Indian Flame."}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem. The food and service is always wonderful. It has a classy atmosphere that makes the dining experience a bit more upscale. They have been consistent over the years with the quality of their food. The only thing is that it is pricey for such small portions. They catered my sister's graduation party and I have been to weddings where they catered and they always come through. If you have not been, take the opportunity to treat yourself."}
{"text":"Excellent Indian food! I could drink the tikka masala sauce. Also love that they will make almost everything mild for someone like me who doesn't like spicy food."}
{"text":"This place is such a hidden gem. My husband and I have stopped in for the lunch buffet a few times and I've never left disappointed. Despite the odd exterior and it being tucked away inside of what seems to be an office building, the inside is actually very classy looking. White table cloths and modern-ish chairs take it up a notch.

Their food is bomb. I love their Chicken Curry and Vindaloo. The Naan was fresh and at the price, you really can't beat this lunch buffet. I often end up going back to work satisfied and ready for a nap. Service for the buffet is prompt, but we'll have to go back again for the regular menu to see how that goes. Love this place."}
{"text":"The best Indian food in the Cleveland area.  The food is excellent, the service is great and friendly and the prices are very reasonable.

I love it!"}
{"text":"I had a craving for Indian food (which I had for a while now, and wanted something a bit more substantial than Choolah, which is still YUMMY) so off to Saffron Patch we went.  My fiance, who is Middle Eastern does NOT like Indian food, because he grew up with it, but he indulged me.

It's a bit hard to find, but it's in the back of an office building on Chagrin.  Think Shuhei.  The inside is beautiful and modern and the servers are well dressed.

We ordered samosas, naan, paneer, garlic naan, chicken tikka (with masala sauce on the sauce) and lamb chops (we wanted to try everything).  I loved the samosas, both of the naans were to DIE for (especially dipped in the masala sauce) and the lamb chops were cooked perfectly.  The rice was so fluffy and there were pounds of it.  I did not care for the paneer - but I think I was expecting something more of a mozzerella stick texture, so that's on me.  

We had so many leftovers and will FOR sure be back, both for dinner and to try the buffet!"}
{"text":"I got their groupon (along with half the city), so it was my first time trying the place. I wasn't sure what to expect but the reviews and the online menu looked good.
Their weakest point is their location; they're on the bottom of an office building behind a BP gas station, so it's not so easy to find. Google maps aren't marking them right on the map either. 
the parking situation isn't the best either. It's mostly 1-hour visitors parking signs that only after we got in and asked we were told those are only restricted during offices business hours (so don't worry about parking there in the evening).
The inside and the food were good. The place was packed but still the service was pretty good considering that all the tables were taken and there was a line at the bar.
Their garlic naan and the dips that come with it is amazing!
The rest of the food was decent; I wouldn't say the best Indian food I ever had but not the worst either (I think I'm using another reviewer's words here, but he was spot on).
Overall, a good experience. And it's not like there's many other Indian cuisine choices in the area."}
{"text":"4 stars definitely because of the food. My table ordered two from the grill menu (lamb chops and shishkabob) and I got Chicken Makhani curry. While my curry was good, the lamb chops were amazing! Grill items are served on a sizzling platter and the smell just wafts through the restaurant. My curry was flavorful and deceptively small since served in a small bowl but I couldn't finish it. The garlic naan was amazing and was a giant portion (4 pieces) compared to a lot of places that only give one piece.

BUT-for a Saturday night, I could tell that they were way understaffed since the waiters also served as bartender, host, and busboy. I waited a good 10 minutes for anyone to show up to the hostess station and another good 15 minutes before anyone showed up to take drink orders. I didn't mind the wait but if I were any more hungry then this review could be a lot different.

Total bill was a little expensive, but not outrageous for a nice night out. I got a gift certificate from Restaurant.com which helped a lot, but it was also a lot of food."}
{"text":"Had the shrimp tikka appetizer, lamb chops for entree, mango lassi for drink.

Shrimp tikka was an incredible mix of spices, tasted better than anything I've had in the tomato sauce range for indian food. Lamb chops were just as impressive, very tender and properly done. Mango lassi was also excellent, not too thick, not too sweet, not too tangy.

Would definitely go back if I were in the area!"}
