{"text":"Worst poutine I ever had. I thought this place specialized in poutine...boy was I wrong.  Crappy fries and they use mozzarella!!!  Sad excuse for a poutine!"}
{"text":"Stumbled into this new 24hrs fast food joint. With the word Poutine in it's name, i must admit i got a bit too excited. i had been craving one for awhile, so when i saw this place i was like hells ya!!! so maybe it was my own fault, my expectations were set too high..  It was nothing special. Just OK... I only had a Poutine, so i cant talk about the rest of the menu. However i don't like spots that don't do substitutes, even for a extra charge.. that's just the way i roll .."}
{"text":"I simply do not understand how one can mess up a poutine. It's fries, sauce and cheese. How can you mess that up? I don't know ... but they did. It was bad guys, real bad."}
{"text":"Run away, even if you are holding scissors. Just run in the other direction. The pizza, gives pizza a bad name (though on the menu, the selection is interesting, but frozen would have been better.) The wings are so small that they are almost skin covering bones with no meat. And the poutine fries were greasy, the sauce was passable and the cheese was fine. Delivery was acceptable.... but why bother."}
{"text":"While the burger isn't larger enough to satisfy a hungry man, it does taste like a good homemade burger.  I haven't eat enough poutine in my life to be a critic of this. All I know, I wasn't a fan of poutine back in Calgary nor Vancouver. This poutine, I can see myself ordering again. The fries, cheese, gravy seemed to be well portioned and no salty after-taste that I remember not being a fan off.   There is a middle and/or high school across the street and it seems the owners/workers don't mind the students loitering. So if you come around after-school time (and I would imagine lunch hour), expect to have a fairly loud atmosphere with them joking around. It simply brought back memories of my days in Jr. High hanging out with the boys at the cornerstone.   Nothing gourmet about this place, just seems like a friendly neighbourhood food joint where the kids can hangout. I did see a number of delivery orders go out so it must be a popular order-in restaurant."}
{"text":"Got introduced to this place by my friends in Montreal that live right around the corner.  The only 24-hour place I knew of before this was La Banquiste, which is THE poutinerie to go to. So, this place had to measure up.  I'd say for a quick fix, this place hits the spot.  I had the meat lovers poutine and it was delicious and just what I needed after a 6 hour drive and 6 beers. The ambiance is quiet and small, but the hipster presence was overwhelming and I just was very uncomfortable for some reason.  When every guy and girl is wearing a bowler hat and skinny jeans and look like they just got out of the hot tub time machine...something is wrong. My friend informed me that Montreal had turned into the Hipster Hub of North America, and I did not doubt that after my night there.    Anyway, the man behind the cash register was very pleasant to deal with and made the experience more comfortable and enjoyable and we joked around with him. The poutine was pretty good, and I definitely would try it again when I am more sober, but for a 24-hour spot on a party street, it definitely hits the spot, especially since they take credit cards, and La Banquiste only accepts cash - making driving the 5 minutes there much more dreadful."}
{"text":"Basically we came here after Patati Patata was too busy/crowded and we were starving. My friend (a local) had said that she had been here before, and the staff was rude but the food was ok, so we decided to give it a chance. T  he \"pizza\" that was in the display counter looked inedible, I'm not sure why anyone would ever eat that and the girl at the cash register looked beyond bored and as if we were bothering her by ordering. She rolled her eyes more than once at me, and I dont think she said a single word to me except for when she told me the price.   The food was...edible, I had a gyro and thats pretty hard to screw up anyway, my friends had poutine and cheeseburgers. The poutine was greasy and soupy, they didnt like it.  There just isnt anyting here to like.."}
{"text":"I think this place is also called RUNA on just eat. Because when we order from them, they give us a pamphlet that says poutine en folie. They are opened 24/7 on just eat and deliver with min 15$ which isn't bad. It is free delivery. The only thing I would order again from  here is the cheese burger and the all dressed hot dogs. I wouldn't order anything else as I have tried most things on the menu and ended up tossing them out"}
