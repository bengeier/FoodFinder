{"text":"This place is an old hidden gem right off of route 50. (washington pike) it's been around for a long time. They will make you sandwiches, or you could just buy lunch meat and potato salad, Macaroni salad, etc. They have boars head lunch meat, which is in my opinion about the best quality lunch meat out there. They also make fresh bread and buns. My favorite part of this place is all of the many delicious choices of desserts. Also have local honey, apple butter, etc. Overall this place is great and I'm planning on stopping there again real soon."}

{"text":"Great family owned deli. Pie. Sandwich shop. The old country store. Super fresh sandwiches with a daily special.  Wednesday is Reuben day and they look delicious.  Salads are fresh and flavorful. Meats are Boars Head. Bread is fresh daily I think Mancini's  People are the key. Super friendly staff. That bend over to help in anyway.  Had the potato soup.  Very nice and hot with great flavor. Roast beef on white roll havarti with horseradish sauce.  All the meats are cut fresh for each and every sandwich."}
{"text":"I highly recommend portman's farm market.They carry boar's head lunchmeat,which is a little more expensive than typical lunchmeat,but,well worth it because it does not go bad as quickly and is far better tasting.They also carry some fruits,vegetables and home aid canned stuff like jams,preserves,jelly,pickles ect.ect. They also have a lunches served there daily with a special for the day for lunches.You will not be sorry.I guarantee it!!!!"}
{"text":"Consistently great !!!  If you like Subway this place isn't for you.  Now also offer Mancini Bread ..... Added bonus.  Daily hot sandwich always a nice option. Friendly staff that keeps things moving.  Try the Chicken Salad and Ham Salad when available"}
{"text":"Portman Farms has got to be one of the best places to grab a lunch around! The sandwiches are great, no doubt, but the real secret is the fresh baked cookies and pies being made right in front of your eyes.   You think you're going to stop in for a quick turkey sandwich, or maybe for a grinder (delicious btw) and bam! You are hit with the smell of chocolate chip cookies fresh out of the oven. That's just not fair. Anyways, anytime I stop by for a quick sandwich I end up walking out with pie and a dozen chocolate chip cookies. My wallet can't take this place.  Seriously, if you haven't tried this place then do yourself a favor and head over during lunch. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"What can't I say about portmans?? From the nostalgic look of the barn when you pull up to the fresh farmhouse smell of baked cookies and pies from the oven when you walk in, everything is just amazing! The sandwiches that are made uses boars head meat and is sliced right in front of you and if you want some for later they can do that as well. They have daily sandwich specials but my favorites are ham salad weekends (keep an eye out for these) and Reuben Wednesday's! The tasty and hearty portions won't leave you hungry in the end and 3/4 of the time I have leftovers for the next day!  Don't get me started on their pies and cookies! And the homemade chocolates and other goodies that pop up occasionally are just amazing! Everyone is always chipper inside and it's just an all around grand place!"}
{"text":"I was a little annoyed because I could not find a Subway in the area and someone suggested I try this place. I am so happy I did. I have eaten here several times and it is simply excellent. The variety, the specials, the taste all are far better than the chain sub stores.   The atmosphere here alone is worth a visit, from the old ovens to the wooden tables out front. The people are great and the food and service are excellent."}
{"text":"Great sandwiches for lunch between 11 and 1 with a different sandwich daily.   This place gets crowded during peak hours, so try to time it right. You can eat your sandwich there, on their enclosed from porch or get it to go. This place also makes the finest pies in the known universe. Try one sometime, you'll be glad you did."}
{"text":"Yum!  Great sandwiches, wonderful baked goods, a charming setting and cheap! What's not to like ?!"}
{"text":"Nice deli sandwiches.  Have been stopping by a few times this summer and you can't go wrong.  Great sandwiches with Boars Head meat and cheese and Mancini bread.  You can pick up some fresh made pies and deserts.  It can get a little crowded and only about six tables for 2 in the entrance area, but at this time of year I get take out and find a nice spot outside.  You can make your own or order some that are listed and named after some customers."}
