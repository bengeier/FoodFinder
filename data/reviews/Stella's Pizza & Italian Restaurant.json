{"text":"I have been to Stellas a few times and went in thinking it was an Italian Place that served drinks.  In actuality, it's a beer joint that serves bar food.  The pizza is just average and was too sweet for me.  Tacos were much better, but nothing to return for.  If you are looking for a place to meet friends for drinks, this is a decent place.  One complaint is too many people are too close to the door smoking.  The smell lingers too much into the restaurant/bar."}
{"text":"Horrible experience.  Terrible food, dirty dining room, unkept looking wait staff (like wearing sweatpants).  Our salads were served after our entrees came.  It was a spur of the moment idea to go there so we didn't look them up first.  Big mistake!"}
{"text":"After several bad experiences there resulting in food poisoning, I've avoided returning."}
{"text":"I ended up with food poisoning after eating there last Saturday night.  I think it was their Wisconsin Cheese Soup.  Service and food are lackluster and atmosphere is poor.  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Stay far far away.    First impressions of this place and we didn't check Yelp before visiting with the low ratings and disappointed reviews.   We should have went to the Mexican or Chinese restaurant in the same plaza."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if this place is just severely understaffed, if the staff are just pissed off at their boss, or just completely miserable about life. The service was so bad, it doesn't matter if the food was good or not.  Me, my brother, and my parents walk in, and we immediately don't know weather to wait to be seated or to seat ourselves. No sign, no hostess. A server proceeds to walk right past us without saying anything, not even a \"hello\", or \"someone will be right with you.\" Hell, not even a smile.  We decide to seat ourselves, at a booth that had 2 menus for 4 people. Servers keep walking past us for a good 10 minutes, without offering more menus or taking a drink order. Finally, when they did come to our table, they just say \"You ready to order?\" We all had to order beers and our food at the same time, the server not writing anything down. My dad had ordered a Dortmunder Gold, and the server said \"We were out of that yesterday, not sure if we're still out of it.\" My dad said, bring me a Yuengling if you're out of it.  So, our beers were all put on the side of the table by the bartender from the adjoining lounge, without saying which was which or if they indeed ran out of Dortmunder or not. One of the glasses was cracked and leaking slightly.  Now, on the menu, it does say please expect to wait 25-30 minutes for a pizza order. We each got a personal pizza or a calzone. Took 45 minutes to come. We also had to tell the server to please get rid of the appetizer plates. During all this, there was a table in the middle of the restaurant with a bunch of food and garbage all over the floor that servers walked past 50 times. If they keep the sitting area like that, what must the kitchen look like?  The food was ok. Not bad, but nothing special. Could have been from any average take-out pizza shop. Extremely disappointing and will never eat here again. I would have been much happier going to the Wendy's nearby, especially since we were supposed to run some errands that night and they were cut short because this place took so long."}
{"text":"Let me start this review off by saying that, before this day, as a server you'd have to be downright mean in an evil-not-a-nice-bone-in-your-body way to get a poor tip from me.  Even with poor service or service delays I have traditionally extended much grace and over-tip.  OK, preface over.  I purchased a phenomenal coupon deal for this place at restaurant.com ($2 for a $25 gift certificate!!).  Sounds too good to be true, eh?  It was.  That old cliche haunted me during my group's entire experience here.    Our party of 8 arrived to Stella's at a staggered pace; starting from about 5:15pm until 6pm Saturday to celebrate a birthday.  The place was busy but there wasn't any wait to be seated.  (And by busy I mean that most of the ~20 tables this place holds had guests occupying them).  There were three servers working.  Our server didn't come to our table once to greet us as new guests arrived.  She waited until after everyone was there to take our first drink order. (45 minutes).  Once our drink order was placed it took another 15 minutes to receive them (mostly waters).  We placed our food order and hoped for better service to come.    Next, MOST of our soups and salads were delivered to the table - the salad is just a bunch of boring iceberg lettuce and a tomato (bleh).  For the missing soups and salads it took several minutes to unsuccessfully hunt down our server - finally stopping another staff member, and by the time our remaining salads and soups arrived our first dinner plate was arriving.  Alone.   Ten minutes later our second and third guest received their food.  Ten minutes (even) later our fourth, fifth and sixth guest received theirs.  A full ten minutes later our seventh guest received their food.  Last on the list to receive their food was the birthday boy himself.   Good company was the only thing that saved this evening from being a complete waste of good time and money (Even after our gift certificates were used we still spent over $100).    Nuf said.  I called the owner who listened to my complaint quietly before offering an apology and a $15 credit to be used in the restaurant at a future date - I don't know if it's worth the drive."}
{"text":"It was dead. Growing up it was always packed. No one was in there expect us. I still love their calzone, sauce was very good, but the service was slow and we were the only customers. It was kind of a sad environment, I have very fond memories of Stella's growing up... let down."}
{"text":"I'm being generous by giving them one star! The place was empty so we assumed we would get top notch service. Our server took a break while serving us and proceeded to smoke a cigarette right outside the window. She came in after we had to go over to the window and ask for some water. She apologized and said it was her \"only break all night\". Seriously??? There wasn't a single person in there. She then proceeded to get our water and box our pizza WITHOUT washing her hands!! So disgusting and so unprofessional. I used to go to this place every Friday as a kid. Very sad to see what has become of it. We will not be returning!"}
{"text":"The pizza is not good at all. Salad was not that good either. Tried it once with the wife and we won't come back. Nothing jumped out that warrants us wanting to come back."}
{"text":"Stella's is one of those places where you think it could be awesome because it seems family owned, quaint, and according to restaurant.com you should be getting a good deal. . .wrong.  The pizza is average, after having Danny Boys and Frankie's, this pizza just doesn't cut it for me. Maybe that's why I was able to get a $25 gift certificate on restaurant.com for for only $3.   Needless to say, Stella, you did not win my fine Italian heart over."}
{"text":"Food is average..pizza's also average...slow service though so not a great place for kids and they have the strangest tasting iced tea I've ever had."}
{"text":"My boyfriend took me to there after raving about their potato skins.  When he went with friends two years ago, Stella's had a plateful of 8 potato skins that overflowed with cheese and bacon.  We finally got to the area and decided to go in for lunch.  There was only one waitress working the tables and no direction as to when and where to sit.  We grabbed a booth that was still dirty as all seemed to be and waited several minutes to order our water and potato skins.  We waited and waited...about 50 mins later, 2.5 potatoes showed up cut horizontally with a minimal amount of cheese and some bacon.  They were tasty but served with 1 tablespoon of sour cream and we never saw our waitress again until the check came.  It was a waste of time and $10."}
{"text":"Disappointing. The Italian Dunkers at high school were better.  I went with a couple friends on a Tuesday night. We ordered jalapeno poppers with cream cheese, garlic bread with cheese, sausage and pineapple pizza, and veggie pizza. Not a lot of flavor, just a lot of cheese. The service was slow."}
{"text":"Not the place to go if you're looking for Italian.  More like the place you go when you are looking for I-talian.  And they make some darn good I-talian.  The sauce is light, sweet and chunky.  It's closer to a summer tomato sauce than a long-stewed Sicilain \"gravy\".  It is served atop collosal -- bigger than your head mountains of thick spaghetti.  Having grown up in a Sicilain neighborhood, I appreciate the deeply rich and complicated sauce more.  Their sauce does work really well in their subs and lasagne, though.  Don't order the salad.  It is just a pile of iceberg and packaged croutons and it smells like water from old pipes in the middle of summer-- sort of algae-ish.  Opt instead for the really tasty soups-- cheddar, onion and a special of the day.  I had the eggplant parm.  The thin slices of eggplant were lightly bredded and expertly fried, but covered in mozzerella instead of parmesan.  Still good.  The lasagne is pure, unadulterated comfort food.  Uncomplicated and lovely.  The standout at Stella's is their meatballs.  Meatballery is a lost art-- people use too lean a meat, use those awful meatball mixtures, add too much binder, add too little, forget to brown them before adding them to the sauce, add scads of unreconsituted dried oregano.  All these things ruin the meatball experience.  Stella's meatballs are perfect-- obscenely juicy, flavorful, firm but tender.  Perfect!  I haven't had their pizza, but my neighbor swears by it.  He swears a lot, though."}
{"text":"If you like your iced tea with a hint of Italian dressing this is the place for you.   Also, my server was polite but the cook kept walking through the empty dining room. One time he gave me a funny look and said \"Your food will be ready in a few minutes pal.\" I don't know if he was just pissed because they weren't busy or what but I didn't get a very friendly vibe.  I ordered the cheese ravioli which came with a meatball. The dinner came with either a soup or a salad. I ordered the salad. Although, the salad was just boring iceberg lettuce and tomatoes it did taste fresh. The ravioli wasn't bad and they baked it so it was kind of like a casserole, which I like, and the meatball was quite tasty.   Unfortunately, I might not visit again because of the strange tasting iced tea and the rude chef."}
