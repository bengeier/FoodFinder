{"text":"Amazing and authentic food  I ordered the legua and the cabeza tacos mt husband ordered the carnitas they were both spot on. Beats the run of the mill Mexican place ant dayvof the week. Don't let the apperiance scared you away do speak English and are very friendly and nice.  Definitely worth the stop to try."}
{"text":"Favorite taco truck in Charlotte , can't say enough great things ...hit the spot every time and their meats and marinades are always super flavorful and juicy ..avocado on the tacos is a super nice touch and the hot sauce is perfect ...the azada and pastor are my top 2..."}
{"text":"Don't let appearances get in the way with good food foodies. This small food truck has some eyebrow raising taste. All the food is cooked to order fast food junkies move on. Service was fast and polite even after the wife asked a million questions, menu is in Spanish. 

If you are on that side of town check it out. Reward yourself with something fresh and authentic. FYI they only take cash but most platters under 7 Beans.

{"text":"Great tacos... Pretty wide variety of meats as well.  We really like the Barbacoa, carnival, and campechanos.  For sure worth checking out... Really good prices as well"}
{"text":"Hands down the best authentic Mexican food in town.  I ordered the steak tacos with cilantro and onion.  I was given the choice of spicy or mild salsa.  The spicy salsa was very spicy and great for a gringo like me who always complains about food not being spicy enough.  I highly recommend this taco truck and look forward to going there later tonight."}
{"text":"This place was my first taco food truck experience and after 8 yrs or so, It's still my favorite Saturday afternoon pitstop.    Basic, but gooooood!   A mist for all people who pass this little red trailer on 215 in Huntersville!"}
{"text":"Huge mistake when I realized I lived with in walking distance of this truck. The tacos are great and $2 each, everyday. The peeps in the truck were very sweet and even let me pretend like I knew Spanish. I'm stuck on the tacos so I haven't tried anything else but the carnitas are fantastic."}
{"text":"Driving past on my way home when my lovely bride tells me that she doesn't feel so pretty good and asks if I can pick up something for dinner so I go around the block and pull in here.
There's some guys finishing up at the table and a couple others picking up and a couple people with a literature cart so I'm feeling comfortable here. I ask for two each steak and chicken tacos and pick up a little something to read while I wait. A couple minutes later my food is ready and I'm getting some blazing-hot-sauce and heading to the little white truck to get out of the blowy cold.
Tacos are lightly seasoned and topped with pico and avacado, onions and lime on the side. Chicken is cooked through but still soft and moist. Same for the steak but with some crispy edges. Grilled onions and lime squeezings make for a fine dinner. Yay! I'm a fan!"}
{"text":"This is a food truck worth trying for lunch.  They have a $7 lunch special, including three mini tacos with rice and beans.  They don't offer fish tacos, but their carnitas tacos are really good.  They offer hot (red) or mild (green) salsa.  I had both, and mixed them for a great spicy addition.  

I'll definitely be back!"}
