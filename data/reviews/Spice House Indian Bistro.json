{"text":"I have been to this restaurant twice. The first time was medicore. While the food was good, the vast majority of it was at room temperature, at best. I find one of the biggest downfalls of this restaurant is their lack of preparedness for customers. We ate dinner there at 7:30pm during a weekday and the food was not hot. We suspect that this was because there were very few people in the restaurant and they wanted to save electricity by turning down the heat of the buffet? No idea, but that was unfortunate especially considering it was peak hours for dinner. Another downfall was cleanliness. Not only did we have to ask numerous times for a clean glass of water (because the glasses all looked like they had been rinsed with water and not washed with soap), but the washrooms were gross. The washrooms at this restaurant need a total gut job and renovation.  Nevertheless, I wanted quick and cheap lunch last weekend and was nearby. I had an even worse experience. Arriving an hour after lunch hours had started, I was shocked to see that most of the dishes had not even been cooked and grew suspicious that the few items out were leftovers from the night before. Despite trying to avoid drinking too much water so I wouldn't have to use their washrooms, I had to go only to find that there was no toilet paper. Moreover, they were out of ice cream and had a virtually non-existent dessert selection.   It's official. I am done with this restaurant and will never return. This place is cheap, but it lacks the professional touches needed for sustained success. I guess you really do get what you pay for."}
{"text":"Recently there was a GroupOn for Spice House so I decided to come here for dinner. The restaurant is spacious and had many different varieties of curry (both meat/vegetarian) as well as salads, naan, rice and ice cream at their buffet tables. I thought that the service was good since the staff was attentive  and accommodating.   Since it was a buffet, I decided to try the different meat curries that they had to offer. I enjoyed the lamb curry and the masala chicken since it had the right amount of spice to it and wasn't too extreme in terms of flavor. I really liked the tandoori chicken but I guess you can't go wrong with it.  Nothing to report in terms of the dessert since it was just plain ice cream.   Overall, I thought the place was decent. My friend who loves Indian food enjoyed his time here. I would say their GroupOn was really good in terms of how much you paid for the meal."}
{"text":"You get what you pay for.  Went in for a weekday lunch takeout. Place itself looked clean, although completely empty. For a buffet offering, there was only 1 meat option, a couple vegetables, and a varying degree of sauces.  None of it looked fresh. None of it tasted fresh. One of the tiny pieces of chicken was still bloody, the chana masala was old and reheated, and the quantity offered in the takeout meal was like a snack.  Never going back."}
{"text":"We went on Sunday afternoon for lunch around 1:30 w/ a groupon.  We read the reviews before going but figured we'd try it out anyway. Food was room temperature, not freshly hot. The mint chutney was spoiled and rice & peas smelled funny. We walked out within a minute of sitting for our meal.  Cleanliness is a 2 star at best.   I would not return."}
{"text":"This place is retarded!!!  Called on a thursday, confirmed that the price of the buffet today dinner is $8.99, Weekend is $10.99.  Headed out...  When we arrived, there was couple of dudes sitting at the bar and told us, they are closed today and is only open on Fri/Sat/Sun.  WTF....???  Sunday comes around, thought we'd give this place another try.  Headed out...  Arrived, the doors were locked and nobody was inside...WTF???"}
{"text":"Spice House Indian Bistro was one of the most unsatisfying dine-in experiences in my life.  I went to this restaurant because I had a Groupon - 2 buffet dinners for the price of 1. It seemed like a pretty standard deal. I ended up (like most people) going right before the expiration date. And what a struggle that was.  First off, it was almost impossible to get a reservation. When I called to book a reservation, the owner asked if I had a Groupon. I said yes, and then he said there was no more room and hung up on me. I called again later to try to book a reservation. Same thing, he asked if I had a Groupon. This time I was dishonest and said no because I really didn't want to waste this Groupon. And without hesitation, the owner said alright you have a reservation for 7pm. Not off to a good start, but hey, I'm not too much of a stickler for customer service. As long as the food is good, that's fine by me.   So 7pm rolled around, and I arrived at a full restaurant with an open mind. I grabbed a plate and went up to the buffet table. And oh would you look at that, there was almost no food out in the buffet trays. The staple curry chicken dish was empty and never refilled. People stood around the buffet table waiting for scraps of food to come out from the kitchen. I ended up paying $6 for chickpeas, rice, naan and a single samosa that I'm pretty sure I could find in the frozen aisle of a grocery store. Oh and some old mango ice cream for dessert.   This was by far the worst buffet I've ever been to.   For a buffet, I don't expect 5 star restaurant quality. What I do expect is to be able to gorge on food until I feel like my stomach will explode, if I so desired. 50% empty buffet trays...completely unacceptable.  To be fair, I believe it was unusually busy due to the Groupon. But as a business, they should have been prepared for the sudden influx of customers during the very beginning and the very end of the valid groupon time. This was their chance to really leave people with a fantastic lasting impression so that they would spread the word, and they blew it.   If I ever see a deal for Spice House Indian Bistro again on Groupon, even if it was for $1, I would definitely steer clear of it."}
{"text":"Can't beat this place for good value. Friendly family-run business. Brought my wife and two girls with me this time. I look forward to next time."}
{"text":"Went again. Generally the same welcome. The glass doors were filthy as was most of the glass exposed to the parking lot. We took a close look at the food, which was very skimpy and most sauces had a 'skin'. There were no dinners just the 2 same gentlemen (?) who appear to run the joint. It was not pretty or clean. Not a place where we wanted to play ptomaine roulette. We asked if this was a new restaurant and they said yes.....We nodded and left."}
{"text":"Bought a Groupon to try this place. When we got there, it was closed. Looked really dirty from the outside. We ended up going to India's Taste a block away. The food was delicious there.   Will be getting a refund on my Groupon."}
{"text":"We went to this restaurant because we had a GroupOn....big mistake!  Food was very disappointing and tasteless.  Butter chicken sauce was flavorless and the pieces of chicken in it were hard.  The saag panner also had very little flavor.  Most of the dishes were cold and when we complained to the waitress she told us to 'dig' into the bottom of the dish and that we must have taken food from the top...hmmm go figure?  Overall I got the sense that the food was not fresh and had been sitting there all day.  There were no patrons in the restaurant and that should have been a sign to us that the place was sub-par.    I can't see this restaurant staying in business for long....  In the city of Toronto there are far better choices for Indian restaurants...so save yourself the trouble and go eat somewhere else."}
