{"text":"Pretty good, except for the black hair in my rice and the sole waitress/cashier  on the dinner shift who looked like she was annoyed that we were ordering something. It was about 7 p.m. Too bad."}
{"text":"First, my fajitas came out long before any other food. The chicken in the fajitas was sauteed, not grilled or even marinated. Normally, fajitas come with a few tortillas and a separate dish with a selection of goodies that may include cheese and salsa or guacamole. But none arrived. And then the skillet started cooling. I thought they'd bring over tortillas and fixings fairly soon, not to mention my wife's food. No dice. By this time, I was already picking at the flavorless chicken. After a while, my wife's quesadilla arrived, and the waitress finally brought me a plate.  I tried explaining to the waitress that my dish was missing tortillas, and she emerged a few minutes later with fresh corn tortillas. But no other fixings. I asked the waitress if the dish came with cheese, so she brought me a salsa bowl filled with freshly grated cheese. There was a small language barrier, so I didn't try to bargain for any more \"fixings\". Unless I was confused about how to serve fajitas, it was apparent that neither the cook nor the wait staff were well acquainted with them. Oh well. Probably will not return. My wife's quesadilla was ok."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for this authentic Mexican restaurant in Madison, but here's the reality of my dining experience:

We ordered three assorted tacos, a chicken gordita, a pastor quesadilla and cheese quesadillas. 

1. There were flies everywhere, lots of them
2. The dining area floor was dirty, tables were filthy and sticky
3. The help-yourself salsa bar is a great idea, but the salsas were not fresh.
4. Waitstaff was friendly but slow - and we were the only patrons for the dinner hour!
5. This was the greasiest Mexican food I've ever had in my life.
6. The food was nothing special.

My search for amazing Mexican food in Madison continues..."}
{"text":"Authentic. Not as well seasoned as I like.  Slowish but pleasant service."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch. I would NEVER go back. We felt completely like we were a nuisance to the one waitress working. Mind you we were the only ones in the restaurant. It took 15 minutes to get her attention that we were ready to order. 

The chips (though free) were stale and too thick. The burrito (though large) was doughy and the fillings were not high quality. Very disappointing experience."}
{"text":"Not a glamourous place, but friendly.  The draw here is the best Mexican food in the Midwest, and a homemade salsa bar that is awesome, as long as you like spicy.  It is also a tremendous value.  And they are kind to vegetarians.  I would go five stars if they had a better margarita and offered a few more appetizers - still hoping someone re-creates Las Caszuelos' cheese dip with poblanos and mushrooms..."}
{"text":"Okay so where do I begin.  It was sooooo gross that I have a hard time looking at lettuce any more.  They didn't drain it it leeked into my rice, beans and Enchiladas.. I had to use a napkin to to drain the water becuase i did not dare send it back.  Now the Enchiladas couldn't even called enchiladas.  They had no enchilada sauce and they were greasy... the flautas someone else had were just harden greasy tortilla. NOTHING had flavor.  Ugh I will never go back."}
{"text":"I loved it!  but maybe it was because the salsa bar was such a huge hit with me.  Though, when I did ask a question about a specific salsa, the waitress couldnt help me answer....confusion/language barrier, whichever.  

I went in Dec. 2011. Service was okay...food- I have no complaints.  Id definitely go again."}
{"text":"In the same locations as the old Guanajuato, but with new management. Great food,  attentive service and excellent prices.  Interesting variety on the menu and great salsa bar.  What more could you ask? Authentic Mexican food, well prepared. I had the carnitas (a pork stew) with salsa verde, one of the evening's specials, for $8.00. Came with rice and beans.  More food than I could possibly eat and delicious.  I  took half home with me.  Drinks are also  very reasonable. Mexican sodas in the bottle are $2 and Mexican beers are $3.50. I will be back soon and bring people with me.  Even if it is on the other side of town for you, it is well worth a drive."}
{"text":"Still a fave place in Madison for authenticity. the salsa bar is awesome- (disregard the review that says the salsas all taste the same, as that is just not true. the avocado one is fantastic, as is the chipotle and the salsa verde.)
Always check out the weekend specials. the posole I had was filled with big chucks of pork and hominy and was deeeelish. One Sunday I had the green chile stew/soup which made me happy for days. I can almost look forward to winter and getting this again.
The fajitas are regularly excellent, with lots of stuff piled on the cast-iron skillet brought to the table.

They REALLY need to start making the lime margaritas with real lime juice and sugar. A mix just does not taste good.
The strawberry one I had was pretty good, maybe made with frozen berries blended.

Viva Mexico!!"}
{"text":"I gotta say that it's hard to find authentic Mexican food in Madison, or in midwest in general. Most ethnic restaurants here are forced to adapt to American liking, i.e. salty meat, over-powering sauce, smothering amount of cheese, etc.

If you like how food is served in Mexico, try this place. Marinating meat is not a common practice--not to mention the non-existence of Burritos!  (that's totally a western thing! although they do have it on the menu.) Not only that they are generous with quality ingredients, they are not stingy about giving you more rice if you ask for it. The atmosphere is pretty chill. For meals at the price of street food stand, this is as good as it can ever be. So stop complaining about the casual atmosphere and learn to appreciate how other culture run their restaurants.

Their salsa bar had incredible selection of salsa with good punch of spiciness. (not the lame toned-down mild salsa typical for midwest appetite) The flavors are incredible.

FYI: We had lengua en salsa verde and bistec mexicana."}
{"text":"It pains me to say this,  but La Guanajuatence is CLOSED. Best tacos and Mexican in all of Madison, by far--but they're closed. A very, very sad day for Mad Town."}
{"text":"I've only had their tacos here, but it's delicious.  It's much better than the other taco places in town that people rave about, i.e. Taqueria Guadalajara.  I haven't tried El Pastor yet but I'm not sure I need to anymore.  

Their tacos have a variety of meats such as asada (steak), lengua (tongue), chicharron (pork skin), tripa (intestines), pastor (pork), chorizo, and pollo.  I'm a fan of carne asada tacos and so I order that each time I go.  Their carne asada is well flavored, not dry, and served on top of corn tortillas and topped with cilantro and onions.  It's delicious.  I also enjoy the lengua and chorizo tacos.  The lengua is slightly more tender than the steak taco.  The pastor is also good.  It's slow cooked with pineapples for a bit of sweetness.  I'm not a fan of pineapples in my taco so I usually pass on the pastor though I still enjoy it from time to time.  The tacos are also incredibly affordable given the amount of food.   

Their salsa bar is extensive with 6 different salsas.  They have the standard salsa verde, but also a jalapeno avocado one, one that's got a pronounced smoky flavor.  It's fun just to try the salsas, and I like that they don't skimp on the spice.  

Their chips are also delicious, freshly fried and salted.  

This place serves up delicious tacos that satisfy my cravings.  I don't care what their burritos or quesadillas or whatever else they have on the menu may taste like.  I will come here just for the tacos."}
{"text":"Wasn't hungry when I went so I ordered the cheapest thing. i forgot what it was called (carne something) but it was a sandwich. it was really good and very good portion. definitely want to go back.
there is a salsa bar with every flavor imaginable.
decor is sweet. lots of colorful quilts and pictures of mexican superheroes."}
{"text":"Move over, former favorite Mexican restaurants... there's a new restaurant on top!  While I cannot pronounce the name and therefore struggle to convince friends and family to try it, this is hands down the best Mexican food in Madison.  The salsa bar is great, as previous reviewers noted.  The kids menu (albeit written on a board) is really generous - $3.50 for nice helpings of rice and beans, and a gordita, taco, or quesadilla. My husband and I each had taco dinners (rice and beans and three tacos), and they were great.  Not your run-of-the-mill meats and flavors, but meat choices the included pork rinds, tripe, etc., as well as the traditional chicken and beef. 

The staff was very friendly.  One lady even struck up a conversation with my 5 year old, and showed him all kinds of pictures of ruins, etc., and gave him a calendar he's thrilled with.  So we not only had some awesome, reasonably-price Mexican food, but my son got a little history lesson and is phyched to learn more.  We will definitely return."}
{"text":"Meh--if you want to go to a taqueria, go to Guadeljara on Park St.

Went there for dinner--not too busy. Free chips with an interesting salsa bar where you could choose your own salsas along with some interesting choices like a tomate de arbol salsa.

The food was good but not great. My companion ate the enchiladas and I got 2 tacos and a gordita. I'd rate the gordita as the best of the bunch.  Nice thick tortilla, stuffed with fresh cheese, meats, sour cream, and lettuce, etc.  But overall I just felt like the other foods were \"ok\". The flavors at Guanajuato are much fresher."}
{"text":"Stopped in last night to grab some carryout and as it was my first time, I didn't know what to expect.  Not only did the food exceed my expectations but this might now be my \"go-to\" spot for Madison Taqueria fare (El Pastor is my favorite).  The restaurant itself is well decorated, clean, and has a welcoming waitstaff.  The menu was extensive but I focused in on the tacos.  I tried the carnitas (special for the day), barbacoa (also a special) and the pastor.  Top with onion and cilantro and stuffed generously with meat, they were all excellent.  The pastor was some of the best I tried.  Not only was the food excellent and reasonable, they have an incredible salsa bar.  With no signs telling me what each was, I sampled 4.  They were outstanding-one with a creamy avocado base, another that definitely had chipotle peppers, and another that was almost straight guajillo peppers (and among the spiciest).

I definitely recommend this restaurant and I will absolutely be back."}
{"text":"Delicious and authentic and non-gringofied and strange meats and salsa bar and limited English and slightly divey and oh-my-god good.

My partner and I were getting ready at the warehouse before work the other day and someone walked by saying they didn't want to work that day, they just wanted to go home and eat tacos.

You know you've been working with someone for too long when you look at each other and instantaneously say \"Tacos!\".

After that it was just a matter or where tacos would be had.  It just so happens that around lunchtime we get off the Beltline in Madison and *BOOM*.  LA Guanajuatence.

We went in and were encouraged by the wobbly formica tables and the dingy lights and the complete lack of interest of our waitress in the finer points of the English language.  

We were given chips immediately and it took us a minute to figure out why we weren't given any salsa.  We looked around confused and ate some dry chips and were about to ask someone and Oh they have an entire bar full of a dozen different salsas we can try.  This makes so much sense that it's gone all the way back to stupid.  I tried almost all of them.  I can't recommend one in particular because my grasp of Spanish is about as good as theirs of English, but the creamy avacado not-quite-guacamole is just phenomenal.  I mean, really good.

I had a three pack of tacos.  One al-pastor, one lengua, and one machaca.  I've never even heard of machaca and had to google it after I ate it, but apparently it's beef that's marinated, shredded, and then dried.  Holy cow you have no idea.  One of my new favorite things in history.  I can't recommend it enough.  You need to try it.

Everything was great.  Service was awesome despite the language barrier.

I will go here again without reservation."}
{"text":"I went to this place due to some elite yelpers giving it very high marks.  Here is my take:  
The food: 4 Stars.  Very Authentic Mexican Cuisine. So before you go there realize you are not going to get a taco with cheese in it.  The portions are not going to be overflowing your plate.  There isn't going to be a hundred different combo's to choose from.  The Menu is one piece of paper.  That said, I really enjoyed the salsa bar and the authenticity of the food.  
The Service:  2.5 Stars.  Perhaps a drawback that comes with the authenticity.  When I went there the people who worked there knew very little English.  Thus, they didn't get my order right.  Also, when I went they only had one server.  So when they had 5 Tables it was difficult to get more chips and refills on soda.  
Overall, I was happy.  I got a good meal for a very cheap price."}
{"text":"If you want to know my review of the food for this place, read my review of Guanajuato Taqueria... they clearly still have the same chef, with different owners.

The place now seems to be owned by an older white couple, that is, if it wasn't already. But the couple was there when I went recently and they had never been there any of my previous visits when it was called Guanajuato Taqueria.

So, after the remodel/renaming/reopening the place looks cleaner, nicer and better lit. The food is just as amazing, the service is just as good. Just as I am about to leave the city I've loved and called home for six years to go to New Orleans, I wish that people would make this the popular Madison Mexican restaurant! GO and EAT!"}
{"text":"This is one of the three proper ratty taquerias (and I mean that in the best possible way) that we have here in Madison. A proper ratty taqueria isn't usually all that ratty, but does serve real Mexican food instead of Miswestixan at places like Laredo's or Pedros. No mass quantities of dairy and refried beams here. 

My other chosen proper ratty taquerias in Madison are El Pastor and Taqueria Guadalajara. I'm a west-sider so have to drive a bit farther to get to those places, but I tend to go to Guanajatense because it's GOOD and closer to me. I usually just get a few tacos and swill back a couple Tecates in a can. They don't have tamales every day, but if they do they scribble \"tamales hoy\" on the specials chalkboard on your way in. Whatever else you're having, do yourself a favor and get a tamale too if they're available. The huaraches are MASSIVE and whatever the plate with the grilled cactus is called is also really good. They even use Black Earth Meats for the farm-to-table folks. I like spice so I dig the salsa bar but for those less tolerant of spicy food sometimes it's hard to figure out which one is mild since there aren't any labels.  So yeah, go there and eat."}
{"text":"The closest thing in Madison to Southern California Mexican. Stopped by yesterday (for takeout) for the first time and I couldn't stop eating the steak burrito, even though I was full. My husband got the pastor gorditas - the marinade was delicious!! I definitely recommend stopping by."}
{"text":"I keep going here.  A recent take-out discover were the tripa tacos (like little rigatoni tubes crispily fried - - but actually made of belly meat) - - truly a FUN food - - and really tasty.

Tonight sat down and had the Lomo Taco plate.   Very satisfying beans/rice/guac and tenderloin tacos with fragrant corn shells.  They have cut the number of salsas to four - - all of which are fantastic, particularly on the excellent chips (are they Milagro corn chip bits?).

In any case,  great food;   wonderful service (it has changed from trying hard, to wonderful);   and wild atmosphere (bright colors contrasting with sterile feng shui;   blaring TV - - some might not enjoy - -  with GREAT mtv-type blaring brass-band norteno music  - - LOVED IT!).

This place remains an otherworldly delight, that gets better all the time."}
{"text":"My new favorite. Their salsa bar rules! Their tacos are stellar! Best of all, they have specials that are tremendous. S.U. had a wonderful bowl of green chile posole that would make our son, a green chile aficionado, extremely happy. I had their barbacoa special, a very generous serving of flavorful lamb shank with all the trimmings. The chips are hot and fresh, the salsas, see above. They have some grill platters (parilla?) that looked amazing! I asked about mole and they say that they make their own from scratch sooo ... that's next on the 'to try' list. Once I saw a seafood stew special that also looked incredible. Gusto mucho!

I do love Tac. Guad. on Park. There's plenty of room for more good Mexican food in Madison. Plenty of room."}
