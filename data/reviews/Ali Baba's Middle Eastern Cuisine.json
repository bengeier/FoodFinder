daily specials are on point. 
 two words - lentil soup (unreal). made fresh (presumably). 

damn, this place goes in."}
{"text":"This was the first place I ate after arriving in Toronto from Philadelphia. I was super excited because Mediterranean is one of my favorite cuisines. I actually didn't know that Ali Baba's was a chain until I started seeing several of them around the city. Everything from the food to the workers seemed authentic.

I got the chicken kabob platter which came with rice, salad, pickled turnip, hummus, tabbouleh, and lots of tzatziki sauce! yum. Generous portion of food and a drink for about $10. Not to mention, they accepted my American money without a problem."}
{"text":"Great place! Food is delicious and super cheap - you get great options and it's healthier than most places. What's not to like?! The inside isn't very nice, so I always get it as take-out."}
{"text":"Agree with some others RE: the service. It's spotty.

Sometimes you go in and the guy behind the counter is your best friend, very complimentary (if sometimes a little too friendly with the ladies). Today however I went in for a little snack, the falafel appetizer. It came to $1.50 and I realized I had no change, took out my debit card and he says \"No way, it's a $5 minimum\", \"I don't have any cash\" I responded, to which he said \"not my problem - get out\". 

Nice to know he'd smothered them in tahini already for me - good luck reselling that.

The food is decent, there is way better in the city. The falafel especially can be disappointing as they fry a bunch at a time and serve them up cold very often. The sandwiches do get pressed briefly to warm them up but it certainly takes away from the warm/crisp of a freshly fried falafel ball. 

Go elsewhere. Liberty Shawarma (Spadina or in Liberty Village) is the best."}
{"text":"Unlike some Ali's were everything tastes the same, the flavours pop with every bite. Try the Lentil soup if you get a chance. The service is fast and friendly with zero attitude."}
{"text":"I love these guys! I moved to Vancouver and this is the restaurant I miss the most. They catered my 30th b-day (we had about 75 samosas). Their garlic sauce is the best. Every time I'm in Toronto I B-line it for Ali-Baba's."}
{"text":"Two Words: Food Poisoning.

About a year ago, I ventured into this joint on one quiet fall evening.
Little would I know, less than 30 minutes into our food-fest, I would be hurling and utterly ill. 
I contacted city services after and they had actually told me there was a \"history\" which makes me angry that these people were even permitted to serve food. Hello, Toronto? Where have standards gone?
Anyway, just be careful."}
{"text":"I like ali baba and would like to have given it more stars.

The issue here is the guy who works there most of the time.

the first time I came in, he was on his cell phone and DIDNT GET OFF while i was ordering. He was having a conversation and TRYING to take my order, needless to say he messed up.

every other time I have gone he is hanging out with his friends on on his phone. 

He is very unaware of daily specials too. 

I hope with time this place gets better"}

Sandwich has creamy smokey garlic sause, and not to drippy.  
love it."}
{"text":"Wont go back the bloor west village location, I ordered a chicken shawarma wrap, and the guy starts thowing things on first, without even asking, also he heats my wrap without asking and then throws it to me in a brown paper bag...like I wanted to stay not go...service sucks big time.."}
{"text":"Just a great place for a satisfying inexpensive meal."}
{"text":"Not much to look at here but holy S, the shwarma is other worldly. Get everything on it and get the extra large, if they still make it. If I lived closer I'd easily weigh 500 pounds."}
{"text":"The staff are fast friendly and professional. Great place to eat! Too bad I am not a student to take advantage of the \"student special\"."}
{"text":"I dunno maybe it's a cultural thing but I find most the staff pretty rude. Like today when he carelessly put the garlic sauce and hummus sauce on the pita, I asked him if he could spread it a bit instead of huge globs in one spot. He then got all weird and overexagerated the spreading. After about 20 seconds of this, I said \"your being ridiculous, stop\"

It's close to home, I still go often but the staff seriously need to check in with themselves."}
{"text":"Just had lunch at this location today. And because it's Tuesday the special is 2 falafel sandwiches for $5. For me, 1 is enough so I go with a buddy and split the bill. So really, my falafel was only $2.50... it can't get any better than that :P.

As for the taste, the falafel sandwiches are GREAT! The staff are friendly, but depending on who wraps your sandwich it can get a little messy when eating the last bit of it at the end. Even still, this wouldn't stop me from coming back next Tuesday. 

In terms of size, this location is rather small and seems more like a take out place since there aren't many seats."}
{"text":"Came in because the poster on the window said a promotion for any platter for 7.25, but the guy inside ended up charging me 9.00 saying it was an old poster.  I didn't press the issue, but will not be going back"}
{"text":"Have made 2 more visits to this location since May (read my earlier review - 2 stars) - completely disappointed... I am done giving this place a shot, and shooting down my appetite. 

FOOD: 
- decent quality, but don't make the shawarma properly. It's not a freakin' salad that I'd be content with the stuff tossed together. I want a proper wrap. 
- They grill it for less than 30 seconds. And it wasn't even busy. I was the only person there. What the heck... I want a warm, nicely grilled, properly assembled shawarma. No -- that's asking for too much at Ali Baba. It's like asking for a medium-rare steak in federal prison. 
- They don't listen for what you want or especially don't want. And once they've slobered the topping in, it's there to stay... Yup-- whether you like it or not, that's what you're getting then. 
- they also have samosas and baklavas - if you absolutely must have a samosa or a baklava, then I guess you could.... FIND ANOTHER PLACE.

Food rating: 0.5 / 5 (I'm too nice to give a zero but way too disappointed to dish out a 1). 

SERVICE:
- I think my description above will explain my overall service rating..
Service rating: 0.5 / 5

PRICE: 
- good deals - 8 bucks for 2 wraps; they have specials for each day
- but so do other places (Wrap N Grab shawarma place is a block away at Dundas St and Chestnut St) - so the deals at Ali baba are not exquisite at all
Price rating: 4/5

DECOR:
- the one thing that stands out about Ali Baba's as compared to other shawarma places - they have decent chair/table set up.
- spacious and clean.. 
Decor rating: 4/5. I just wish they would back their decor with what they're actually there to sell - food and service. 

OVERALL RATING: 1/5
- they have had time to settle down at this new location. because they are a franchise and have a good-looking place, it seems they keep getting business. But not a second star in my rating (like that matters though =P)! ;) 

Why to go there:
- if you are looking for downtown toronto's choices of shitty shawarmas and shittier service

Why not to go there:
- if good food is what you seek, and if you have some value for your hard-earned (or tax-return in my case!) money."}
{"text":"Amazing food for the best price for lunch Downtown. I usually get their 1/4 Chicken Dinner with Lentil Rice! Now they also sell their Lentil Soup for $1!!! Really! $1, can't go wrong. Staff is always nice, the pony tail gentlemen is great, always good customer service. 
Don't come in here trying to impress your date, unless your date is also ghetto like you and likes great food for good prices! :D 
Very simple and effective, great place to pop in and out. Tuesday Falafel Shwarma special is great too. 
Try their sugarless Halwa, made of milk and honey! BAM! I know what to expect when it comes to Middle Eastern food and all I expect is friendly service and this location hasn't disappointing me yet."}
{"text":"The owner is really friendly I grab lunch there occasionally it's better then any other alibabas I've tried !"}
{"text":"The Shawarma sandwich is actually good. I like the 5$ combo, it's a great deal, however every time I've been there they never had fries, so I always get the samosa. Why post that you offer combo with fries if you don't make fries?"}
{"text":"The food is great!  Price is decent and the people, are super nice!!!  Wonderful!!!!"}
{"text":"Mediocre location serving low quality beef  . I ordered a beef shawarma today that was gristly and cold. Will not return."}
{"text":"I have always loved this Ali Baba, but had a bad experience today that I feel I should share. 
I went to the washroom to wash my hands before I ate, and there was no soap or paper towel. I wanted to wash my hands, so I asked if I could go behind the counter to use the sink, and there was no soap there either. The dispenser was utterly dry. You could tell that there hadn't been soap in there in months. So I couldn't help but wonder... where are the employees washing their hands? They are exchanging money and going to the washroom, while continuously putting their hands in the food to make your shawarmas, and not ever washing their hands! Gross."}
{"text":"$5 student special. Includes shawarma, drink, and tax. It was delicious and for the price I cant complain."}
{"text":"VERY POOR customer service, rude manager. I ordered two chicken shwarama platters and they messed up my order by giving me a platter and a wrap. I called them back and the owner told me that he would make another platter for me. After waiting over an hour, I called them back and the owner pretended like it wasn't his fault and I didn't end up getting my platter"}

Blind man wins human rights case after restaurant bars guide dog

Published on Jul 05 2014
Jonathan Forani
STAFF REPORTER
Gregory Scott Hill just wanted a warm bite to eat.
But when he, his wife, and his guide dog walked into a Toronto Ali Baba's Restaurant on a bitterly cold February afternoon in 2013, an employee told them the dog had to go.
\"Why do I gotta go through this?\" Hill, 52, recalls thinking. \"It's tough enough to get around being a blind guy, but to have to be fighting just for your rights all the time,\" he says, trailing off. \"We're not in 1955 anymore. This is 2014 -- and Canada yet.\"
The Human Rights Tribunal of Ontario recently agreed, ruling in Hill's favour on a discrimination complaint he filed in April last year.
The restaurant's owner, Yousef Bani-Ahmad, was ordered to pay Hill $5,000 in compensation and post signs welcoming service animals to his franchise locations. All of Bani-Ahmad's staff must also complete an online \"Human Rights 101\" training course.
Though Hill, blind most of his life, doesn't feel that $5,000 is enough, he concedes the ruling is fair.
\"Some of these restaurant owners, the only way that you can wake them up is to shake their wallet,\" he says. \"If they were to have a disability of some sort -- other than what seems like the disability of greed -- then maybe they would understand what we have to go through.\"
What Hill experienced that day happens more often than he likes to admit. \"Toronto, it's a big place. There's so many people that just don't understand human rights.\"
He had a long Monday of errands in the city that day with wife Marta Londono. The Markham couple was relieved to find Ali Baba's Restaurant on Dundas St. W. open, as the city was still recovering from a Feb. 8 snowstorm, one of the biggest in years. The two were tired, hungry and bitterly cold. Freezing rain fell sideways, he recalls, cutting at their faces. When they walked into Ali Baba's around 3 p.m., they thought they'd found the right spot for a late warm lunch.
But, spotting Mara the guide dog, the employee said they had to leave because of health regulations against dogs in restaurants. When Hill informed him that Mara was a service dog and showed him an ID card issued by the Attorney General's Office, the employee allegedly called his boss, Bani-Ahmad -- a phone call Londono filmed with her phone, outraged.
\"[He was] more interested in what his boss says, not what the law is,\" says Hill.
Bani-Ahmad, who represented himself at the tribunal, denied receiving such a phone call that day, but acknowledged that his employee had made a mistake. He \"accepts that the situation was embarrassing for Mr. Hill,\" the tribunal's decision reads. \"He confirmed that he believed that a person's dignity is 'worth his life.'\" Bani-Ahmad could not be reached for further comment.
The couple left for another Indian restaurant down the street after the employee told Hill the couple could be served, but the dog had to stay outside.
Isai Chalmiev, Hill's legal representative, says this was a clear-cut case of discrimination, but it still baffles him.
\"It just doesn't make sense to me, how people from other parts of the world don't know that a service animal is a service animal. It's not a regular animal,\" he says.
Chalmiev usually helps clients fight traffic tickets as a paralegal at GTA Traffic, but has begun to branch out with cases like Hill's. \"We gotta preserve our human rights,\" he says. \"This is all we have at the end of the day, right?\"
The tribunal ruled in Hill's favour on June 25, citing section one of the Human Rights Code: \"Every person has the right to equal treatment with respect to services, goods and facilities, without discrimination,\" including disability.
\"If this ruling stops somebody else from having to go through the indignity that I did, or stops a store owner, or a restaurateur from discriminating -- fantastic,\" says Hill. \"There's no other way to say it than just blunt force. It's gotta stop.\""}
{"text":"Generally better than others in its franchise. Great prices too, if you come on the right days!"}
{"text":"Delicious food and the 2 for 1 falafel deals on Tuesdays are worth the trip downtown."}
{"text":"Garbage and the guy behind the counter wasnt friendly"}
{"text":"Do yourself a favor and don't go there. The food is really bad and nasty. The beef shawarma is thick slices of steak grilled in front of you and wrapped in a pita bread. Falafel was cold and hard and I just couldn't get to half or he sandwich. It was a terrible experience and I would never go back there again. The place looks dirty and not maintained AT ALL! I would be very concerned about the hygienic status of the restaurant. The food didn't taste fresh and just had a weird taste."}
{"text":"Big portions, nice quality, really friendly and kinf staff, really good prices. They offer some good deals such as 'happy hour' (every dish for 6$after 6pm) and Tuesday's special(2 falafel wrap for5$)"}
{"text":"Worst food ever, if I could give it a zero I would. I've given it a couple of tries, but both times gotten violently ill after eating. The food is not stored properly, the salads sit out and are wilted, it's quite disgusting, falafel balls are so overcooked you could play hockey with them. If you ask them how long somethings been sitting out, they get really angry, like you don't have a right to know. Rude service. Stay away!!!!!"}
{"text":"I come here practically every day because I work down the street. The staff are lovely and always supernice to me. The food, especially the chicken sharwma plate hit the spot every time. The lentil rice is amazing and as a lover of onions and garlic, theey dont hesitate to pile that stuff on for me...too bad for my coworkers when I smell all full of lovely onions and garlic, lol!! But who's complaining? everytime  go to Baba's people look in my plate and run over and hook themselves up!!"}
{"text":"Worst shawarma i've ever had. Chicken was super dry. Eggplant is cold and covered in oil. On a more positive note, falafel balls were decent and the food was cheap."}
{"text":"Been coming here for the past 15 years! I've tried plenty of shwarmas in the city yet no one compares to this place!! I get the chicken shwarma sandwich and when in the mood, the meat samosas....

Been coming here for the past 15 years! I've tried plenty of shwarmas in the city yet no one compares to this place!! I get the chicken shwarma sandwich and when in the mood, the meat samosas...."}
{"text":"This Ali Baba's is always super clean, and the salads are always bountiful, colourful and fresh. This is my favourite location and I start having cravings if I don't eat here for a while. Whoever used to make the shish tawook sadly took the recipe with them because it hasn't been the same in months but I can't really quibble. I can't stress enough the cleanliness factor here! The prices are great, they have specials everyday and the staff are very friendly. They stay open late and even better, because they get a late night crowd, the food is super fresh even at midnight!"}
{"text":"Vegans beware-though  you may want to eat the garlic sauce, don't. Though it doesn't have dairy, there is something that makes it creamy-like. Probably eggs. 
That aside, the vegetarian platter is awesome. For about $7, you can get lentil rice, different types of salad (beet, chickpea), dolmades etc. The food is great.and so is the service-everyone who works there is very friendly."}
{"text":"The service at this place is spotty.  Middle eastern Shawarma places tend to not perscribe to the sandwich artist Subway concept, even though the variety of toppings is vast.  The staff here will typically blurt out \"Everything? hot sauce?\" and before you have even answered they have started filling the pita with toppings you may not want.   Even after 10+ visits I still have to get them to hold their horses when they get my Shawarma going"}
{"text":"Ordered the Tuesday special- buy one get one falafel wrap. My mistake. They messed up my first wrap; the guy ripped the entire wrap in half and dragged it along with all my food spilling on the counter. With one swipe he swiped all of my food on the counter and shoved it back into the wrap as I watched in horror. My colleague expressed her displeasure at my broken wrap and the man angrily wrapped it in a SECOND wrap. Unhappy with my fate with a double wrapped-wrap I told the owner at the checkout and he yelled for a second one to be made. UH OH. First, it had hot sauce which I asked to not include 3 times AND I found a piece of plastic around 0.8-0.3 cm (hard white colored plastic/rubber) in my sandwich that could not be chewed. I heavily suspect this was done on purpose but regardless I have reported this to Toronto Public Health as the number of unsanitary practices is just disgusting. NEVER AGAIN."}
{"text":"I like this place.
I have noticed other shwarma places only have good shwarmas at dinner or lunch times, but these guys keep everything very clean and fresh.

Shishwook is great. I usually get the deal of the day and it is very full-filling."}
{"text":"Awesome and cheap! I always order the Falafal pitas."}
{"text":"There is nothing special about the food here. I have tired their shawarma sandwich as well as chicken kebab plate and they were both a waste of money and calories. Here are a couple of things that I didn't like 
The shawarma is toaster for probably 30 seconds. I don't know why they bother at all to toast it because it doesn't even warm the bread. 
Their taboulie has a lot of onion and is the worst taboulie I have ever had. 
In both the shawarma option and kebab option the meat portion is very small. You mostly feel you had a vegetarian meal. Considering that, I think this is a very expensive place and definitely not worth trying."}
{"text":"The most desipicable service from the owner. Although the food is cheap, so is his attitude. 

He was heard to be throwing things in the back room out of frustration. My server went to go to the back to help him. The server came back and proceeded to use the same gloves (they touch the ingredients directly to stuff the wraps). I politely asked him to change his gloves. The owner saw this and said something in Arabic to the server regarding the gloves. He then asked me what I was looking at in rude tone of voice. Confronted and yelled at me for looking at him. I have never felt so insulted. He has no respect for women. Will not be returning to support this dump."}
{"text":"Lovely! they made it easy for me to start eating meat again after 6 years of being vegan! Their food is amazing, not gross bits which make you barf, the meat is soo good and doesn't taste like blood. Thank you for feeding me! :) Also in Canberra (Dickson Alibaba) once the man making it got oil in his eye, he continued to make it and then ran to wash his eye, I can't think of another company so dedicated. I felt bad though because he was so strong, took it like such a man and got oil in his eye making my lamb kebab. I hope your feeling better now sweet pea :) xo"}
{"text":"I go to Ali Baba's intermittently when I have a craving for shwarma or felafel. Their food is mediocre and geared towards poor-quality low-price end of the spectrum. Service is okay and the store could be a bit cleaner.

My other critique is about their daily specials promotion. These promos appear cheap but are not good as they sound (obviously). Take the tuesday special for example - 2 felafels for the price of 1. They will use only two felafels instead of three per sandwich and use other condiments sparingly as well. I understand that this is a marketing tactic but it's misleading for sure."}
{"text":"I ate lunch here on a weekday two months ago and had SEVERE food poisoning. I was rushed to emergency and the doctors determined that my falafel sandwich had been contaminated with foul matter. I was off work (unable to walk) for a week and a half, and my digestive system has been damaged. It's months later and I can only eat a handful of foods.

I wish zero stars were an option."}
{"text":"I work for its landlord so once in a while they brought food to our service.  I've had their chicken shawarma, quarter chicken plate as well as kebab.  I wouldn't recommend their rice plate as they tend to be a bit oily and greasy, but I do enjoy their shawarma sandwich. The portion is alright, more like a snack.  The flavour is not bad and the one time I had it was mixed of dark and white meat, which I prefer.  Personally I think it is an ok spot to grab a quick bite without incurring too much money in the area."}
{"text":"I love their beef shawarma. Ive tried a lot of shawarma places and nothing compares to theirs. I can actually taste the meat instead of just lettuce or other condiments. The owner is also very friendly. Always worth the drive coming from sauga."}
{"text":"Terrible service here. I wouldn't say their chicken shawarma was anything special either. I've avoided this chain to a maximum but gave it a shot - did not help my expectations."}
{"text":"I bought a chicken shawarma plate (~$10) and it didn't taste good, the rice was weird, the meat was undercooked in some places and burnt in others (I had to throw half of it away). But the place looked cleanish and the people were nice. So, I don't know if it was just one bad experience or what but I won't be going back there."}
{"text":"Parfait pour un repas rapide, nous avons pris le wrap falafel, les falafels étaient moelleux. Les pommes de terre à l'ail étaient très bonnes. Le personnel sympathique."}
{"text":"WARNING:

This location is currently bieng investigated for DEBIT CARD COPYING!!! 

Also the OWNER will ALWAYS overcharge....

Hopefully they get shut down ASAP"}
{"text":"My favorite Ali Baba's. They're mostly the same- but this location seems to have the friendliest employees, the willingness to make the falafel fresh even if there's a few balls sitting in the basket (lolz), and very generous portions. Falafel plate FTW. Seven bucks. Huge pile of food."}
{"text":"Passable food, but awful service.  Showing up for takeout during lunch can take a half hour.  I tried to call my order in in advance -- no one picked up the phone after several attempts.  I tried to call the manager (number posted on the website) -- he was \"in a meeting\" and wouldn't help me."}
{"text":"For a very affordable middle eastern cuisine, this Ali Baba's location is one of my favourite go to restaurants for delivery. Price point is quite reasonable in regards to quality and quantity. The chicken shawarma is delicious. Delivery time is reasonable and worth the wait."}
{"text":"I had the chicken shawarma and I did not like it.   The chicken tasted like it was boiled.  It didn't taste like it was roasted at all.  And the sauce was bland and watery.  And I asked for extra sauce.  Chicken was all dark meat; no white.  Upside:  portion size was adequate.  My husband liked it though; his preference is dark meat.  His top priority is portion size, whereas mine is taste."}
{"text":"I'm stranded down in this part of town while working a handful of miles from here. I say stranded because a few miles means something different in downtown Toronto.
I wanted to walk to china town but its raining pretty hard and its a good mile or two to get there.  There isn't much by my hotel so I figured I'd give it a shot. We have lots of these type of places in metro Detroit (Dearborn primarily).

Walked in, first thing I noticed was a Q-Tip on the floor which turned my stomach a but but I stayed.  The staff are pleasant and got my food out quickly - chicken shawarma wrap, Samosa and drink for under 10 bucks.

The sandwich started out good but looking around and not a single clean table continued to make me feel a bit sick.  Just then as I take a bite and look to my left, I several baby flies stuck to the wall (last seat opposite the register).  It is clear nothing has been cleaned in a long time.  I decided to pitch the food and look forward to breakfast.

Ugh!!"}
{"text":"The best falafel wraps we have ever eaten and the best prices too! The service was fantastic. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"This place is one of the best cleanest Ali Babas in Toronto. Flafal is amazing and always fresh and crispy . Their salads are delicious, especially the chickpea salad."}
{"text":"this place really awful i went there last night and the store smile stink even i order shawarma sandwich they put so tiny pit chicken when they ask them to put extra the guy he said he need to charge me extra 3$ its sin"}
{"text":"There were just a couple of things that rubbed me the wrong way with this place.  In addition to a mediocre falafel wrap (pretty flavorless on all accounts), the service was gruff and the restaurant itself seemed too compact and greasy.  I understand that's an issue that happens with shops with fryers in it - so that's not a big complaint.  But, as far as first impressions, I did not want to eat any more.

There was a huge selection of baklava - so that might be a redeeming factor and something I'd be willing to try."}
{"text":"love it 
one of my second fav. place in my launch break"}
{"text":"2 nights in a row I have indulged in some drunken Falafel. Great customer service and at the right price.  Stumbling into here with only Loonies and Toonies left to spend, making demands of extra banana peppers and I am sure smelling like the pub, these guys are very accommodating and helpful.  One night I ordered the falafel sandwich, which was inhaled in the matter of minutes and the next night I ordered a plate. The next morning it was next to my bed barely touched and I was so tempted to dig in cus it still looked pretty good but I knew better not to."}
{"text":"I remembered getting really good sharwama here a long time again. Been back to the same location and it was not good at all."}
{"text":"Great chicken shawarma .  Everybody else was closing at ten p.m. on a weeknight and these guys took care of me and fed me very well. Chicken was tasty, fresh grilled.  Tons of sides and toppings. Near to my best meal all week and all for about five bucks."}
{"text":"I like shwarma, and sometimes I'm so desperate I go to Ali Baba's and then immediately regret it.  It's just that Ali Baba's is everywehere.

I think it goes without sayin the service sucks balls.  They ask you \"you want everything?\"  I say \"no onions\"...only to see him put onions in it...everytime.  Since it's not my first rodeo...after he asks me the first time I know I'll have to remind him once he starts putting the toppings.  I learned the hard way oneday after telling him only once and seeing onions in my shwarma after getting home.  Nothing sucks more than trying to pick apart a wrap.

Falafel is dry.  I got it on a Tuesday...2 for 1 special.  It's barely worth that deal.  So damn dry."}
{"text":"SO GOOD. 

Chicken shawarma platter is bomb. All sauces are amazing. I love this place! And they even have a take out window if you are walking your dog so you don't have to struggle to tie him up to go in!"}
{"text":"There are several locations and we have found the service exceptionally friendly every time! The food is authentic and so good! I had the fish pita for the first time time today and was not disappointed!! It was so fresh, moist, and perfectly seasoned. The toppings went well! It was a crazy low price and we will be back any time were in the city! xo"}
{"text":"This is my go-to shawarma place in the hood. Food quality (especially meat) is great, staff is super-friendly and portions are generous. Not all of my experiences with Ali Baba's franchisees were akin to what I experience here. This location is definitely setting the bars higher. When in the area, I always bide my time to grab a delicious bite at Ali Baba, Bloor and Spadina."}
{"text":"We were on the run and looking for something good and easy. We picked up some chicken schwarma wraps, fries and dolmas. It did the trick- all were good and we were where we needed to be in time!"}
{"text":"This particular location of Ali Baba's gets five stars because it delivers the most consistently delicious, well-prepared, food and has the most consistently positive and welcoming atmosphere of all the ones I've tried in the city. They are more generous than other locations, providing ample servings of the garnishes, dressing etc. and they don't weasel you with  extra charges for things like pita with your platter (yes, I'm talking to you Bloor & Bathurst!). Dining in options are limited and not too picturesque but take out service is quick and friendly."}
{"text":"I was thoroughly impressed with the generous portions and the always friendly service I received at this location. Unlike many other donair shops, this restaurant was always clean. It was a motivator in my decision to move to the neighbourhood. I am saddened to see it has closed (a burger place appears to be in place to open shortly. Because that's what we need -- another burger place. Note the sarcasm.). Thank you to the owners (Persian I believe). Sending best wishes on your next endeavour!"}
{"text":"Ali babas is classic. They have amazing daily deals and specials. And always fast service with a smile! My favourite are the beef shawarmas and chicken shwarma! There everywhere so you have a variety of options of locations to go to! I prefer it as a grab and go food but they do have casual seating set up inside if that's what floats your boat!"}
{"text":"I came here with a friend after improv and we had a nice dinner. I ordered a dish which was both gluten and dairy free. I'm not 100% sure it was completely gluten free as my tummy began to grumble during the meal.  I wouldn't recommend this restaurant for celiacs. 

However, the food was really good if you are a person without food intolerances."}
{"text":"FINALLY! A shawarma place that makes a great shawarma! :)

Stopped in here after a vasectomy consultation because I needed a treat after having a stranger grope my manhood whilst instructing me to cough... TMI??  Anyways..

The price was the standard price range you would expect at any shawarma place ($5.99+) with some decent combo options available for people with larger \"eyes\"..

I went with my standard \"Go To\" choice when I'm trying out a new shawarma place: the Chicken Shawarma Wrap.

The meat was the most flavourful chicken I have ever had in a shawarma wrap! It was absolutely incredible! Amazing and full of heart!

My only gripe were the semi-rude, half-competent staff members, and the clumsy decor, sooo that's a paddlin' (-1 star)... They have a large patio in the back though, which is a definite plus!

I will definitely be back here, as this is easily the best shawarma I have tried in Toronto so far. Maybe the staff will be in a better mood next time?? Fingers crossed.."}
{"text":"The beef was burnt and old ! Not worth it. And I hope they read this. So garbage. I would rather go to Alexandria down the street. Such a bad choice on my part"}
{"text":"I've been coming to Ali Baba for over 10 years. I have tried a bunch of shawarma across the city and I think that this one is best. The meat is great, and the fillings are generous. The garlic and hot sauce are perfect. I get both plates and sandwiches - lentil rice is the best pick for your plate. Someone complained about dry meat -- you need to look at the skewers. I don't know if I'm going beef or chicken until I get there and check out the skewers. If one is a sad almost fully-carved-away remainder, I go with the other. The staff has changed over the years, but in general they've all be really nice."}
{"text":"24 Wellesley Street West - Google maps doesn't even acknowledge this address unless only the postal code is inputted.  How strange!

I ventured outside of my corner of the universe to this Middle Eastern restaurant expressly because of a wagjag.com offer.  I'm usually too lazy to pop outside my downtown cubby but I just couldn't resist a deal.  So new that this location isn't even on google maps, I had to go to mapquest to pinpoint its location.  Located on the ground level of a random building, facing the street, it is pretty easy to spot once you're in the area.  We arrived a few minutes after noon and just barely got there ahead of the lunchtime crowd.  What a crush!  The staff and layout of the restaurant is clearly not prepared for the volume of hungry workers amassing within that brief half hour window just after 12pm.  The staff was extremely friendly and easygoing, taking the time to answer questions even in light of the line stretching around the walls.

The food... mmm!!  Fresh, fast-ish, and extremely tasty.  We had a chicken shawarma / beef shawarma made up of the usual delicious chicken/beef, heapfuls of veggies and tasty, drippy sauce all wrapped in a toasty pita pocket.  They're each $4.99 and for $2 more, we added in one combo that gave us the choice of two items (fries, samosa, pop).  The fries where presented freshly cooked and steaming hot.  The chicken samosa while definitely flavourful, lacked a bit of something... due to its sitting out for a while, I suppose.  

There's plentiful indoor as well as outdoor seating.  There were multiple groups of office workers from the surrounding area that came out as a crowd to this place, so I guess they must all enjoy what they're having!  On Tuesdays, the special is two for one falafels.  Definitely coming back for some (before noon to beat the crowd)!"}
{"text":"A pretty good deal is going on right now: $5 for a plate of food. That's rice, a couple salads and a protein with a sauce of your choice. The combinations are endless! (unless you understand mathematical permutations, in which case, the combinations are definitely limited. But still, pretty vast.)

I had the roast quarter chicken with yellow rice, beet salad, tabouleh and hot sauce. Everything was super tasty. The hot sauce is ACTUALLY HOT!

The only issue was that it took a while for everything to get ordered and paid for, but to be fair, there were only two people there and we all came in at once.

This spot is super close to where I play dodgeball, so it's likely to be visited quite a few times by me."}
{"text":"bee ware of alibabas.

the 2 chicken shwarma deal for $7.49 got me

but i almost got stung... 

... i have to say that any shwarma place that doesnt cut their chicken or beef fresh off the roasting spit should give their customers the option to inspect the meat, as mine had the unexpected condiment of a yellow jacket hornet /bee/wasp, making love to the tahini..

now i can't confirm if it was the hotsauce or the wasp in my wrap that made me sick after,

but the food was tasty, and they gave me a free replacement shwarma..

good service, good tasting food...

bad wasp in the wrap. (see photos)"}
{"text":"This place is reported as closed, but it's still open. Might have been closed at some point.

Got the Tuesday 2 for 1 falafel wrap deal for $5. Wraps are really small. Seems to have really shrunk in size compared to 2 years ago. Not sure if this is how it normally looks, or it's their \"special size\" for the 2-for-1 deal.

Flies were seen on the tables and flying around. Rice can be seen on the seats. Better to just have take it to go."}
{"text":"ATTENTION  U of T students who had over 600 chicken shwarma's and sandwiches from this place, unfortunately you would not know this as this was a catered ever\t for Labour Day Orientation Day.  I witnessed your order in the making with over 500 of t\hem wrapped in foil and sitting on the counter for delivery the next day....  When mentioned that this is not the proper holding temperature for chicken they looked at me sideways, and kept on making them...  I hope no one gets sick as this is the source...."}
{"text":"Man, that is a good shawarma.  It comes securely wrapped in a pita, with a few spoonfuls of tabbouleh salad inside and the requisite pink pickled veggies.  Nice, fresh, and not so terribly bad for you (I think).  My chicken shawarma and juice came to about $7.  The server was quick and pleasant, and the eating area at the back was clean & had CP24 tuned in.  There is an endless supply of kleenex for mopping up your sauce drips."}
{"text":"Not sure where they all came from, but all of a sudden I've noticed Alibaba's everywhere!

I've also come to realize that they're not all equal.  Even though there's another one real close by (it's like they're become the next Tim Horton's or Starbucks), this location rocks.

Service is awesome.  Plus they're always trying new twists that other locations don't.  If you're a regular, they'll also sneak in some of their creations for you to try.

They make these home made pita chips which are awesome.

But for $5.99, you can get a full 1/4 chicken meal which comes with choices of rice, and salads and toppings.  Easily one of the best values in the city, if not the absolute best.

It's also a mound of flavour.  If you don't like flavour.. well then skip this place.

From the garlic sauce, to the hummus, it's all good.

Dang.. I'm hungry again."}
{"text":"I LOVE these people, especially Bashir. They know me and hide their lemons when I approach. SO friendly and nice, and MAAAAAAN can they cook. Everything is good.PERIOD. New renovations BTW."}
{"text":"Meh. Went back recently and the staff had changed and they no longer grill your meat before putting on your shwarma. That sucks. Now its the fill up pita and put in a panini maker to warm.

What happened to grilling the nice chicken on the grill to make it crispy???? Next time in TO I will try to make it to the Parliament Ali Baba's to see if they too have switched to the bad way of doing things."}
{"text":"Good place for fast food. Pretty small and in summers are very hot inside so it's better the take out meals."}
{"text":"I love the food at Ali Baba's ... it's surprising that food from a chain should be so good. I really like the falafael and the shawarama, andd I am pretty picky!  The rice and beans and side options make for a filling and really good mean for around 10$. Always makes two meals for me."}
{"text":"Their daily specials are enticing but once you move your eyes away from the specials and into the restaurant, you start to feel differently. I can't put my finger on it but there's  something \"ghetto\" about Ali Baba. Not the type to care much about atmosphere or service, I walked in.

We were hungry and I wanted some middle eastern food. It was a Thursday so we ordered 2 Shish Tawouk sandwiches for $10. I was lucky they didn't have any chicken ready so they made fresh ones. The tray where the grilled kebobs would go doesn't look very appetizing. It had a strange liquid. When I think kebobs, I don't associate it with being stored in a liquid until served. Fortunately the chicken skewers went straight from the grill to our sandwiches. We also ordered some Falafel to share. I like how they sell individually with no rice or sandwich. 

The sandwich was ok. But it's a messy ordeal to eat it. A lot of the toppings have some liquids. I'm used to eating Persian kebobs and the meat at Ali Baba lacks that smokiness that I like. The flavor just isn't there. I don't think they marinated it. It feels like they are relying on that sesame sauce for taste. The falafel was alright. Although it was freshly fried, it wasn't very delicious. 

Even though the meal was just so so, I somehow decided to come back the next day. Friday's special is 2 platters of your choice. Not a massive discount but a discount none the less. We chose chicken and beef. Once again the food was edible but it seemed to have more sauce than I liked. It's delicious in a heavy way. In my mind, the sauce weighted a ton per teaspoon.

After 2 consecutive dinners at Ali Baba, I think I can safely conclude it's not that good. I mean, the food is edible...but I don't want edible. I want mouth watering goodness."}
{"text":"The inside of this place smells terrible and the food is mediocre. Throw in the lacklustre service and you've got a solid 1 star eatery."}
{"text":"Not really seeing where these bad reviews are warranted, this place had delicious beef shawarma for $5.99, definitely filling, delicious, all sorts of great flavours and the price is right.  The negative comments literally make no sense to me.  Plus they have those delicious pickled beet/radish things. MMMM! :)"}
{"text":"The best damn falafel in the city. I was lucky enough to live directly across from this lovely restaurant for over a year, which resulted in dozens of falafels sliding down my throat.
Haven't tried anything other than the falafel sandwich and falafel platter but both are usually swimming in tahini with pickled beets, lettuce, hummus, and a pita. And a crucial step that is lost on all falafel joints in Seattle is to put the wrapped falafel in the panini press press to get that slightly crunchy exterior on the pita."}
{"text":"Yum. I just finished eating a $5 (well, $5.41) Beef Shawarma Sandwich from Ali Baba's and it was DEEEELICIOUS. I don't think I haven't had something that good in a while. The price is excellent and they made it fresh. He shaved off the meats and grilled it for a little while making up my pita. 
Afterwards, they put it on a panini griller which made it a perfect consistent temperature (instead of biting into to hot meat and cold fillers). 

They have daily 2 for 1 specials - like 2 Falafel pitas for $3.99 or 2 Shawarma sandwich for $7.99.  There's also a fish dinner/sandwich option, and barbeque chicken (which looked more tasty than you could ever find in an SC). 

They also sell bakalava (pistachio, walnut chocolate among some..)

I can't wait to come back for cheap, and great quality food. Going to try the falafel next."}
{"text":"First time here. If you live in Toronto you probably have noticed Ali Baba's. This franchise is spreading like wild fire.

They have pretty sweet daily specials (picture below). I ordered the Chicken shawarma plate and my friend ordered the beef shawarma plate. Chicken shawarma was pretty good. But my friend's beef shawarma was chewy and not in a good way. Free WiFi.

Stick to chicken and stay away from the beef."}
{"text":"This is by far the worst dinning experience I have had in my 37 years of existence on this planet.  The \"food\" mostly consisted of hairs; the \"meat\" was full of fat and gristle; our order was lost through online order, order was not complete and I had to return for the rest.

We will certainly never return, and would advise you to do the same.  Perhaps they have under gone a management change, but this place is most certainly not good.

I would give them 0 stars, but Yelp would not let me."}
{"text":"OK, I am totally biased here. No lie. The guy behind the counter totally has a crush on me, so I might be getting a premium size when I order. And who doesn't like a side of compliment with their lunch? Guilty. Horrible guilty.

LOVE LOVE LOVE this place. The food is crazy good. The portions are healthy, as in big guy healthy. And the deals of the day? Tuesday is like 2 falafel wraps for $5!!!! $5!!!!! That's like subsidized cafeteria pricing...

The only downside is that I find cleanliness a hit or miss. Their storefront door is open so they occasionally have flies around... That can't be sanitary but still... Who knows what happens at the back of bigger restaurants?

I'm just going with it!

And totally going tomorrow... It think it's Chicken shwarma plate - 2 for $15... Bazinga."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed the chicken shawarma plate that I had. The chicken was moist, and the rice was flavourful. The tahini and hot sauce compliment the other flavours. This is your typical shawarma place, but the taste just stood out to me. I sampled the 'shishwook' which was a marinated chicken shish kebab, and it was delicious."}
{"text":"I am eating a wonderful chicken shawarma as we speak at this location. Service was friendly, and my food is amazing!"}
{"text":"We picked up some falafel here the other day, and man was the difference in quality from our regular A-B's apparent from first glance... and not in a good way.

Much, much smaller, with stingier toppings, than the ones we're accustomed to at the Bloordale location.  We both knew right away we'd be needing more to eat, which is a bit frustrating.

As for taste, well, sad to report, also inferior.  There was a kind of burnt-grill flavour that neither of us liked and suspected comes from a lack of proper cleaning.  The falafel themselves were dry and crumbly, while the toppings were -- as said -- stingy, except for an overabundance of coarsely cut white onions.  Agh.  Talk about breath-death.  C'm'ere while I slay you with my onion-gas!

It's cheap, so they score points there I guess, but we're rather glad we have the better Ali-Baba's so much closer to home.  Can't say we'll be back to this one judging by our first experience.

Oh well, can't win 'em all!"}
{"text":"We were on our way home from visiting my fiances' parents in Brampton and wanted something quick/tasty/cheap so we found this place on Yelp. Bae ran inside to grab take out.

I chose lentil soup and a falafel platter, bae chose a mixed shawarma wrap with fries.

All of the food was delicious and seemed to be prepared with care. The falafel were crispy on the outside and moist inside, not dry at all. The lentil soup was so flavourful and comforting, perfect for the cold weather. Bae said his wrap was exactly what he wanted. Fries were good too!

All in all, a great lunch. Would definitely visit this location again!"}
{"text":"I dont know nor can i speak for the folks leaving bad reviews but the chicken swarma was amazing"}
{"text":"I can only talk about what I have had here and that is the beautiful falafel.  
It was made by two gentlemen that were extremely friendly and took pride in what 
they were doing.  The taste was unbelievably amazing.  The prices are extremely reasonable and they have two for one specials most days of the week.
The restaurant had limited seating but mostly people take out anyways.
When you walk in it feels like you are in a Middle East city with the music playing from a typical radio you would find there.  
Overall....great feel to the restaurant and great falafel.  If you get one....get it loaded with everything including the hot sauce which is not over the top at all."}
{"text":"Just delicious! I order in and its always warm & on time. Chicken is sooo juicy and spice is very tasty, so a very decent size!!! The salads are always very fresh & super yummy potatoes! Great prices , they never disappoint, recommend to all ."}
{"text":"Going to school just around the corner, i have eaten here many times over the past year. If you like middle eastern food, wanna grab a quick bite to go and at a reasonable price, Ali Baba is the right place for you. There are cheaper places just around the corner as well (shish kabob) but i like the food at Ali Baba better specially their falafel and the beef shawarma. The plates are also pretty good options if you are hungry. The fish fillet is pretty good but it is a bit sweet just so you know. Often get their Tuesday deals which is two falafel sandwich for $7. If you are student, you get a free drink as well.

{"text":"i agree with Laura on all aspects!

I am a huge Ali Baba's fan but there are only two that i can say meet the Ali Baba standards, 1) The OG in High Park and 2) THIS ONE!

The guy who is always there is the man...mad respect because he is very friendly and loads up on the food."}
{"text":"Still can't find a place that compares to the quality of Ali Baba's.  Not any Ali's but this one in particular.  Ahhh do i miss you."}
{"text":"This place is disgusting went in and got a wrap and the guy just started putting whatever he wanted in it and when I said no hot sauce he said \"what your not women enough\" rude. I then ordered a small potato and he was going to put a white sauce on it and I asked for it on the side and he said \"why you can't handle this either\" again rude I go to pay and he charged me $1.50 for this white sauce that he offered me to start so I told I don't want it then he said \"you trouble making you have to take or I have to through away\" this place is disgusting with gross food and nasty rude employee..... good luck to anyone that goes here"}
{"text":"Read on...  It's interesting. Before I start I need to say I am the least pickiest person ever when it comes to food, besides the fact that I'm vegan, otherwise you may wonder how I actually ate here more than once. As a vegan sometimes I have to take what I can get because I need to eat a lot of food. I've gone to Ali Babas every now and then for a vegan option for fast food (falafal platter). 

Every single time I've gone to this location has been a total disaster.  It's never been right. The employees here don't pay attention or listen at all,  they just zone out and sleepily splash your awful meal together in the most disgusting,  revolting way possible.  

One time I bit down on a 1cm stone that was in the food, along with a massive mouthful of other dirt (it was in the turnip salad so I never got that again)

Another time they put Greek salad mixed in without even asking which has cheese I can't eat, and then refused to make a new plate because they apparently didn't have any falafal yet. . .  Clearly just lying.  (by the way, the falafal platter doesn't come with Greek salad...  Yeah.....) 

The very last time (tonight) I always ask for NO HOT SAUCE somehow after I made it very clear NO hot sauce,  I even made it to the end of them crafting this horrible food, in the time I paid for my order as he wrapped it up,  he DUMPED hot sauce all over my platter without me seeing. . .  I mean,  no exaggeration, it had to be 1/3 of the entire bottle of hot sauce. .  I got home and discovered this and because I worked all day and got all the way home I tried to eat it because I was starving and didn't want to walk all the way back,  I ended up eating less then half and threw up,  and tossed it in the garbage. My stomach and throat is burning and I feel absolutely terrible. 

Believe me, this place is garbage, and the worst of the Mediterranean food 'restaurants'. STEER CLEAR. . .

 I can't believe people actually eat MEAT from this place... I would never touch it but I assume it has to be the lowest grade meat you can put in your body."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and the have really good food. They have a great $5 Happy Hour deal after 6PM everyday and it gives you a really big portion of really delicious food! The place has pretty friendly service and a nice quiet location. Definitely deserves a lot of business!"}
{"text":"Not the greatest service, but the Crazy Hour $3 shawarmas from 3-6pm are sooo good it merits 4 stars."}
{"text":"Got hooked on shawarma while in the GTA. Ali Baba's came well recommended, and, thankfully, they're almost as ubiquitous as Tim Horton's. We hit this on on the way out of town. One chicken and one beef, loaded, $9. Fast, delicious, cheap, fantastic."}
{"text":"I've only been here for their Falafel sandwich special. It's a decent and cheap option for lunch, especially when you're in a hurry to get back to work. 

The staff is super kind, especially the lovely lady. I love the toppings they offer, especially their hot sauce. Since the turnover is exceedingly high during lunch so you know the falafels are fresh and warm. 

There isn't much more to it; just a solid option for a quick, cheap lunch."}
{"text":"Just ate here for the first time. I ordered a chicken shawarma. I must be spoiled because it does not compare (at all) to Sofra Grill which is right by my house. Plus, the guy who served me jipped me on the toppings (which weren't the greatest either and he was not friendly at all."}
{"text":"When I'm looking for quick grab and go lunch I'll pit stop in at Ali Baba's on the corner of Dundas & Ronces. On Tuesdays they have a two for one falafel sandwich for $3.99 which is a total bargain. Whenever I order a falafel sandwich the character behind the counter always says....\"you want a falafel sandwich or a sandwich falafel?\" Every single time someone orders a falafel sandwich he asks this question and its funny because people actually stop and ponder on it. 

Ali Baba's is a bargain from a price point perspective. I do have some concerns though at moments about the cleanliness factor. If I get in the store early it's not too bad but anytime after 1:30 p.m. and the steam table is looking somewhat grungy. I also noticed that buddy behind the counter didn't change his gloves as he fills the orders.  He would just wipe his hands off on a rag and move on to the next order. I watched him fill four lunch orders before he finally put on a fresh pair of gloves. 

Mind you, I've always enjoyed my falafel sandwich and have never had any sort of aftermath issues with it. What I like is that Ali Baba's at least gives me a fast food option to the burgers/submarine sandwiches or pizza slices that is still quite quick to pick up and go."}
{"text":"I find that Ali Babas varies alot by location, this is definitely the best one I've tried. Really friendly staff and great food at a reasonable price. Have become and will continue to be a regular at this location. Usually busy but line tends to move quick."}
{"text":"Before going to try this food, I wondered exactly what I'd be paying for because this food establishment is located inside of the buildings food court downstairs. Hearing the name alone, which seems to be my standard was of judging any place that serves food, made me think of some sort of small run down little shop in the corner of a strip mall that looks like no one would go there for a bite to eat, but in reality somewhere that sticks to it's culture, love of food, and respect for the customer to make it so overwhelmingly jam packed. Almost like a family restaurant.

Upon first going there, I found out it was a Middle Eastern restaurant. This fact alone already had my attention. Middle eastern food is probably my 4th favorite cuisine. I had high expectations going into buying any sort of food from them. The entire staff seems really nice and friendly. Always making you feel that much more welcomed  even though you're in a food court.

The price, especially for someone who is always trying to find the best value meal, being that I'm a big person and an equally big eater, I don't like having to spend a lot of money on food to satisfy my hunger. That being said, the price for something that comes from a food court was great! It's no surprise that Middle Eastern food is so cost effective, because if you've ever been to a Middle Eastern restaurant, its like they practically give the food away in terms of the portion sizes. For $10 you get a nice, big, and healthy lunch. $7 if you're vegetarian or if a 1/4 chicken with rice is enough to fill you up.  

My choice of food was a Beef Shawarma platter, which is basically a shawarma wrap put into a container and in a bigger portion. To say the least, it tasted great. This platter contained brown rice prepared in their special way, 2 handfuls of lettuce, a handful pickled radish, 2 Tomato slices, a little herb salad/salsa that I don't know the ingredients of but tasted refreshing, a generous portion of tzatziki sauce and Hummus,  and of course a load of beef that was on top of the rice that took up half of the container. If you're reading this right now, just get up and go try it. They also have chicken and fish if beef isn't for you. Everything about this dish was so well thought out even though it seems so simple. It seems so strange to see the primary food groups be put out in front of you to be eaten by putting it together yourself in your own way in todays society where everything Is prepared together and all at once, like a burger or pizza. Being able to take a bite and get a different amount of different flavors and textures in every bite  just made my lunch taste all that much better. It's also nice that they provide food that doesn't just settle your food craving, but also gives you a well balanced and healthy alternative to other foods that are offered in the food court."}
{"text":"Perfectly good vegetarian plates. But 3 stars because they won't even give you a glass of water! Seriously? I mean charge a quarter for a cup if you have to, but to force me to buy a bottle of water... Not cool, when Toronto has perfectly good tap water."}
{"text":"Love this place. Really cheap to eat here, and fills you up. It also tastes amazing.
EASILY you can fully dine here with a bunch of pita breads with a stack of hummus, and 2 shwarma dinners for under $30.

Seriously love this place."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place on the way after work. Let's say you get your money's worth.
The food is filling, tasty and at a good price. What wrong can you go there."}
{"text":"I can't say for any other Ali Baba's , but they make good shwarma here, the best I've tried.
I think there had been a change of management or something- but the shwarma is smaller than it used to be- although still as delicious as it was 5 years ago when I first tried it here.
Their ingredients are always fresh and I love the t tabbouleh  they put in. Service is quick, food is delicious and you can choose to eat in.

Only weird bit is that they try to sell burnt spinach turnover things for regular price - and it's never ever moist. I keep buying it, hoping that one day I will get a moist one but it has yet to happen - I need to stop buying it - but otherwise , GREAT."}
{"text":"Ordered with uber eats, they colossally  fucked up my order, and the stuff that was \"right\" were 2 wraps that were SO SOGGY you couldn't eat them because they fell apart and then the woman that did it had the gall to sugges I repurchase the entire order at my own cost so she could remake it. And probably spit in the food. Don't know what I expected, it's a grody looking joint, always dirty and filled with gross people."}
{"text":"Probably a 3.5- and 3.5 to 4 for a chain/fast food place (ie I am not evaluating on the same criteria I would for a typical queen st west upscale restaurant). 

Pros- night staff (Adam) is sooooo friendly, easy to interact with, and is one of the reasons I try to only go there in the evening. Portions- generous for price point. Taste is pretty good for what It is, compared to similar type food places. Like the garlic sauce. Also like the option of a Greek salad, and lentil rice, when ordering a combo. 


Day staff are usually unfriendly and question my order (yes, I understand I have to pay for extra sauce- why do I need to be asked three times before honouring my order request??). And sometimes if ordering off Uber eats the orders may not be as requested- recommend calling after placing the order to confirm. The portion sizes make It worth it, if you're craving Schwarma and don't want to bear the bitter cold to get It..."}
{"text":"This Ali Baba's location is pretty good, although there are better options in the city. Sadly, this is one of the very few shawarma places in Bloor Village West. The wraps have been getting smaller and smaller since they opened the location, which is disappointing. At first they would be exploding with meat and veggies, but now they're pretty tiny.

Staff is generally friendly; The older gentlemen will always strike up a conversation and has a good sense of humour. The younger employees tend to have much less of an outgoing attitude, but their courteous and will get you in and out quick.

My recommendation is to go on days when you want to order their specials. Two wraps for eight bucks is a pretty good deal. It can feed two, or one really hungry person."}
{"text":"How surprising is it for a middle eastern Shawarma place that delivers on price and quality. 

Ali bans, from an outsiders perspective is a hole in the ground and I get it. 3 years ago I wouldn't step foot into this establishment. But my taste buds have evolved and I understand what is good and what is bad. 

The meat is flavourful. Comparative to Osmow's or even halal boys or me va me (I've been going there for 13 years) the flavour in an Ali baba shawarma is far more superior. 

If you want to have a constantly good Sharwarma experience - just stick with Ali baba. You won't be displeased."}
{"text":"This place seems to have reopened with new management; management which is a lot better than before IMHO.  The vegetables now seem fresher, and the guy behind the counter seems keen on offering good customer service.

Right now there is a \"happy hour\" $3 chicken/falafel wrap special between 3pm-6pm; super cheap!

I used to avoid this place until recently, particularly when the two older men were running the place (and the lettuce and most veges were old).  Much better experience now!"}
{"text":"The only thing I will review is the falafal coz thats all I ever eat! Oh, and the fixins that go on the plate including the hummus, tabouli and salads are to die for!

And, not to mention the 2 for $3.99 falafal special every tuesday I hope never goes away! Its come down to the point now that even when we are leaving for the weekend, I grab a couple of sandwiches which we eat while driving instead of stopping at a mcdonalds or a BK to get food. 

Best falafal hands down."}
{"text":"Cheap, huge portions, but the service is hit or miss.

If you like great middle eastern at a good price, this is the place to go.

The staff is 'hit or miss' at this place and can be rude."}
{"text":"It's cheap and super good, food is delicious and awesome, and it's ver healthy. DON'T MISS IT,NEVER!!!!"}
{"text":"Tasty shawarmas in a convenient location, across the street from broadview station. 

The meat is shaved off the spit and grilled to form a bit of texture when you bite into the sandwich. Tasty and warm! They have the regular shawarma toppings - lettuce, onions, garlic (toum), pickled beets, cabbage. tomatoes, hot peppers, tabouleh (i think this is extra though). Tahini and hot sauce optional.  I recommend you do it up! have the sandwich as it was intended!!! The pita is then put on the grill press to toast the pita up a bit. 

The sandwich is a good portion- it fills you up.  It's decently priced - not the cheapest - but not the most expensive. I think it's between 6-7 for sandwich and drink.

I am also a huge fan of the fish. It's lighter, but definitely packs flavour. It does get a bit soggy at the end of the sandwich though. So maybe ask them to make sure to not go so heavy on the sauces. 

I have seen people get the plates - and they pile on the food! 

They have daily specials- so falafel days I find are the most popular. 

The guys working there are friendly, but not exactly the most efficient...service can be slow."}
{"text":"This place does not honor it's prices. Jan 31st they were saying you can get a shawarma sandwich for $2 for all of February. Two weeks later it was $2.99 and February 23rd it was regular price. Very poor customer service."}
{"text":"First of all, the food and the price here is pretty good, especially those daily specials. Tues is $5 for 2 falafels! I normally HATE falafels but for some reason, the ones here are really good. They know how to make their food. 

Customer service here sucks though. Maybe it's a language barrier but they're pretty rude sometimes. Everytime I come, I make my order and he always ends it with \"go pay now\". Geez, I'm obviously going to pay. 

The only reason I come back is because it makes for a cheap and delicious lunch. If they didn't have that kind of food, I wouldn't come at all."}
{"text":"I'm going to give this 1.5 stars because the lentil soup and samosas are pretty good.

These are the other items I've tried:

Beef shawarma wrap - consistently nasty (someone from my office actually has them cater her events); really fatty meat, flavourless, dry and very, very stingy with the toppings.  

Falafel wrap - kind of on the nasty side.  When I ordered it, the girl was painfully stingy with the toppings and said, as a one off, she would not \"charge\" me for some tabbouleh in the sandwich - like all Middle Eastern places I go to don't charge - WTF!  Kind of felt gross after eating it.

Shish Tawook wrap - It wasn't too bad but not too good either.  They really need to add more sauce to enhance the flavours.  When I say stingy, it's like a tablespoon of tahini/garlic sauce they add.  Also, wrapped loose so food went everywhere.  Kind of felt gross after eating this too.

Grape leaves - again, gross ... ice cold and leaves were not tender.

Anyway, it always has a huge line-up but I think that's mainly due to the lack of good restaurants in the food court.  Also, the food looks like it would be delicious but I think that's where people get fooled."}
{"text":"Honestly, one of the best fast food shawarmas in the west end. The meat can be a little salty at times but, overall, it's seasoned well, not fatty and they are not stringy with the toppings.

My only complaint is that it gets very, very hot in there during the summer months."}
{"text":"I had shawarma platter yesterday, ad it was the worst shawarma I ever ate; very dry and bland
:( In the past I ate their falafel and it was ok.
Be careful and ask them to cut the shawarma in front of your eyes"}
{"text":"Got here at 10:15 am. The staff were busy setting up for lunch and everything looked fresh and delicious. I ordered a shawarma sandwich and it was great - big, bursting with flavour and presented quickly and politely. If that's anything to go on, I'll be back."}
{"text":"Nothing could go wrong here. Best falafel or shawarma for the price. Offers are good. Staff is friendly. Best place to go for a quick snack or dinner in the area"}
{"text":"Went here to get 6 wraps and some side orders of rice for a meeting, should be straightforward enough. I let 2 customers go ahead of me because I wasn't in a rush when it was 1/2 hour until the meeting, but by the time my order was actually ready I was in a major rush. 2 staff members working-  one could have been preparing the falafel while the other was helping the customers ahead of me. Instead, it was only after their orders were complete that she started. Finally when it was all ready, they  had absolutely no cutlery for the rice, they suggested I wait until they bought some from the dollar store. Had to go to Tim Horton's in a hurry after leaving there."}
{"text":"Big portions. Tasty chicken shawarma and pretty good garlic potatoes. ingredients were fresh. friendly lady behind the counter."}
{"text":"This place is okay for food, but treats Asian people differently, they give less chicken and veggies for Asian and when you ask, they say they wrap it differently.

However I was inspecting and white people clearly got a full load of portion compared to Asian people."}
{"text":"2 chicken shawarmas for $13, nuff said. Fantastic taste. Service is friendly and welcoming. Love this place!"}
{"text":"I forget lunch, I just come here & get a felafel. It's that simple. Crunch of fried chickpea, tang of pickles & tahini. And Tuesday they're two for one, which is great. Come on in & grab yourself one. Or two. 

The shawarma & shish tawouk also look tasty."}
{"text":"Food was mediocre, my falafel was cold and a bit too much batter for my liking, big portions tho for $7.50
The rice was kind of odd, had some dark black mushrooms in it"}
{"text":"This is the type of place you would go to when you're desperate for falafel, and too lazy to go anywhere else.

It's a serviceable falafel, but it's too small to be filling, and too expensive to warrant buying a second.

It'll do in a pinch, but that's about it."}
{"text":"Had a chicken sandwich on saturday night which was excellent. Returned on sunday night for another, but was disappointed.  The chicken was dry.  I suspect that the chicken and gyro/lamb+ beef meats are \"leftover\" a little too long.  Was also concerned with the cleanliness of the place, but have not suffered any \"revenge\"."}
{"text":"Very good food, came late before getting a bus back to NYC, and they stay open, which is nice. Guy at the counter thought I was trying to give him a fake American 20 dollar bill. At first I thought he was joking, but then, he takes it, shines it up to the light, asks another employee if they take American money, asks it out to dinner, etc. Like, really? Seriously? I actually said to him, who do you think I am? It was a little off-putting and let's just say, he didn't get any kind of tip. Excellent combo deals, a good amount of food and a soda for under eight dollars. I would come back."}
{"text":"Since my review a year ago (see below), I have encountered nothing but poor service from this establishment. Firstly, we once waited an hour and a 1/2 for our delivery, believing we called the Peter St location which is only 3 blocks away from us. Tonight I called the number for Peter St that comes up when you google it and ordered for pick up (I had learned my lesson). I arrived at 6:30pm to find the door locked. Thinking maybe they went to the washroom, I knocked as the lights were still on. A young man in the back came to the door while putting his shirt on!! and said he just closed because it was too slow. At 6:30pm? And how gross to be walking thru a resto with your shirt off! The number on the door matched the one I called and turns out its for the Dundas and Church location, clear across town! Never again. Too bad. 

Previous review:
I never thought I'd feel compelled to comment on a fast food joint but the sandwich I had was amazing! I have been searching for good Lebanese since Montreal.
I ordered delivery thru Just Eat and was able to select all my toppings, which was so great. Fresh, yummy deliciousness delivered promptly."}
{"text":"I regret going here. I ordered beef and ended up getting chicken, which i couldve rolled with. Except their portioning is pathetic. It was basically an expensive lettuce shawarma."}
{"text":"One of the best Ali Baba locations in the city.  Definitely the nicest guys behind the counter.  They know that I want some of both types of rice and get my plate ready!  I'm a particular fan of their grilled chicken on days I'm feeling less than stellar.   Tell the lads to load up your sandwich or plate - you won't be able to finish it.  I carry baggies in my purse to be prepared for any drop-ins at this Ali Baba - there's always something to carry home for the pupsters.   

The cleanest/least scary bathrooms in any Ali Baba I've been in.  Some of them are wicked scary.   That's actually almost enough to go to 4.5 *"}
{"text":"The ppl that run this place are pretty efficient and fairly nice. The food is okay but the portions are small... at least the wraps are. I ate in but the place is pretty grimey. Would probably not do so again."}
{"text":"Cheap, delicious, healthy, and friendly.

Love the falafel plate, the vegetables are quite fresh, the hummus and hot sauce is just right. For a big lunch under $8, you can't go wrong."}
{"text":"Went there on thursday at 6pm and the place was closed. Please update the hours. It was quite a walk from my hotel :-("}
{"text":"This is definitely one of the better stores in this franchise, came here after a comedy show nearby and had a great time. The storefront is an unassuming walk in but further to the back there's enough seating for about 30 people. 

The place is clean, well lit and  for under $20 3 of us had a variety of stuff ranging from samosas to rice, baklava and falaffel. Everything here was fresh and and service was great though a bit slow. Regardless, its cheaper than McDonalds or all of the fancy restopubs in the immediate area so have some fun and relax if you're in the area after a show at the Music Hall or comedy clubs nearby"}
{"text":"This place is a great addition to the area amongst all of the resto-pubs and kitchy hipster joints in the immediate area. Great flavors, friendly service and always ample seating. This chain is kind of hit an miss with franchisees running their locations with varying levels of service but this is one of the good ones and needs to be acknowledged for it. The only issue I've had here was dried garlic potatos which were probably a bit old, outside of that this place has never disappointed."}
{"text":"I usually come here on Tuesdays for their falafel special but their service is so bad I've decided to boycott them.

I asked a worker how much their baklava is and he said $2.50 each, then mumbled to his coworker in Arabic. I thought it was expensive but I bought 4 anyway, which was over $10. Right after I look at the sign above and it says a box of baklava is $2.50 and a large is $6.50... Tell me how I got overcharged and paid $10 for 4 little baklava when a large box is $6.50. 

The customer service here is disgusting and I never want to step foot inside anymore. The workers always serve you with such an attitude. I've heard so many complaints about this location and it's all true."}
{"text":"One of the best Alibaba places in TO. 
There are many in town, but they are very different and there's a great deal of inconsistsncy. however, this location is my #1. 
Great food portions and nice quality food. Friendly staff. They have a happy hour option after 6 or 7 PM which is totally awesome. 6$ for any plate. Given the portion size an d quality it is totally worth it. I will definitely recommend this place, espacially the happy hour :-)"}
{"text":"Worst Ali Baba place in Toronto..bad quality food, small portions and teribble customer service.
Waste of money and time"}
{"text":"This place is such a rip off - ordered and paid for a \"large greek salad\" only to receive a soup container filled with day old lettuce and no dressing. AVOID!"}
{"text":"Great food. Fresh produce. Friendly service."}
{"text":"All rice options have onions so I had to get 2 salads instead. Portions were terrible--not even 75% filled. And the service is not exactly friendly. Don't bother with this place."}
{"text":"I have to say the quality has improved remarkably. The veggies are fresher and the meat is juicy. The team now gets orders right and everyone seems to follow a process which leads to quick and accurate service. The shish tawook on Thursdays is excellent."}
{"text":"The food is really good. The atmosphere is a little lacking but since the food is cheap, you should not be expecting harps playing nearby. 

The people there are friendly but kurt. If you are ok with that, try the place out. If you are a wuss, don't even bother as you will be whining all night long afterwards. Ok, it is not that crazy but don't expect amazing service, just fast."}
{"text":"The name of the game here are the daily specials.  I came today and had two fresh tasting chicken wraps for $9 total. 

Tomorrow (Wednesday) they do a large shawarma platter for $6 I think.

I would come early when the ingredients are hot and fresh - the fading and old interior which hasn't been renovated for probably 20 plus years sort of sketches me out so I wouldn't eat here if you have a choice. 

Otherwise the staff is friendly and personable."}
{"text":"Cheap good tasty and not-too-dry Middle Eastern food. Waitress was really nice and generous. Fish of the day is probably something to try (it looks good but the dish was still full at 5PM = why?).
 
Not sure I would seat and eat there (not really appealing at all) but this is now one of my new (take away) lunch place."}
{"text":"This food... No. Ali Baba's usually pretty good for an average place. Meat quality is kind of bad... Great deal for 2 shawarmas but they don't taste that great. The veggies are fresh I guess, but the meat is what matters most. Really friendly and talkative owners. But would not make me come back."}
{"text":"Big restaurant on a busy street ( Dundas St west )
They shouldn't be thinking very cheap. 
trying to charge you for a small bread. Which is already comes  with your shawarma plate."}
{"text":"Best chicken shawarma sandwich I've had in Toronto."}
{"text":"Big portions, low prices, and low quality beef Shawarma. Wifi works fine. Chicken Shawarma is your best bet here. The washrooms are downstairs and look run down. They also have shisha upstairs."}
{"text":"The falafel plate is pretty delicious but the male server behind the counter was a right grumpy c*nt. When I asked for less rice and more salad he got angry and very rude, even when I said I'd pay extra for it! I don't need that kind of energy when I have lunch and so I won't be coming back here..."}
{"text":"Not bad but not great. Staff are cool. Sometimes it's a bit inconsistent but overall good for value. Chicken Sharwarma is my go to here. Toppings are fresh and sometimes there is a wide variety. Other times just the usual suspects. Great for budget seekers."}
{"text":"The food here is Middle Eastern Cuisine on a budget. The hummus was decent enough. The falafel was soft on the crust which is not how I like it. Get it crunk and crunchy is what I say. The service was excellent and I enjoyed the conversation with the staff. The one girl said she wants to move back down to the states to Virginia. That blew me away. Toronto is now my favorite city and she wanted to go back to Virginia. I guess some people like soft falafel too so why not? Choose your own adventure."}
{"text":"I'm not gonna lie, eating inside the restaurant isn't the best experience. It's small, and while sitting near the back, at least during the last visit, you get strong wafts of what smells like the inside of a portable toilet. 

That being said (and that's the sole reason 1 star was docked), the FALAFEL SANDWICH here is insane. Crunchy falafel, crisp lettuce/tomatoes, pickled turnips, pickled cabbage, tahini sauce, garlic sauce, hummus and onions are nestled in a warm pita, then placed in the panini press. 

Sides of LENTIL RICE and RICE PILAF are equally as mindblowing, and sides of BAKLAVA are cheap and yummy.

Sure, it's a chain, but you can't argue with a damned good sandwich."}
{"text":"For some reason, I walked into Ali Baba's with the feeling that I was the first person EVER to set foot in this restaurant. I'm not sure why I felt this way. My dining companions watched amusedly as I asked the staff when the restaurant had opened. When they told me 10am, I beamed with excitement. \"They haven't even been open one day!\" I exclaimed. But my friends were quick to clarify. \"Were you open yesterday?\"

\"Yep,\" was the reply, \"every day.\" Turns out they have been open for months. Whatever.

It's pretty spacious inside but not exactly a marvel of hospitality. The stairs to the washroom look like they could cripple a man, and have been cordoned off with the equivalent of a child safety gate, but for adults. I can't wait to see someone eat it on those things.

A few things worth nothing about this Ali Baba's. They have daily deals which nets you a sandwich or two at a steal. We took advantage of a pair chicken shawarmas for $7.99. In typical Ali Baba fashion the wraps were excellent. Especially since I washed mine down with Strawberry Milk. I can't believe they sell that stuff here. (Or anywhere for that matter.)

You can pay with debit or credit if you like. There wasn't a line up when I went (around 2am) but I've heard it can get pretty busy here.

Obligatory Title Pun: Open Late (and SESAME).

Menu Readability: Better than average.

Need to mention: Have you actually read the story of Ali Baba?

What this place teaches me about myself: I can eat shawarma anytime of day."}
{"text":"Holy shit this place is disgusting i dont even understand how it has more than 2 stars!!!! Today i got a chicken wrap and when i took a bite thank god i looked inside because i saw a dead black fly in there mixed with my chicken and veggies. I warn everyone to AVOID this place at all costs. Not to mention their staff a

DO NOT GO HERE UNLESS YOU WANT EXTRA MEAT BY THAT I MEAN DEAD BUGS IN YOUR WRAPS"}
{"text":"Having recently moved from Bloor West Village where we regularly ate at the Ali Baba on Bloor, we were excited to have a new location so close to our new house.

Went for our first take-out tonight and am sad to say that all locations are certainly not the same.   

The service was good, but the food was very lacking. 

Portion size of the chicken shawarma platter meal was about half of what we used to get and the chicken wasn't even editable.  Ended up leaving most of my chicken and just ate the rice.

Very disappointed with our first experience, but figure we will try it out one more time, just to make sure our first bad experience was not a fluke occurrence."}
{"text":"I ordered a falafel wrap with all the toppings and a can of pop and the meal was delicious and a good value, at less than $6. If you go on Tuesdays, falafel wraps are 2 for 1.  If you cross the street, you can go into the Ryerson engineering building, where there are many benches to sit and enjoy your lunch."}
{"text":"Been a while since I've had a post-drinks shawarma. This location in the chain is fairly clean, staff were friendly and my wrap was made quickly using fresh ingredients.

The prices were reasonable, although tabbouleh was an extra charge. All said, very satisfied overall and would return again if in the area."}
{"text":"This place is so amazing. I've gone to other locations and it's not as tasty as this location. I'm surprised at the bad reviews here. I noticed the week night staff not as good, but the day time guys that run the place are really nice. The falafals and beef shwarmas are the best!"}
{"text":"Consistent and always delicious.  No issues ever. Great staff, but the specs are a little cramped when you are trying to squeeze by other customers on your way out."}
{"text":"Rough.

I'm not a big fan of Ali Baba's generally but there are worse middle-eastern places in Toronto and at least you know what you are getting. This location however, is not the best. I have frequented this location enough times-  being local to my area - usually for the 2 for 1 falafel wrap Tuesdays. In that time I have seen every kind of comedy occur, from pathetically wilted lettuce to a falafel sandwich without the falafel. 

It's cheap and fast, but there is not much else going for Ali Baba's."}
{"text":"Very happy to return to Ali Baba's for this week's visit to Toronto.

Pros:

- Great value for the money - both Don and I got the chicken shawarma plate, which includes rice (lentil rice is my favorite), tabouleh, green salad, garlic sauce (ask for extra!), hummus, and lots of tender, flavorful chicken. If you like spice, you can get hot sauce added to your chicken. We also tried one each of the beef, chicken, and veggie samosas; we liked veggie the best.
- Friendly staff.
- Quick service.
- Excellent location.

Cons:

- None that I can think of.

Worth stopping in for a well-priced, tasty meal. There are plenty of locations around the city for when you're craving some Middle Eastern cuisine."}
{"text":"Indulged in some  Falafel. Great customer service and at the right price. Only Loonies and Toonies will get you far with these guys who are very accommodating and helpful.  Try their falafel sandwich, which I usually inhale in the matter of minutes. The next morning you'll still be burping it."}
{"text":"Decent Shawarma at average prices.  Nothing spectacular but daily deals here are a plus.   To me this is a better bet than the other place down the street (not sure of the name but at corner of Chestnut and Dundas)."}
{"text":"I had a great experience here today! Wonderful, very friendly staff. They work hard and go far and beyond, to provide  excellent customer service (which is not the case at many other restaurants in the city!) 
The food is very tasty and exceeded my expectations! 
I recommend trying a platter, great potatoes and rice as well as grilled meat and fresh veggies."}
{"text":"After a little bit of a long journey to the Danforth music hall, I was feeling some schwarma, this is the first restaurant of this brand name I tried, the team that was cooking was very very good at cooking the food for nothing only me, but other customers in line, almost working to military perfection. The food was beautiful, very very well seasoned and good toppings to go with the wrap. I only have a tiny complaint, which isn't one at all, they need to have a regular and a large option for the wraps, I had ordered it as large and I guess they only have one size, if your in the area for a concert...don't go to pizza pizza with the goofy doors. Come here instead!!!"}
{"text":"Been there a couple of times during the lunchtime. Not bad, neither something to dream about. Keeping in mind that Norah Shawarma went quite down lately, Ali Baba was a reasonable replacement.

I don't really enjoy those loud \"AAAHH HOW ARE YOU MY VERY BEST FRIEND!!!\" yells at the entrance, but looks like as soon as you softly downplay them once, you get remembered and next time things go smoothly and quiet.

Food is ok. I like the salads, but meat is generally on the over-fried side. That's not bad, as it looks and feels like a desired effect - just different from many other places where there's more meat and less carbon and oil in the shawarma. Again - that's just my taste, and as a lunchtime meal it was ok!

Price is very cheap for the zone, which makes the place additionally attractive. It doesn't look big, but there is enough space to seat a couple of friends. It is rather dark and \"cozy\" inside sort of like a cave, but when in those places one don't want to pay attention to details anyways...

So honest 3 stars, nothing particularly wrong (or particularly inviting) about Ali Baba as a lunch place. Not recommended for anything beyond that."}
{"text":"the taste was good. But serve is so bad! Negative attitude.  I have ordered a student special combo, the size is so small, just a little bit rice.... serious????"}
