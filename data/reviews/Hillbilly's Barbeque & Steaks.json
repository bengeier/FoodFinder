{"text":"What a wonderful experience my family had for dinner at Hillbillys. The Staff were friendly,  knowledgeable,  and eager to make our dining experience great! The food was super yummy and filled us up. We eat here often and will definitely return! 

Thank you and keep up the great work...."}
{"text":"Middle of the road people,  middle of the road!  BBQ and sides are decent but nothing to write home about.  If you are a local and need a BBQ fix its okay,  however it's far from the top on award winning BBQ and doesn't deserve an out of the way drive."}
{"text":"I smelled the BBQ from the interstate and was not disappointed.  Yea it looks like an older style steak house but man the food was great."}
{"text":"Hushpuppies are addictive. This place is the real deal in Carolina BBQ and is worth the trip out of Charlotte. I take out-of-town guests here for authentic Southern cuisine."}
{"text":"I visited this restaurant tonight with my family after being tempted by the smell of hickory smoke while getting gas at  nearby gas station. The place didn't disappoint at all. Combined we tried all of their meats (ribs, pulled/sliced pork, smoked chicken and sliced beef) and everything was moist and the perfect level of smoke. While eating, and discussing the food one of the people with me made an off handed comment about preferring her sliced pork cut thinned and a man (possible cook/owner/manager) got up from a nearby table and offered to get her a fresh stock cut thinner. We also tried a number of sides (bbq beans, hillbilly fries, sweet potato fries, potato salad, hushpuppies and texas toast. The sides were fresh and perfectly cooked/chilled. The sweet potato fries come topped with a cinnamon-sugar sprinkle which is to die for and could only be enhanced with a marshmellow cream to dip them in. The portions and price are very comparable with other places in the area. The service was sweet, polite, fast and educated on the menu. The decor is a bit cheesy/cheap and looks like a dive but the food more than makes up for it needing a decor update. I would suggest it to any friends of family with a hankering for BBQ that find themselves in Lowell."}
{"text":"This is a great hole in the wall right off of I85. The barbecue, hush puppies and sweet tea were all great. Everything you want from a road trip food break."}
{"text":"To start, they need to overhaul the interior. I remember all their locations looking pretty ragged 15 years ago, and they haven't changed. The carpet is frayed, the floors are dirty, the tables don't have coverings so you can see the grease on top and the gum on the bottom, the chairs are old and uncomfortable and the display at the checkout was just really sad. There was one candy case of some sad looking m&m's in the middle of a dusty display case. 

Okay okay so it looks crappy. How's the food?

Not much better. My mom and I both ordered pulled pork platters with fries and onion rings for me and fries and potato salad for her. They bring out free hushpuppies, and that's lovely! Except, they're gross little hard hushpuppies that taste like they were made a week ago and reheated in a microwave. The fries weren't extraordinary, clearly out of a freezer burnt bag. My mom didn't care for her potato salad but she wasn't very specific. The onion rings were a little thick for my taste, and it tasted like they don't change the oil enough. The BBQ itself had no color to speak of. No smoke ring, no flavor. The only color and flavor you get is when you mix in the heavy BBQ sauce that comes already poured out on your pork. I've tasted better sauce out of a bottle from grocery stores. 

It seems to be a recurring problem in BBQ restaurants around Gastonia that the meat has no flavor and has been destroyed to the point where the texture resembles something that I feed my cat. 

Bottom line: Don't waste your money here on food you could replicate at home for less (and actually get some flavor out of!)"}
{"text":"Hillbilly's is usually our go-to place for great bar-b-que; not anymore.  Our son's birthday party was at Hillbilly's because he loves the food there, but I noticed he only ate two bites of his food at the party.  Well, when we got home and I sampled his food I found out why.  It was nothing but GRISTLE AND FAT!  It was a ratio of 10 percent edible meat and 90 percent fat!  I'm sorry, but I expect better from this place.  We won't be returning any time soon, which I hate because they USED to be so good!

The ONLY reason for the second star is the woman who waited on us.  She was great.  Earned them another star they normally wouldn't have gotten for the horrible food my son got on his birthday!"}
{"text":"Restarunt was not busy and there were plenty of tables empty. The girl at the register didn't even acknowledge that we walked in. After a couple minutes I suggested we leave loud enough to be heard. The young lady turned toward us and said she would be right back. But she didn't come right back. Then another young lady came to the counter and said they would be right back. They didn't come back either. So we walked out and went to Shanes BBQ at Northlake and had some excellent ribs and chicken plus sides. I would recommend you pass by this local favorite until they get better staff"}
{"text":"Good pork barbecue . Excellent portions and friendly fast service. Over 55 menu makes lunch less than fast-food. Thanks Hillbilly's."}
{"text":"I found the food very flavorful and moist.  Ribs had good amount of meat.  Beef was very good.  I was surprised by the  high quality of the potato salad and Mac and cheese. 
The presentation was basic and on small plates.  But I don't eat those. 
I hope to get a chance to stop back."}
{"text":"Kitchen has to be the slowest I've ever seen. Waitress was nice, hostess seemed pissed that we would interrupt her day. Hope the food is at least decent.

UPDATE: I won't be back. Lunch was served after 45 minutes of waiting, and it was cold. Such a shame. This is the only real BBQ option on Sunday."}
{"text":"We had our company Christmas party here on a Friday evening.  The servers, Anna & Blair were very friendly, helpful, and attentive.  We had a group of 20, and they helped us arrange the tables in a group, they stayed alert to people as they straggled in and made sure they got their drink order promptly.  Everyone's food came out within a period of about 3 minutes, and it was hot and delicious.  They checked on us frequently, and handled requests happily.  The dining room was clean, they had Christmas music playing, and we didn't feel rushed at all.  One of the best Christmas dinners we've had in a several years (at other restaurants).  We've found a keeper and will be back again next year."}
{"text":"I tried this resturant Saturday evening. I was driving home and thought I give this place a shot. The first thing was the hushpuppies were cold. The bar-b-que sauce was ok sweet if you like it that ways. Ok I ordered a combo with ribs and choped beef. The food was very salty. I believe the quality of the meat is very poor. The taste was just barly passable for meat. I also order fries and steak bread. The fries were ok and the bread was very good. I could of had a meal on the bread and been happier. I tried so nothing ventured worth a shot but won't be back."}
{"text":"Our experience here was limited to take-out. The wait was longer than expected for chopped beef sandwiches, considering the restaurant was nearly empty at the time. The pit master's explanation was that he chopped the beef to order. During our wait, the seating hostess kept checking back with us. She couldn't have been sweeter - the kind of courtesy and charm taught you by your parents, rather than by a manager. She got us a beverage while we waited. Unfortunately, the tea couldn't have been sweeter either (even the hostess acknowledged this,) reminding me that in the South one must specify \"unsweet.\" When the sandwiches finally arrived, they were delicious, even to a chauvinistic Texas barbeque snob. This is not a place one goes for atmosphere; it's a big open room with windows on three sides, kind of like a barbeque Denny's."}
{"text":"Good place for authentic southern BBQ. 
Site: 4/5 clean and homey, adequate parking by a Shell station right off I-85.  Travelers will find it a quick stop for a break from fast food. 
Food: 4/5 Good food, tasty, and choices from BBQ, steak, burgers, and sandwiches, salad bar.  Many choices for sides including two kinds of fries, two kinds of slaw, okra, two kinds of baked potatoes, greens, green beans, etc. hearty portions. 
Price: 5/5 very reasonable prices 
Service:5/5  fast, pleasant, efficient. A+
Will stop in future trips by here"}
{"text":"I came through here back in 1995 and the food was awesome. The BBQ smell just reaches out to the interstate and makes you drool.
I got the HillBilly's Monster Burger medium and it was just the meat and a bun but it was succulent.
I got a side of collards and aside salad."}
{"text":"Good bbq no doubt but prices are a little high for the amount you get especially if you get a 1 trip salad bar. Favorite thing here is the hushpuppies! Bbq sauce is really good too. Homemade salad dressings are yummy. Onion rings not too great in my opinion. Kids love the Mac and cheese. All in all it hits the spot but for a not to pretty price."}
{"text":"We stopped in by recommendation from my dad's co-worker on our way to see the lights in McAdenville. To say the least, I should have trusted Yelp over him. 

To start out positive, the restaurant is very spacious and the staff were all friendly. Furthermore, it really is a prime location if you're trying to see the lights. I recommend getting there around 3ish in order to avoid the RIDICULOUS traffic in the evening. 

That being said, our whole party unanimously agreed the food was subpar. To be fair, I was biased going in because I'm a BIG fan of Eastern Carolina BBQ, while they serve Western. However, the food was really just lackluster all around. We got a variety of menu items, none of which shined. Furthermore, the portion sizes were very small. No one left full by any means. The prices accurately reflect what you'll receive, though. 

But really, when you're eating at a place called Hillbilly's, you probably shouldn't expect much."}
{"text":"If you need a great caterer for a pool party, Birthday party, graduation party, church gathering, wedding party or just friends hanging out somewhere, look no further than Hillbillies in Lowell, NC.  My family used them for our Mom's 90th Birthday party on July 30, 2016. They have some the best barbeque around.  The \"slaw\" is to die for; you will be coming back for more if you like good slaw like me. The fried okra was superb and mouthwatering.  The barbeque was moist and delicious.  They bring the food to your location and even set up. You just keep visiting with friends as they set up for you.   The delivery folks from Hillbillies are so friendly and accommodating. Please don't look no further than Hillbillies in Gaston County for some good food while you have fun with family and friends. Larry Wilbanks 8/1/16"}
{"text":"Umm  look if you do not smell smoke then how are they cooking it.? Bruce I know you have been to better places than this..Like the Grocery Store in the plastic container in the meat Department.. No No No.. No BBQ here. Look at the menu when there are more non BBQ items on the menu  than BBQ items then its not a BBQ joint.."}
{"text":"Hillbilly's: Garrison Blvd. is better. Friendly service. Small salad bar."}
{"text":"Service took forever. One of the teenage staff members told me that they weren't seating anybody because they were out of silverware, so I ordered to go. It still took around 20 minutes to get my food, which is pretty long considering BBQ should already be prepared. 

I got a combo plate of ribs and pulled pork. The pulled pork was so dry, I had to cover it on sauce. The ribs were tender, but could use some seasoning. Also, the potato salad was pretty much mashed potatoes mixed with equal parts mayo...not sure if that's a Carolina thing, but that wasn't what I expected at all."}
{"text":"Best brisket I have ever had.  The sauces are amazing and the hushpuppies are world class.  Must visit for the best in the South!"}
{"text":"Some of the best BBQ I've had! When you pull in to Hillbilly's in Lowell (the original) for the first time, you might think twice about your choice. See, it shares it's parking lot with a gas station. Don't judge this book by it's cover! Fine dining it is not, but if you're looking for smoky BBQ chicken, tender ribs, and mouthwatering pulled pork and beef, look no further! Also, forget the complementary basket of bread. They serve hot out the fryer hush puppies that's are TO. DIE. FOR. Their original sauce is a traditional KC/west Carolinas tomato based concoction of yummy. They also have a vinegar based sauce and a hot version of the original, but we've not tried those. Don't miss this North Carolina gem!!"}
{"text":"Am visiting my fiance's family down here in NC for the holidays, and in the midst of making last minute stops for gift shopping, we stopped here for lunch. Our server was very friendly, and brought our table free refills of our drinks, amongst other things. 
I had the BBQ beef sandwich with a cup of chicken noodle soup (soup of the day); the soup hit the spot as it was chilly & rainy outdoors, and the BBQ beef was tasty, and there was some extra BBQ sauce on the table which I used to add to the sandwich. The sweet tea was delicious, as back home in CT it is something that's not usually available. 
I've had better BBQ but for today it was pretty good. 
One observation I made was the salad bar area, I felt that there were not enough selections, such as in lettuce....there is a world beyond iceberg lettuce but perhaps that's just me."}
{"text":"First time visit yesterday.  I had the 12 oz. Ribeye, a baked potato and the salad bar.  Provided complimentary hush puppies.  Enjoyed the steak; cooked as requested with tasteful seasoning (I did not order any special/extra $ seasoning).  Baked potato a little small but no biggy.  Salad bar not too extensive.  Bacon bits not real.  Service was very prompt and I was checked on often.  I will be back!"}
{"text":"I can't tell you if the food is any count at this restaurant, because we didn't stay long enough to eat there.  When we got there our party (party of 8) was there to celebrate my dad's birthday.  They made it pretty obvious they weren't happy to see us come in.  The entire restaurant was empty, save for about five other tables where other patrons were tightly packed in like sardines; but that didn't stop them from trying to fit a TABLE FOR EIGHT in a hole that wouldn't accommodate four!  Their excuse?  \"We only have one waitress.\"  Say what?  We were there thirty minutes before the dinner rush!  Instead of subjecting ourselves to an uncomfortable meal where we would be packed in, trying desperately to avoid hitting the person dining just inches away from us, we all walked out and went to Twin Tops instead.  Twin Tops was crowded, but they sat us right away at a nice, roomy table, and they hustled to make sure we got the best service we could get!  It was such a great dining experience, and I'm so glad we didn't stay at Hillbilly's!  I had heard this place was going downhill for quite a while now, but having been out of state for five years, we thought we'd go for the nostalgia factor.  BIG MISTAKE!  I don't think we'll ever darken the doors of what used to be one of my favorite restaurants ever again.  And, the next time we're in Gastonia, we'll head anywhere else but here.  We already know Twin Tops is a great restaurant; we'll probably just head there!"}
{"text":"Great Good and fantastic service. Very reasonable prices. You will want the smoke smell as a perfume!"}
{"text":"Let me ask you this:  Can you drive down 85 south and smell the mouth watering, smoky, honey-laced, barbecue smell without stopping at Hillbilly's?  I dare you to try.  Let me be honest, though... I'm not into the whole Eastern Carolina vs. Western Carolina BBQ feud thing.  Both kinds of sauce are equally tasty, and BBQ for me is an every now and then treat, not a way of life.  But get this, peeps..... THEY GIVE YOU HUSH PUPPIES LIKE MEXICAN RESTAURANTS GIVE YOU CHIPS.  Just set 'em right out on the table when you sit down.  That, my friends, is worth a trip out of Charlotte.  The BBQ is great, the chicken is great, the fries are great, the service is great, and it's got a cute log-cabin-y feel to it on the inside.  One of the few non-national-chain restaurants Gaston County has to offer, and certainly a winner!"}
{"text":"It's alright. The service was great, the ambience was classic, the fried okra was perfect, & the ribs were delicious, but everything else was \"meh\". It was a cool experience, but food wasn't special. Coleslaw, potato salad, ginger chicken sandwich was bland, something was missing.

{"text":"My wife and I ate here this afternoon after hiking at Crowders mountain.  The staff was attentive and courteous and seated us in a reasonable amount of time.  Our waitress answered our questions and explained all of their sauces and made good recommendations.  We split the ribs and pulled pork plate which came with unlimited hush puppies, fried okra and a newly added dish which was a vinegar-based macaroni salad.  The meal came out in good time and it was nice that the meats were delivered without sauce.  The ribs were very good even without sauce and the pulled pork had nice burnt ends mixed in and both had good flavor.  She brought us 4 different sauces and I have to admit that the sweet vinegar and the spicy sauces were far-and-away the best.  Overall we thoroughly enjoyed our experience at Hillbilly's and will definitely swing in again the next time we pass through Gastonia."}
{"text":"Well, I am in the south, I guess. When I pulled up I noticed there were only Caucasian customers leaving the restaurant. When I walked in there were only Caucasian patrons and workers. Okay, fine.  The person at the main register asked me if I was picking up a to-go order, I replied no.   She then asked me if I wanted to place a to-go order, well, seemed like that was my only option so I did such.  
The food was good, I ordered the Large BBQ beef plate with macaroni and cheese and green beans the macaroni and cheese was dry, and burnt but it was still good. The BBQ Beef was the best I have ever had. Everything was piping hot, I really enjoyed the food."}
{"text":"Stopped here on a whim, passing through. Super friendly staff, unpretentious place. I got the combo plate - very good though not stellar like some bbq places. Interesting vinegar slaw. Price was reasonable. People talk funny down here."}
{"text":"I think the food here is pretty solid, though it is a bit of a chain. It's still good, pit cooked barbecue with all the usual sides and fillings. Vegetarians, move along.

I met several friends here for a retirement dinner. Oops, there's a whole large room in the back so if you're looking for people, head back there.

The staff did a good job of catering to our large table of 20 people, getting the food orders and bringing it out to us accurately and promptly. They also did well at keeping the drinks refilled.

I had the pound plate of ribs and after nibbling on a couple of the excellent hush puppies, I had half of the ribs and most of the baked potato to go home in a box. The ribs were quite moist though perhaps a little chewier than perfect. I'm still picking yummy bits of meat out of my teeth!"}
