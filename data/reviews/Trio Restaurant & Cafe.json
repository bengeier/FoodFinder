{"text":"Came in with the wife thinking this was a family restaurant. Wrong. They had half naked girls belly dancing on the big screen the whole time we were there. Also if you dont smoke, do not bother coming here as you will choke on everyone else's second hand smoke. We ordered the mixed platter. The rice was excellent but everything else was subpar at best. The protein portions were tiny and you could tell they were not the best quality. The garlic sauce is so small it is not sufficient for the whole meal, you will ask for more. Salad tasted like someone sprayed lemon on vegetables and served it as a salad. It might be a decent place to hang out if your with a group of male buddies, as it was mostly men drinking smoking and watching the nudie show on tv. But you might want to take your family somewhere a little more PG to save yourself the embarrassment"}
{"text":"This location has been home to at least four establishments over the last 15 years. Being a supporter of local business and with time and money to burn, my pal and I checked out Trio with no expectations. I felt somewhat underdressed because the decor  is very classy and I hadn't showered in like 4 days, (dirty hippie look) but the bartender was welcoming. We got a glass of red and soon after (when I regained my bearings) I was delighted to discover this was a hookah bar!  I ordered a Double Apple (shisha, like tobacco but sweeter, and comes in pucks, plus you smoke it from a 3' tall bong so it's  extra smooth)
My pal Rob doesn't smoke but he loved the trio of Mediterranean-style dips, baba gounosh, hummus, and ... I forget the other but they're all good and fairly nutritious. There were really good-looking meals being served so next time I go I must get some... this visit I was in it for the smoking. The atmosphere was really fuckin cool.
Check Trio out if you like chilling, hookah smoking, drinking, and the cultural aspects therein. The food i had was good too. Stay up everybody!"}
{"text":"Went to this place. Ordered a traditional egyption food which is hawawshi. The bread was soft , the meat had no flavour, took forever to cook the food which was only 1 order.  I wont recommend it to anyone."}
{"text":"Clean restaurant! Clean hookah! Best hookah good service and price is good. Yesterday we stopped at a hookah shop the hose was sticky and cost roughly 10 dollars more. Their excuse was that other shops charge you per coal. Needless to say I won't trust a Yelp review for the best shisha spot in Calgary anymore. Highly recommend this place not rated the best just goes to show hidden gems are better than artificially created reviews."}
{"text":"a new place to discover, and what a pleasant surprise in a location that has turned over many times before.  we happened on this lovely spot, and spent a beautiful afternoon on a beautiful patio, with great service, and help in selecting our first flavor of shisa - and lots of great vegetarian options!"}
{"text":"Trio is our go to place to hang out and sheesha. Very cool ambience and the owner along with the entire staff is is very friendly and welcoming. Their Kofta wrap is a must try."}
{"text":"Great food! Great people and clean sheesha! Have been there multiple times and is my go to place!"}
