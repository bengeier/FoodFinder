{"text":"BEST Italian Bakery in Mississauga by far.  Everything at the hot table is delicious, esp. the veal.  Bread is always fresh and the gelato cant be beat.
The only complaint about this place is that there is only one!"}
{"text":"I've had Lazio bookmarked for agessssss and I finally tried it out! And it was amazing :)

What was ordered (see pictures): two cookies, almond croissant, apple turnover, creme filled cannoli, espresso macchiato, and cappuccino. And it was all just over $10!! How awesome is that!

They also have freshly baked bread, a huge deli, ready to eat food, etc! All the employees are super nice and SO patient. 

I wish they had a larger seating area or even an interior seating area! 

Definitely recommend :) I'm coming back for the deli!!"}
{"text":"My partner and I wanted to make some homemade pizza and were looking for pre-made pizza dough and I gotta say this place has some of the best in sauga. The dough rises really nicely and if you put cornmeal at the bottom of the dough it turns out even better. We stopped by for canollis as well and those are great too. Crunchy, not soggy."}
{"text":"Best gelato I've had in the GTA - didn't think I'd find it in this cute bakery in a random plaza near Eglinton and Mavis. Great service too."}
{"text":"Went the other day, got some buns and cold cuts for lunch for family and they were quite good, although abit higher priced and found the service lacking.  Seemed like they didnt want to answer any questions and had the attitude they were doing me a favour by answering.  Went yesterday to get a veal sandwhich and it looked good...til i took a bite and it was the most flavorless sandwhich ive ever had.  All i could taste was the provolone cheese(had sauce and peppers on it).  Cant say it was bad but it was just dissappointing.  Also service was poor again from everyone but the cashier.  I didnt know that saying \"can i get a veal sandwhich with cheese and peppers please\" was something that could upset someone.  Anyway,   Ill go back if im in the plaza anyway but wouldnt get the veal sandwhich."}
{"text":"5 stars for the products. Great cappuccino, very nice cannoli. Bought an olive smaller bread (bun), we just finished it and we feel like going back getting another one. The service is excellent. My only complaint is that the place is a bit tiny but who cares... The food is great. 
I must mention customer service. It's excellent. Everyone is paying attention to your needs, asks if you are being helped and all this with a genuine smile on their faces. Whoever manages this place deserves 5 stars. Thank you for existing in my neighborhood."}
{"text":"Its a charming little place in a small plaza. We did have a little trouble getting there though. We came in expecting a small area to sit and enjoy a coffee and maybe a pastry but were let down as there were no seating whatsoever ever. It was a little cramped and by when we got there, there wasn't a lot of pastry and breads left. What we did get was a few cannolis and for what we got it was a reasonable price and very delicious."}
{"text":"These guys have been here forever, and they still kick ass. Awesome gelato and bread."}
{"text":"Man's cannot emphasize what Lazio means to me.. I've been going there my entire life.. If I took the time to talk about it ... i would never stop.

Go and eat.

Potato pizza/rice ball/sausage/meatball"}
{"text":"Love this place! I've been in town 3 days and have stopped each day for my afternoon cappuccino and pastry. My son and I also had sandwiches one day. My veal parmigiana was excellent."}
{"text":"Came in after years of not coming in,boy I sure am sorry I ever stopped coming in, the veal on a fresh bun oh to die for, the hot sausage on a bun my husband just loved was ready to go back last weekend for another one. Waited till we went back in on last Wednesday. The bread ohh so fresh and good,pastry my downfall lock me in the store pleaseeee.
Lazio the place to go very friendly polite and very helpful helping use my walker in the store,lots of room, the staff do not rush you.
The best Lazio Italian Bakery around."}
{"text":"Not sure why I did not mention the bread in my review. 
It's  to die for old school bread it so good.
Baked throughout the day .
You can always get some kind of hot bread it's always coming out of the oven .
Voted best bakery in Mississauga. 
While your there try the croissants they are the best.
They just fly off the shelf ."}
{"text":"In sad Mississauga, this is the ONLY place I get excited for. Modest little italian grocer that has me struggling so hard not to eat all the goodies purchased during the car ride home. 

Don't leave without grabbing fresh fennel/spicy chilli taralli, torrone, cured meats, antipasto and Italian cookies - the white one with nuts in it."}
{"text":"Hidden in a small plaza, this bakery is of a decent sized. As any other Italian bakery they have a good selection of items in their bakery section. They also have the hot table option with sandwiches and pastas to buy from. That's not it... they also have a deli section and a mini-grocery store.

But I only go there for their awesome amazing walnut/ pecan nut plain cake and damn...it finishes quick. True goodness!"}
{"text":"One of Mississauga's little gem's....

I have been buying fresh bread from them for years! It is always been great service and amazing food!

They offer a variety of pastries and freshly baked goodies. They also have a wide selection of gelato for the sweet tooth in you!"}
{"text":"Love this place. try the gelato. I live 45 mins away from this place but it's worth the drive!"}
{"text":"I spent way too long intending to visit this place, and in the meantime jealously seeing other people visit and rave about the place. It was time to finally get off the bench and into the game! I've now been a couple times, and safe to say I'll be stopping by almost anytime in next in the area.

It's a pretty decent sized place. There's of course a huge selection of items from the bakery. There's also a deli area, and the centre is a mini-grocery store with some imported items.

At this point, I've ordered a few types of danishes, croissants, cannoli, bread and cappuccino. There's so much more to try, such as the hot table items and their famous gelato, but this place is already a bonafide winner for me. The quality is superb and they seem to reach the desired level for each item, whether it is: sweetness, flakiness, texture and so on. Even other things like having a good-quality fruit filling in the pastries.

As always, value is huge for me and the bill is always lower than I expect. The prices aren't listed (that I can see), yet I no longer care since I know it will be probably even better priced than I'd hope for.

A real gem of a place and anyone who leaves nearby is very lucky!"}
{"text":"Our family has been buying fresh bread from here every Saturday for years.
The fresh croissants are  amazing. Once in a while they have fresh croissants, drizzled with chocolate, sprinkled with icing sugar.

Every Saturday AM, if my mothers is not home and  I awake at 8 AM., I know when she does return, shes coming from Lazio's (or getting her hair done by the Italian Croatian hair god Ivana a few blocks away from here).

Go here - get the croissants, get some coffee, get some pastries and a loaf of fresh bread. Thank me later."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on our way out of town. They make a mean cappuccino. I purchased some of the pastries and pizza for lunch later. The pastries were very very delicious not too sweet not over done just perfect. I ended up eating the pizza sooner than lunch the dough that  they make the pizza with was super tasty. The staff was very friendly and welcoming."}
{"text":"Gelato to die for and their hot table has a number of yummy options! Great for lunch if you are in the area."}
{"text":"We got custard tart, macaron , pastry and tiramisu. All were very good. It had the right sweetness. The tiramisu and tart just melts in ones mouth. It was a chance discovery having been to maharaja restaurant..... for sure will come back 

They had a bakery section and the bread loaf seems to be worth trying. Next visit for sure"}
{"text":"Good selection of pastrys, with a to die for eclair.
Very friendly and helpful staff.
Remember to take cash/ debit"}
{"text":"This place is owned and operated by people who love what they do and have been in the business for a very long time. It definitely shows in every aspect of their business. 
Recently renovated, accented with imported high end quality Italian food service equipment and fixtures, this place is as good as it gets without going to Italy.
It's hard to drive by and not stop in for something. Everything taste great and fresh! 
I have tried their pastries, breads, espresso, cappuccino, and gelato. Holding back is the problem as you find that you can't stop stuffing your face with amazing snacks."}
{"text":"Amazing bread, coffee, cheese, cake and pastry also cant forget their ice cream , my kids loves stopping by in hot days"}
{"text":"Have gone here many times from uni until now. This plaza has so many of my loved little spots!

Favorite place for fish cutlets, cheap biryani, eyebrows and also this little gem.

Their cappuccinos are delicious and I don't normally drink coffee! 

They sweets are great, has an array of European baked cookies, cakes and eclairs. 

Their hot table also has a great range of sandwiches, aracini balls, pasta and different entrees. 

I love that they are connected to a deli and little grocery store. 

Wish parking was better and that they had a seating area!"}
{"text":"Beat gelato I have had in a while, opted for 1/2 mixed berry and 1/2 almond gelato! Almond was absolutely amazing, a must try."}
{"text":"Love this place! Amazing bread and great sweets and deli counters. Awesome energy!"}
{"text":"If I could give zero stars I would. Was sold a burnt custard tart and I'm not talking about the general top being spotted with black... but the crust was burnt so badly that it was absolutely disgusting. I don't know why they have so many positive reviews as their food quality in garbage. This was the WORST custard tart I have ever eaten (I mean taken one bite of, turned it over noted the black hard crust and threw it out). I  will certainly not be returning, as they clearly have no pride in what they serve customers. It's the first time in my life I have been sold and served something that should have been long thrown out."}
{"text":"I've been here several times because my kids attend weekly music lessons right next door. Some of the products are good however I disagree with the great reviews on yelp. I'm a repeat customer and I never received a smile from any of their staff.  

This bakery has potential but it leaves a lot to be desired. There is absolutely no seating in this place. And the demeanour of the staff reflects a  \"get your stuff and go\" attitude.  They seem overworked and uninterested in customer service. 

I always get the same curt,  unfriendly and rushed service here.  Businesses like there's are losing to Starbucks because they're clueless about service and act like they are doing customers a favor. 

Also,  they're closed on Mondays."}
{"text":"Mississauga is lucky to have this place. It's a small place and the variety of product isn't as extensive as other Italian bakeries in the GTA (such as San Remo Bakery, for instance), and it can be a little difficult finding parking in the plaza's lot (it took us 10 minutes to find a free spot on a Saturday early afternoon!), but regardless, it's still a wonderful spot for fresh breads and pastries in the west end.

My most recent visit was on a Saturday afternoon around 1:30 PM, and it was very busy. The place is like a combination of quarter bakery, quarter coffee shop (but  there's no seating available, so it's pretty much grab and go), quarter grocery store, quarter meat shop - random, but it's the best kind of confusion, you don't know where to look first! 

Today, we purchased three small items: one custard tart, one pistachio zeppole, and one slice of tiramisu. The pastries were wonderful, fresh, creamy, and had the perfect amount of sweetness (although I'll note that their custard tarts are a little denser than I'm used to). Their tiramisu was a slice of heaven, and the zeppole was bursting with flavour. Fresh and absolute perfection. Really enjoyed these. For these three items, our total was $6.52.

I can't wait to try more of their pastries and, in particular, the croissants, which were flying off the shelves. Service was very pleasant, and they sell a variety of Italian coffees in the grocery section, which I'll be coming back for since they were son sale (Illy, Lavazza, were just a few of the packages to select from). Will be back again soon!"}
{"text":"Lazio buns anyone ?? 

Lazio is hands down the best bakery in Sauga for the freshest, softest buns AND cannoli's! Like WOW! Those were my exact words after ordering buns from them for Christmas and Easter. Their cannoli's are heavenly. Always fresh and have the crunch* on the shell. Aside from the bread area they also have a good hot table and deli section. Their coffee is also great! 
Their hot table and pizza are good, not the best but not bad. Molisana bakery has a way better hot table and the best pizza for sure! But I eat it still when I'm hungry and in the area. So bottom line if you need buns and cannoli's COME HERE! You won't regret it."}
{"text":"It's an Italian bakery in a strip mall with plenty of parking where you can get bread, pasties, meats, cheeses, and lunch. Its all to go with no seating. You can get espresso, cappuccino, and Americano coffee which you stand and wait for.

I ordered an Americano and waited with a cool bunch of Italian men dressed with snazy clothes and fidoras.

The coffee was prompt and the staff really nice. Personally I would like a ace where you can sit down and enjoy your beverage but the quality is good."}
{"text":"Finally tried it! Was mainly going for macaroons (seeing I have an obsession), not a great selection of them. However, the eclair was amazing and definitely recommended!!

- their Custard pastries and cheesecakes are amazing!!!"}
{"text":"These 5 stars are solely for their spicy olive bread. Everything else here is probably 5 stars too, but I just haven't tried it yet."}
{"text":"My favorite Italian bakery in Mississauga.

I love the spicy olive focaccia and pistachio cannoli. I've tried some of their freshly baked breads and they have been consistently delicious every time.

Everyone who works here has always been very friendly."}
{"text":"They've got amazing pizza dough for when you don't want to or don't have time to make your own. And I love their bread!"}
{"text":"I get to travel for work and this is one of the best perks, finding the small local shops that serve espresso straight from heaven! Not to mention the chocolate cannoli's that I order - and served at a stand up counter just enhanced the experience.

I also collect espresso cups (and coffee sleeves) from my visits and the owner was more than happy to sell me one for my collection.

You must stop in if you are in the area!"}
{"text":"Lots of variety to choose from.
was able to get my hands on their gelato and cannoli. it tasted good! however, it was a little bit too sweet for my liking.

but definitely worth a try!"}
{"text":"I'm surprised I haven't been here before because I usually get my eyebrows done in this plaza. While browsing yelp for Canollis I found this place and bookmarked it. On my way home I decided to stop by and give it a try. I ordered a small vanilla gelato, rice ball with sauce, chocolate eclair and a chocolate Canolli for about 9 dollars (pretty good eh?) . I got there around 8 I clock so they didn't have any Portuguese tarts or plain Canollis left :( 

Now on to my review. The girl at the counter was pretty knowledgeable and didn't mind my question about the pastries and fillings. My gelato was delicious. Creamy, smooth and not overly sweet. The price for the size was perfect treat. The pastries were good as well better than others I've tried but still not the best. The rice ball tastes good. It has. Nice home made sauce and was stuffed with cheese and meat. I think the rice ball could use more meat and cheese. It was served to me at room temperature so I went home and warmed it up. I also added fresh cracked pepper and salt and a bit of chilli garlic hit sauce for some heat and it yummy. 

Overall I had a pleasant experience and I would go back to try some items from their hot station and those Portuguese tarts."}
{"text":"This is possibly one of my best secrets for baked goods in Mississauga. Recessed in a (former)  non descript old strip mall (the mall has changed since Paramount arrived... they are bringing in huge volumes and it looks great),  this gem produces great espresso and tasty Italian goods each morning.  I love walking in and smelling the fresh bread from the oven.  You see HUGE bags of flour just piled in the bakery areas in the back.  There are lots of baskets filled with tons of bread and all of it fresh. Everything is made on site and daily!  

They have wonderful spicy black olive foccicia bread and the crusty Calabrese buns that are pillowy soft inside. The espresso are not bitter but they have great bold taste that just wafts in front of you. The sweets are fantastic and full of flavour.  The tiramisu cheesecake has soft texture instead of the soggy mush that some bakeries do all the time.  Their tiramisu is not traditional... the one I had was a chocolate cake base laced with espresso and then a layer of marscapone cheese espresso mixture with some cocoa powder on top.  The cake layer base wasn't the best but the marscapone mixture on top was so delicious.  The coffee flavour is pronounced and not watery. The croissant is above average and has a nice crisp crust and lovely buttery flavour.  It probably can be better in the technique folding but for 50 cents, I am not complaining.  The profiteroles are big and FILLED to the brim with a nice thick whipped custard.  It has a wonderful sweet vanilla taste and not of that fake pudding garbage that some other places does.  Each sweet I've tried so far has been great.  They have such a huge selection that I barely gone through a quarter of it.  Cannoli are ridiculously addicting.  They're filled with REAL sweetened ricotta cheese and none of this pudding or whipping cream impostors.  This is the real deal! 

They also have an area for hot table (not that big) and a nice deli area.  Overall, the store is super clean, bright, and modern.  Though it has been there a while, it doesnt look or feel old.  The service is fast and seems to be very friendly towards regulars.  I hope to be one of those shortly!"}
{"text":"Gelato, gelato, gelato!  We've been looking for decent gelato close to home since crema de gelato closed in Burlington.  This place has great gelato, as good if not better than what we've been missing for the last year.
It looks like gelato is only a small part of what this place has to offer... it's a full scale bakery with a huge variety of delicious looking things.  We're looking forward to going back and trying a few more things, AND more gelato for sure.  I had fig-pear!!! I've never even heard of that flavour before, delish!"}
{"text":"Old school Italian  bakery.  Really good home made bread.  Deli section with hot table. Good sweets...cakes, canoli and cookies.  We always grab a cappuccino  when we go there."}
{"text":"I discovered this place through Yelp!! After reading the reviews I had to try it. 
Definitely a Five Star. 
Staff were friendly and helpful, facility was clean. The place is very small, but their food is amazing and the bread is to die for. Also their coffee is superior. 
Will definitely be a regular at thx place now."}
{"text":"* I love Italian bakeries and deli shops. Breads are freshly baked. Many selection of pastries.
* Cooked food is available too. I always get spicy sausages. 
* The pastries and breads are so tempting. On my cheat day, I will indulge.
* The ice cream looks tempting. It looks fresh.
* Place looks very clean and the staff are very friendly."}
{"text":"1st time visit and tried the tiramisu and hazelnut gelato along with cappuccino and espresso. All of it was really good."}
