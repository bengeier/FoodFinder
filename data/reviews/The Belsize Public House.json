{"text":"A great local addition to our sleepy little hood, would love to see a proper brunch menu with a little diversity and would love to pimp up the already glorious patio just a few more notches. Amazing chicken sandwich and their house made salad dressing is delightful. Friendly staff & also a solid burger."}
{"text":"I came into the Belsize on a Tuesday evening with a couple friends and I absolutely LOVED the spot. We live just down the street and we are already planning our trip back. The cauliflower cheese dip was to die for and we enjoyed a fantastic burger, churned in house. 

Our server, Marisa (I believe was her name), was exceptional! Kind, pleasant, and very knowledgable of the menu! Just excellent! 

We cannot wait to return!"}
{"text":"A great addition to the area which is lacking in pubs. The atmosphere is good, great beer selection and good food."}
{"text":"Went on a Thursday night.  It was busy but not too loud.  The service was good and attentive and the food was very yummy.  Got the fish and chips and they were excellent - the fish wasn't too oily and the fries were perfect.  Only complaint was the s'more pie was a little too rich and it was cold in a way that wasn't very pleasant. It was chilled the point of being tough to eat while the marshmallows were burnt, which wasn't a pleasant texture combo. It would have been far better if the pie crust and chocolate filling were warmed a bit instead of being hard and cold - everyone at the table who tried it agrees.  Also: don't get one for yourself.  My friend and I each got one and I barely got through half before giving up because of how rich it was.  Splitting it would have been just right."}
{"text":"I don't think I've been to a place that is more Canuck than this place! I love it. I haven't had a disappointing item on the menu. 

Get a special of the day it's worth it. And their beer selection is awesome too. They also have a patio that doesn't back onto a busy street so you don't have to hear the sound of loud cars. Just a great spot all around and the food is some of the best in Mount Pleasant!"}
{"text":"Everything was delicious, i had the jerk pork sandwich and my husband had the moroccan chickpea & vegetable stew. Price very reasonable and service was excellent."}
{"text":"It took an hour to get our food and it was not very good, very expensive, better places in the area."}
{"text":"The Belsize is just down the street from my workplace.  I have been going more or less once a week since they opened in June.  I like the decor, the staff and the menu.  They have a tidy selection of craft beers to choose from, as well as a similarly tidy selection of wines.  The menu keeps being refined, and the food seems to be getting better each week.  In the last 10 days I've had a gaspacho that was superb, a couple of great salads, and today their chicken wings, which were some of the best I've ever had.  These are not your \"wing night\" kind of wings, but big, meaty wings done in a buttermilk sauce.  Came with a maple BBQ glaze, they could hardly have been better.  You should also try the smoked trout nicoise.  The smoked trout is local, delicate, and amazing.  

Real good patio space.

I'm really glad to have this great place nearby for lunch.  I have yet to stop by for dinner.  I think it would also be a great place to stop for beers after work."}
{"text":"Yes!  This place was long overdue for the neighbourhood.  It is classier than Longest Yard, but still family friendly.
Then food is hit and miss but so far more hits.  Could use cocktail menu.  Love the patio.  Love how it's busy.  Love how the staff remembers you.  This place is finally hitting its stride."}
{"text":"Cozy and comfy- the staff were very knowledgeable and there was great service.

We mentioned that it our cousin's bday- and they brought him a slice of cake to celebrate.

The buttermilk wings were done really well and their burgers were good. It is a cross of pub food and gourmet, I liked it."}
{"text":"I work down the street from the Belsize and my colleagues and I come here often (sometimes too often). 

THE FOOD- This is a great lunch spot, I've tried many of the things on the menu and have never made a bad choice. The steak and cobb salads are both flavourful and filling, the Jerk Pork and Grilled veg sandwiches are both delicious. And the Moroccan chickpea stew and chicken pot pie are both great comforting choices on cold days.

THE DRINK- They consistently have a good craft beer selection here, and although I don't often have a drink at lunch, I always take a look at it and am impressed by it.

THE SPACE- This is a cozy, little spot that's great for conversation over good food and drink.

THE SERVICE- The service here is always friendly and generally pretty fast."}
{"text":"Very crowded. Didn't have the beer I wanted that was listed on the CHALKBOARD which is so easy to change. Terrible service. Only two servers on Saturday night? Last call at midnight not announced. Refused to serve at 12:01. Never going back."}
{"text":"Fantastic Portobello and goat cheese concoction on focaccia...really nice surprise and so were the fries. Nice selection of wine-by-the-glass. Super-friendly service! Terrace with/without sun. My only issue was the wine was not served cold enough...but they kindly tried to fix that. Since adding ice to a good Sauvignon Blanc is an act of pure insanity, keeping bottles on ice would solve issue if fridge is off."}
{"text":"Cute casual restaurant. The wait staff are pleasant and not pretentious. The food was delicious and reasonably priced! Good place to go to if you are looking for decent yet not extravagant food at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"Been twice for breakfast and once for dinner, experiences continue to get better as they settle in to the neighbourhood! Packed-house for dinner and drinks recently, no complaints there. Solid eggs bene both times for breakfast, plus they also have a veggie alternative and the standard offering available (eggs, sausage AND bacon, toast, etc.). Very friendly staff who are helpful and attentive. Weeks ago when they opened they felt a bit understaffed, but everything lately has been smooth. Recommend!"}
{"text":"I was local to this place doing some other shopping and my phone suggested it, having never been here I wasn't sure if it was a pub with minimal food and mostly drinking. The inside is far bigger than it seems, has a great boat or lake house feel to it. The service was amazing, my server was responsive and when i asked for garnish removal, I didn't get a it on the side when the dish arrived; which to me equates attention to detail. Perhaps the owner, but an older gentleman was working the floor and assisting as backup, that impressed me. Normally a manager is far from the action or above lifting a plate. I ordered the chicken wings in a maple sauce and they were the best wings I have had in this neighborhood of over a year living here. Cooked to the bone not mostly, breaded and marinated evenly without excessive fat or breading to hide low quality chicken, just fantastic. I also had the lamb burger w/ sweet potato fries, the lamb was cooked perfectly and without the slightest bit of fat. The fries weren't over greasy and had more of a baked texture. Again very well prepared. I visited noon on a weekday if that helps."}
{"text":"This is the perfect place for lunch. The food is good, there is a patio outside, and the staff are super friendly."}
{"text":"On a Sunday afternoon, I was ravished and decided to walk to this new pub. There is a patio area and an indoors area. Unsurprisingly, the indoors seating area was empty, except for the bartender and a bar fly. Patrons were on the patio, which I was lucky enough to find a table.

The most attractive feature is the craft beer menu. But what to pair with?

From reading the Mains, I am not particularly keen on trying them, but the salads sound delicious! I had to settle for the Grilled Flatiron Steak salad because the Smoked Trout Nicoise was sold out.

It was served in a large bowl with enough greens and veggies to complement the dollop of blue cheese and steak. The vinaigrette wasn't heavy, which I forgot to ask on the side. I asked for the steak medium rare....It came out more rare than medium-rare but I ate it. So, I'm really not complaining! The dijon in the vinaigrette served to season the steak.

I had great service, great food and am looking fwd to returning!"}
{"text":"They lied to me that they ran out of the beer I chose. And lied to me again when I asked to taste one of their \"guest beers\"on the board, claiming that's the one I had just finished. All the staff members and some regulars were not happy with the fact that I am a racial minority. Are you kidding me? I am not naive or moron."}
{"text":"Fairly new in our area and had the potential to be our local go-to. But after visiting last week, I've got mixed reviews. Having arrived early for lunch (12pm) on a weekday it felt very warm, welcoming and cozy. Menu has is diverse and would be appeal to many palates and tastes. I opted for the cobb salad and my guest had the steak sandwhich special with salad. Both were enjoyable and large portions. Service was friendly and attentive. My only complaints are that, after 45 minutes the place packed up and it was very loud and felt cramped. And, while I enjoyed the salad, I had an upset stomach for hours afterward. I probably won't return."}
{"text":"Glad to have this place as our almost-local bar and restaurant. Not quite on our doorstep but certainly worth the walk. 

We've been here twice for dinner and left impressed both times. The food is great and the relaxed atmosphere means this is somewhere you can settle in and sample their wide selection of ales and beers. A pub set up with very good food. The specials change every week and we wish they'd keep them for longer! Their recent tuna salad and steak frites were excellent. Sadly they'd finished when we returned a week later! From the regular menu we enjoyed the salmon tacos, chicken pot pie and the creamy croquettes. As others have said the chicken wings are big and meaty and a must-try (if feeling naughty). 

The staff here are relaxed and friendly. I'm not expecting 5 star service in this environment and price range but they've been good in recommended food and beers - and rarely wrong!

Will try to get back here for the breakfast!"}
