{"text":"Went there for sushi. I was not particularly impressed with the sushi rice quality or flavor/seasoning. The neti were okay but I like my sushi rice well-seasoned."}
{"text":"Great place! Fast and friendly service and their sushi is delicious and priced fairly."}
{"text":"Great food, priced a little above similar restaurants. The server didn't understand my wine order and brought me a White wine when I ordered a Cabernet.  I ordered Filet and Scallops. My ordered chicken and steak. The chef was hilarious, and engaging! Did a great job! Will come back!"}
{"text":"Was looking for a good sushi restaurant in the Aurora area and happy to say that this fit the bill. Restaurant was clean and up-to-date. Service was prompt and very attentive throughout the meal. Prices were extremely reasonable. Sushi was good quality and menu selection was large.  We did not try the hibachi grill, but it looks like they can accommodate several large groups in this restaurant. This place is hidden away in a strip center in the Aurora/Bainbridge area, so don't miss it."}
{"text":"Unsatisfactory. Tried out this Japanese place because we're new in Twinsburg, OH. The chicken yakitori & calamari, carry-out, not good at all. Very small serving."}
{"text":"What to do when you love to eat teppanyaki but your poor introvert spouse hates the hibachi show and being seated with strangers? Samurai Steakhouse to the rescue! They let us sit in the dining room and eat the yummy food while skipping the show and awkward conversation. Also to clarify, I am the awkward introvert in this situation :)  As others have mentioned, the service is fast. Super fast. I don't know that were were there for more than 35-40 minutes and we lingered a bit after our meal. Every one was very polite and I felt the prices were comparable to similar restaurants in this area.  Food was yummy as expected. We will be back."}
{"text":"Visited here for a birthday party, our hibachi chef was the most enthusiastic we've ever had!  The children loved him, and he kept us entertained.  I felt horrible for the neighboring table that had a boring, bland chef, but sometimes that's just how it goes.  The food was decent. It appeared fresh, but what does it matter when you add three sticks of butter, a quart of oil and a handful of garlic?  You could throw the frozen tuna in there and no one would know.  Service was great with refills and they even let us use the gong.  Tasty birthday ice cream too.  It's not going to win culinary awards, but they will give a great show for the family at the hibachi tables."}
{"text":"The hibachi show is the highlight. My family always has an entertaining night here. I especially love the onion volcano, always a sight to behold. Food is guaranteed to be served hot. The sashimi isn;t bad either, they serve my favorite -- white tuna.  If there was only one targeted area of improvement, is that the whole place smells like cooking oil. A one-weekend-a-month scrub down might be in order."}
{"text":"We moved to Solon from the west side and have been searching for a good sushi place. A lot of the places in this area can be expensive. We checked out the menu and were impressed with the prices ($3.75 for veggie roll, $4 for sweet potato tempura roll). The sushi was excellent! Super fresh ingredients.  We'll definitely be back ASAP.   Note: my fianc√©e didn't want to come because he thought it wouldn't be a real sushi bar, but they do in fact have a sushi bar even tho it's called a steak house."}
{"text":"Not the best Japanese I've ever had.   It was \"ok\". It was not bad, but it was not good either.  The best way I can describe the food is \"eh\"."}
{"text":"Their isn't anything particularly special about this place. The AC doesn't work properly and makes it very warm with the grills on. Food is blah!!! Very blah!!!"}
{"text":"My family and I visited here on a Sunday evening, and we were seated right away. The server took or orders quickly and almost immediately brought out the first hibachi course. The entire staff was very friendly, helpful, and especially understanding of our one year old who didn't like the flame part of the dinner. Our hibachi chef was great, entertaining and fun. Everything was absolutely delicious. We ordered the steak/shrimp and the chicken/shrimp and the seasonings for all were so good. Definitely check it out!"}
{"text":"There's no other way to start this review then by saying that the service at Samurai is F-A-S-T. Does Clark Kent work here? From the moment you sit down to nearly 10 minutes in, you already have your drink, soup, salad and sushi.  When Mom and I are shopping in Aurora, stopping in for dinner is a no brainer. The hibachi never lets me down! The rice and vegetables have fantastic seasoning and are crave-worthy. I usually go with the shrimp (plump and juicy!), but the chicken and steak are awesome, too. We're not too into the hibachi experience in general...so we tend to just grab a booth in the back and indulge in privacy. For those who do sit at the hibachi, they have really talented chefs. One gentleman is so hilarious, I literally will laugh at him halfway across the restaurant.  I'm a sushi snob, and the specialty sushi here passes the test. The Chelsea role is one of my favorites, particularly because my Mom isn't too into rolls that are very raw, and this one is easily enjoyable. The shrimp, avocado, cucumber, asparagus and seared tuna are a delightful combo and have a great presentation.  They also have the world's easiest online ordering. Great place for take-out or to stop in for dinner!"}
{"text":"You can go here and not sit at the big communal table if you want the hibachi grill. I've been to better hibachi locations in my life, but this is my choice for the area. I would say the serving size is slightly less than other places I have been. But it is still a lot of food! I just feel like hibachi places are known for making a huge mound of food."}
{"text":"A fun place to go on a Friday night. The hibachi chefs are energetic and always in a good mood. Food is excellent and cooked perfectly. One of Aurora's best restaurants."}
{"text":"You'll get a kick out of this: when I walked in I noticed a box on top of the cashier's station: \"Frozen Tuna!\" I asked the manager if they served only fresh fish, and they said \"oh, yes, it's always fresh\". I asked what the box of frozen tuna was doing sitting over there... \"oh, uh, that's just a box, our tuna is only fresh\". Well, I can tell the difference between fresh and frozen tuna, and the sushi was definitely FROZEN tuna. Still, nothing tasted particularly bad--just nothing special. We also had a hibachi dish...chicken. It, too, was just ok. Service was good and friendly. I probably won't go back to this place.  And by the way, the entire staff is mainland Chinese, not Japanese."}
{"text":"I did not use the hibachi part of the restaurant; I sat in the table side and just had sushi.   The sushi was fresh - very good. I am very picky about my sushi - where it comes from, what it looks like, etc... and I had no complaints at all. If you wanted to you could sit at the rear bar and watch the chef make the sushi to order.  Service was fast. The girls were friendly and attentive.   While I've no complaints at all I can't speak to the hibachi food like all the other reviewers are."}
