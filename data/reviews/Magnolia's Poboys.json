{"text":"This review isn't based on the food, it's based off of the fact that I got on their website to see where they were gonna be today between 11:30a - 2pm and I drove across town to try their food and the truck isn't there.  Needless to say I was pissed.  I called the number that's listed on the website and it went to voicemail.  So you can imagine how I feel right now.  It wasn't raining today either.  I talked to someone the other day because I wanted to try their food and the next day they weren't gonna serve because it was supposed to rain all day that's why I waited till today.  I don't understand why charlotte doesn't give the food trucks a location so we can patronize them daily instead of food truck fridays.  I lived in Philly and you could find food trucks in the same locations daily, makes it easy.  Oh well, better luck next time. 9-5-17 This is my 2nd review of this establishment.  On their website for today they were supposed to be uptown Charlotte at 525 N. Tryon st between 11:30 - 1:30. I get there at 1pm and guess what, No food truck again.  I'm done with these ppl. I know I was in the right spot because an employee that works at that office building pointed me in the right direction.  There was a food truck there but it wasn't Magnolias."}
{"text":"Don't let this food truck pass you by. It is awesome New Orleans cuisine.  I had the shrimp po boy with the remoulade sauce. The shrimp was fresh and the sauce was perfect. They had some gravy fries that looked great too, but I did not need those calories.  I can't wait to try more of their items.  The staff is super friendly."}
{"text":"Just finished Magnolia's shrimp po boy with fries and it was excellent!   Love that taste of New Orleans with just the right amount of spice.  I work at Innovation Park and we have food trucks come daily.   Magnolia's is here on Wednesdays and is definitely one of the best that I have tried."}
{"text":"Holy delicious! We had the shrimp po boy with fries and a hot ham and cheese with gumbo! The shrimp were perfectly fried with a lite batter and their remoulade sauce was AMAZING. I can't speak much for the ham and cheese (I don't eat ham) but I did try them gumbo and it was delicious. Perfect amount of spice and flavor. I definitely recommend this food truck!!!"}
{"text":"Outstanding!!!!!   Trying to escape Irma found a diamond in the sand!  Kid friendly, pet friendly, service of a 4 star resort.  Was there on Saturday, they had Magnolias food truck there. I recommend the buffalo chicken po'boy.  But tried several sandwiches they were all fantastic, hats off to magnolias!"}
{"text":"If you are looking for an authentic Po'Boy this is the place for you. Be sure to ask for the remoulade on your Po'Boy a little bit of spice really sets it off! They came to my work for lunch and I raved about it to my wife. Well, later that night they were at the festival we went to in Pineville so I had another one with her. She was also very impressed."}
{"text":"This food truck is SO amazing! The owner/chef makes everything from scratch! My favorite item is the ham and swiss sandwich! It's hot and the ham is crispy on the sides which gives it more of a bacon flavor. I get the potato salad as my side and it's the best potato salad you will ever have in your life! I also love the gumbo and desserts!"}
{"text":"I went to there location at the corner of Stonewall and College outside of the Convention Center, apart of Center City Partners food truck program. First time so I asked what was their signature he said the shrimp but his personal favorite was the roast beef so I did both and got the Surf N Turf Roast Beef and Shrimp. Let me tell you, I would've never thought to combine those two but it is delicious and as flavorful as New Orleans cuisines are known for. Even now after eaten it I unable to accurately explain the taste besides yum. Comes with a side, I chose fries because I'm a fries girl. Golden brown and seasoned well. The sandwich portion is more than usual so that's always a plus. Fast service and hot quality food. I've found my Thursday lunch"}
{"text":"OMG.... so delicious. We ate here at the Pineville Fall Festival. I had the shrimp po boy with remoulade sauce and my husband had the roast beef. We had sides of French fries and coleslaw and the pecan pie for dessert. It was all amazing. Super flavorful. Even my 6 year old son loved it and kept stealing mine. I actually just looked them up to see where I can find them again to get more of their delicious food. As an added bonus, the staff was super friendly and helpful. If you have a chance to try this food truck... DO IT."}
