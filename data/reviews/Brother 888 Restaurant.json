{"text":"Worst place, don't go here.  The service is horrible.  There are flies everywhere.  The portions are smaller than usual.  Our order was messed up, we requested to add fried rice and we didn't get it.  The pork chop was really small.  I paid for the entire meal after complaining about it.  Even though it wasn't worth it.  Worst place ever!"}
{"text":"Disappointing meal to a decent start. The coffee was good and everything else went downhill from there. We ordered the med. Pho dac biet, the broth was decent - flavour and fragrant. What was lacking was the substance; served in a huge bowl with very little protein ration and noodle. The rice with grilled chicken and pork was a joke. The flavour was seriously questionable. The meat cooked inconsistently with tough and soft area. Weird was the strange slightly tart off taste, making me question the freshness and quality control of the kitchen. The nuoc mam was watered down with slight taste of sweet and tart...not something I'm used to, to say the least. The servers obnoxiously and loudly yells across the restaurant from time to time...especially worse when they think we don't understand what they were blurring out.   Bottom line, decent pho and coffee... Skipping the rice next time."}
{"text":"Finally tried this Vietnamese restaurant tucked away inside the Mississauga Chinatown. Sadly, my verdict isn't good for this joint, despite its seemingly trendier look.   The service was lacking... there was only one other party besides us and we were largely ignored during our meal. Not unfamiliar in asian restaurants, mind you! So we would have been quite okay with that if the food had been good.   Unfortunately, that was not the case. The fried spring rolls were drenched in grease and had far too much taro on the inside. The sauce, which is usually pleasantly sweet and salty, was tasteless... And had sambal oelek mixed into it, which was so odd to me. The mango salad was overly salty (due to the fish sauce) which masked the freshness that any salad should have. And while the pork chops and chicken were definitely seasoned, it lacked a fullness in flavour that comes from a great marinade... Which was thoroughly disappointing. On the upside, the pho was quite good and I think we all enjoyed it. But was it enough to come back?  Sadly, no. I hate to leave such a sad first review, but unfortunately this is where we've arrived. I hope to come back one day and see a bustling atmosphere and improved food and service."}
