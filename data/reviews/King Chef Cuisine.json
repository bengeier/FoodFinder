{"text":"this place is gross.

honestly maybe 2/5 meat items are edible. its all bone or fat for the most part . i end up feeling really sick after eating here and the woman is pretty pushy."}
{"text":"Not great, but pretty standard Canadian Chinese food. However the owners are really good people."}
{"text":"The exterior of this place is not very inviting. What attracted me to walk in and try out this place was their lunch special: 3 combo for $4.99.
When I walked in, the place is not as bad/sketchy as I thought it would be.

They have Chinese food and Canadian food. I've tried their Chinese lunch combo, similar style to Manchu Wok, Panda Express type of food, except they actually taste better, especially for $4.99

I also tried their breakfast combo: homestyle hash browns, bacon, toasts, eggs, tomato for $4.75. Taste like regular breakfast to me... They also have blt sandwich, pancake, etc.

As someone who studied business and economics, I can tell you that their menu price does not make sense at all when it comes to the amount of food you're getting vs. the cost of the food. One example: A BLT sandwich is only a couple of cents cheaper than the big breakfast they serve. So yea, if you want the best deal for your lunch money, either order the 3 combo special for $4.99 or the breakfast special combo for $4.75.

Overall their food taste good for the price you're paying. Oh, I wouldn't recommend you to dine-in there if you don't want your clothes to smell like food. Their kitchen is located in the dining area instead of the back, so the fume when they make you fresh breakfast lingers around and get stuck to your clothes if you stay there long enough. Just get a take-out"}
{"text":"My office, which is located near queen and bathurst, ordered delivery from here for new years eve. I have spent a few years living in Europe, where chinese food is saucy and spicy, and I have been struggling to find anything comparable here in Toronto... until now! Was thrilled to find that the spicy chicken dishes were ACTUALLY spicy and full of flavor. The veggies were actually cooked properly and balanced perfectly with the amount of meat. The salt content was just right. I was blown away! Even the noodle dish was good, which I had given up on finding here. 

So why not 5 stars? 

Well, I was dismayed to learn that they have a tiny delivery zone. I live on yonge south of bloor, which is in most delivery zones, but this restaurant apparently does not venture east of spadina. Very disappointed by that."}
{"text":"The food here is quite good for the price. The inside is quite humble. The staff are quite pleasant. I would go back here for lunch anytime! This is simple dining done well. Get in, get the buffet, get back to work!"}
{"text":"Ordered one of the items on the daily special menu: chicken with black bean sauce. The restaurant layout is very basic and there is not much of an ambiance. The server was very nice and the portion size was very generous. In regards to the dish itself, it was typical somewhat greasy Chinese food which you crave every so often. Nothing to rave or complain about. The dish was $8.50 with an extra $1.50 to change the white rice to fried rice. 

One thing to point out is that they advertise no MSG."}
{"text":"Can't believe it has taken me this long to write a review for this place considering I usually go here once a week when I am feeling to lazy to cook.

I first came here during a lunch hour as they do lunch specials, that was so long ago that I can not even remember what i ordered or how it was.

Since then I usually come back this way after gym and order the same thing everytime. Szechuan Fish with noodles. The lady who usually serves me is like an aunty now, always happy to see me and knows what i want. 

The portion is great and the fish is so tasty with the spiciness being just spot on. I love garlic as an ingredient so this suits me fine. I never finish the whole thing at once so it usually makes a decent lunch for me the next day. 

Long live King Chef!"}
{"text":"This is the case of the admittedly greasy and non authentic but comforting and great when you don't want to cook dinner Chinese food Wars on King St. W.

My partner and were loyal to Bamboo Buddha for a very long time, until recently when the food took over an hour, and tasted awful. I had heard about King Chef on Yelp and a fellow Yelper actually reached out to me and suggested that I give them a try.

Last night, my boyfriend arrived home from a flight kind of late and I had lunch at 3 pm so I wasn't even going to make dinner. I suggested we order from King Chef.

The menu on line looks ok, and they even have a few pictures (albiet bad ones) that illustrate cuisine laden with dried chilies and other szechuan spicy stuffs. We ordered the chicken balls (had to compare them to the monstrous ones at BB), 2 Egg Rolls (since BB was out of them last time), Spicy Green Beans, Cantonese Chow Mein, and Crispy Ginger Beef.

After I called and placed the order I realized that I didn't have cash. The man on the phone said they don't have a mobile terminal and I'd have to give out my number to him on the phone. This seemed a bit archaic, but I agreed. Then he cheerfully told me that the food would be an hour! What? AN hour? I guess we were spoiled for a long time and BB because we'd call and the food would be here 15 minutes later! I get that places are busier on certain nights, so we were patient.

Now for the food: Visually, not striking. The amount was half what we normally get from BB. There were no spicy peppers to be seen on anything at all. The egg rolls were shiny and dripping grease. The overall fresh vegetable factor that has me loving Bamboo Buddha is definitely not there at King Chef.

Canotnese Chow Mein had decent sauce, but the noodles were super dry and impossible to break apart and portion. The addition of Squid and baby scallops were nice, but overall the dish was not that impressive.

Green beans were a tad spicy and just ok if a bit overcooked.

Chicken Balls were not as big as BB, but the coating was crispy and the chicken a bit dry. I'm not giving points for this because I know they don't make the chicken balls in house.

Crispy Ginger Beef was at least not too sweet, and the flavour was meh, No ginger to speak of. Mediocre  and bordering on unappetizing to look at.

We won't be giving these guys another chance. At least we've had great experiences on a regular basis with Bamboo Buddha. They faltered a few weeks ago, and I feel it's okay to look elsewhere after a bad experience. But King Chef did nothing to win us over. I was really disappointed because of all the positive reviews. 

Maybe they just had a bad night. But as I mentioned in my latest review of BB, if that last experience we had with them had been my first, we never would have ordered again.

Bamboo Buddha it is! I'm looking forward to taking my business back there and giving them a better review."}
{"text":"Business is closed for good. Waste of time trying to find it. Please mark closed. No good good and inexpensive Chinese food"}
{"text":"I had the most awkward meal of my life here.
I came in and I was the only one there. I'm not usually put off by that, I always have work with me. However, when I said \"hi, I'd like a table for one\", the two employees  looked at me as if I was a space alien. \"What do you want?\" They asked me.
\"A table. For one.\"
\"You want to sit?\"
\"Yes.\"
\"Oh!!!! Are you waiting for someone?\"
\"No, I said a table for one.\"
I ordered a wonton soup and a beef chow mien. I asked for a bottle of water, and the employee serving me came back with a paper cup of tap water. He also asked me if I wanted a spoon or just a fork. How am I supposed to eat soup with a fork?!!
The soup was very bland. The broth was lacking flavour and there was one random stick of broccoli in it. The wontons themselves were okay, but nothing special. It would have been nice if the broth had green onions in it.
The chow mein portion was huge. As to flavour, it was a bit bland.
As I ate, the two employees sat directly across from me and stared at me as I ate. It was very uncomfortable.
When I finished eating, the guy serving me said \"okay, bye! Thanks!\"
He forgot to charge me for the food until I mentioned that I didn't pay yet.
Overall, even for takeout or delivery I would stick with Bamboo Buddha a few doors down."}
{"text":"Yesterday we placed an order with King Chef.  On our notes we had mentioned that there is a \"shrimp allergy\". 

First our order took an 1.5 hours to reach us.  When the driver showed up he only had 1/2 our food order.  He contacted the restaurant and they stated yelling at each other.  He said he would be right back with our order.  

We opened the bag and noted what was missing and we called the store to ensure the correct food would be coming our way and also to raise our discontent with the time delay and now on top of it...our food has been sitting around and will be cold.  The individual we spoke to yelled at us and told us that be cause we made a large order it is our fault and we should have ordered earlier.  Not sure what the timing has to do with our food being cold and 1/2 of it not showing up.  

Once the rest of our food arrived we opened up one of the dishes...which had 4 pieces of shrimp in the bottom of the container.  Not sure if they tried picking them out and missed a few; nevertheless we could not eat that order. 

We contacted the store again and once again we were told that they couldn't make any promises or orders being accurate and that it was our fault for order so much."}
{"text":"I don't think it's fair to say that with so many Asian restaurants in the Spadina and surrounding neighborhood area that they are all the same, but I usually find that there are ways that certain ones stand out from their counterparts. 

I ordered lunch here and had a good experience. First off, Chinese food can sometimes be a bit rough for even the most seasoned of eaters, but I had no troubles at all after eating the food here. The woman who owns the place was my counter person and cook and was friendly and chatty. She said if I ever had a party to call her for the food and she'd give a good price, although I got the sense I wasn't the first nor the last person she told that to, but it's still a nice gesture.

For my order I got the ginger crispy beef and chicken fried rice, both separate. The ginger beef was pretty tasty even though it looked absolutely nothing like it's picture in the menu. The rice was tasty as well, a tad bit greasy bit tasty and more flavorful than other fried rice I've had with large chunks of white meat chicken in it. 

My meal total came up to just over $20, which is not too bad. If if gone to Spadina I think I'd have gotten about twice the amount of food, but I'll be fair in acknowledging that I don't need it. The portion was just right.

Overall pretty good, but nothing mind bending. Still worth the trip if you're close"}
{"text":"I ordered veg fried rice and chicken wings and they were both quite good.  I find the other items to be too oily and they are not for me, but I've heard a lot of good things about this restaurant."}
{"text":"It's not even 8am yet, and I'm considering tucking into my super supper leftovers from last night. 

King Chef is definitely my new Chinese delivery place. I ordered a pretty standard western feast: chicken fried rice, spring roles, general tsao, and mixed veggies (mostly spicy green beans). Not MSG-heavy, but still a salty soya treat. All of the meats were plump, juicy and fresh tasting. 

It's a little pricier for delivery than similar options, and I haven't actually touched foot inside this place, but I love the snacks they're slinging."}
