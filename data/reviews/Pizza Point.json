{"text":"Awesome pizza for the price. Dough tasted fresh, crisp on the outside and moist in the inside. Most discount pizza shops I find the cheese and pepperoni to be bland, but this shop was great, tasted well seasoned and bursting of flavour.   AND the service is actually good, friendly staff and owner.   After trying so many pizza shops in Brampton, I finally found my staple joint."}
{"text":"As other reviews have stated, this place is indeed pretty cheap, and they have lots of toppings to choose from - free delivery on top of that. They had a special for a large 3 topping pizza for $15. I opted for pepperoni, sausage and sundried tomato. It arrived at my place about a half hour later which is nice and prompt. Terrific value and service, but there's room for improvement with the food quality, even given how inexpensive it is. The sundried tomatoes were served whole, which IMO is too much, and would be much better diced. The crust was also a bit too chewy for my tastes. I can always opt for another topping than sundried tomatoes, but there's not too much I can do about the crust, which caps my rating at a 3. Still a good option, and if I find the crust improves, I'll happily update my review."}
{"text":"Been coming here on a monthly basis for the past 6 months. Cheap pizza, but its delicious! And the onion rings are crispy and just plain old good. Always friendly staff inside. We just can't say enough good things about Pizza Point. Will be a customer as long as we live in Brampton !"}
{"text":"They have the best fries.. I'll start my post with that.. people who love Costco fries I'm telling you that you have to go here for their fries it's just like Costco fries.. their Medium size fries is like a large in other place and only cost $5.65..  This place is just down the street from my place so it's very convenient  for me to go here and get a slice or fries.. the quality of pizza is really good I absolutely love their meat lovers and garlic bread pizza.. if you ask for delivery the delivery is free of charge..   They make great pizza and great side dishes for a good price they don't charge an arm or a leg unlike the big names..  They usually get busy on school days during lunch and after school so if your  raving pizza around 12 or 3 and need the whole pizza I suggest calling in an advance... ohh they do have a few seats but the place is more of ordering and go.  I defintly recommend people going here for good quality pizza and fries for a very decent price"}
{"text":"Been a customer for 2 years now. Really good pizza for a privately owned pizza shop. Their prices are reasonable,  unlike the repetitive one worded dominant chains.   Their pizza is not gourmet or anything but delicious and awesome value. Did I mention free delivery?"}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places I've ever been.  Friendly service, good price, and awesome pizza!! Oh ... and they also have really good deals and printed coupons! Must try!"}
