I prefer this place for Indian food"}
{"text":"I am a vegetarian and was hoping to have good indian food. I therefore yelped and found out this restaurant. 

If you have no other option and have to eat indian go ahead! Otherwise just keep away from this place. The buffet had 2 vegetable entree, 1 dal, sambhar, idly, rice and veg appetizer. I really did not like any of the food. 

Bottom line - not worth 15 bucks"}
{"text":"Excellent food and having very good behavior of staff . I am not hoping that such a good food I shall get in las vagas . I have tasted many foods and found all are equally excellent."}
{"text":"Pretty good place. We tried chicken biryani and vegetable biryani and both are really tasty. And the staff is friendly and helpful. I have tried coup different places in Vegas but this one is my best."}
{"text":"Amazing food. Quality food. Lot of varieties in buffet. Not had this good buffet in recent times."}
{"text":"Very good lunch buffet value at $13. Limited selection but had all I wanted."}
{"text":"It was one of the least tasty Indian food I have eaten in the US, I think what I ate once in Austin at one random Indian restaurant was the worst - and I forget the name of that one. 

We had the buffet and everything was bland. Indian food is about spices, and here there was a total lack of spice in most of the food. I came in hungry, tried the tandoori chicken and the chicken curry and another chicken dish and all of them turned out to be equally bland. I did not have the courage to eat the goat curry after that. It may be just the fact that it was a weekday, but it was a disappointment. I will not go back."}
{"text":"Worst Indian food I ever ate.  If there is zero star I would give a zero star.  Food was cold, old and stale.  I strongly recommend not to eat here. Food sucks here."}
{"text":"This is the last place I will ever visit!

The person there was very very Rude and very unhelpful. They did not care that we were sitting there for the last half an hour, even when there were only 2 tables filled.), When I told him \" Finally you came\", he said- \" I can go back if you say so, you can even go to another Place\". Its just shocking and looks like that they dont WANT the place to work .  The food was UN-flavorful,  just Spicy ( even when I ordered medium spice). I am an Indian and can handle spicy food quite well."}
{"text":"Before I start my review, I would like to preface this by saying that you WILL pay extra for rice if you decide to eat here. 

I just got done eating my carryout from Bombay. DO NOT ORDER THE CHICKEN JALFREZIE. It literally tasted as if the cook dumped an entire container of salt into my dish. I have had Jelfrezie at many other Indian restaurants, and none of it has ever tasted like straight up sodium. 

When we placed our carry out order, the guy on the phone said no chicken pakora. When we called back to ask if they could do veggie pakora instead, we were told that they did in fact have chicken pakora, so we ordered some. When we opened the box, it was not chicken, not even veggie, but their chilly pakora. Good thing I like it spicy or I really would have been out of luck. 

I dined in here with my fiance yesterday, so I will share that experience with you as well. 

I have a gluten allergy, and the waiter was semi helpful. He definitely could have been more knowledgeable about allergies, but he knew the ingredients of pretty much everything on the menu, so I was able to figure out what I could eat with little issue. 

I had mattar paneer, and it was delicious. My fiance had chicken tikka masala, and it was \"okay, but the cubed chicken had a weird consistency.\" The mango lassi is good. The basmati rice is delicious, though it does cost extra, and our bill came out to $9 in rice although we had just 2 orders of it, and on the menu it mysteriously says that rice is \"$2.50+\"

I was very disapointed when my carry out order was handled so horribly and the food tasted so bad, as I had considered this place to have pretty good food when I dined in.

There are many other Indian restaurants in the area. My reccomendation: try one."}
{"text":"I was driving on the strip when I saw the sign of this restaurant. Its located close to circus circus/Riviera. I went there for the dinner buffet, Its ambiance is nice and staff was pretty welcoming and friendly however, its food quality was horrible. I went there for dinner buffet along with my dad as we were craving for indian food. Its about $16.95/person not including drinks. Pretty expensive for the old \"baasi\" food that they offer.They don't have that many items. The tandoori chicken was very dry, their biryani was overspicy and very hot. There food really lacked quality and it appeared as it has been sitting there since morning.  I also ordered mango lassi that was for $3.95 and tasted pretty mediocre. 
Towards the end I pretty much wasted my money and felt I was duped and I lost my appetite. I DON'T recommend anyone going there."}
{"text":"The food was nice and spicy. But nothing to write home about. Certainly a reasonable value in this area."}
{"text":"I ordered food to-go from Bombay. This was by far the worst food experience. It gave me DIARRHEA and I ended up throwing all the food.

- The tandoori chicken was very stale and GAVE ME DIARRHEA after one bite!!!
- The lamb tikka masala and butter chicken had the exact same gravy which isn't right
- The lamb was uncooked and very hard.
- The chicken in the butter chicken was very stale with really bad quality meat. Butter chicken should have white breast meat but they had put leg etc. pieces. Seemed like very old leftover tandoori chicken pieces. 
- The food was VERY expensive for the quality. 

I'm going to send official complaint and report this place for poor quality, contaminated food."}
{"text":"Dishonest and unprofessional. This is in same complex as another Indian restaurant and we ended up here by mistake. Few points about dishonesty
1. We reached at 2.30 pm. They said only buffet can be ordered, so we ordered for 3 and half. My mom doesn't eat onions/garlic and there was nothing to eat for her, so she just sat there without food.
2. When she was not eating, he comes and says, now cook is here and we can order jain food. (We could have ordered non-buffet already as buffet was closing at 3.00pm).
3. In the end, he charged for my mom's buffet as well as full charge for additional dishes. We separately ordered her nan and rice dishes for her as we were told she alone cannot eat buffet. But they charged for her dishes, they did let her eat rice etc from buffet, but charged for buffet anyways. (it was not a mistake, because they didn't correct it when asked. It was knowingly done)
4. The buffet had chutney etc, but no pakoras or samosa were finished already. No response when asked about it.
They were talking nicely and it didn't occur that cheating business was going on on the side. When I carefully looked at the detailed calculation later, we spend hell lot more than just few extra dollars. It was too late to go back and fight and felt cheated."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a quick lunch during the week, and were pleasantly surprised by the quality and diversity of food offered.  Naan bread was amazing, staff friendly, and food delicious.  Only complaint was the bathrooms - smelled like there was a gas leak.  Will definitely be back next time we're in town to lose some money!"}
{"text":"I was compelled to give one star because there is no zero . Very limited options for buffet . The combination dishes were not made properly. Plates and bowls used for serving had more role to play than the customers  . The management were more specific about what has to be used to eat and least worried about if customers enjoyed the meal or not ! There is this one waiter there who could learn to be a bit more polite in communicating with customers . One star for the freshly served naan's  .

Not worth a visit"}
{"text":"We were late for dinner in the sin city and as we all know indian food is not available after 10 but these guys took us in and trust me (we have been having indian food for last 2 days) the food here was awesome..... They also serve jain (no onion, no garlic, no potato) food....which was pure heaven. Will def recommend....."}
{"text":"Very Authentic and Delicious food I ever ate in USA... I used to not write reviews but the taste and service let me login to yelp... Must try chicken tikka masala, chicken biryani and veg malai kofta with crispy garlic naan... I also had masala dosa with coconut chutney and sambhar that was outstanding I never ate it like this before.... Must try this...."}
{"text":"This place is terrible and gross! Over 50$ for 2 dishes and a salad for fast food??? Please avoid as there are some really good Indian restaurants that are A LOT cheaper and with much better food! First every order takes 35 minutes to prepare. They even have a hand-written sign they are happy to point out to you, but they do not tell you when you order. I found tons of small bones in my byriani chicken and the naan bread was gross and heavy. Oh and more fun, the owner is super condescending to women."}
{"text":"Management is not taking care towards the customers.... started our buffet... after 15minz he came to fill the water after asking twice... Refilling is tooo late"}
{"text":"I love eating their lunch buffets. A delicious spread and good variety. Kheer to pakoda are equally finger-licking. The naan is soft and has the right amount of ingredients.  As of March 2015, they are undergoing some renovation - which might make seating and indoor temperature an issue for the next couple weeks. 
There's one more reason why they are my favorite: once I was there with my mom, and she required a special diet for religious reason for a certain day. And these guys, prepared special meals for her - without extra charge or cringing. 
There's rarely an Indian restaurant that is so Indian in spirit! 5 stars!"}
{"text":"The food is average here but this restaurant has very bad service. It's run by un professional staff.. I wish I could give a rating below one star.. I went with family here on Memorial Day weekend. I entered the restaurant at 955pm gave order by 1005pm and was served food at 1110 pm.. Had to wait more than an hour for the food of just 2 dishes.. Had to several times go and ask the staff for my order. And just when I was about to leave they got my order. The food was ok but by that time mood was ruined. N to put icing on the cake they charged us with some dish which we didn't order..
Please avoid this restaurant and go someplace else if you don't want to ruin your evening.."}
{"text":"It's worst place , don't even try here . Buffet ws too bad , there was only 8 items and they charged $14 per person . Chicken curry was sweet , sambar was worst , they kept idli no chutney , no desert"}
{"text":"I tried the lunch buffet, and it exceeded my expectations. I kinda stumbled upon it while walking from Encore on my way to Jack in the Box to try the famous deep fried tacos.  Since Jack in the Box was farther away than I thought, I'm sure glad I opted for this instead.

Great value, ambiance, service, selection, and taste.  There were only a few of us there, including tourists from India who seemed very satisfied.  

The buffet included fresh naan, which was the best I've had in a very long time; a salad bar; deserts; soup; spring rolls; mini bhaji, pakora, and samosas; great vegetarian and chicken options; and curried goat. 

Completely satisfying and will go again."}
{"text":"This is the 1st time I'm actually using yelp just so that I can share my worst buffet experience ever at the Bombay restaurant. Awful food- completely different from what you see in their marketing photos. Zero customer service....Eventually- we gave our feedback to the hotel manager who bluntly said- \"don't eat here next time\" - which is highly unprofessional. Will never recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Very nice indian food.. even better than some indian restaurants... butter chicken the best i have ever had.. yellow dal was also great.. and not to forget, the bombay chai amazing.. luv this restaurant.. wld come again n again here for indian food.. owner staff n everyone very courteous.. being away from ur country n getting same food rather better as u get in your country feels like heaven.."}

#Not a Tasty Food #expensive 
We ordered bunch of different starters as well as main course
Chicken biryani was worst top of that its very expensive with 8 pieces hardly, it's not a regular authentic biryani(Chicken curry n rice mix) 
Samosas are waste as well, and forget about chili chicken they just made kabab into pieces and added tomato curry on top of it. 
Don't waste your time"}
{"text":"If you are looking for the BEST indian food in Vegas, this is the place. We have been to many other indian restaurants in Vegas, but this place is unbeatable. Their butter chicken, shrimp saag, paneer tikka masala, naan and chhole is to die for. Come here for the best indian food in Vegas."}
{"text":"The buffet was fantastic!  Excellent variety.  As a veg, I was thrilled that there were so many dishes available.  Pakora, channa, dahl, mixed vegetables, wonderful flavors.  

 Service was also outstanding.  My water glass never got below half full.  They brought fresh naan to my table to go with the buffet.  Servers checked on me several times \"Did you like that one? try this dish next!\"  \"don't forget to try the dessert, it's my favorite\""}
{"text":"They have poor service and not so good food. You will always wait for 15-20 mins even if you see empty tables."}

{"text":"Had the buffet lunch at the recommendation of my fellow Yelpers.  I really enjoyed my lunch.  The food was flavorful and the service was very nice.  I ordered a glass of wine and the charge was very reasonable at $6.00 for a glass of chardonnay.  I will return to the restaurant.  My favorites on the buffet were the chicken curry and the spinach dish.  Good value and a good lunch on the strip."}
{"text":"After a long drive from So Cal, my family and I (Mom, dad, myself and my 2 teen nieces) decided to dine at this Indian restaurant for lunch buffet. This was on a Tuesday around 1:30pm.

As we entered into the restaurant, there were only one other family in the restaurant (a party of 6). Inside, it was presentable.

As we headed to the food area, we notice some trays were empty. We had to ask them twice to refill them. Food in general tasted okay. I've had better elsewhere.

When the bill came, I was somewhat shocked. They automatically included tips in the bill. WTF!?!?  Here is the breakdown...

Weekday lunch buffet for 5 ppl at $12.95..............: $64.75
Total taxes..................................................................:  $  5.24
Automatic gratuity......................................................:  $11.65
Grand total..................................................................: $81.64

A little advice if you do plan to eat there. On their website, they have lunch buffet buy 2, get 1 free coupon available. Also for there is a 15% off coupon for dinner buffet. BE SURE to print them before going there!"}
{"text":"The buffet is amazing. Great selection of my favorite dishes; the flavor and quality of the food is off the chain. Great ambience, nice decor, reasonable prices and just an all-around great dining experience if you love Indian food."}
{"text":"I order from this place every couple of weeks (via UberEATS) and it's always really good. I've never visited the restaurant so I can't comment on service but as long as they consistently make delicious curries, I'll continue to order them!

It's quite a bit more expensive than some of the competition (e.g. Mount Everest), but I prefer their curry so I think it's worth it."}
{"text":"This place  was a saving grace to our vegas vacation.  we stayed at the wynn, right next door, and expected to gorge their much hyped thanksgiving fiasco only to find out there was a steady 3.5 hour line all day long!  we were not expecting to dine Indian, but the food was sooooo good that we were able to look past the great disapointment of not partaking in the anticipation traditional foodie heaven that we looked forward to all year.  
mind you, my sweet baby and I love indian food and travel a lot, always trying out different indian restaurants all over the country.  This place was by far one of my favorites that have been to.

common american mistake  rule #1: never order from the menu in an Indian place that offers buffet!!!

THis buffet especially  was super fresh and all the food was well prepared with love.  the chutteneys were super flavorful home made, they use really great recipes.
Moreover, the peeps in there were super friendly!  

A great unknown treasure next to all the snooty, tourist-trappy, overpriced pretentious places in the hotels that are not even that great, for a fraction of the price."}
{"text":"Pretty good food at this restaurant, nice and spicy like Indian food should be!  Different kind of curry's like egg, chicken and even goat!  Whichever was actually tasty.  For a buffet though, left a little to be desired, although tasty, @ 17.95 for the dinner buffet each, they should have a bigger buffet or lower the price.  That is the reason it only gets 3 stars instead of 4 or even 5.  More to offer and they would have hit it out of the ballpark."}
{"text":"Good location ... when you are tired on strip .. we ordered dinner .. dal makhni was nice , but Kadai paneer was nowhere near .. so overall ok food with such high prices . Will not visit again"}
{"text":"We ordered samosas for appetizer and they were drenched in oil. The butter chicken and garlic naan were ordinary. The naan was hard. The butter chicken had no taste. The rice was dry and the daal was not tasty. The only good part was the pista kulfi which was sold as pista but was actually a kesar kulfi. We do not recommend this place unless there is no other option."}
{"text":"We went here for the lunch buffet.  It was pretty good, but definitely not worth $12.95 per person."}
{"text":"I've had Indian food all over the globe (ex. India, Nepal, Sri Lanka, etc.) Bombay cuisine in Vegas is hands down the best Indian food out there! do yourself a favor and feast here to mend a speedy hangover. Egg curry and mutter paneer made my Vegas trip! Choose the right, eat Bombae cuisine every night!"}
{"text":"best dosa i have ever had. lunch buffet is reasonable($14) considering its location ( the waiter was somewhat attentive but he was very friendly(stereotype is asian resto has the worst customer service).  it is rigjt beside a Catholic Church so if you are ever on town, go to mass and then have lunch here."}
{"text":"This is the worst possible restaurant ever. I have never seen people so rude and arrogant after making stale food. The chicken tandoori seems like it was cooked few days back. This spoiled my whole appetite. I hope the concerned people take necessary action to make the restaurant better."}
{"text":"Had lunch buffet, egg curry had no eggs, goat is so chewy that I started chewing 20 mins ago and I'm still trying to finish it and daal wasnt cooked properly. Would never come back here. Only reason I gave it 2 stars is because the person who served us was working really hard."}
{"text":"The worst restaurant in Vegas. We are not at all satisfied. We ordered biryani but they mixed curry and rice and gave it to us.  It was worst in my 24 years of life. We ordered soda they haven't gave but they charged. Service was extremely disappointed. The guy who served us was not at all responsive. The way he spoke with us is not at all in a convince manner. He said the food will be in 15 minutes but he bought after an hour. We waited for 1 hour and came back without eating any food."}
{"text":"Worst food and rude behaviour. Rating should be minus since there is no option giving one. Please avoid if possible ."}
{"text":"HORRIBLE !!! If i could rate this a 0 i would!! Came at 925p to have a nice dinner, only for the guy to tell my party he is closed when the sign clearly says they are open until 11pm. Then asked him why the sign said they are open til 11pm and he said pest control is on their way.... at 930p pest control is coming ?? No sign saying they'd be closing early and there are people inside eating!"}

We will definitely go back  to this place during our next visit.

{"text":"As the months have passed since our last visit to Bombay (which was only days after our first visit), I have to ask, \"Why haven't we been back?\"

The service at Bombay is really top-notch, and I generally find Indian restaurants to be reliable in their warm welcome and swift attention. Bombay exceeded my expectations.

We first visited because, holy moly, an Indian dinner buffet? Really? Game-changer!

Alas, that first glimpse of the dinner buffet almost sent me back out the door. Tomato soup? \"Yellow curry?\" Were they trying to court the tourist who might be more comfortable with the idea of \"buffet\" than \"Indian\"? When we peeked under the dishes (almost everything was covered), nothing looked very good, or much like what you see on other Indian buffets.

But, there we were, and parking was a dream (something that keeps me away from my former fave, Tamba), and the fun of going somewhere new is my own catnip. (Plus Indian restaurants always have that clean, cold water like nowhere else. Bombay is no exception. I've asked for their filtering secret, but waiters just smile and turn away... like girls in a Don McLean song.)

We settled into a big booth and peered at the decor. Hmm, former Chinese restaurant? (Seriously, does anyone know?) I kept staring at a photo mash-up of the Las Vegas Strip and India that suggested if you exit the Venetian just right, you'll step into the Taj Mahal.

We started with samosas. With samosas I want fragrance, slight crispiness, not too much dough, and a spicy filling. Bombay satisfied me with texture and taste plus two fresh-tasting chutneys (mint and tamarind), although I could've done with a bit more fragrance. (I say that about everyone except Kamal Palace in Long Beach. They ruined me!)

On our second visit we also had paneer pakora. Fine, not too dry, fun to try once.

The list of vegetarian dishes was commendable, but I didn't see my favourite: shahi paneer. I lurve shahi paneer so much that I'm thinking of a name change. (Hey, it would only be one consonant, and it might help people finally pronounce my name right.) 

Indian foodies in the West seem to tend toward healthly eating, so I know this is so uncouth to admit, but I just adore-adore-adore a creamy sauce. Shahi paneer, aka royal paneer, is aptly named in this category.

It's not fair to dock a restaurant because they don't carry one dish. Then I'd be no better than those little kids who will only eat chicken nuggets. But, as almost every other Indian place in town (that I like) has shahi paneer, including the little place in the Riviera food court, this wasn't boding well for repeat visits. I like new things, but I also like what I like.

As long as I'm making confessions, I'm only really happy with an Indian main course if it has paneer in it. I know, I know, that's as terrible as admitting my love of shahi and makhani sauces. Don't misunderstand me, I squeal over aloo and pakora and kofta for sure, but paneer... cheese... that bar is set. Someone open a Wisconsin-Indian fusion restaurant and I will be complete.

Paneer dishes at Bombay include palak paneer (alas, the only Indian food I dislike - that's right, I hate cooked spinach - worst poster child for vegetarianism ever, I know), mutter paneer (nice, but can be bland with an overbearing amount of peas), and paneer tikka masala. I went with the last option. 

The paneer tikka masala was solid fare, as was the naan (plain and garlic) and rice, although the wording on the menu is a bit unclear over what's included. On each visit, we ended up paying separately for both naan and rice despite the words \"Served hot to eat with bread or rice\" above the list of dishes, which would imply that one is included. This is followed by the somewhat contradictory \"Add $2.00 to make entrees combo served with one Naan/ half rice order.\" We asked, but I have to admit that I'm not sure what the server said, other than it sounded like this wasn't available. Hrm.

Overall, it comes back to the word \"solid.\" Not \"transportive\" nor \"breathtaking,\" but also not \"iffy\" or \"meh.\" Prices run a little high compared to other area Indian restaurants (Gaylord and Origin excepted) but are right on the mark if not reasonable for the Strip location. To answer my own question, I think we haven't gone back just because there are other places where I can get exactly what I want. But, with the closures of Kohinoor and Saffron - Flavors of India (not to be confused with the Eastside place), Bombay - a \"solid\" 3.5 for me - gets bumped to four stars. 

Or: 2-star buffet, 3.5-star taste, 4-star menu variety and ambience, and 5-star service and location/parking."}
{"text":"So good The Chicken Teaka masala was amazing it's a bit expensive if you go at night but the portions are big enough you can share taste and friendliness 10/10"}
{"text":"Truly one of the most awful meals I've ever had. If they fed this buffet to prisoners, the ACLU would start holding candlelight vigils and writing letters to the president. 

Overlooked chana dal, greasy frozen samosas, palak paneer that was made from Eisenhower-era spinach, and rice that was...well, I guess you can't fuck up rice too badly."}
{"text":"Been looking for a good Indian restaurant around town and decided to give Bombay a try. I went in on a weekday during lunch and asked for a menu, but was told that only the buffet was available. I didn't really want to have the buffet at first, but since I was already there I figured why not. I also noticed that I was the only non-Indian person in the restaurant and everyone was having the buffet and enjoying themselves.

The buffet was fairly small and consisted of about 8 entree items, 2 different kinds of rice, a minimal salad bar and 2 kinds of dessert. I'm not too familiar with Indian food so I am not sure what everything is called (although most had signs above it), nor did I try everything. Some of the items looked a little old (like it had been sitting in the warming tray a while), but the items I tasted were warm and tasted fine. It's worth noting that the tandoori chicken and chili chicken were pretty tasty. I was a little disappointed that they did not have chicken curry, which is what I usually order. The waiter was friendly and came by to pick up my plates each time I got up to go back to the buffet and also refilled my water when it ran low. He also brought me a basket of naan during my meal that was warm and tasted fresh.

The restaurant itself was decorated nicely, although it felt a bit warm and stuffy while I was eating. Perhaps they  need to turn on the a/c? Just a thought. Also service is slow because they only have 1 waiter during lunch, who also doubles at the host/greeter. But this really wasn't a problem until it came time for me to pay because there were only 4 tables seated while I was there. I was never brought a check, and just handed the waiter a $20 bill and asked to pay for my meal. The waiter returned with $6 in change so I assume the lunch buffet costs about $14."}
{"text":"full of regrets right from the moment i stepped in to this restraunt with family. the attendants were very arrogant, not at all pleasing and at one moment, i felt like leaving in the middle. food was ok but service was very bad. origin of india was highlight on the contrary."}
{"text":"Who. So much to choose from this place of Indian cuisine. The price is very good for this place for lunch buffet plus they hours are great because the lunch extends till 4pm. It's only $12.95 for lunch buffet. 

They have many seats available, has free WIFI, and it's located on the strip next to the Encore hotel. 

You can eat as much as you can.  They are also rated A+ for health department. That's a good sign that they are very clean and reasonable place to check out if you like Indian food."}
{"text":"I don't understand why this place only got 3.5 stars....my husband and I came here for the lunch buffet and the food was amazing. They havr many different options and the staff is very friendly.
We were hesitant about coming when we first saw the ratings but are glad we went with our guts (no pun intended)
We will be back!"}

-extremely friendly staff
-forgot about us after a while.. Went thirsty
-no tikka masala in the lunch buffet which is what we came for
-basmati rice was ok.. The fast food joint in the riviera hotel had better rice
-naan was great though! Not too greasy
-not a lot of meaty choices

$13 for lunch buffet
$17 for dinner buffet

And they do take credit cards."}

{"text":"Extremely poor food, exhorbitantly expensive and rude staff. Almost as if they don't want you to visit. Disappointing."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise this was tonight.

My wife and I discovered the existence of Bombay, in the shadows of Wynn's \"Encore\" tower and were immediately attracted by the words \"dinner buffet\" - a rarity when it comes to Indian restaurants.

The restaurant is conveniently situated just across the street from Encore in a large complex with plenty of parking. When we went in we were immediately struck by the unusual decor, all blood reds and deep blacks, definitely a Chinese restaurant in some past incarnation. We asked to take a look at the buffet and the friendly hosts told us to go right ahead.

The buffet looked OK enough, however on this particular evening it was missing some of our key favourites so we decided to order from the menu.

At first I thought the prices were a bit high. It was understandable, I thought, given the Strip location. We ordered a serve of Samosas, Chicken Tikka Masala for me and Paneer Tikka masala for my wife, with a side of basmati rice and garlic naan and plain naan.

The samosas arrived and I was surprised and pleased to see three instead of the two mentioned on the menu. They came accompanied with the usual tamarind and mint chutneys and also a marinaded vegetable chutney. I thought the tamarind was especially excellent. The samosas were very tasty and I appreciated the crispy fried texture of the crust which made for a nice change from the more doughy (but still good, just differently) crust from other restaurants. The filling was aromatic and not too dense. Just right.

When our main dishes arrived I realised the prices weren't higher after all. For an Indian restaurant these portions are huge. Yes, they still come in bowls that look small compared to what you expect to find at American restaurant, but they are deeper and wider than the standard Indian serving and for the first time in, I think, ever we actually had to get to go boxes to take our leftovers home.

Initially we both thought the food was \"OK enough\", however these dishes really improve after a couple of mouthfuls and your palate adjusts to the complexities of the seasoning. My chicken was delicious and while my wife usually prefers a Shahi Paneer (which we didn't see on the menu) she enjoyed her Paneer Tikka Masala. 

The naan was very good, I particularly liked my buttery garlic naan and the rice was a simple yet delicious accompaniment.

Our server seemed genuinely pleased at our questions about how long the restaurant has been open (apparently since November) and was delighted we'd enjoyed our meals. His demeanor made Bombay one of the least threatening most relaxing Indian meals I've ever eaten, surprising for its location.  We will definitely be back.

On our way out the door, after we were presented with a loyalty card which offers 15% discount off a future visit, our host encouraged us to \"tell our friends\", so here I am - telling my friends. Bombay is well worth a try if you're into Indian food."}
{"text":"I don't usually write reviews, but I had to with this restaurant.  I'm giving it 2 stars simply because there aren't many vegetarian options on the strip, so at least they have that going for them.  Otherwise, this was very disappointing.  The food was mediocre at best and I paid $25 for a cup of rice, one order for Vegetable Korma, and some garlic naan.  Absolutely ridiculous.  I wouldn't go there again even with my desperation of trying to find vegetarian options on the strip."}
{"text":"Came with my girlfriend recently on a Friday night.... The experience was ok, but one thing I don't understand is why the drinking water was room temperature. I don't understand why sodas and other beverages come with ice, but the water doesn't. 

The food was also not very hot. In fact, my Curry was cold. So was the rice.... and after trying my girlfriend's curry which was different in writing, it honestly tasted the same.

I also feel that it was a bit overpriced for what we were getting. The garlic naan was the only thing I liked out of the whole experience."}
{"text":"I feel like this place went downhill. The food quality is not the same. The staff is friendly, but the food wasn't. I was a bit disappointed that the naan wasn't freshly made like other places. It's in the container sitting there, which makes the naan really dry. I wouldn't come back here for the buffet anymore. I'll have to stick with my regular place I go to."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are in town for vacation and stumbled across this Indian cuisine as we LOVE Indian food. We walked in got seated within couple of minutes the hostess/waiter could have had better customer service as in welcoming people and saying hello when people enter the restaurant but he was very good on filling up our drinks when we were running out so that was good. But I feel when we said thank you he could at least acknowledge with a \"you're welcome\" or a smile. Although I thought he was very nice he could show more of a personality.

They have lunch buffets but when we got to the buffet the food looked like it had been sitting there for hours it didn't taste fresh or hot anymore. BUT we chose to stay and try to order on the menu for a fresh meal. I ordered the butter chicken and masala fries my boyfriend ordered chicken tikka masala all with basmati rice. And served with naan. We were not disappointed by the fresh made meal. So I suggest just ordering from the menu! It was delicious and were super happy we decided to stay.

The bathrooms looked clean and the sink was beautifully designed. 

I would come here again just not for the buffet! ;)"}
{"text":"Awesome lunch buffet. Highly recommend. Plenty of veggie of options and yummy chicken tikka Marsala."}
{"text":"This one star is also just because they have Indian food..Hell of slow with the serving..not enough people to serve"}
{"text":"I had a very bad experience at this restaurant. Their management has a lot of arrogance. They are not polite with the customers. I ordered the food and waited for 20 minutes. Then I asked the waiter if we can get the food a little quickly. He turned out so arrogant and asked me 'how long has it been that you ordered. Is it 30 mins?' When I replied yes... He responded saying 'Are you sure?'. How can anyone speak to a customer like that. 
Finally food arrived. Malai kofta tasted good."}
{"text":"We did buffet here and the food was good, service was nice and the naan was 10/10, the staff is friendly and brings fresh food every now and then.

This was my 2nd time here and i think I will go again"}
{"text":"DON'T COME HERE. WASTE OF MONEY. DONATE YOUR MONEY TO SOMEONE WHO NEEDS IT RATHER THAN SPENDING HERE.Food smells really bad here. Different curries in buffet goat curry, chicken curry egg curry , but the funny thing is there is no meat in any of the curries. Guy who calls himself a manager  is a dumb ass."}
{"text":"Delicious and accomodating! The naan was lovely and buttery and served hot. Would highly recommend the daal and paneer. Also tons of vegetarian options! Our server was also very warm and brought me a chai tea on the house as a kind gesture."}
{"text":"The Buffet had a lot of options to choose from, including dosas! Costumer Service was great as well. Not my favorite Indian food, but totally decent."}
{"text":"We came in at 9pm, we didn't make a reservation, but it seemed pretty slow in there... I was craving Indian food, but we waited almost 10 minutes and we never got seated, or even greeted. NO acknowledgement whatsoever from the staff (which was one guy basically)! It was dead in there, so what's the excuse?... it was not even fancy in there anyway. I would not recommend it at all and I wouldn't give this place a second chance."}
{"text":"This restaurant is not closed or dead but it may as well have been because there is absolutely nothing about this restaurant that was appealing. The service was beyond terrible. When I get bad service, I usually end up tipping 5 or 10 percent but I was so disappointed that I told my friend not to tip at all. The food was average, definitely not the good but not bad at the same time. We requested chai and it took 20 minutes for them to get it. I can make chai faster than that. I do not recommend it. DO NOT GO HERE!"}
{"text":"Very good food. I did't go for the buffet but instead ordered off the menu. The buffet looked good but I was looking for a very specific dish that was not part of the buffet. Service very good, I was checked on frequently and my water was filled serveral times without having to ask. Price is reasonable for the quality of food and service. Don't be scared off by the strip mall it's in, it's all good inside!"}
{"text":"I tried their lunch buffett, and the food was decent- not horrible but also not amazing. There's a good variety of vegetarian and meat (mostly chicken) dishes on one section of the buffett, another section with dips, salad, and desert, and then another section with the carbs (rice, rice mixed with veggies, and naan). I also ordered a mango lassi, and this was refreshing. 

The location is by a strip mall on the Strip and across from a church. We were immediately seated. Service was okay - they were very good at filling up our water glasses but on the slow side when we were ready to get the check and pay for our meal."}
{"text":"I live in New York but this is the best Indian food that I've had in America. Especially the naan is a perfect 10. This place is a must visit if your in Vegas. Love this place and will visit this place if I ever come back to Vegas."}
{"text":"We found that restaurant by walking by, they had $16.00 Buffet GOOD DEAL!
they have more naan selection, I haven't seen at any other restaurant.

service - is okay, slow. they short staffed only 1 person doing all the work

Prices are very decent comparing to other restaurant in this area. 

Overall- I will Def go back again, I love Indian food."}
{"text":"Came here on advice from an out of town friend. The restaurant is tucked in a small back strip corner-ish type area on the strip. Up until I went I thought that whole area was closed down abandoned businesses. I was pleasantly surprised. There were 7 people total inside the restaurant, my friend and I included. No buffet that night. 
We ordered I had shrimp tandoori and it was just... so so, nothing great nothing bad... just average. The spices were spicy but did have a whole lot of flavor. The garlic naan even lacked enough garlic ( I'm a garlic freak ) IDK the food wasn't bad, it was just... average  to me I guess. 
Would I go again... yes, if someone asked to specifically go there but I personally wouldnt go out of my way to go again."}
{"text":"Great food and outstanding service!  I wish this guys were in Chicago near my home.  We were large group and they satisfied everyone's special request in the group.  Chicken Curry was outstanding with garlic Nan."}
{"text":"Here is the reason i am giving them 5 star NOW. I was looking to eat a south indian dish call DOSA for all over the town and, All the indian restaurant say they make DOSA but when you sit down and try to order they come up with lame excuses for not to make that. So call this place and ask they offering this plate and the person who answer the phone said they offer Dosa all day everyday. I was do thrilled and went with my wife to the dinner and, thinking last time we had shitty Dosa at Bollywood Grill on Sahara and Rainbow, Also Indian masala in Rivera Casino. They all made with old rotten taste vegetables in side and i couldnt even eat them with the spoiled food smell. Here i am at Bombay india Cuisine waiting.... WOW i mean big WOW!! its huge like a golden gate wrapped up and crispy and fresh smell with fresh Souses all around me. I was asking the waiter why you guys not telling people about this plate. Seriously, it was the greatest DOSA plate i ever had after long time. I mean longest time. Then my wife order Goat Biriani for her and it was as good as Dosa. We had great time. Interior exterior of the place is also making great appetite. Finally the owner told up he found  new chef from South india Few weeks ago, and that's the person make the different for the food. 

Great!!! Super great!! we are going back!!!"}
{"text":"We were on the strip and starving after a night out. We explored multiple buffet options and found Bombay Indian cuisine!! We had amazing authentic Indian food!! The ambience was amazing. The best part was the fresh&hot naan served directly to the table! Very friendly service. Will be back next time I am in Vegas."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of being introduced to this delicious food at a holiday celebration...the standard has risen... everything was exceptional I can't wait for the complete experience at the restaurant"}
{"text":"BIG NO!
Didn't like the food at all.. No variety
Neither for Non-veg nor for veg.
Leaving almost empty stomach from this restaurant. :("}
{"text":"I happened to walk by this restaurant. The service is friendly and the food is delicious."}
{"text":"Food not bad...not exquisite. Ps-I love Indian food...
The kheer and the naan were the best parts of the meal,  in my opinion..."}
{"text":"Came here for lunch buffet. I'm not an expert on Indian food and all I had tasted good. Nice place clean with a sanitation grade A three times. I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"The food was delicious and the serving sizes were perfect. The tandoori chicken was very tender and flavorful."}
{"text":"Food is pathetic. Not taste good. Less options. 
Less items - Not worth for even one time. Staff was rude.  Restroom was bad. Waste of money."}
{"text":"good food. authentic cuisine. buffet lunch is reasonable. an array of food  that you will feel like you are in bombay, india. while you are eatlier ng you get to bee exposed to authentic indian mysterious c too adding to the authenticity of the restaurant. 

we came tailend of the lunch so need to replenish the food but overall good. favorite is the samosas and padi padi, goat curry and tika masala are my faves!"}
{"text":"Would not recommend. I am a big fan of Indian food and I feel this establishment is missing an opportunity right on the strip. I would recommend keeping the buffet more hot and fresh, and to keep the cleanliness of the bathrooms."}
{"text":"Food is not good

We ordered butter chicken and naan.
Naan is little bit uncooked and butter is not up to the mark"}
{"text":"We just came back from Vegas, we had lunch there today, well, for Vegas, this is considered too small for a buffet, they had two kinds of rice, fresh out of the tandoor naan, and about eight to ten options of both meat and vegetarian dishes (apart from a salad, a soup, few chutneys and the two deserts), the quality was great, teh seating atmosphere was very comfortable, the price was right, the service was extremely attentive, the waiter actually came and offered to explain about the dishes, but, since we are Indian food veterans, we didn't needs his explanation., There was no lines, and we didn't have to walk half a mile through the casino to get to the buffet, you can't go wrong here, we will definetely come back when we visit Vegas."}
{"text":"bad service & order takes forever... wasted lots of time here...

tip: order online & have dinner at hotel..."}
{"text":"Great location on the north end of the strip near the Encore resort. I've been to several Indian places in Vegas and thus far, Bombay is the best! They have friendly service, nice decor, a TON of menu variety, and of course delicious and flavorful Indian food. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"The worst service ever .. People are so rude . Had to wait 20 minutes just for naan , when we asked for it he said 'are we sleeping here? '"}
{"text":"Had lunch here with my boyfriend as soon as we arrived in Vegas. Fresh food, plenty of options, and very friendly service. The naan was the best we've ever had! Would highly recommend when you visit Vegas!"}
{"text":"After 24 hours of drinking,gambling,walking the strip and drinking again, the lights of vegas were starting to blind me and the my body seemed immune to black coffee and water.
Like a shining beacon of hope i spotted the words Bombay Indian cuisine.

The husband has this theory that Chaas/buttermilk (salted Lassi) is the answer to the mother of all hangovers and boy it works like a miracle.
This restaurant is located at las vegas blvd which is not very far from the strip, the area however is a little shady.When we walked in around 7:30 the place was pretty empty (never a good sign).We got a table for 7 people and were seated right away,the staff  didn't seem to have a care in the world and loud bollywood 90's music was playing in the backdrop.

We quickly ordered salted lassi for everyone and it arrived pretty quickly in tall fancy glasses (used to serve milkshakes in diners).Once i had a taste of that my doubts were cleared as was my splitting headache.The drink was delicious and refreshing.
We went on to order Tandoori chicken, chicken tikka, chilli chicken and chicken biriyani with some naan (Indian bread).The chili chicken was great,other dishes were just average.The portions are good and eventually the staff warmed up to us and also lowered the volume on our request (I was actually starting to enjoy the music, guess i was high on buttermilk).

Overall the food is three stars but i will give them a four for the buttermilk that saved my life literally.

Cheers!"}
{"text":"My parents were looking for some Indian food during our stay in Vegas and Yelp pointed us to Bombay Indian Cuisine. This place is located just past the Encore Resort on the Strip in a strip mall next to some really touristy souvenir shops. 

While not impressive from the outside, the inside was quite nice and tastefully decorated. We showed up right at 11 am, so we were the first customers.

The buffet selection isn't large (roughly 8 main items, a salad bar area, and a few appetizers) and it's a bit overpriced (~$15 per person at lunch). However, the food was quite good. I especially liked the goat curry (it's awesome that they had goat curry to begin with) and the tandoori chicken. I wish that the dishes were a little spicier, but I tend to like my food spicier than most people do. The samosas were a bit on the greasy side (even for samosas). The naan was cooked perfectly though. Overall, I was satisfied with my meal. However, this place doesn't compare to any of  the myriad of wonderful Indian restaurants in the Bay Area. 

This place is a decent Indian buffet. I hope it's not the best Vegas has to offer though."}
{"text":"Girls weekend in Vegas definitely required some recovery time at our resort and I found this restaurant through Bite Squad food delivery service.  My roomie is vegetarian and the food was delicious and beautifully seasoned.  This was our first time having Indian food.  The vegetable fritters and garlic naan were our favorites!  The  vegetable Manchurian was delicious, too.  I'm not vegetarian but I had it that way for my friend and the food was very filling and satisfying.  The option of heat level when ordering is a good thing, too."}
{"text":"Food is awesome at least you get good vegetarian option and restaurant is next to Encore Casino so no need to go anywhere else"}
{"text":"Totally Unauthentic  n tasteless food. I really don't care about interior, but at least except good taste and fresh food. Their soups are so watery, feel like having packed soup powder mixed in water. Korma wasn't creamy at all. I would not suggest this place  until you only wanna eat Chicken Kabob and Tandoori  Chicken with Wheat Roti"}
{"text":"HORRIBLE experience with this place.  Took more than an hour for them to get our order.  And we didn't order anything out of the ordinary just dhal, roties and rice.  Pathetic service by the staffs.  No reason given on what the delay was.  However, others who came after us were given their orders!!!  We finally had to walk out without having food in this sick place.  When we did, the staffs were smiling, not something that I will tip for.  Someone suggested these people were serving beyond their capacity -  are you kidding???? There were hardly 15 people.  Good that we didn't have food from here, I am sure their food is also as disgusting as their attitude."}
{"text":"We had to walkout of this place after 1.5 hours of waiting, NOT at all a customer friendly place. They didn't even apologize for the inconvenience."}
{"text":"Their open buffet is average , their taste is not excellent ..........
I went to them in new year . But I won't visit them again .........  


...........................................,.,,.,.,,,.,,,,.,,,,,,,.."}
{"text":"We had dinner here. Expensive!!!! Expensive!! Expensive!!!! 

Samosa was rather bland. Paneer tikka masala, butter chicken and chicken Karahi was okay. Among them, I liked the Karahi the most as it balanced the flavor nicely. Daal makhani was bland and unimpressive!

Service was HORRIBLE!! Took literally an hour to serve! The waiter was extremely rude. The price was about $123 for unimpressive food with bad service!"}
{"text":"I must say the service is excellent,as it was late lunch,with only one other couple in the place... The food was tasty,except no samosa on the buffet and it was a little pricey for lunch... The naan was light  and flaky,plus they have the mango lassi for a few $ more..Minus a couple of stars- due to the cost,granted it is an all-u-can eat buffet...
Parking was easy,right up front,but located in back of a small strip mall...
Easy to miss,if you did not see the sign out on las vegas blvd.."}
{"text":"Yes, they have a dinner buffet, but even for this Indian buffet devotee it was bit too pricey and not up to snuff visually. Everything was the same shade of brown, and the overall impression was that the food had been out for a decent amount of time. Plus, there were few vegetarian options. which are generally my favorite! Thus, we decided to order off the menu, which is a rare occurrence when I step into an Indian establishment.

The most impressive thing about Bombay was our server. He was impeccable. He had worked at another restaurant in town for a brief period of time, and he remembered my name and my husband's occupation. He was incredibly kind and attentive. He recommended the mixed vegetable curry and paneer tikka masala. For $2 extra you get a combo with rice and naan, which brings each entree to around $14. 

When the naan first arrived, it was clear we had been served a reheat. As soon as we said something, our server whisked it away and soon returned with hot from the oven, fresh naan. The new naan was good. As for the entrees, the tikka masala was definitely the stand out. I would order it again. However, the mixed vegetable curry reminded me of a Haldiram boxed meal. These meals aren't bad, but when I eat out, I expect a bit more. Some of the vegetables were canned, and the curry flavor didn't seem unique. 

On an interesting side note, if you're looking for big, black leather booths (this seems to be a common Vegas request), they have them here. Of course, the fluorescent lighting and Indian fare probably aren't really vintage Vegas. 

On the Strip and are craving Indian? This will get the job done."}
{"text":"Great food, great service.  I felt like I traveled to the Holy Land.  Thank you Bombay."}
{"text":"Where do I start? Bombay Indian Cuisine was definitely Bomb. The atmosphere was comfortable and quiet. My waitress was a sweetheart and because I've only eaten Indian Cuisine once before I wasn't sure what to order, but she was patient and helped me through the menu. I ordered the Shrimp Curry which was amazing! I like spicy, so I ordered it at level 5 which was perfect. I ordered the rice which was so much better than Asian rice and went perfect with the shrimp curry. I also got the garlic butter naan and dipped it in the Curry sauce and if all blended so well. Highly recommend this place, I will be visiting again before I head back to Alaska!"}
{"text":"The rich red walls, comfortable leather booths, and colorful artwork makes for a cozy place to eat. My friend and I got there around 5:30 and it was empty. Usually this is not a good sign, I would have turned around if my plus one did not have a living social coupon. 

The wait staff were quick to welcome and sat us in a quiet corner booth. The restaurant picked up after 6, but the noise level was minimal. The busser came by to refill our drinks and cleared the table of dirty dishes promptly.

The dinner buffet was lacking for $17. There were minimal choices and some of the dishes were room temperature. The tandoori chicken had a nice flavor, but was dry. The chicken curry was flavorful and the meat was moist. The cauliflower in curry sauce was one of my favorite dishes, but there wasn't anything else that stood out. with a total of 10 dishes on the line, you will have no problems trying everything. There are better Indian restaurants in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"Worst service......dont have enough people to serve.....
And buffet was very bad....."}
{"text":"An average Indian restaurant located in a shady marketplace on the strip. We ordered matar paneer n bhindi. The okra was completely dry n rubbery which made it hard to eat. The breads were just ok."}
{"text":"Oh, my goodness- I've never eaten at two restaurants on the same day before, but I did today!  My evening meal was at Bombay Indian Cuisine, which sits in a plaza in the shadow of the Encore, and very close to a wedding chapel or two. 

Immediately upon entering the restaurant I was hit with a lovely aroma of deliciousness- it was fabulous. It was about 6 pm on a Saturday and there were only one or two other occupied tables.

The space is nothing special- no carpeting, no \"atmospheric\" lighting. There are two dining areas that look exactly the same: hard, black wooden chairs (not the most comfortable, but serviceable) with bench seating on the wall side. The bench seats were topped with high, shiny, black, tufted backs.  I liked the lighting they used over the tables, except that until our meal was served, our fixture was blinking with almost a seizure-inducing regularity. I'm glad it stopped or I would not have been able to eat at that table.

The food was deeeeelicious.  We started with the chicken pakora, which actually wasn't anything special as far as seasonings, but was sufficiently enjoyable.  

I got rice and naan to accompany my entree: the lamb tikka masala. I don't know why  I chose lamb- I just didn't want chicken or paneer.  The entree was a very attractive deep orange/bright red color, and was both rich and satisfying (photo has been uploaded). I could have done without the meat altogether and just sopped up the sauce with the naan, it was so good.

I must say that I was surprised that they gave us burnt naan. Had it ALL been burned I would have sent it back, but only the top layer of pieces came out that way. I didn't mind that some of it was crispy/crackery, but I preferred the warm, soft pieces underneath (and I'm not a fan of charred bread!)

The Bombay masala tea didn't taste very \"Bombay masala\" to me, but it was refreshing. It could have been Nestea or Lipton, for all I know. On a hot day I would have really enjoyed it, but the restaurant was cold enough that I kept my jacket on the whole time.

The service was great- the servers were very polite and unobtrusive, and made sure we were well attended throughout our visit.  They didn't give us a hard time when we presented a restaurant.com coupon, which I appreciated.  

I'd have no problem coming back here!"}
{"text":"The worst Indian restaurant that i have been to. I went to a private party that was hosted in this restaurant and the buffet was only $10 and the food tasted like shitt I'm serious no flavor and no taste no salt nothing. The dal curry tasted bitter , the lamb curry had not lamb only bones and skin, even the tandoori chicken didn't taste good. I mean i have had way better indian buffets for 10 bucks. Their regular buffet is more expensive and slight better than this. But anyway there was a lot of ppl at that party where they were charging 10 bucks for a drinks, what they should have done was impress the people with food so they will come back another time but they made the food so bad that i don't think any of those people will want to go there again."}
{"text":"I've been frequenting this establishment over the past 2 years, and they seem to have changed ownership. What once was a legit spot to get some Indian food, has definitely gone to diarrhea status. 

Walk in, no one greets us. Ok, I'll let it slide (even though the place is almost empty.) Go to use the restroom, and I see one of the cooks finishing his business and proceeds to walk out of the bathroom without washing his hands. Maybe he washed up in the kitchen I hope? I chose to be optimistic, but definitely not a great impression. Bring on the E. coli and Hep, baby. And slather it up with some naan and Tika Masala. 

Fast forward to the lunch buffet, which is decent, but nothing special. Server never comes by, so I walk over and ask him for a drink. Again, the place is dead. 

The one nice thing about this place was that it was quiet, despite being in the vicinity of a convention. But I don't think I will be coming back anymore."}
{"text":"We just love love love this restaurant.  We stay at Bellagio but make the trip down to the dodgy area just for this delicious unpretentious food."}
{"text":"Tasteless food in the name of Indian food!!
Waste of money with disappointing staff behavior as well.Never recommend to anyone.
Nothing good to write about.

Forced to give 1 star as we don't have choice to give 0 stars."}
{"text":"For a local to drive to the Strip on a Friday night to try Bombay Indian Cuisine one would think not. However, the restaurant is conveniently located off I15/Spring Mountain Drive near The Wynn and, most importantly, the food was delicious!!  

My daughter and I  started with chicken samosas, lamb and chicken kabobs and onion bhajis.  The chicken samosas were well balanced with flavor, and not doughy.  The kabobs were moist and flavorful - I liked the lamb the best.  Onion bhajis were yummy, I just added some mango chutney for some heat.  

For my main course I ordered the chicken tikka masala and the mutter paneer, both of which I would definitely order again.  Each was nicely balanced with flavor, and portion.  

This was my sixteen year old daughter's first experience with Indian food and she was to go back and try more menu items.  I agree."}
{"text":"Stone in dAl makhani . Very dirty bathrooms and sink leaking . Feel bad as the server was extremely nice and professional but had to write this review as I got food poisoning last night after eating"}
