{"text":"Loved the service and food! It's my first time eating here & I was afraid they wouldn't have meat free sandwiches but the cashier guy Anthony was awesome and gave me great suggestions! The pesto sandwich was delicious! Best I've had!!! Thanks Anthony (:! I'll be coming back for sure!"}
{"text":"What a fun discovery. My granddaughter and I found this sweet little coffee shop inside the Library. We had very good sandwiches and enjoyed sitting at the table playing a game chosen the many they have placed in the restaurant to enjoy."}
{"text":"Love the Café at the Library.  I visit the Library 3 to 4 times a week. My first stop is the Coffee Press Café. I usually pick up a pastry or white mocha. I have also tried sandwiches and the muffins . All food is reasonably priced and very good. The employees are always pleasant and efficient in customer service. Taja and Elizabeth are usually working when I visit the Café. They are always pleasant and make a Person feel welcome. Taja  is great at suggesting Items to try out. This is why I Love the Italian Sodas. Going to try the Blood Orange Soda today. I also have a Slight addiction to the Brownies. I suggest you try it out......"}
{"text":"I like that they're trying with creative food names on their menu and some of the staff is nice, but there was this girl there with red dreads who was really awful and rude. Not to me, but I saw her drinking and eating behind the counter and being rather rude to a customer who asked for a water cup. Other than that everything tasted okay and it's a cute little shop."}
{"text":"This is a convenient place to get coffee and sandwiches when your already at the Paseo Verde Library. Lots of kids come here when school gets out."}
{"text":"It was slightly difficult since I'm not from this area of town. It's connected to the Paseo Verde Library so you see many people passing by and little kids too. I order the a blended mocha and the pressed Pinocchio Sandwhich with added turkey. My drink was ok, I've had better. My sandwhich as well was ok. It could've been pressed more to actually resemble a panini but other than that, it tasted pretty good."}
{"text":"Best Carmel macchiato and breakfast sandwiches by Melissa! Good food, great service, highly recommend this place !"}
{"text":"Pretty average coffee shop. Service was friendly but coffee was just meh and the staff seemed completely undertrained. Good atmosphere and obviously convenient, there's just really no reason to bother unless you are already at the library."}
{"text":"So I'm on my way to get some library books and I see this coffee place. At first glance, I think that this place is going to just average and they wouldn't even have good coffee. Boy was I wrong. I order me some regular coffee and I go in on that stuff. Straight guzzling that coffee down. I couldn't believe how tasty this coffee was. It was so good that I forgot about those library books. Then I got one of those Yin Yang cookie things and it was probably the greatest piece of art I've ever feasted on. Those cookies could end wars. Then, as I walk out, I see some jelly beans. I LOVE JELLY BEANS. I put like $5 into that machine and just went crazy. You have to go here now."}
{"text":"I love this cafe! I come to the library every week to study and I always buy snacks here. The employees always make me feel welcome. I personally suggest the iced white mocha, but really, any coffee here satisfies my caffeine needs."}
{"text":"A coffee shop inside of a library, what's not to love?! This little joint goes above and beyond, offering both beverages and hot/cold foods, in addition to healthy snacks and even school supplies. There's ample seating and a community atmosphere, and none of the librarians make frowny faces when you take your coffee in with you to grab your books!   Pay attention to the board out front with the specials- a recent peppermint mocha rocked my world, and they offer surprisingly hearty hot sandwiches considering their small space and reasonable pricing."}
{"text":"Super friendly baristas, yummy bagels, danishes and donuts. Excellent coffee and tea. Games to play for kids. Comfy chairs to lounge in. Next door to library entrance. Doesn't get better than this!"}
{"text":"Ok first the good,  the counter guy was real friendly and nice, the bad your prices are to darn high.  If your getting bfast your better off going to mcdonalds or even burger king to get more bang for your buck. Even the donuts are over 2.00. Also it took forever for my bfast item and i was the only one in there.  I guess your paying for the nice atmosphere.  I do want to add the food was good, just out of my price range."}
{"text":"Service is great and attentive. I came here thinking I could have some lunch and then work on some stuff for work (via wifi), but turns out they don't have free wifi - which is my reasoning for 4 stars instead of 5. For wifi, you would have to get a library barcode with a password.   I had the Melville Tuna on marble rye which was good and made it a combo with an iced tea and chips. It was $8.65 without tip.   It's a really cute little place that I thought would work, but as there was no wifi, I had to leave after lunch to search for other options."}
{"text":"Cool little café a minute walk from my work.  The atmosphere is friendly and inviting and they have a variety of snacks and lunches.  I don't drink coffee or teas but they have a large selection that my coworkers enjoy.  The black and white cookies are my favorite and are always good.  Their homemade sandwiches aren't too shabby either, although they can be a little pricey for what they are."}
{"text":"When I think 5 stars I think \"extravagant\", but this was none of that. Average coffee, average tasting bagels and sandwiches, average atmosphere. Not sure how it got rated so high in relation to the amount of reviews but every now and then I get a \"meh\"."}
{"text":"Lenny was awesome! So friendly! I enjoyed being able to sit in the corner and study while eating my breakfast sandwich, which was absolutely delicious!! He was clean and followed health regulations ( I watched very closely). I like that he always kept busy and talked to the customers, even when there were obnoxious individuals."}
{"text":"This is quite possibly one of the best coffee shops/lunch spots in town...not what you would expect at your local library!  Lenny was extremely friendly and delivered top notch customer service.  Trust me, order the Pesto Manifesto and add a slice of turkey, ham, and pepperoni...I guarantee you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Excellent sandwiches and coffee! Plus the two guys that work there are super nice good guys. Oh, and the donuts are amazing!"}
{"text":"I love that the library has a cafe! We always stop and it's great incentive for the kids to be quiet! Friendly staff makes it a fun stop!"}
{"text":"Possible great Tinder date location.   The Coffee Press is located inside the Paseo Verde Library and couldn't be a more random coffee shop, but the espresso is still pretty good. The get their coffee beans from Mojave Java and Tea, a local coffee roasting company.   The espresso tasted fresh, not bitter, and had that perfect soft foam on top. Yes, espresso should have light foam on top and shouldn't taste like burnt caramel. The green straw guys have it twisted. There's a small seating area here as well and a kitchen that's fully equipped for making sandwiches, toasted bagels, or serving hot sweet pastries.   Why is this a great Tinder date location? It's brightly lit, it's cheap, and you can make a sneaky escape through the library if the situation calls for it. Tinder meet ups, espresso, and pastries; sounds like a solid Tuesday afternoon."}
{"text":"I walked into this place for a quick snack break, and regretted my choice almost immediately. Upon walking in, I noticed the dirty tables and lack of greeting from the employee at the counter. No other customers were sitting inside. I wanted to order their special, but the employee told me they were out of it, so I ordered a standard turkey sandwich, which was $5.50. Employee didn't even smile once and I was disappointed by the dirty and sloppy appearance inside. Sandwich was average, nothing special. Will probably not be returning due lackluster customer service."}
{"text":"Awesome coffe place right at the Library entrance. Prices are reasonable and coffee is delicious, not to mentioned their pastries and sandwiches that are really good too"}
{"text":"A great place for a cup of coffee while you enjoy the Henderson Library.  They have great chocolate chip cookies too!"}
{"text":"Nice, quiet (due to inside a library) local spot that brews a mean cup of joe.  The owner and staff have always been nice and helpful to myself and family.  Actually brought people from out of town here."}
{"text":"Great coffee and food! It's clean, quiet and quaint.  I love stopping here to get great quality coffee and a little snack. Their bakery items are awesome as well as their sandwiches. Beats Starbucks any day."}
{"text":"First timer here, I went to vote and had no clue this little coffee place existed. I stopped in and had a breakfast bagel and small iced vanilla coffee. Very good :) I'll be going back!"}
{"text":"Thankful this coffee shop is attached to the Paseo Verde Library. After three hours of homework you know a girl can get hungry. I got the pesto sandwich (tomatoes, cheese, pesto sauce and Italian seasoning) with a small coffee. Their espresso machine was down, but that's ok! I got a regular coffee with hazelnut syrup. I love how they have various game boards to play with. Also, if you forgot your writing supplies, paper etc, they sell pens, pencils, paper and more as well!"}
{"text":"food and beverage options are awesome and service is great!!!"}
{"text":"I go to the library frequently to do my homework. I frequent the coffee press often.  The staff there are amazing.  Lennie, Thomas, Liz, (and formerly Taja) are top notch.  I would definitely recommend them."}
{"text":"Waste of money and time. The coffee was an utter disappointment. It was burnt and bitter, couldn't even finishish the cup I purchased. Not a great atmosphere. I would not recommend this place to anyone and would not go again. So many other great coffee places to go to in Henderson."}
{"text":"This place is a great little local coffee shop tucked away in the Paseo Verde Library! The staff there is super friendly, I just wish they had more help! When I was in there there was only one person working and they had to do everything, coffee, smoothies, sandwiches, taking orders, everything. They were super nice and somehow managed to get everything out fast. I enjoyed my drink and I look forward to going back every time I'm at the library."}
{"text":"I love the dirty chai tea here!! My friend got a strawberry smoothly and it was very refreshing on a hot summer day here in Vegas. This quaint cafe is the perfect place to study or get a little something to eat while reading a good book.  The workers are very nice and understanding, when I had a question they were happy to answer. They have free wifi and it's very fast. The air conditioning is works amazing and feels so nice after a hot day.  I would sooo come back here with my friends and tell them about it! It's a perfect place to chill and get some work done."}
{"text":"I love coming here. The library is one of my favorite spots and I know I can stop by for a quick drink and/or snack at the coffee press anytime. Staff are pleasant and the ambiance is delightful."}
{"text":"You would never guess that this awesome coffee shop is hidden just inside the doors of the Paseo Verde Library. What a perfect combo. Coffee and books! But Coffee Press has so much more then just coffee. They have sandwiches, bagels, fruit, pastries, and tons of other beverages.  On this visit I just ordered an ice coffee and a cheese stick. The barista was sweet to ask if I wanted room for cream. She even warned me that the lids were being weird that day and to be careful. The coffee was brewed just right and didn't have that burnt taste that some places can have. I love the option of the cheese stick instead of a cookie, which they do have and they look delicious. They also have a protein box. Super convenient!   The staff at the Coffee Press is always very talkative and friendly. Even though the space is small there are a variety of places to sit and relax. They also have outdoor seating!   What a great place to sit, drink your coffee and read your book that you just borrowed from the library. I'll be back for the excellent coffee and to try one of their yummy sounding sandwiches."}
{"text":"Such a good spot!!! It's in the library, really easy to access and has an entrance outside of the library. Good coffee, pretty good pastry, and tbd on the breakfast sandwich. The young lady at the front was so sweet!! The atmosphere was nice they were playing jazz and the place was pretty busy. This place is definitely a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Pleasant atmosphere!  The Mark Twain Turkey sandwich was delicious.  The guys behind the counter are friendly.  They have a huge selection of flavored syrups for coffee and the huge peanut butter cookie was fresh and yummy.  I will go there again!"}
{"text":"The place is awesome!! Excellent service!! Excellent food!! Everything they offered was beyond my expectations. I might have a new addiction."}
{"text":"Wow this place is SO GOOD!!  Definitely one of my favorites now!  I must honestly say that their new Pinocchio Panini is the best sandwich I've ever had! I cannot express how profusely amazing it is!  They must either have skill, a super good panini press, or both because the ciabatta has the perfect texture of crispy on the outside and soft in the inside. It has tomato, mozzarella that's like fluffy pillow clouds, lots of pesto, a bit of balsamic vinegar, and fresh basil. A must try!!!"}
{"text":"What a great place to relax, with java or desserts. The girls behind the counter are always friendly and helpful.  It elevates going to the library, with this independent gem of a coffee & sweet shop."}
{"text":"This is by far MY FAVORITE coffee house because it has a variety of drinks, bakery items, AND the best food. I come here at least 2x week or more.  This is a great local spot!"}
{"text":"This cafe is located inside the Paseo Verde Library. It has a large coffee selection as well as food. The sandwiches are very good and the price is fair. I highly suggest it if your going to the library and need a break."}
{"text":"Good service and good coffee definitely will be back again. Right in the library so if you want to wake up to be able to do your homework or study would highly recommend you stop by and get a coffee. The service was very quick and efficient very friendly worker."}
{"text":"Not sure why this place is so highly reviewed. Ordered 2 mochas and they didn't even taste the same. Mango Italian soda was alright."}
