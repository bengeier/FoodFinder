{"text":"I ordered \"speck\" which came with chopped raw lettuce littered everywhere on the pizza. Literally had to eat it like a salad at first. The buffala entree was tiny, like the size of a golf ball split in two and they serve no bread to eat it with. These tomato sauce-free pizzas also took an annoyingly long time to make. There are much better places nearby, like magpie, napolitana or focolaio."}
{"text":"Petit endroit magique où la pizza est hallucinante. Très très abordable et vraiment romantique."}
{"text":"A huge dissatisfaction and disappointment.  Listening to the gazette food critic brag about this place,I wanted to try.It's supposed to be Pizza Neapolitan style I have been to Napoli I know what it  is, this place doesn't even come close,tasteless ingredients plenty of tasteless dough The worst Cesar salad ever."}
{"text":"This place is pretty OK, but seems mostly likeable to me because of the way it makes people feel cool when they're there and its nice terrace. [ambiance and design go a long way.]  I've been here twice now. The servers are funny. Went in with a small group in the afternoon on a weekday when no one was around and the server took a lot of time getting to us and seemed to forget about us. Then he poured my friend a second cup of wine even though she had changed her mind by the time he had come back. It was presumptuous, but obviously 'mistakes' like that help them make money.  Secondly, the pizza is hit and miss. I've tried two so far. The best was the $19 porcini pizza -- really delicious. The margherita bianca and their others that I've had bites of were nothing incredibly special and often lacked subtlety -- for example, there are way too many oregano flakes when they use them and the result is a generic pizza experience.   The pizza has also given my friend stomach problems twice now. Wasn't a problem for me though."}
{"text":"Good place to chill, terrible place to eat pizza if you can even call it pizza. There is no even cheese and it's just bread burnt on the sides."}
{"text":"Yummy crust! I had the Ricotta pizza with pistachio pesto, mozzarella, and lemon zest. I found it a bit too oily for my taste but the roasted pistachios give it a yummy saltiness that makes you want to keep digging in until the last bite. My boyfriend had the Prosciutto with grape tomatoes and arugula, I had a bite of it and found it to be pretty good. The place is small and inviting, could seat max 20 people. Prices are good for the quality you get. For both pizzas including tax and tip 37$"}
{"text":"Solid pizza, decent appetizers and ok service. The location is perfect for a summer night. The pizza itself is good but other restaurants are making better pizza at the moment."}
{"text":"I was looking for the classic italian pizza and some friends recommended No 900 in Bernard.   I love it. The flavor is awesome and its the classic italian pizza i prefer. I don't like too much bread, therefor i love the light one they make at this specific pizzeria."}
{"text":"Serveur bien mais ce qui est pour l'entrée d'antipasto à 24$ , insignifiant pour le prix, quelques bouchées et 2 bouts de pains maisons mais finalement de pâte à pizza cuite. La pizza margarita correcte mais le fromage était quasi inexistant sur 2 pointes...très déçue, celui de la rue Peel est supérieur...mais quand même 90$ pour une bouteille de rouge, une entrée et une pizza et on a encore faim, même pas le goût de commander une autre pizza...je connais tous les restos d'Outremont, je suis du quartier, payer pour la qualité sans problème mais être cheap sur les portions et le fromage, ça passe pas, y faut pas prendre les gens pour des cons...ma 2 visites chez vous et ma dernière...prochaine fois qu'on a le goût de pizza, on marche dans la petite Italie! Ciao"}
{"text":"This is indeed a small place but we were lucky to get the last table for four. Service was friendly but pizzas took a while. We were in no hurry on a beautiful summer evening. Wine selection small but well priced for a glass - e.g. Chianti $7 and we were given a sample to try. Three of us ordered the porcini, burratta and truffle oil pizzas - the amazing aroma hit us first - divine. The taste was equally good. Crust is light but we would have preferred a more fully baked bottom. We sampled the Margherita but found the tomato sauce lacking in flavour. Since this is the standard for pizza lovers, I am only giving this place 3 stars. However, we all intend to return for the porcini pizzas. Another disappointment - no decaf espresso."}
{"text":"Pizza saucisse italienne douce gouteuse, excellente. On y retourne. Service rapide sur place. 10 minutes."}
{"text":"The bottom line here is that the pizza was absolutely delicious. I read some stuff about the service being bad but that was not the case with us. The waitress was very friendly and came to see us often to make sure everything was OK. We tried 4 pizzas and they were all delicious. The price is also very reasonable. Old school Neapolitan pizza just the way I like it. Will definitely be going back often. I wish they would open one in NDG as we could use a great pizza place."}
{"text":"Je n'aurais jamais pensé manger là puis vouloir y retourner dès le lendemain. Et dieu sait combien on en essaie des places à pizza et rares sont celles qui se démarquent, même parmi toutes les récentes ouvertures. J'y suis allée deux fois, je dois admettre que le service est un peu lent, et j'ai été consciente de quelques erreurs ou oublis à des tables autour de moi pendant mes 2 expériences, mais la pizza est tellement bonne qu'on y retourne. Je vous conseillerais bien de commander pour emporter, mais en même temps, le charme de cet endroit est que c'est très petit, au beau décor et convivial. On y va à 2 ou 3, mais à 4-5 vous pouvez attendre facilement 1h. Parmi les 5 pizzas que j'ai essayé, ma préférée reste la margarita et la porcini et truffes. Wow! À essayer, assurément."}
{"text":"When I complained about this place last time, somebody urged me to email my complaint to them directly. I did, and she said she would relay it to the owners. This was almost two years ago, and I never heard back.  In the meantime, I've been to the pizzeria 3-4 times, though I'm not sure why. The pizza is decent, but not nearly as good as the prices and atmosphere suggest. I really hate going here: it's impossible to get anyone's attention (last time 3 waiters were on their phones as I was waving to get the check, and the one who served us didn't even make eye contact before walking away), the food takes forever (I kept track last time and it was 44 minutes, at 9:30 PM on a Thursday), and the pizza is spongy and way overpriced. You might enjoy this place if you really love chewy pizza and obnoxious hipsters, but I'm staying away."}
{"text":"Was there on a Sunday night, temperature around 16c, they had a outdoors heater...but was not functioning...we asked whether we could have one that was actually working but the rude waitress (or rather manager) pompously asked us to move inside...don't think so lady!   She finally threw menus at us so we could order...and so we did...burrata, as an entree and Pizza con salsiccia calabrese for main.  They must be kidding!!!  The Burrata was not a burrata (and old at best) and the pizza, which took 45 min to arrive after the entrees, was \"uninspired\" to say the least. And nothing calabrese or Italian about the salsiccia. They must had a bad night or something. The long and the short is that we had a bad experience with very unprofessional staff and manager. The energy was negative as soon as we walked in.  I seldom write negative reports, but I fear that I am forced to do so in this instance. Sorry guys."}
{"text":"Visiting this restaurant for the first time during the summer was a treat. My wife and I sat outside in a cozy area where the waitresses and waiters could barely get through between the tables. The casual sidewalk and street traffic was enjoyable. They appear to have a policy where any waiter or waitress can help as we were serviced by three different people all very helpful and friendly. I rate the service a solid five stars. The selected Chianti glass of wine paired nicely with the sausage pizza we ordered (Saucisse italienne douce). The sausage was very fine and wasn't chunky as you might expect. Over all this was a wonderful experience that we repeated a second night while in town."}
{"text":"Not bad, but nothing I would go out of my way for...sadly.  I had big hopes, especially  as a pizza 'fan boy.'  The pizzas look wood oven cooked, and simply look delicious.  They are delicious.  The acid test of a good pizza is the crust though. The flavor was good.  The texture was chewy, but when they serve the pizza with a fork and knife there is a reason.  You cannot pick up a piece and eat with your hands as the toppings that slid off the slice and on to my pants will attest to.  After a few bites I wondered if it is in fact cooked in a wood oven because it just is missing that crispness a super hot oven gives.  Besides the food, the space is tight.  Don't bring a big group!  And don't expect much privacy for your conversation. But, as I said, it's not bad."}
{"text":"I really love the Caesar salad here. The pizza is ok, not my favourite. But they make it in 90 seconds! Service is great but the restaurant itself is small. It's much better for takeout or delivery (if you live close)"}
{"text":"Update!  Delivered home. Disappointing. The toppings were few and far between, thank goodness it was take out as I was able to add some extra of my own - but I shouldn't have had to do that. The toppings were bunched in the middle and as you can see from the picture it was half empty crust. I was not impressed. If you're offering a delivery service, you should ensure you're able to deliver hot food - the delivery guy did not have one of those hot delivery bags so of course the pizzas were cold on arrival. If you don't have one of those, maybe it's better not to offer the delivery option.  The stars are for - despite all that - what I did eat was tasty, so gotta give credit to that. But yes, I do have complaints."}
{"text":"Sans aucun doute ma meilleure pizza à Montréal ! Rapport QUALITÉ/prix parfait et c'est Rare à Montréal... Bien contant d'avoir pu déguster une énième fois ce soir une bonne pizza chez vous, avant mon déménagement sur la côte ouest. Bon courage à vous en espérant vous revoir lors de mes déplacements à Montréal."}
{"text":"Tout est dans l'assiette!effectivement la patronne ne vous écoute pas,les tuiles blanches font penser à une salle de bains,seulement 17 places à l'intérieur(toutes les visites ne peuvent être qu' impromptues,par petits groupes) et 60? En terrasse quand le temps fait penser à Naples.et un service lent(overstaffing en salle?)vins italiens-on les félicite! MAis alors la pizza:exceptionnelle tant la pate que la garniture!alors avec la gentillesse du personnel c'est l'émotion.on y retourne aux heures creuses pour éviter de manquer de place. Pour la petite histoire:il y a 35 ans(deja) ouvrait,en face le PATATOU avec la 1ère terrasse à Outremont.on faisait la queue....."}
{"text":"Simple and tasty pizza.  Small place, takes a while to get your order but the pizza was very good. The pizza sauce and cheese was amazing.  Their Caesar salad is too authentic. Small and a little bitter because of the capers which is very traditional and not westernized."}
{"text":"La meilleur pizza a Montréal!!                                                Pour cuire et obtenir une croute  très croustillante et moelleuse  il faut un four qui va jusqu'à 900 degrés, le gout des pizzas est très bien équilibrées et les ingrédients sont de qualités. Un peu étroit mais sympas quand même un incontournable!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I have been here a couple of times, for eat-in and for take-out. Thus, this review speaks to all the visits.   The pizza is consistently good, we have tried and enjoyed a couple varieties.   That being said, the service is consistently poor. It takes forever for the servers to even notice you're there. Half the time, I just see them standing at their station playing on their phone. In fact, we went for lunch last week and another customer \"joked\" to the waitress \"Hello! You didn't even notice me in here?\" after he tried getting her attention numerous times.   What we do like is the lunchtime special from 11:30 - 4:00, on weekdays. You get a pizza (margerita or pizza of the day) and a side (two types of salad to choose from, or in the winter soup). This minestrone soup that they serve is AWFUL! First, it's not the classic Italian minestrone that is a tomato based broth with beans and vegetables. It's a clear broth (seemed to me to be water) with some cut up vegetables. It had no flavour, and it took forever to be served to us. Which I didn't understand as it's already made and just had to be poured into a bowl and brought to us. When it did arrive, it was cold. DONT GET THE SOUP, It's awful!!! Get the caesar salad!  Come for the pizza, make sure you're not in a rush as the service is extremely slow and not attentive."}
{"text":"I really love this place. It's super consistent and solid Pizza. We used to live around the corner from this joint and it was our go to. It's unfortunate that they've started to charge for egg on top of the Pizza, but after trying every pizza on the menu both of our favorites are the Saucisses Italens Douces with added garlic and an egg. The pesto sauce on top is the perfect addition. We've also had their cesar salad and a cheese fondant dish in the past, and both are delicious. The place is fairly prices for a dine-in napolitan pizza. Compared to most italien pizza joints outside of little Italy, no.900 is definitely my favorite and my go-to!"}
{"text":"Ok, I am a huge fan of Bottega, arguably the best pizza in the city. But the P900 is freaking good. The atmosphere is great, simple and pizza focused. The food, especially the pizza is reasonably priced and really good. I have had just about every type and I have enjoyed them all. The ingredients and the quality is there. I really like the spicy pancetta pizza, buy I like spicy. The only down is that all locations seem to be small and super simple so not too comfortable and the pizza is small so sharing 1 doesn't work. Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Les pizzas, c'est la vie. Je suis toujours hyper emballée à l'idée de tester une nouvelle pizzeria italienne, surtout quand les avis sont très positifs !  Chez N*900, j'ai choisie de goûter la pizza \"speck\" qui m'a fait de l'il sur la carte. Du speck (forcément), des tomates, du parmesan, bref que des bonnes choses ! Et bien malheureusement je n'ai pas été conquise DU TOUT.   Je m'attendais à trouver de la sauce napolitaine sur ma pizza (qui en plus est apparemment délicieuse chez N*900) mais non, rien. Je n'avais aucune base (ni tomate, ni crème), ce qui a rendu malheureusement ma pizza très fade. La seule chose qui lui donnait du goût était l'énorme quantité d'ail posé dessus (cru en plus).   La pâte était bonne néanmoins, la prochaine fois je testerai la Marinara (la plus classique).   Petit point positif : enfin une pizzeria à Montréal où ils utilisent du basilic Genovese et non du basilic Thaïlandais au goût anisé !"}
{"text":"What went wrong is the service. We called for a delivery of 2 pizzas at 19h30 on a tuesday night since the weather was terrible outside, even if we live 10 minutes walk away. An hour later, we receive a call saying that our pizzas were missing with their delivery person. So it's either we wait for the delivery to show up (after already waiting for an hour) or we pick it up ourselves. We were shocked to find this out an hour after our order, when we were specifically told there was a 30 minute wait before getting our pizzas, which we accepted. This is very disapointing for the fact we needed to walk in the terrible weather to pick them up, getting them more than an hour and a half later...."}
{"text":"Two words: buffalo mozzarella. Somehow, this simple tasting white blob of a cheese makes a world of difference to a pizza. I was really, really wishing there was more of it  on mine, which was the \"Prosciutto\", consisting of the said cured meat, rocket and sweet cherry tomatoes. I finished the whole pie with ease, which is testament to how good it was, as well as how thin albeit authentic, according to my date who knows a thing or two about Napolitan pizzas) the crust was. He had the marinara, with extras of egg and anchovies, which was quite good too. It was a Sunday afternoon when I dined there and I was not in a hurry to get anywhere after, so the length of time it took for the food to arrive didn't bother me much. However, I was slightly disappointed that the pizza didn't arrive piping hot. The outer crust was lukewarm, hinting that there had been a slightly more than desirable delay in it being delivered to our table. Overall though, it was a very pleasant outing. We sat on the terrace, the servers were lovely and the price reasonable. It's a great asset to the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Service was good.  Decor is very nice: trendy and original.  So why a one star rating? The food. Ultimately, that's all that counts.   Uninspired menu, just copying what is already out there but with less quality. Pizza dough is not good... Chewy and tasteless. Even the wood fire oven can't save it. We tried 4 different kinds of pizza and we all remained unimpressed with the toppings. Simply not flavourful.  If this is the type of pizza you like, stick to Brigade or Bottega, which are better choices. If you feel like exceptional pizza, stick to Napoletana on Dante.   Sorry to be so harsh... But it's just not worth."}
{"text":"First off, I have to admit that I'm biased in this restaurant's favor due to the quality of it's branding (great typeface, beautifully painted window sign) and overall interior/exterior design. So yeah, the first thing that got me was the whole vibe of the place. Think Parisian bistro style outdoor seating, yellow accented table furnishings, subway tiled interior and a funky wooden branded bicycle out front.  Although totally casual, the overall design of the place is fantastic (I know I know, I repeat myself), and I have to say that although it's not the best pizza I've ever had, it's definitely up there for Montreal. Plus the price/quality ratio is pretty darned good too (their pizza pie is cheaper than Bottega and dare I say even Magpie).  The wine list is short but good and decently priced, and the service was pretty solid as well. I tried 2 desserts, the tiramisu and a chocolate tart, and although the tart was \"meh\", the tiramisu was \"j*zz in my pants\" good.  The only thing is that the hostess who seats people is pretty rude and I once waiting in line for 40 minutes for them to tell me that there was a problem with the computer and that they couldn't take any orders (like a pen and paper does not exist). So that pissed me off. My rating went down from 4 to 3 because of that."}
{"text":"Great little place for excellent brick oven pizza! Good atmosphere good wine list good prices!!!"}
