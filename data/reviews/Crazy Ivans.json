{"text":"If you want a lot of really good food cheap and fast, this place is for you. The spicy chicken shawarma was delicious and the portions are huge. The crazy cakes are really good too. Highly recommended and I will be back soon to try the beef shawarma and gyros."}
{"text":"Pass this spot everyday since it's near my house so I figured I'd give it a try & it was everything I dreamed of. I got \"The Ivan\", which is their Chicken Shawarma and it was incredible. So many unique flavors hit your pallet like a Mediterranean cacophony of yum, and the entire thing was almost as long as my forearm. Pickles, Cabbage, Tomatoes, Cucumbers, Chicken, and some creamy sauce I couldn't identify. Was a little soggy but I think the girl just put a bit too much on, not really an issue though because of how delicious it was. HIGHLY recommend, I don't think there are any better Mediterranean flavors in Medina"}
{"text":"Clean, friendly service, though we didn't care for the food. Our dogs had Shawarma for dinner."}
{"text":"This place is so weird. Just came outta nowhere. Set up shop in a building that's always had weird stores. And it's called Crazy Ivan's? And they only have like one or two things on the menu? What the hell... But you know what? It's damn good shawarma. Damn good. Haven't had shawarma this good at many other places, certainly none around here."}
{"text":"i love trying new places so when i drove by crazy ivans i was intrigued. The staff was very friendly and the food was fresh. i got the pannini and the sharma both were great. i hope everyone tries this place because its def worth it."}
{"text":"Fun, bright, clean place to go for something different.  Happened to be in Medina for the day and saw this place across from the gas station where we stopped.  Had the chicken shwarma and really enjoyed it.  I saw them making the bread from scratch, there was plenty of meat on the shwarma roll and the sauce had a delightfully fresh flavor (I asked for extra and it was no problem).  Looks like a Russian lady owns the place so I would say the recipes are authentic Russian cuisine.   I'll be looking for more next time I'm out that way.  A+!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  shawarma is so good i get it every friday!  the owners are super nice!  its a must try!!!"}
{"text":"What is a shawarma you ask? Simply delicious. Apparently it's a Turkish \"gyro\" and it's very tasty. I decided to try Crazy Ivan's today and I'm glad I did! Their beef shawarma had great flavors and I was very impressed. I will be back for sure"}
{"text":"I have to say I am really impressed with Crazy Ivans!  We noticed that there was a new restaurant at their location last week.  My family and I were a bit trepidatious since we have seen many businesses come and go at that location over the years.  

However, we were drawn in to try the food because we saw that they had shawarma!  We love shawarma in our house and we were very excited at the prospects of having good shawarma near home!

We tried it yesterday and LOVED it!  I am serious this was a delicious and healthy lunch.  (Healthy, quick, cheap and tastey are a nearly impossible find in Medina) 

I love this place.  The food was amazing and I will definitely be going there often to get my fix!!  

My only negative experience was that the wrap didn't have enough sauce.  My husband had the same experience.   The top and bottom of the wrap had some sauce but it was non-existent in the middle.   This led to a large amount of the wrap being very dry.  If they tweek that one thing then I will seriously have zero complaints and I will have a hard time keeping myself from eating it daily!"}
{"text":"Highly recommend! The owner was exceptionally kind and sociable. The food was fast, fresh, and DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"The shwarmas here are amazing! All of them. Although I can't speak for the vegetarian version. Today I had what is possibly the best burger I've had yet in Medina. The \"Jones\". Portabella burger. Absolutely delicious!! Highly recommend this place!"}
