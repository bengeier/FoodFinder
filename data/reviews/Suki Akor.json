{"text":"Very good menu my wife isn't big on sushi but the selection off the robata section and the chilled appetizer was plenty enough. The menu is a little bit expensive but hey you pay for what you get, I will pay extra anydays to get fresh seafood on my sushi. Good atmosphere, great location and the friendliest staff. Overall had a great time. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"So I work nearby and was very excited to hear there was a Japanese option available for lunch. First of all, the staff was very nice, attentive and pleasant.  The place wasn't busy.  The server recommended the bento box which I got with steak.  So, for $19 I thought I'd get a great variety and decent amount of food.  Nope, just steak which was meh, rice, and overcooked vegetables in a brown sauce.  The food wasn't bad, just ok.  I would really reconsider going back there b/c it was expensive for what you got. I think they need to get more reasonable lunch prices and maybe provide a bit more food."}
{"text":"Great ambiance along with warm and friendly staff. Had the California Roll off of the lunch menu. Good and fresh tasting. Perfect portions and combination, sushi and sashimi combo with choice of salad or Miso soup at a great price."}
{"text":"First visit....7:48pm on a Saturday night. I'm sitting next to a couple with two kids under 10. The place is so brightly lit, it's like being at cafeteria with really nice chairs. The staff members are warm and friendly which is refreshing. The menus are laminated ()
Aparrently you can wear gym clothes to dinner here, there is no dress code. 
The Green Monster and Dirty Old Men rolls were great.
Not sure if I will go back on a Saturday night. There was no vibe..."}
{"text":"Bit of a disappointment, while I would give a thumbs up to the overall service the ambiance doesnt match the price point at all.  Not sure what they are trying to go for but it truly feels like you are sitting in a cafeteria. May be a better fit for a quick lunch but wouldnt recommend for any special occasion or an evening out with friends."}
{"text":"Sushi was okay, but nothing special. We also waited a very long time to order and for our food to come out. But the worst part was that we got food poisoning! We called to let the manager know and we were told someone would be in touch with us soon, but never heard back from them. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"The service was amazing. Great people. Our server Diamond was beyond patient with us. For drinks we ordered water and hot tea which was served in a regular cup instead of a mug or teapot. So hot tea from a regular water cup was to HOT to hold.  It was not the servers fault though, they apparently didn't have any teapots or mugs at all in house. 
For appetizers we ordered papaya salad, softshell crab, and calamari. The papaya salad was very small and had absolutely no flavor at all. It was plain. The calamari was okay, nothing stood out from it. Not big or shareable either. The soft shell crab was small for the price. 
For entrees we ordered the filet minon, grilled chicken, red snapper, chirashi, yakusa, and green monster. To start the filet minon was probably the best thing out of everything we ordered. It was cooked right and it came with potatos. The grilled chicken came out cold and dry. It was 2 pieces of chicken with yes 2 pieces of grilled asparagus, broccoli and mushrooms. The fried snapper was presented beautifully. The chirashi was great, sushi was the best thing we ordered. Big props to the sushi chef!!! All of the sushi was presented amazingly and came in different styles. P.S tip your sushi chefs to guys!! They work hard to make your sushi edible and presentable! 
I hope they change some things from the time it takes for them to bring the food which was almost a little over an hour to it tasting better or at least worth the price. We payed about $470 including the tip. So yes very over priced. Try it for yourselves and see the food they have. It's a big assortment with a lot of different choices. I'd give 3 stars for food but the service was great so 4. Everyone was very friendly."}
{"text":"Very bright, in fact a little too bright.  Food was incredible!  Got the blackened duck which was the best we've had, but it wasn't blackened, so the description is a little inaccurate, but don't get me wrong, it was fabulous.  Also got the RC Rainbow Roll with cucumber on the outside instead of rice for the health-conscious.  It was really good, but needed some wasabi to kick it up a notch.  Good service and we would definitely come back, but needs a little more atmosphere, lower the overhead lights."}
{"text":"I went here thinking it would be a great experience since people I know has been raving about this place. Unfortunately I was very disappointed with the whole experience of it all. 

First off the menu was not very creative. No originality what so ever. The really funny thing was that it states japanese steak and sushi on the sign. But I would say 50%of the menu was thai good with Tom yum soup and green papaya salad for instance. 

I ordered the chawanmushi. Which is supposed to be a silky hot egg custard dish with a texture of a flan. Instead I got a dish that would be more of a steam egg dish. ( If the chef doesn't know how to make something he should not even attempt it. ) it just make him look stupid to Japanese customers or customer that know japanese food 

Next I had a grilled chicken dish and it was dry and the breast was not cleaned or trimmed of the grissle. 

The duck breast dish was actually cooked well but the sauce that it was served with just ruined it. Again nothing Japanese with the sauce is made with black bean sauce and capers which was very salty. 

The menu looked like the chef and owners went around to different restaurants and copied dishes they liked at other restaurant. And the menu was actually outdated like miso chillean seabass which was a Nobu dish 30 years ago. 

In short the food is very over priced for the quality"}
{"text":"Stopped in for dinner. I literally saw their sign from my hotel window. Turns out they are about a week old. I wanted carry out and reviewed the menu, looking for veggie-maki options. I ordered the cucumber and avocado rolls and asked if they could prepare a vegetarian-tempura roll. The server asked the manager and they made it happen. It was really good! The only criticism would be, it would have been a better experience if the veggie tempura was drained well, before rolling. Otherwise, I really enjoyed my meal. It was fresh and reasonably priced."}
{"text":"This place is soooooooo good!  We got several Sushi dishes and a couple of their cooked dishes.  We had great service and everything came out quick and fresh.  The atmosphere is fun and hip.  This would be a great place to go before hitting the town.  Love the location and the interior!"}
{"text":"I don't yelp often- We had an amazing experience at Suki Akor. We came for a team dinner after work. Coming from Boston, we had high expectations for the quality of fish and the restaurant surpassed it. On top of the food, the service was phenomenal. DIAMOND you rock!! Thanks for the awesome dinner... made our whole trip!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered take out while staying next door at the Embassy Suites.  Hostess stand was very friendly and attentive when I arrived to pick up.  Unfortunately, upon getting back to hotel I saw they forgot to put in soy and wasabi (mandatory for me with sushi) even though I asked that it be included when I placed the order.  Again, they were very friendly and responsive when I went back (although they didn't say \"sorry for the inconvenience\").  Finally was ready to enjoy the rolls I ordered, and although I found them to be pretty good, I didn't think they were great by any means.  Looks like a good spot to try again, but will eat there next time.  I'll be sure to give em another shot!"}
{"text":"Great Japanese restaurant in a part of uptown without too many restaurants.  Brand new, nice clean interior. All the servers work very well together and everyone is friendly. Sushi tastes super fresh and there is a great variety of non-sushi Japanese food."}
{"text":"Good lunch spot. We ordered the sushi lunch bento box meals and you get a lot of good food for the price. Ordered a roll too and it was a little pricey but it was a big roll. Going back again and will update"}
{"text":"Awsome Sushi spot! really delicious....  the fish quality above and beyond... the papaya salad so refreshing.."}
{"text":"I wanted to give 1 star, but decided to add another with the following review. 

I can tell they spent a lot of money to open this spot and this restaurant is next to the great hotel with valet parking, across the street from NASCAR museum.  Getting there is not a problem, getting in would be another story.

The menu items and it's price reflecting you are stepped into a high end restaurant.  As soon as you get your food, you would start asking yourself why, why are you paying premium on food court quality food.

It is not authentic japanese restaurant.  As other reviewers stated, they serve a lot of Thai food and Americanized \"fusion\" japanese food.  Would i complain PF Chang?  No, because i know what kind of food they advertised as Asian bistro!  Less flame to you if you call it Asian Steak and Sushi.

Sushi rolls that they have probably more expensive than Oku or Nikko with the lesser quality/ambience/vibe combination.

We had the sushi combo, a few rolls and a hot dish.  Honestly we left feeling very disappointed, and i wish I did listen to my wife to head out to the other restaurant.

Why 2 stars?  Service is great and i think that alone warrants a star bump.

Will not be back."}
{"text":"The waiting time is long for us but the manager tried his best to take care of us.

Try to avoid going there as a large group."}
{"text":"Loved it! The atmosphere is cool and hip, the wait staff was fantastic and the food to die for. Soft opening last night was a little crazy, but they made it work. We ordered the sushi and different apps. The sushi was fresh and innovative and delicious. Get the corn, so good! Killer onions in the shrimp scampi with fresh, sweet, plump shrimp. I'll be back for more. Origato!!"}
{"text":"I was very glad that Charlotte uptown can have a sushi place. My boyfriend and I came here today and overall it was okay.

Pros:
1. The service was great; Jeffery served us today and he was very helpful.
2. The maki was good, about $16 for ten pieces.
3. They offered 2-hour free valet parking at Embassy Suites.
4. There was a good selection of sake.

Cons:
1. The left-end piece for maki was not in good shape, for the two maki I ordered.
2. The sashimi has a clear fridge-taste, which I understood - there were not many people so it was hard to get fresh fish all the time; also, as it was $32 for 16 pieces, I did not have a high expectation. However I would rather pay more to get higher quality sashimi. Not recommended.
3. We were offered a 2-person table but it was a little bit small for the food we ordered; it would be better if we sat on a 4-person table, or if the plates were smaller.

We did not order tempura or soup because they seemed to be over-priced. I did not regret giving the place a try, but the food can definitely be better, give the price level. I would give three stars and half - rounded up for the good service."}
{"text":"Me and my sister came and try their land and some sushi menu option. From land we try filet mignon, the meat come in perfect temp as I preferred and very well presentation. We also try their tuna Tataki which is fresh and taste delicious. Sous in tuna Tataki perfectly balance not over seasoning not to sour like other places. I would say price vs quality is very fair price. It's worth it for what we paid. Service is also great very attentive and professional. 

So far our experience is great. Definitely our new spot to come on weekend. Read couple bad review on yelp, totally different what our experience from some bad reviewers. Seems they get bullied quite bad."}
{"text":"I rarely eat lunch out at work, but recently a group of 8 went here for lunch. I arrived late, so I ordered the lunch special fried rice, with Shrimp. My friends all ordered Sushi, 10 minutes before I arrived. My food came out before theres, and I finished eating before they got their food. My fried rice was excellent and I had enough for 2 meals. No complaints at all. However, my friends were a little disappointed, because the Sushi took so long to come out. Taste was fine. I'm not sure if this is the restaurant fault or my friend fault for ordering Sushi at lunch. Typically, Sushi does have a longer preparation time. Anyway, if you want fried rice and shrimp, its excellent here."}
