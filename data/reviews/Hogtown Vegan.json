{"text":"I asked for a booth and the waitress said she couldn't seat us at one. There was only 2 other people in the restaurant and booths were open. The unchicken & waffles were good but the macaroni and cheese wasn't. The iced tea tasted watered down. I'm willing to try other dishes but at the Bloor location next time."}
{"text":"Fast food vegan style. Greasy and not healthy. Tasty but you feel guilty for eating all those calories. There are some differences between this and the Bloor location. Being a corner unit, it is cold in the winter. The fries are better but the wings not as good. They have a special of the day at this location but stick with the menu items. I had an unveal  parmigiana (the daily special). It was terrible. It was extremely soggy, like it had been soaked in water for days. The food at the Bloor location  has always been very good. I expect this place will improve."}
{"text":"Great comfort food. Delicious, no compromise vegan fair. A must visit when in Toronto. The Nacho cheese fries will leave you wanting more."}
{"text":"I'm not a vegan, but this place is awesome. Super cool vibe, and our waiter was very polite. They have a bunch of records up on the wall which makes for an interesting decoration. 

I ordered the un-chicken burger with bbq sauce, and a side of fries. My friend got the same thing but with a side of Cesar salad. The chicken substitute is very convincing, and the seasoning is perfect. The portion is the right size, not too small and not unnecessarily big. Comes on a fluffy sesame seed bun. And the toppings are minimal. Keeping it simple with lettuce, tomato, and pickles. Of course it's completely vegan, and I'm always left satisfied as if I was eating a real chicken sandwich. Maybe even left more full. Sides are typical, nothing special but satisfying as well. One thing I noticed is that they have quite a few selections for sides. The fries were good so the other sides with fries like the poutine should be a good pick too. 

I was so satisfied I didn't get end up getting dessert even though I really wanted to. Totally would come back and make sure I get a dessert."}
{"text":"I have been to their Bloor location multiple times, so when I heard that they opened a new location of college I had to go and check it out.

Same menu as the Bloor location, same greenish walls. This place has a patio but I'm writing this review on December so needless to say I didn't get to check it out.

I asked the waiter if they had any secret menu items, he suggested the \"Un-chicken Popeye\". I was expecting a vegan version of Popeye's fried chicken, but it was more like a chicken pot pie with gravy on top (Pot pie, not Popeye!). I'm not complaining, it was delicious! Even better was the side of mac and cheese that came with it.

Overall great experience, I'm glad to see more vegan restaurant opening in Toronto."}
{"text":"This location carries the same great food quality and service as the original one on bloor! Nice and cozy atmosphere, and the best vegan comfort food in the city hands down. The phish n chips is the best!"}
{"text":"Just as great as the original location! Staff is friendly and everything on the menu is incredible. Can be quite busy at times. Has a separate brunch menu."}
{"text":"Randomly came in to grab takeout for the first time today. I decided to get something I knew would be fast as I was pretty hungry so I went with the poutine which was pretty decent. The only thing is I hate mushrooms (yes, I'm probably the only  vegetarian to hate mushrooms, I know) and I noticed after I ordered that is what the gravy is made of. Anyways, I was surprised that the cheese actually tasted pretty good considering I haven't had good luck in finding a vegan cheese I actually enjoy (or one that actually melts for what matter, lol). My order came fast as well, less than 10 mins I would say. And even though I wasn't dining in, the host at the front offered me a drink of water which I thought was awesome. 

I'd definitely give this place another try but I'd opt to dine in instead so I can try other things off the menu and rate the customer service."}
{"text":"The Foooood:
- Beef stew with dumplings: Great, strong flavor, and great textures! I was excited to eat \"beef\" stew again and this did not disappoint.
- Mac 'n cheese: I'm not a huge fan of vegan cheese in general, but they did a good job with this in my opinion. Good flavor, little spicy.
- Mashed sweet potato: Sweet and creamy goodness.
- Wings: They got the breading to roughly approximate chicken skin, which was a nice touch. The sauce and texture of the \"chicken\" were enjoyable.
- Fries: They were overcooked, but they were sprinkled with some kind of tasty spice and the sauce they come with is nice.
- Cream soda: Good. Has an interesting flavor for cream soda.
- Chocolate mousse: So good. My only complaint is that it's a tiny little bowl for $7, but that's the case with all desserts everywhere in Toronto it seems.
* Price of meal before tip: ~$50 CAD

Ambiance:
Lots of other customers, about 75% full. Everyone seemed to be enjoying themselves. The servers were very friendly and on point with service. We were seated immediately (~7PM on a Sunday). The patio is pleasant in nice weather. They have communal seating outside-- 4 picnic tables segmented to denote individual seats. My only complaint about the seating was that my butt was sore from sitting on the wood bench for 45 minutes, and it might be a little awkward for a less-than-agile person to sit down/stand up (I'm sure they'd bring a chair out if needed). Otherwise, no complaints!

Summary:
We enjoyed everything about our food and our visit. Hogtown has become my new favorite vegan restaurant in the GTA."}
{"text":"You're not a vegan but the thought of eating \"healthy\" junk food appeals to you. Besides, what's vegan chicken wings really gonna be like?

Well, it's just saucy tofu charged at a premium Ã  la veganisn with a side of mediocre service. Fine for the token experience if you really want but I'd spend my dollars elsewhere. Btw, no resos. If you walk-in, they'll take your name down but not your phone number. No, they won't call you. If you miss your chance... too bad. Anyway: Walk-in Saturday 6PM and expect a 45-minute wait for a table for 3-4.

If you're actually vegan though, this place is pretty great. Good menu variety, cool diner-esque decor, and IPAs on tap."}
{"text":"Good vegan food. Went for Sunday brunch with a friend who went to the other locations first. The college street location was less crowded, cleaner and more aesthetically pleasing.
Good, personable and prompt service.

Ordered the chili cheese fries and macaroni (meal) as our starters. They each arrived steaming hot and were delicious. About halfway thru Mac and cheese we both knew we were full, but our meals arrived so we continued. My friend had the the unchicken waffles and I the PB French toast. My was great, except I didn't love the 'bacon' not sure what it was but definitely prefer what they use at Fresh or frankly none at all.
Took most of our meals homes and I enjoyed for lunch the next day.

Food great,
Service great
Price very good
Location great
Ambiance, fine"}
{"text":"As a fairly newly transitioned vegan, I was very happy with my Saturday Night dinner venture here

I had the Beef Stew with Mac n Cheese as a side and it was comfortingly and decadently delicious.

Followed by the cookie ice cream sandwich... yum yum

My hubs and I shared all this and we were both satiated. He ordered a pint of their special (don't recall what it was) but I had a sip and also really enjoyed it."}
{"text":"This is my first experience with a vegan restaurant. I've only been a vegetarian for a couple of months and find that the only thing I've really missed is a good greasy burger. I've set out on a quest to find the best vegetarian/vegan burger. The Hogtown Vegan definitely delivered! It's a cute location, with a good sized patio and a comfy interior. The servers were friendly and helpful. I know sometimes vegan places can seem intimidating and a bit elitist, but these guys were super kind and unimposing. I had the bacon burger and it was delicious! The \"bacon\" definitely couldn't fool a carnivore, but it added a nice crunch. The burgers actually tasted like a real burger, not this rice and lentil bs you get when you order a veggie burger in a normal restaurant. It was filling and cheesy and wonderful. My mum, a non-vegetarian/vegan tried the nachos and enjoyed them!"}
{"text":"If you're a vegan, this place may be just for you as there are not a lot of restaurants that are strictly vegan I find. Wouldn't recommend coming here on a Friday night with 4 or more people as the place is quite small and they don't take reservations. We waited for about an hour but at least they serve water while you wait with limited seating if it's busy. 
We ordered the unchicken and waffles, the beef sandwich with a side of coleslaw and Mac and cheese. The unchicken and waffles tasted good with the syrup in cinnamon for the waffles. Vegetables were seasoned well but nothing special about the seasoning for the chicken. Mac and cheese tasted like almost like soy sauce so that was new for me. Used a bit of ketchup just to try out the flavouring (not sure if this is a Canadian thing). I probably missed actual mac and cheese but it was ok. 

There's parking on 13 Brunswick Ave. $10 for the evening."}
{"text":"While on vacation in Toronto, I was told that this was a great vegan restaurant. So glad I went. It's quite small, but the food and service was great. I ordered the un-chicken, collard greens, and sweet potato mash. The collards weren't as seasoned as I like, but I just added a little salt. It was hard for me to decide what to order because they are a lot of offerings on the menu. If you're in the area, check it out."}
{"text":"If you are used to the Hogtown Vegan on Bloor some differences with this one are the patio and bathrooms are downstairs. Besides this the decor is very similar.

We walked in on a Friday afternoon and they were very busy which was great, we didnt wait long at all.

The menu is very similar to theqq Bloor street location. We ordered the Big Hog, the un-turkey sliders, and the bacon cheeseburger with fries supremacy.

The waitress served and seated everyone in the place and didnt miss a beat. All said the quality was fantastic and we will be back again."}
{"text":"We went to the other Hogtown Vegan location on Bloor and heard this is the newer location on College so we thought we'd try this one next.  The decor is much nicer so I do recommend this location over the other but both are about the same size for seating.  The food is equally excellent as is the service."}
{"text":"I just want to start with saying I am not vegan and this food was amazing!! I got the bacon and cheese burger with chilli cheese fries. I don't eat red meat and this definitely satisfied my burger craving! The food came out pretty fast and was hot!  The meal was very filling with a great price point. 

The service was great, super friendly servers. The restaurant isn't too big. We got there at a good time and as we were leaving there was a line up at the door. I will gladly go back!"}
{"text":"Highly delicious. You would not believe it's vegan. I had the unChicken and Waffles and they were so yummy. I especially loved the mashed sweet potatoes and the greens. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"It was my first time here. Great service. I had their Southern combo. The pic & presentation was good, but the food was just ok. Mac & cheese was great, couldn't go wrong w/ the collard greens, but the 'chicken' was lacklustre. I'm going to try something else if I come back."}
{"text":"OMG!! Best vegan restaurant! M brought me here as a surprise and it was honestly the best surprise ever!! I have never been more impressed with the choices and the flavours of the food. At restaurants, choices are limited being a vegan...but here...all the choices were an option! We ordered the shiitake fried \"clams\" the hogtown burger that reminded me of a Big Mac and we upgraded to a side of Mac and cheese! Both M and I were thoroughly impressed with everything and we genuinely had a great time. 
Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed Hogtown Vegan! The atmosphere was very friendly and I loved the decor. I came with my friends, and the waiter was nice and quickly gave us menus. I ordered the Southern Combo with collard greens, mac and cheese, and fried chicken. It came with BBQ sauce. I loved the mac and cheese as it had lots of flavour. At first, it was a bit sour but I quickly got used to it. The collard greens were a tad bit salty but still delicious. As well, the fried chicken had a nice coating and it went well with the sauce. Overall, it was quite filling for a $14 meal! I will definitely come back!"}
