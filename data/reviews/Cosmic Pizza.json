{"text":"i seriously can't believe this place is even doing business...  the worst $20 pizza ever. their customer service is horrid too... i told them that i was not happy with the pizza i purchased (first and only time) and the response was, and i quote \"there is nothing wrong with the pizza, besides, YOU ordered it\" NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"food is great delivery time sucks last two times i ordered they told me 45-hour and it took 2 1/2 hours the first time pizza was cold they gave me a cookie w/ ice cream that was kinda burnt but it was hotter than the pizza the 2nd time took 2 1/2 hours i called at an hour and at 2 hours to ask what was up they were snotty as all get out to me then my bf called a half hour later and bitched at them and just canceled the order it might have to do with the fact we live in mesa but they arent that far from where i live the time shouldn't be that bad. will never order from there again regardless of how good their pizza is."}
{"text":"I had the exact same experience with delivery. they quoted me 45 mins and afetr 1 1/2 hours i called and they were rude. when I complained they gave the excuse that they only had 1 driver and that he was on his way. I gave them 15 more mins to get here and when they didnt show up after 10 miins I called again and they told me it hadnt been 10 mins yet so i just cancelled the oder. Who runs this place??? I agree 100% with the first guy but the food is pretty good.
