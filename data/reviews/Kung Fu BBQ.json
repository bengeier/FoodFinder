{"text":"Came with a hungry party of 7 people and was greeted and seated without a problem. There were 2 other tables at the restaurant during the time, so it wasn't busy.  The staff was quick in changing our grill after a round or two and the meat was averagely flavored. The overall restaurant was clean and the atmosphere was welcoming. The owner was nice.  My main complaints: -The portions of meat (limit 3 plates per round) was very small -The time limit of 100 minutes was not enough time to get your money's worth, especially with the slow service -The staff was out of sight and wasn't attentive to our table when we needed more food -We specifically asked for 3 plates of the same meat but we were given only 1. We finished the meat in under a minute after cooking...We made sure we finished all the meat before we asked for more, so we weren't being unreasonable in terms of that.  Upon leaving, we voiced our concern to the owner about the reason why we got so little meat on the plate every round even when we specifically asked for more and showed that we could eat a lot...her response was that in her experience, guests ask for a lot of meat but don't end up finishing and end up getting charged for the unfinished food.  Overall, the experience was not worth the $30. Everyone left hungry and upset at the slow service. Spend your money else where. If you really want KBBQ, make the trip to Chicago instead and you'll be more satisfied."}
{"text":"Authentic soup dumplings and wonton soup!! Even better than the shanghai restaurants in Bay Area and New York. Must try spot in Champaign!"}
{"text":"This place has the best soup dumplings (????and pan fried buns (????in town.  They are very authentic, far better than the ones I tried in Chicago and NYC, and on par with (if not better than) the ones I tried in California such as Din Tai Fung (???).  I've been there a few times, and the quality of the food is quite stable.  The portion is very reasonable given its price.      Anyone who likes soup dumplings and pan fried buns should try this one out!"}
{"text":"My friends and I all got the all you can eat and we were all very satisfied.  The meat is very high quality and the service is impeccable.  The owner and the workers are all really friendly people and really do care if their customers are enjoying themselves.  We're definitely coming back!"}
{"text":"The restaurant tried to shake the last penny out of the customers by pretending to forget whether we've paid. The price is totally different from the menu since it will charge u for 20% service fee without telling you beforehand. The cashier, I guess the owner of the restaurant, was so mean. So bad she can't speak English, otherwise she will be so successful as a standup comedy performer. Her words can make A 7 feet man cry like a baby. Just don't go."}
{"text":"Great food!!! My husband and I went during lunch we had the all you can eat bbq and it was sooooo good. It's worth the money you pay. The people are so nice and make sure you have everything you want. If they see the grill getting dirty they change it for a clean one and they do the same with the plates.  Our server was great he stayed there cooking our food and made sure we had food at all time,the host was really nice too,when we got there she explain the different manure and the special they had on the all you can eat menu price. It was our first time here and we will for sure come back."}
{"text":"Korean bbq and chinese baozi. Bbq is very expensive: $34/person all you can eat. You can only choose all you can eat for barbecue. Baozi is good. They have the special baozi: xiao long bao"}
{"text":"I went to this place on its first open day. It was greatly overpriced, $30+ per person. And the meat didn't taste good. The environment was also awful, noisy and dirty."}
{"text":"best BBQ I ever had in the whole CU area. Just try the 22.99 All you can eat BBQ and you will see why"}
{"text":"This is not a place to go with friends, you will be very disappointed by the service of the Cashier (presumably the owner of the store). The store charges 20% of the service fee without letting you know. We had all you can eat BBQ buffet, the price is $28.6 per person(taxes and mandatory 20%.service fee). Even though the food is okay, I don't think it worth the money. Don't go to this restaurant, you will be disappointed and you will not want to see the long face of the Cashier"}
{"text":"This is The most authentic Shanghainese food. In urbana champaign and we were just in Shanghai a few months ago. They have all you can eat BBQ but I definitely recommend their Shanghainese specialty dishes that they have a la cart. Give them a try! We recently moved from NYC to UC and there were a lot of good Shanghainese restaurants in NYC but Kung Fu still ranks very high. However I do think the owner needs to work better on their marketing and advertising because it's very hard to tell they sell Shanghainese food because of all those vents for the BBQ."}
{"text":"I have only had the BBQ, and I think it is good, but this is meant to be a PSA about this restaurant's sneaky billing practices (hence only 3 stars). I think the menu price is reasonable but they are trying to charge twice for tip. I went two days in a row for lunch. The first time I got the $11.95 2-meat for one-person BBQ. The bill came out to $14.48 because there was an additional line item for a \"service fee,\" which, when I asked about it, was told was the tip. So I only paid $14.48. The next day, I got the same lunch and when I received my bill, it was $14.48 without an itemized \"service fee\" and then there was another box for adding tip. I asked the cashier/waiter about it and he said I could just pay $14.48. So make sure to check your bill, do your own calculations, and don't pay tip twice!"}
{"text":"Had Korean BBQ here before but it was nothing special. They have Shanghai food now, which I tried today and it was great! The lady who owns the restaurant was super nice, too."}
{"text":"I went for lunch on 6/27/17; a new business in the summertime, I figured they could use the business.  We were the only ones there when we arrived.  No Korean BBQ yet.  A paper menu with just names and prices, no pictures, no descriptions, not helpful for a newbie.  I ordered the chicken dish.  I got a hunk of cold chicken on the bone; that's it, no sides - no rice or vegetables.   And apparently it's one menu for lunch or dinner.  Paid dinner prices at lunch.  They need some lunch specials that are a complete meal.  Not worth the price.  I ate about half of it; wish I hadn't eaten that much.  Fortunately my friend ordered other items and shared.  Dumplings were tasty but little meat in them mostly dumpling.  Took the rest home and saved it by cutting it up, adding it to sauteed vegetables, heating, and serving with rice.  I would like to check it out when they have Korean BBQ, but will be very wary and ask a lot of questions before ordering."}
{"text":"Best soup dumplings (Xiao Long Bao) I can find in Central Illinois. Authentic and delicious. Barbeque is a bit expensive for local students but the meat is pretty fresh."}
{"text":"I know this place has been open a while and honestly I was pretty skeptical about coming in because I was hearing mostly negative things. My experience when I came in for dinner was positive. I think they may have changed things up. Originally I heard a lot of complaints about prices and quality but I thought both were superb. I came in at 7pm on a Wednesday with 6 people and we got seated super quickly because the place was pretty empty. We all got all you can eat BBQ.    Service: 5/5 I don't tend to dish out high service grades but the servers were attentive and friendly. The man helping with our table was always really prompt about meat orders. He changed the grill without us asking him too and refilled water often. The server didn't hover but was always around when we needed something. Also, they ran out of sesame balls.   Setup: 5/5 The majority of the condiments lived in a center console sort of \"buffet style\". They had a wide variety of choices of dipping sauces and veggies. They also had pork bun, cookies, oranges, and some other small dim sum like items. Everything else was brought to your table by the server.   I like the high quality grills they had. Usually after kbbq my clothes smell like grease but the fan was super powerful and I largely avoided that.   Atmosphere: 4.5/5 The decor was nice and all the tables and chairs were high quality. The only fault I could mention is how empty it is but honestly I just think it's a shame that more people don't come in. The place was also super clean. Occasionally when the server changed our grill, he just carried the grill plate back to the kitchen while dripping oil on the floor so that could be a point of improvement.   Food: 5/5 I liked all the items we tried. The most important thing to me was that the meat WASN'T frozen when it got to our table. It was a mix of defrosted and fresh and this made such a big difference. The flavors were great and the meat was good quality. They also had a great variety of meats as well. We had people who are kbbq vets who said it was as good if not better than some of the popular places in Korea and California.   The items in the buffet condiments area was good as well. I liked that I could self serve lettuce, yams, sauce, etc rather than having to wait for someone else to get it for me.   Also, the cookies in the center console were absolutely amazing. The buns were also really good but oddly crispy on the bottom. They also had sesame balls but they ran out.   Quality: 4/5 Great quality food. The meat was superb. The items in the condiments bar seemed a little stale though.   Price: 5/5 I've paid upwards of 30 dollars for kbbq in Los Angeles and this was right up there with those spots. For $24 all you can eat, you really can't go wrong.   Overall: 5/5 Definitely try this place out. It doesn't deserve the bad rep because it's really good!!"}
{"text":"This place make me feel like the 3hr drive to Chicago is totally worth it. Awful taste, no service and they ask you to tip!"}
{"text":"Really  terrible! Super low service, the buffet bar is almost empty when we get there at 7pm. Nobody will ever answer anything!"}
{"text":"A group of friends of mine went there for buffet bbq. Food is good and we were pretty happy until the boss lady came to us and told us that we had been eating for too long (2 hrs as she claimed but one hr and half to the most, we believe) and should be full by then! (So basically asking customers to leave?!) We felt wierd and standed up to pay the bill at the counter, then the lady charged us a 20% \"service fee\" without asking us! More to that, she tried to charge us twice for a take out that we've paid seperately before! After that she ironically comments that we spent so long eating and should be \"Too Full\"! Guys this is too much! Worst customer experience ever!"}
{"text":"Kung Fu BBQ is the place to go for kbbq. They have an all you can eat menu with premium angus and kolbi beef. They will be releasing a cheaper menu soon that will be more affordable for everyone to enjoy. They also have a menu for single dish items that you can order for lunch or so. For those of you who haven't eaten all you can eat bbq, theres a grill in the center and you cook your own meat.   They also have the bomb shanghainese dumplings with great soup inside. I read other reviews about having soup in the dumplings and it is supposed to be like that!! Comparable to Din Tai Fung.  Great place, decent service, and a great management. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Okay. So, my daughter and I were hungry for an afternoon type snack. Not a full meal, just a hefty snack. Not something sweet-- just something savory that was substantial enough to quell the appetite before eating dinner. We arrived at Kungfu Barbecue with a taste for Korean food and thought we might order a noodle dish and split it or something else. We weren't quite sure what we wanted, we just knew we had a taste for Korean food and we didn't want dinner. At any rate, we walked in and were presented the menu and noticed that there was also a menu titled Chinese dim sum. Hmmm. Okay. Dim sum is perfect if you just want a little bite, but in a Korean restaurant...that could be chancy. However, we were thinking Chinese tapas would whet our appetite, so we ordered the pan-fried dumplings, the xiao long bao, shumai and some ban chan to go on the side to satisfy the Korean taste craving.   Can we say my 11-year-old daughter and I freaked out about the xiao long bao?!!   For those of you who are in the cult of xiao long bao, these are the legendary soup dumplings that so few chefs get right and so many long for their perfect execution. These are dumplings that somehow hide hot soup with a chunk of succulent meat wrapped in a dumpling that holds the contents without leaking the secret goodness inside. These dumplings were sure perfection-- to the point that they caused my daughter to exclaim, \"Mom! These are amazing!\". We ate them so quickly-- wait I take that back.   We inhaled these things.   We were shocked that they were all gone and accused each other of having eaten more than a fair share. Kungfu makes everything fresh and you can taste the difference in everything we ordered. Down to the kimchi (which was excellent and had a great balance of garlic and chili) to the xiao long bao, the dumplings and the Shanghai style shu mai. Everything was handmade, fresh and the right temperature. Nothing is frozen and reheated. As someone who appreciates the labor that goes into making sure that food delivery is on-the spot- fresh, we salute the chefs at KungFu for their commitment to honoring classic Chinese and Korean culinary techniques. What a welcome fusion of cultures and flavor profiles!   We will be back to partake in the barbecue. Did I mention that they have the latest hoods installed so you don't leave smelling like a barbeque pit after dinner? This is the spot ya'll. We will be back very soon."}
{"text":"This is the best soup dumpling (xiao long bao) place in town! Very very juicy and full of soup.. I am from Shanghai and this reminds me of the food I had when I was young. Barbeque is a little overpriced but wasn't too bad overall. Bottom line, Shanghainese will probably love the baozi and xiao long bao, because that's similar to how they're made in Shanghai; but that might not suit the taste of people from other places :)"}
{"text":"1st review. They offer the most authentic shanghai dim sum in the town. The 1 star review above was bullshit. Xiaolongbao was famous for the soup inside. I'm sorry to see people don't understand that. Must try spot in champaign."}
{"text":"Kung Fu BBQ is definitely the place to go on campus for Korean barbecue and Chinese buns. Their buns and xiao long bao are very authentic (and have steaming soup in them AS THEY SHOULD!!) The raw meat was fresh and well-seasoned. Overall, great atmosphere and hands down some of the most authentic Korean and Chinese cuisine in the CU area.  The owners were very sweet. Service may be a bit slower because it is a newer business and the whole restaurant is pretty big. Definitely recommend to anyone craving Asian food and looking to fill up for dinner."}
{"text":"Their dumplings are authentic and delicious! I just wish they would serve them consistently (they are only sometimes available). Please make the shu mai, pan fried pork dumplings and Xiao long boa permanent items on your menu and I will be a loyal patron! Otherwise good service and thoughtful owners who seem invested in customers having a good experience."}
{"text":"They had very nice selection of beef, pork, and shrimp/octopus for all you can eat. It's pretty good price too. Total was $28.55 including tax and tip for all you can eat.   The beef and pork is a bit bland without sauce but they have sauce (soy, chili, and hoison). The marinated beef and pork is delicious. They did give us more fat at the end. Very good service and constantly check up on us.   We did have a bit of wait in the beginning for us ordering. Lady was very nice telling us about the menu choices and everything. We all left feeling full and satisfied. Would definitely go back."}
{"text":"BRING YOUR APPETITE! This place has an amazing all you can eat option but you gotta make it worth it.  With a built in tip and tax their all you can eat option comes out to around 28$.  You sit in front of a small plate grill as servers bring you plates of raw meat and fish.  Definitely a fun place to go if your a carnivore!  The service could be a little better they are pretty slow and sometimes out of basic thing like garlic.  This place is a fun experience and a cool place to go with friends if your into interactive dining experiences.  I have not tried their premium buffet for $33 but I have heard great things."}
{"text":"Best Korean BBQ on campus. You can choose from an unlimited selection of angus beef, pork, chicken, shrimp, and octopus (and a lot of side dishes, too) all for only $28.55. The servers were pretty attentive too - they regularly changed the grill and were quick in getting our check. If you come here hungry, you'll leave satisfied."}
{"text":"We went there for 22.99 BBQ. The time limit is 100 min for 3 types of meat per round. The first round was served at 6:45 pm. At 7:55pm when we requested meat, the pushy women manager came telling us we have run out of time. She then turned the heat to the maximum and put all the remaining meat into the oven. Before the meat was done, she distributed the raw meat to our plates and kept compalining we were too slow cooking. She even compared us with other cusomers who were said to be able to finish eating quickly.   I was totally shocked and extremely angry at that moment. If you cannot afford it don't run the business. Stop bullyng your customers just because you were born with a mean face."}
{"text":"This is probably the best Chinese restaurant in UIUC. If you are here for some BBQ or authentic Shanghai food, tis is the place. The dumpling is super Shanghai style, with Real Kobe!"}
{"text":"First of all, food here is way below average and servers are inattentive. This place is way overpriced for charging $35+ per person and that is if you could finish all the awful meat they give you. Yes, they serve you huge portions of each item you order and if you could not finish it expect to pay $12 extra."}
{"text":"Kung Fu BBQ has great quality meat for Korean BBQ. Their dumplings are savory and authentic."}
{"text":"We went there for BBQ buffet, very disappointing experience. The women (I guess she is the owner of the place) is so good at ruining your dinner and making you uncomfortable.  The time limit is 100min but I don't know how they count the time. Less than 80 min after they served us the first round, the women manager came to tell us \"time is up!\" and kept complaining we were too slow for cooking. She just took over the tongs and distributed meats in our plates, even though meats were not ready to eat! we were shocked by how rude she was...can't believe someone can run a restaurant like this. Also, the price on the menu is 22.99 per person but you would need to pay almost $30 per person due to the mandatory service fee. Does not worth the price. I left without having enough food. Wouldn't go there again ...Don't go there with your friends, especially if you have more than two people. you won't get enough time to eat since the stove is very slow and you need to wait for the food be ready."}
{"text":"If I can give a zero I would definitely go for a negative review. The reasons are following:  1. When we get in, the cashier woman (who also seems like a manager and a server to everyone) told us ( a party of 2) to find an empty table to seat down. No more words are given. 2. After we sat for 5 minutes and had decided what we wanted, no server EVER CAME to our table. No water no words no attention and nothing. 3. My friend and I sat there for a little longer and decided to give to this place a second chance by going to the woman in charge and asked whether they can send someone over. The woman replied with a (kinda rude) manner:\"So here I am,\" while she feet were rooted beside the cashier. 4. We washed her busy doing checks for at least 4 parties and giving out menu for 3 parties. Finally she came to our direction after around another 5 minutes but she only came to the table beside us for check.  FINALLY WE LEFT THE PLACE WITHOUT BEING GREETED, SEVERED and WELCOMED. THE END."}
{"text":"This is the only place in CU that does All you can eat Korean BBQ. The prices are a little high, but they also serve high quality meats such as certified Kobe and any others.  The owners are from Shanghai and they brought Shanghai dumplings to CU. They are VERY good. As a person who has grown up eating Din Tai Feng in Taiwan. I can vouch that the quality of the dumplings here are top notch. The soup in the soup dumpling are flavorful, as they should be. Their pan fried buns are extraordinary. It is authentic Shanghai cuisines.   I think what they have done for their soft opening is wonderful. What I wish to see in the future is a more cost effective All you can eat menu for customers who just want a ton of bulgolgi and not have to pay $37 for it.   Ultimately, this place is a great place to take a note of and eat on special occasions."}
{"text":"Very good Korean Barbecue. I've been thrice and it's always been a positive experience. After my first visit I learned that you get more of your money's worth going with an All-You-Can-Eat option for $22.99/person. You get to chose a variety of 3 meats at a time out of ten e.g. Angus Bulgogi, Chicken Bulgogi, Spicy/Marinated Shrimp, Thin Beef Briskets, etc.  Love the food and the service is up there!"}
{"text":"Really authentic Shanghainese food!! Make sure you get the Shumai, wonton, and xiao long bao!"}
{"text":"We ordered meat Baozi and soup dumplings. They tasted authentic,  but the portion was just ridiculous, with barely any stuffing. The soup dumplings were basically liquid, such that you are doomed to break it with chopsticks. And you end up eating soup soaked skins. Servers were inattentive. The owner lady seemed to not a give a f*** about your business. With the restaurant almost empty we had to wait for five minutes to get seated. Just avoid this place and go have noodle soup in the next door."}
