{"text":"\"Best\" Gyros - umm , not.
I've been here twice - once within the first week of opening (so I'll discount that mediocre experience) and then now.  My latest order was at 11:30 AM. I ordered the regular size meat lover's gyro, which, according to the menu, has seasoned, cubed chicken in addition to the gyro meat and regular ingredients. 
 It was highly disappointing; here's why:
1.) I had been looking forward to a gyro for days - so the \"Best\" sounded like luxury. But,
2.) the gyro meat was dryed out, not slightly charred, not luscious as it should be. More spins without cuts for customers equals more jerky-like product and, lamb jerky, while a heck of a good idea, is not what I had in mind for lunch. Did you guys forget to pay the gas fired spit grill bill?
3.)  I looked up tzatziki after this experience and in all the best reviewed recipes I found - all had a critical component that I felt was gapingly missing from this joint's sauce - acid. Best Gyro's sauce is like cream cheese with herbs - advice to management - walk across the street to the Turkish place and just taste their food, lest you be embarrassed to ask for advice.  This creamy, too stiff sauce was consistent with visit one and would be best served on a mish-mosh bagel.  Please offer cut lemons for people who like gyros.
GOOD THINGS:
1.) the flat bread was griddled perfectly.
2.) \"BEST\" Actually - After hearing your apparently non-grecian staff handle phone-in orders pronouncing the Establishment's name on greeting I became freed forever of my fear of offending greek restaurant owners everywhere - it shall forever be as I first thought it should be- my \"kronos emancipation pronunciation\" - 'ghai (like chai, as in tea) -row\", ghai-row, not 'yee-ro'.
3.) BEST - when you guys fail, and you're set up to, the physical plant and what you've done to it is perfect for a worthy replacement. The landlord is the winner here. 
Get a grip on the basics guys and I'll be back."}
{"text":"Ate here once when I visited Cleveland.  Casual, fast-food type of place, good Greek food, large portions!   Nice to have fast-food options other than the usual McDonalds/Taco Bell/Wendy's type of stuff.  Recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I think there food is really good....also besides their gyros..their philly cheese steak...hamburgers and also the chili cheese fries....its made fresh and it tastes awesum!!! The people are friendly there ..and its also open 24 hours on the weekend :)"}
{"text":"I used to love Best Gyro.  Got take out all he time and it was very good.  Then about a month or two ago it changed and not for the better.  Now it is really bad.  New cooks, new front man, food quality went downhill and portions got smaller. They used to make the chicken fresh to order.  Now it is purchased as pre-cooked and tastes like rubber. Made my wife sick immediately and she spent the evening in the bathroom. That suggests it is not clean. Too bad as this used to be such a great spot."}
{"text":"Excellent gyro shop.  I stop in for pick up once every two weeks.  The junior gyro is big enough for most.  Great value and good quality."}
{"text":"I had the \"best corned beef in town\" and it was not that great.  The sweet potato fries were OK and I like the layout of the place. I want to go back and try a gyro to be fair."}
{"text":"2nd rate corned beef was highly disappointing. The cliche \"best corned beef\" should be eligible for false advertising."}
{"text":"So good. The fact that they're open super late makes them even better. The gyros are huge and they have so many items you'll never get bored. Great all around spot."}
{"text":"The only thing \"BEST\" about this crap is when it leaves your lower G.I. If this mashed together and molded log is genuine Lamb and Beef then I'm George Clooney and Brad Pitt.....and what's up with the spongy Pita Bread? I gave it an extra star only because of the portion size. Thinking about stopping in..... Keep drivin'!"}
{"text":"They could pretty much put the place on a hitch and haul it to next carnival and it would fit right in. No surprises, very \"healthy\" portions."}
{"text":"Worst customer service.
Food lies on counter even if customer is waiting....my order wrongly fulfilled."}
{"text":"The website is wrong says they are open until 3 am on Friday and Saturday but they closed at midnight."}
{"text":"Really good prices. Delish falafel. Lots of varieties of Gryo, meat off the cone not frozen strips!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome!!
The establishment is Clean, people are friendly and the Gyro was great!!
And very nice clean bathrooms."}
{"text":"Ordered the Aphrodite gyro and zucchini fries; they were both amazingly good!! Portions were so big that I had enough for three meals (and it still tasted good).  This place is awesome!"}
{"text":"I go here on occasion, when I'm in the mood for a gyro obviously. I typically go during the night between 9pm and midnight. It's good for after bar food or just anytime food. Service could be a bit quicker there were three people working when we went and although there were people ahead of us it felt like quite a while to get food. All in all not a bad place at all."}
{"text":"This is best gyro is very convenient, and clean. now with that being said, the morning crew is very rude and impatient. Doors open up at 10am, I arrived at 10:02 am, I asked the older guy if he wanted a few more minutes to continue to \"set up\". After he rolled his eyes, took several deep breaths he says; let's go, let's go, I got other things to do let go with the order! didn't appreciate the way he talked to me an my wife. so the hell with this  place for breakfast.  I recommend late night food with a better group of employees."}
{"text":"I tried it for the first time tonight and I had to run home and write a review about it. I've never posted a review, but this was amazing.  Seriously the best gyro I've ever had.  The lamb was amazing, the pita was fresh, and the sizes are HUGE!!!  +1"}
{"text":"Good food, very fast service. Worth every penny. Open late on Friday and Saturday, 4 am! They also deliver!"}
{"text":"Ordered from them for delivery. The girl on the phone was very pleasant.  But after I was done ordering($12 worth after delivery charge) she tells me that they have now a $17 minimum for delivery. Even though I order from them before and there was never a problem. I work at a place where I am the only one here and I can't leave so picking up is not an option.  I'm not saying I want special treatment and I don't feel I deserve it. But they might want to rethink the delivery for local businesses. Needless to say I won't be ordering from them again. I like their food but I can't afford a $17 lunch."}
{"text":"The menu looked great, but unfortunately the food was not. I was really disappointed by the sloppy assembly of the food and the meat itself was not traditional gyro meat. I did find a hair, which I'm trying to convince myself was not a hair but a string of some sorts in my food. Mostly tasteless and wasn't worth my money. Maybe other items on the menu are better, but I'm not too excited to try anything else. 

The food did come out quick and the lady who took my order was nice. Just not crazy about the quality of the food."}
{"text":"Their new Lee Rd location does great! Their Gyros fully satisfy my cravings and after eating there a half dozen times or so; I have never had a disappointing experience.  People working there are always motivated and they run a tight ship.  Their fried mushrooms are magic in the mouth and it is rumored that they will start delivering soon.   Very happy to see a good Gyro shop open on Lee Rd.  A pleasure to eat in or take out."}
{"text":"Only place I eat gyros best in town. The people that work there are very nice and the place is amazingly clean. My daughter thats super picking never gets when we go out ate her whole huge cheese burger. Great place for families. Go show best gyros some love and you'll teast the love. I will be back soon"}
{"text":"I went there a few days ago for a light meal, had a shocking experience...I was sitting outside eating my sandwich when I heard a person shouting, inside the restaurant stood an older man, about 65yo arguing with one of the workers behind the counter, at some point he hit the worker's hand and then threw what looked like a piece of paper across the counter and left in anger, two seconds later the worker, a big guy named Tony, about 45yo ran outside the restaurant and started chasing the disgruntled client, he was extremely angry and was threatening the client and swearing at him, other employees and myself pulled Tony back, but he kept wanting to antagonize the client, which in turns yelled back at him claiming he stole his coupon and lied to him, the client left and Tony went back into the restaurant.       

I was shocked at the stupidity of the client who went to this extreme over a \"stolen\" coupon, I was even more shocked and appalled with the violent behavior of the worker Tony who should have known better how to deal with a frustrated client in a peaceful manner. 
That was my second time in that eatery, I have no intention of ever going back there."}
{"text":"Stopped going about a year ago.  Used to enjoy the food.  went there one night and the male owner (owned by a married couple) was sweating profusely due too the heat from the grill.  Actually wiping the sweat with a towel but not washing his hands.  His sweat was dripping unto the grill/food.  Haven't been there since......love gyros but not marinated in human sweat...hoping to find a gyro restaurant minus the sweat"}
{"text":"I had a wonderful experience at Best Gyros.  Their extensive menu offers many specialty gyros, but I went for the classic.  The meat was so tasty, and the portion was huge!  We also got zucchini fries and cajun fries, and I strongly recommend both!  Overall- great food for a great value!"}
{"text":"The festival gyro is very resonably priced; however,  if you have a family to feed, get the family deal for $20.  You get everything you need to make 4 gyros."}
{"text":"Try the Bacon Cheese Fries if you Dare.......
Open 24 hrs. Oh hell yea!!!

Try the corned beef.....seriously
Corned Beef sandwich with the horsey sauce will blow your mind.

For Breakfast try the Corned Beef Omelet with cheese
I am hooked. They do the breakfast sandwiches all day long 24 hours.
They also do the gyro omelet all day.
Very quick service as well!!

{"text":"Small place that is really meant only for takeout or delivery. Great food with a wide variety of menu options, including chicken. They also have some yummy fries, including Cajun.  Service is relatively fast and food is made fresh. Prices are reasonable. And they are a part of the belly program!"}
{"text":"I had pierogies on a gyro. 

Let those words sink in.

Pierogies. On a gyro. 

Muther-farking pierogies on a muther-farking gyro!

This is a thing that has happened and it was glorious and it was at Best Gyros. 

If you need a place that's open late (midnight most nights, but FOUR IN THE MORNING on weekends) and  that serves yummy non-health foods with booze sold in wee small bottles, you need to go to the Best Gyros on Lee Road (just a block or so south of the Cedar Lee Theater). 

In addition to the obvious, Best Gyros serves breakfast (Hubby got scrambled eggs topped with gyro meat), about seven brands of liquor such as Skyy, Jameson and Captain Morgan in tiny bottles ranging in price from $4 to $7 (which could mix well with the Coke products they also sell) and, per a conversation Hubby had with the manager, they will soon serve ice cream and shakes (they had this conversation in March 2015). 

As for the gyros, there are nine \"Seasoned Flavors\" (prices vary by size, a regular is $8.99) and FOURTEEN of the \"Specialty Flavors\" (regular size is $9.49), one of which is the aforementioned \"Cleveland Special Gyro\" that was topped with deep fried potato and cheese pierogies and sauteed onions. The serving sizes are good - Hubby somehow managed to finish his breakfast, but I was full half  way through my regular size \"Cleveland\" one and had to take the rest home. I took pictures of our meals with our water/soda bottles in the composition so you can better gauge the serving sizes. I hope that's helpful. 

NOT a health food joint by any stretch of the imagination, but the kind of joint you'd want to visit before or after you hit the Lee Road bars."}
{"text":"Never ever again.  Twice they charged my card and just never showed up, never called...  I had to chase down the manager to get a refund.  Order at your own risk."}
{"text":"Love this place, big fan of the hot chili pepper gyro.  Nice and spicy and loaded, and I mean loaded with meat.  The size of the large gyro is kind of ridiculously big but hey it is so good you'll eat it all, trust me.  I go here for my gyro fix.  Highly recommend.  They serve breakfast as well, although I have never had it.  If it is as good as the gyro's I certainly need to try."}
{"text":"Love this place!  They have a huge variety of food options (way more than just gyros).  They accidentally forgot to include my onion rings once and when I went back they not only replaced them but also gave me a free desert.  They are always really nice and the food is very tasty!"}
{"text":"Well forward to 2018 in June... back again. I just can't get past the corned beef hash n eggs. It's sooo good! Bf had a Greek salad then a gyro. It's so big he had to eat it with a fork lol!! Baklava yummy too. I ate that first with my coffee for breakfast !! The owners are still great and staff.
   We sat in the parking lot for awhile( till 4 in our semi) and came back in for a wonderful corned beef Sammy to share and two drinks! Wow verrrrrry yummy"}
{"text":"Pretty solid gyros at good prices. The festival, in particular, is a great value especially at lunchtime for $3.99. I always get the junior Zorba, though, which is still a huge amount of meat (junior is the smallest size) and comes with feta and olives. Fries are excellent, too! Best gyros for the price anywhere in the Heights area that I'm aware of."}
{"text":"On my way home from the Cedar Lee Show and saw the restaurant, I have not had a Gyro since High School and I had to stop in and savor the flavor of a Gyro from Best Gyros!  It was delicioso!!! Huge portions!  Great price!  Had mine topped with Lamb, Fresh Avocado, Tomatoes, Leaf Spinach, Sweet Onion and Cucumber Sauce!  I wish we had one on the west side!"}
{"text":"Knocked it down a star due to ordering something and receiving an entirely different item, Fry's were soggy as well. I'll return as this is only one mess up out of the multiple times I've been here but I will be checking my box before I get home. 

A decent little place , still think its more expensive then it should be but foods solid , I'll be back"}
{"text":"Food Poisoning. I came here on March 20th 2017 for take-out dinner. It was a busy day, and I hadn't eaten anything until then. I ordered a cheese & jalapeño fries and a falafel. The next day I was welcomed with food poisoning symptoms and by nightfall it had gotten much worse. I ended up having to take Wednesday-Friday off work because of this. This food put me in such bad state that even now (03/25/2017) I'm not fully recovered.

I called the restaurant today and asked for the manager, and told her what happened. I was told that the owner would be informed, but did not receive an apology. Whether or not the manager believed me, does not excuse this lack of decorum.

Honestly, I prefer not to write negative reviews. However given my frustration and the lack of immediate receptiveness to my situation, I believe this is my only recourse.   

I would recommend this establishment only if you're fine risking food poisoning."}
{"text":"I don't understand what all the hype is. I thought the pricing was extremely high, especially for the quality of food you receive.  I could have made the same exact meal from home, there was nothing special about it.  My fiance bit into something hard in his chicken and was done with it after that.  I lost my appetite as well.  The baklava was hard as a rock and almost impossible to chew.  To say I was displeased is an understatement, I will not be returning."}
{"text":"This is my second trip to Best Gyros and I have thoroughly enjoyed both visits. The gyros are enormous and the owner is a great guy who was friendly and personable. The ample amount of gyro meat was more than enough to fill me up. Best Gyros offers 23 varieties of Gyros including a \"Christmas Gyro\" with cinnamon sugar. I'm old school and prefer the reliable Greek Girl which has spinach, feta cheese, lettuce, onion and tomato.

The accompanying hand cut fries are slightly limp but they taste good. I just happen to prefer a crispy fry so that's my personal preference. Best Gyros also sells breakfast which I haven't rried yet. Corned Beef is featured prominently but I haven't tried that either.

The owner was very pleasant and they process orders quickly despite everything being cooked to order. I will return. Very enjoyable experience."}
{"text":"Truly disappointed tonight got a jumbo gyro it's dry as hell crispy pieces of meat. Also ordered a philly NO MUSHROOMS no peppers well there are a ton of mushrooms on here. This place use to be good oh well just lost a customer!"}
{"text":"Called in a to go order for 45 minutes later and it was ready upon our arrival.  However, we still had to wait 15 minutes in line to get the to-go order, which kinda defeats the purpose (of avoiding a line) 

The food was hot and tasted great.  The pita was thick and fluffy and the meat was real, not a frozen imitation.  My only request is that they add some GREEK rice to the menu!!"}
{"text":"Most convenient place to eat for me since I'm soo close I love the corned beef and eggs and I love getting the corned beef sandwich, Two pieces Texas toast, corned beef and American cheese it's awesome! Although I enjoy the corned beef I really thinks it's probably not real or very cheap due to the texture and taste. Overall I nor my wife has had a bad experience and hope not too."}
{"text":"Ah, the gyro; a sandwich of great joy to me:)

Best Gyros of Lee Road in Cleveland Heights serves the food hot, with great variety and amazing taste. I've never had a bad meal there and they serve a gyro breakfast platter that will satisfy even the biggest appetites. They have even have ice cream, baklava and small mixed drinks for the person in need of a small libation. 

They're hours are good,and there's metered parking in the lot just around the corner, and there's usually plenty of space. 

All together, this little corner gyro restaurant keeps my appetite spinning for more:)"}
{"text":"I have come here many times.  Delicious gyros that never disappoint. Fresh toppings and heaping amount of fries although I would say it's a little more expensive than one dollar sign.  My lunch was 14 dollars but still worth every pennie.  Will continue to treat myself at the best gyros in town"}
{"text":"Really good when you want some late night food! I love their fries, so good. They are also open pretty late which is super convenient and have delivery when you're too lazy to go out!"}
{"text":"Made to order foods; we had the Gyros and chips, but nothing else.  With 2 eating one entree, it was just about right... and the way I'd suggest ordering food here if you're trying not to burst at the seams. 

Earnest, friendly service is probably the true highlight.  It'll be really interesting to see how this place proceeds to brand itself, and whether it will stay relatively generic."}
{"text":"Best gyros is the best gyros for anytime after 10pm. Solid value ($3.99 for an gyro!) and open very very late. The latest on the block. Combine the gyro with fries and you have yourself a tasty fast meal... totally a guilty pleasure...

The store itself has very pragmatic service. Definitely think of it as more of a fast food joint and tend to take out."}
{"text":"Amazing gyro salad. Order from here often - sooo good. Meat is great. Workers are friendly and delivery is usually quick."}
{"text":"Love this place. The staff is really friendly and they have been great about special requests. The trays are great for work/home parties. My only suggestion is a change in the sauce-it's a bit too thick and lacks flavor. They make yummy fresh cut fries (think \"county fair fries\"). Enjoy!"}
{"text":"I had the bourbon gyro, large.  
It was awesome!  I normally have to ask for extra cucumber sauce but they enclosed 2 sides with it.  I was barely able to find the pita under the mountain of meat on top of it, but once located it was crispy yet chewy.  Freaking perfect!
The sweet potato fries were also really good, they shook some cinnamon and sugar on them.  Yummy!

While waiting for my food I wandered over to their selection of ice cream, they have a decent variety.  I'm most excited to try Eskimo Kisses.  By the end of the meal, however, I was too full to even think about getting a scoop.  
Until next time..."}
{"text":"Something for everyone at Best Gyro! From pierogi's to salads they serve it. I enjoy the best gyro's here. You select the size, they take care of your hunger. 
I've never been disappointed and parking is easy there. Try a gyro there, always fresh & tasty!"}
{"text":"Best is a good way to describe Best Gyros.  Whenever I go anywhere, I am typically in search of Italian food and bakeries, Greek food, Middle Eastern food, and comfort food.  I went here twice, brought back a second time by the generous gyro offerings at reasonable prices.

Not knowing the city and told that there are some sketchy areas, I presumed this might be in one of said areas.  That is not the case at all.  Best Gyros is east of downtown, but quite a ways east, even out beyond the medical complexes, Little Italy, and an established area of big homes named Cleveland Heights.  There is even one of those cool cinemas, the Cedar-Lee, which seem to be all too necessary staples to mark cool neighborhoods that would be agreeable to millennials and hipsters. And this eatery is about a block or so south of that intersection.

Many people order their food to go.  One can also eat in.  I noticed that there are some wrought iron tables and chairs outside, too, even though they wouldn't always be usable.  Either way, it's nice and airy inside, and there are some goofy things to look at.

If you have an average appetite (even if you love gyros), the regular gyro ought to suffice.  I had them omit the lettuce the first time and forgot to do so the second time.  I like gyros with just the shaved meat, tomatoes, and tzatziki sauce, even though I do like lettuce - in salads.  Mind you that they have other things, such as burgers, sandwiches, fries, and even desserts, all of which are fairly priced and seem to please Best's customers.

The food is good but what kicks this place up a notch from being ordinary are the very fair prices, the value, and the friendly service.  A regular gyro and a soft drink came in at under $10. The people who work here seem to understand that, even if one is \"too cool for school,\" you can still be nice to people! If you are in the vicinity or can wander eastward from University Circle and Little Italy, check out Best Gyros for Greek fare and other types of hatch filling grub."}
{"text":"I had a very poor experience with waiting at Best Gyros. I went yesterday evening, 11/19/2013, and ordered a regular chicken gyro. It took 25 minutes to prepare, and the woman at the counter almost gave my food to the wrong person. Further, there was another person who had to wait 20 minutes for his order, and he called 10 minutes before he arrived to place his order.

If you want an experience where the young girl is more interested in flirting with her classmates than taking your order, ready food waits before being delivered to the customer, and the food takes entirely too long to prepare, then you should come to Best Gyros"}
{"text":"The best place for greasy drunk food (or a quick lunch).
They recently added online ordering, which actually works (unlike other businesses in the area).  Monster-sized delicious wraps are my usual.  You'll always get a crazy amount of food for a cheap price.
A little bummed that they changed their thick-cut Zucchini Fries, to those little shoestring fries though, and they seem to mix up their ranch and cucumber sauce sometimes... That's it though. Everything else is awesome."}
{"text":"Not the best quality food but it excels at quantity. The regular size is huge and I assumed that you would need a trailer for the larger sizes.

The staff is extremely friendly and it is easy to get in and out with street parking right outside the door.

They are open late so it is a great place to pick up a quick bite on your way home."}
{"text":"Love this place! It's the best gyro I've had on the east side in a long time. The fries are good, a nice complement to the gyros. My only complaint is that there are no fountain drinks. I know, it's a little nit-picky but I much prefer fountain cola to bottled cola. The staff is friendly and on the occasions where I've ordered delivery, my food has arrived well before the promised delivery time."}
{"text":"Never again. I mentioned that it was my first visit to the person behind the counter.  I said this because I wasn't as quick to order. Instead of offering suggestions or any suitable reply I received an \"Oh\". She then walked off for a moment. I should've left then. What was I thinking?  Gyro meat was over cooked on one side. Meat was bland and tzatzki was lacking as well. I had a large Best gyro.  No reason to return when the entire experience is mediocre."}
{"text":"I come here occasionally for lunch. Today was my third time here. It's a small place which offers a few seats but mostly everyone does take out.

Anyhow, on my first visit, I ordered the regular size (1/2 lb) meat lovers specialty gyro. It had gyro and chicken meat as well as the usual lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and cucumber sauce. The order took about 20 minutes since I came during a busy lunch time. Brought it back and was surprised to see how BIG it was! It was loaded with meats! Even for a meat lover like me, it was a bit much. The gyro meat was very flavorful and fresh. It was all fresh cut.  The chicken was tender and had good flavor as well. The pita was soft and warm. The cucumber sauce had a nice consistency and was smooth and creamy. I had a junior size (1/4 lb) regular gyro on my second visit. Again the gyro meat was very good. Comparing to the meat lovers, I prefer the traditional version more since I was able to taste more of the gyro meat. 

Today I ended up getting their $5 lunch special which consists of a festival gyro (small regular gyro) and fries. The gyro was smaller than the junior size but since it came with fries it was filling. Their fries was alright, but it got a little soggy despite having holes on the container.

I will definitely return for my lunch visits. They have a huge variety of specialty gyros. They do advertise as having the \"best corned beef in town\" so I might take them on that."}
{"text":"Sooooooo good I seriously don't see why people don't like this place the gyro meat is so flavorful and the bread is very soft plus every time I've been here the service has been great. Best Gyro in Cleveland."}
{"text":"This restaurant has improved considerably in the last year. I had an issue on occaison where a counter girl got lippy with me. They took care of that. Food is good. The portions are very generous and the blend of ingredients is done well.   I like the Jamaican gyro. They have plenty to choose from including salads and gyros. A full meal for sure. Festival gyro is smaller but very good. Usually very clean and convenient. Patio seating and dining room alike.  Park in the street. For some reason, locals pronounce it JYE-ro. In Greek it's YER-ro."}
{"text":"Excited to try Merchant but disappointed in the quality of customer service.  The staff seemed less than exuberant to wait on customers.  With such an amazing view of the park, and on Taste of Tremont day, none the less, my expectations were set high but were, unfortunately, not met.  
I would not recommend"}
{"text":"NEVER AGAIN 

The meat is hard greasy and crispy like bacon. I have never had a Gyro like this. I should've known when the girl at the counter said 5 minutes and rushed outside to her car to have a smoke. That this was not going to be a good experience. 

I am beyond !"}
{"text":"This place is clean, the staff is friendly and the food has always been great.  Being up in Cleveland Heights for the summer, I will miss it when I leave, the salads are awesome with a pita under the salad. Everything I have eaten there has been great!"}
{"text":"If David and Posh were serving these up, firstly they'd be less thin, but also, it'd be renamed \"Becks Gyros.\" But they're not, so it won't.

Sadly one of the most underrated places in Cleveland. The other location gets more love (and has room to sit), but this one makes one of the best Gyros I've ever had in my life. The reviews are simply criminal. Not like Michael's Smooth Criminal, but more like Britney being in love with a Criminal. Nothing against Michael though - he's my Gyro.

What to get: A Gyro mmmmmm.
What else: Um. Idk?

If your pant button busts because you ate too much here, then you need a \"Belts Gyros.\"

The clue is in the name. These Gyros are literally the best anywhere. I can't think of a better one. They're on par with Nick's in Atlanta, Gyro World in Queens NYC, and so on. Absolutely incredible and Cleveland's best, with Gyro World in the west burbs a distant second place.

If you wanna wager on a horse race during your meal, go to \"Bets Gyros.\"

They also have wonderful service, much like the other location. And they have an option to get a mini Gyro, which by the way is pretty damn big and fills me up just fine, for under $5! Every place should have this kind of options. What a brilliant idea.

If you drive a Mercedes here, go to \"Benz Gyros.\"

The other location has way more places to sit, but the girl at this location is ridic adorbs. I'm obsessed with Gyros and I've tried them all over the country. Other good ones include one in Davenport, IA, as well as Oakland Gyros in Milkwaukee and Ekko's in Houston. 

And if you're drunk when you come here, well then you're eating \"Buzzed Gyros.\" Sounds about right."}
{"text":"Very good!! This was our first time here! The staff is very friendly. We both had gryros and all the ingredients were very fresh. I would highly recommend this place when in town."}
{"text":"Stopped in early afternoon Sunday, with my sweetie.  We purchased a medium Gyro, 5.99.  The pita was fresh , the onions were fresh, the cucumber sauce was a double portion, more than enough for the sandwich, and the lamb was delicious.  Forget about Arby's, these are the best, and the clerk gave us a senior discount to boot."}
{"text":"This place has the best gyros ! I've had tons of gyros and none of them compare to these gyros! The cheesy bacon fries...don't even get me started!! Delicious!!!!"}
{"text":"I misspent my youth doing awful, awful things while working in fast food chains.

I'm sure I'll spend eternity in hell for my sins, but before I die and face judgement, I follow this rule about fast food: if the kitchen staff look like a bunch of deadbeat teens suffering from amotivational disorder, DO NOT EAT THERE.

So when I just want fast food, where to go?

Best Gyros.  The Cleveland gyro is fantastic.  So is the garlic and cheese one.  So are the sweet potato fries.  So are the salad wraps, if you're not in the mood for something gluttonous.  It's all good.

Eat anywhere else, especially at a franchise of  a publicly-traded multinational corporation, and you're playing russian roulette, but instead of bullets in a revolver, well, just imagine the grossest thing some metal kid could do to your food and then consider it's gonna be worse than that.

Best Gyros!"}
{"text":"Good late night, partially drunk, after Casino stop. Gyro is huge, prices ok, location is suspect, and interior is barley passable. But.......the gyro and fries are good with friendly staff.  What more do you want at 3am?"}
{"text":"How much do I love this place?  While I'm sitting here having the best gyro and fries ever, I'm trying to figure out if I can move nearby so I can eat here daily.  WOW!  A great find."}
{"text":"So much food! So much comes with an order I'm not sure how they can make money. Very good!"}
{"text":"A few years ago a friend of mine visited Best Gyros in Mentor. You know, the one on Mentor Avenue and 306? yeah! That one. He told me that they had good food at a reasonable price and that they were open very late!

While performing my usual lunch routine (searching Yelp for delicious food that catches my eye) I came upon Best Gyros on Mayfield Road. Perfect! A Gyro sounds amazing. I have not had one for quite some time. Lets see if my friend was right?

My first time here! I walked in and was greeted by the woman from behind the counter. After checking the menu and trying to decide between all of their specialty gyros I decided to just go with the standard; a gyro and fries.

The lady at the cash register recommended that I go with the regular gyro and I decided to throw some fries on there as well.

Regular Gyro - $7.99
Cajun Fries - $2.99

After ordering I turned around and to my surprise I noticed some chairs. There are a few seats for customers who would choose to eat in. By a few, i am saying 4 or 5. There is a little ledge you can eat your food on with chairs in front of it. I used them while I waited for them to prepare my food.

It took less than 5 minutes for my food to be prepared. As I sat waiting 3 customers came in and ordered food. The small order area quickly became crowded. But you know what? It kind of just... worked. The food is prepared so quickly that they can easily shuffle people in and out. Plus, its a gyro place! I am sure most people wont mind as generally you do not go to a fancy sit down place to order a gyro. You order a gyro when you are a) in the mood for a gyro (ok, of course, thats too simple but you know what i meant) or b) in need of a quick fix or c) you are drunk and there just so happens to be a gyro truck that likes to park out in front near all of the bars. Maybe a fourth possibility involving fairs and being surrounded by 'carnies'.

My food is ready. I take the bag and hop in the car to head back to work. The bag is already steamed up and you can feel the grease within. \"This is going to be delicious...\" is the only thing that comes to my mind.

I get to work. Throw my food down on the table. Unpack the bag. Snap a few pics (for yelp!) and dive right in.

The gyro was massive. I really could do with ordering a junior next time. However, the meat was delicious and very well seasoned. The pita seemed a bit basic. Perhaps they could toast these more... not sure exactly what was off about it.

The fries were also quite tasty. I ate most of them. Be sure to ask for ketchup! I did not (luckily i had some at work).

So, would I return to Best Gyros?

Best Gyros is open until 4am some nights. Their food is tasty. Their prices are average. Their location is 'ok' but nothing to write home about. Their food seemed fresh and properly prepared. Yes. I would totally return to Best Gyros."}
{"text":"I got a regular gyro and it was VERY good. I would definitely eat it there, I drove 20 minutes and my pita/lettuce were a little soggy. The different variations of gyros on the menu is insanity, would love to try some of them. The staff was very friendly and a lot of people seem to be eating here even in the off times. I can't wait to return!"}
{"text":"I give a 4.5 for food 2.5 for atmosphere.  I almost always get the food to go. But they have the best gyros around. And really good fries"}
{"text":"This 4am tiny corner shop has a fantastic falafel and pita sandwich. I asked for a side of hummus to make it a delicious combination that filled me just right. My boyfriend could not stop talking about how good his Reuben was for hours after. I didn't order any dessert but the cheesecake case had me drooling."}
{"text":"Anytime a superlative is in the title of a restaurant, I'm weary...and \"Best\" Gyro is no exception. There's nothing \"best\" about this place. Average Gyro, Kind of OK Gyro, Nothing else open Gyro. These would be more accurate terms. Not much to say here. If you want the best, try the rest."}
{"text":"Great Service Been There on more than one ocassion and customer service is A1. The Gyros are freaking awesome and they're so many different types of gyros"}
{"text":"Munchies late night, well this place is your munchie heaven. I know it's processed meat hell, but it tastes so good and builds strong teeth and healthy bones.  Ok so maybe I'm full of shiz on that one.

So if you want something that is not Rallys and made fresh to order late night,  this your option. And not a bad option either. Food is made to order, the service is amazingly friendly, considering all the drunk azzz degenerates (no judgements whatsoever) that gravitate to this establishment. Prices are reasonable and for being one of the few late night options in the Peoples Republic of Cleveland Hts. you can't do much better than Gyro heaven."}
{"text":"I'm actually reviewing the new location in Mentor, on Mentor Ave & 306. For some reason it's not listed yet.  Me and my brother decided to stop in for a quick dinner because we were craving for gyros.  

We've actually been here multiple times before because it's at such a convenient location on two of the busiest streets in Mentor.  We keep coming back because honestly, the customer service is amazing for a fast food joint. On weekdays they got  50 cent fries from 10-10pm.  Their basic fiesta gyro with cucumber sauce in it is only 3.79.  (all the other gyros come with sauce on the side)

The prices here are far more than reasonable.  The nacho cheese gyro of the picture i uploaded is the smallest size they have, which is a junior!  Whatever size you get, they always stack with a mound of meat.  The 50 cent fries are a huge amount too (check out picture).  I have also tried their Atomic gyro.  If you're not a hardcore spicy eater avoid it. It's spicy as **** stacked with atomic sauce and jalapeno peppers galore, guaranteed to make you sweat a storm.

All in all, i totally recommend this place for all your greek cravings. With 20+ different gyros, nothing really ever gets old.  On Saturdays they open til 4 am for all your post bar hopping appetites."}
{"text":"Good food, big portions

  Stopped in my old stomping grounds of Northeast of Ohio before heading home and stumbled upon this small establishment.  I saw \"best gyros\" on the billboard and just had to see if they could earn this distinction.  

  The restaurant is small and homey.  Nothing fancy about it at all.  The menu was more extensive than I expected but I stuck to a gyro with fries.  Shortly after ordering a huge place with the gyro and another plate with the fries came out.  The gyro was gigantic, one of the biggest if not biggest portions I have ever had.  The fries were good, seasoned well.  The gyro was delicious.  The lamb was cooked and seasoned well, all the toppings and sauce on point.  I was thoroughly pleased and would go to any time I find myself in the area."}
{"text":"Jesus.  You need to try this place.  Order the Greek Girl, and you'll know what I'm saying.   It's so good I want to cry. ;)"}
{"text":"Used to love their gyros but I think the quality went downhill a bit here. I came here a few weeks ago expecting amazing gyros like the ones I'm used to and ordered their gyro to go along with French fries and was severely disappointed. I got my to go order in 15 min wait time, and checked to make sure everything was in the bag and it was so I drove off... 10 min later when I'm at my friends house sitting down to eat them I look at the French fries and they are soggy and not well done enough.. then I bite into my gyro which usually has tzaziki sauce and there is none on there!! I was eating the driest food imaginable, like it was inedible.. so yeah their food has gone down hill; or maybe someone messed up my order but my regular 4-5 star review is now a 2 until I go there again and enjoy the food."}
{"text":"For some reason, this business continues to screw up our deliveries. Instead of having the integrity to admit they delivered to the wrong location, or completely forgot to deliver -- they lie to you, don't respond to emails, and refuse to accommodate your bill. 

It's a shame that this business can't keep reliable employees, because the food is pretty great. 

I honestly wish the owner would get his business together and show he cares about his loyal customer base."}
{"text":"Extremely surprised by this place. I actually avoided it for a while because it looked a bit out of place. 

Went in tonight after my painting class because I was starving!!

I ordered a standard Gyro, cajun fries and baklava. 
When our food arrived, it was well packed. See pictures. 

I love the fact the sauce was on the side. In my opinion, when it isn't, it makes the pita wet and soggy.
The Gyro was well cooked and delicious. I actually ate the entire thing. I ordered a medium and it was plenty. 
The fries were tasty and not overly seasoned. The baklava was rich, nutty and delicious. 

Late night dinner just got a bit easier. 

I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Reasonable prices, quick service, healthy portions, average taste (by the slightest of margins).  But open 24/7 Fri. and Sat.  Also have an ok breakfast.  

Atmosphere: no need to discuss it, because it has none.

Recommend: spinning lamb meat on pita.

Really a 2.5."}
{"text":"Good gyro, a tad pricey and polite (but slow moving) staff. The place was clean and bright. We'll be back."}
{"text":"The breakfast special is my go to on a regular basis. It is plenty of food and always hot and f fresh. The environment is very nice its a great place to just chill."}
{"text":"Never ate there but I would have if I didn't see the cooks prepping the food with NO gloves on. It was just disgusting."}
{"text":"Far from the best. The gyro meat was under spiced, pretty much tasteless. The falafel was really disappointing. They seemed like breadcrumb balls more than chickpeas. The falafel was served without any tahini or hot sauce. I'll give them two stars because everything seemed reasonably fresh and the pita was good, but I won't be back."}
{"text":"Is there anything more disturbing that a spiral of lamb spinning on an open-air vertical rotisserie? 

I realize this is the typical way to cook \"Yee-roh\" meat, but it still erks the hell out of me. At Best Gryro's, there's two spits of meat spinning in all of it's glory just behind the counter. What if someone sneezes? What if there's Swine Flu in the air? Surely this can't be sanitary, can it? 

Ah hell, everyone else orders 'em, so they can't be that bad for you, right? For lunch I threw aside my inhibitions and ordered the Regular Philly Gyro, which consisted of shaved \"meat\" (a lamb/beef combo?), peppers & onions with a cucumber yogurt sauce served open faced on a grilled pita. The portions were HUGE! There was no feasible way for any normal human to eat this in a sandwich form. (Note to self: the \"junior\" portion would be plenty next time). 

The gyro was decent, but not the \"best\" as the self titled local chain proclaims. It's also worth noting, the store-front in this Northfield location is a renovated Arthur Treachers, so you can imagine the decor is very bland looking.

Overall, the atmosphere and food of Best Gyro's is about as appealing as the ever spinning mystery meat , which isn't saying much."}
{"text":"Finally stopped in for a gyro. We pass this place all the time and say we should try this place. Well today we did and I am not disappointed one bit. 
    I ordered the buffalo chicken gyro.  We also ordered a regular gyro and a side of jalapeño cheese fries for dh. 
    I will say that the sign says it all about this place. Pitas are fresh and portion of a regular size gyro will fill you up.  
    Fresh Fair cut French fries you can't go wrong. 
    This might be my new place to go when I don't get a free buffet at the hard rock casino. They are friendly when you walk in and they bring out your food when it's ready. 
    It's a little place inside but well worth the stop."}
{"text":"Not the best corned beef in town like they advertise...not even close. Corned beef was so cold it couldn't even melt the cheese on the sandwich. Fries were the best part of the whole meal with pickle as a close second. They do not provide fountain drinks forcing you to buy the more expensive bottles. Service was good but I think they are grossly over priced for the products they provide.  Burger and chicken tenders look like the ones you get out of the frozen aisle in a grocery store. It also felt like we were sitting in a igloo in the restaurant like the AC was on...and it's 32 degrees...In OHIO...I do not recommend this place."}
{"text":"I'm a regular here and these guys well go above and beyond for you. Food is always tasty and fresh. Great people. Recommend if your in the area."}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying that I love how convenient Best Gyros is but location and hours can't make up for sub-par food. Twice I've gotten carryout and each time I asked for extra crispy french fries. I think the fry cook saw \"extra crispy\" on the ticket and deliberately gave me raw, floppy, greasy \"french fries\". Clearly no one cares about the food they are putting out and it shows. The lettuce on my gyro was so greasy it became transparent. The tzatziki was warm greek yogurt. The actual gyro meat was tasty but cold. When I first moved to Cleveland Heights I liked Best Gyros. It seemed clean and convenient with a fool proof menu. Now I see the place for what it really is, mediocre college fare that's only edible when drunk."}
{"text":"I was working over at NBH and had about an hour off to go get lunch. Saw this place on Yelp which sounded pretty good, so I decided to check it out. I got their gyro festival with fries and a drink combo for 7.99$. The gyro was pretty good, not amazing but then again I didn't order any sort of fancy gyro (they have lots of different options). The fries were nice and crispy just how I like them, and the people were friendly. I would go back to try some of the other options they offer."}
{"text":"For some reason their burgers are my favorite thing.
Call in advance cause it will take a while. 
Real ice cream and sweets for dessert."}
{"text":"Every now and the I want a gyro - I like this place - everything is made to order and good.  I think the food is very consistent, and portions are big.  Prices are reasonable.  I am can't think of anything really bad to say other than sometimes they get a little backed up with orders when busy, but they make everything to order so that is to be expected.  The fries are really good too!"}
{"text":"Falls far short of the 'best', but an overall good quality product. I am sure you can pick details you would change, but Best Gyros is a solid option, particularly late night on the east side. One of the few places you can find my fav soda, green tea ginger ale."}
{"text":"My wife decided to order dinner from this place. It was delicious! The gyro was big enough that we split one. The Greek salad with spring greens was amazing. Delivery took about 45 minutes, but it was worth the wait."}
{"text":"Yeah this place is fine. The meat tastes good and is usually filling. Get drunk and enjoy."}
{"text":"Not the highest quality food--it is fast food. Service has always been friendly when I have ordered from here. They have a very broad menu so those with a less adventurous appetite can find something they like here as well. Both times that I have ordered delivery, the food arrived within the hour."}
{"text":"This place is the best! Love the traditional gyros! Introduced a friend today, and he loved it! Great menue, breakfast has wonderful offering! We go when ever We Can!"}
{"text":"Okay. Just. Service is is like a lunch counter in Boston -gruff, brief, functional. Gyro okay but I've had better off of Schwarma trucks in NY. Fries greasy and limp square cut skin on, under cooked. I'm generous with stars."}
{"text":"Great food and they deliver. Some pretty interesting varieties. I've liked the ones I've  tried. Careful though, the jumbo is HUGE!"}
{"text":"The location is superb: in the heart of the Cedar-Lee district of awesomeness, just down the street from the Clev. Hts. Public Library. The menu is pretty extensive, almost to the point of being overwhelming-- but once you've perused the menu board a couple of times, you'll find that they have something for almost everyone. So far, my favourite has been a simple gyro with a side of cheese fries, but I'll occasionally venture into different territories. I've never tried their margaritas, burgers, fish 'n chips, etc., so I won't comment on those things.

Fries-- the servings are huge, and it's almost impossible for one person to finish their main dish and the fries in one sitting (and I always go there extremely hungry). I kind of wish they had an option for a smaller-size (and hopefully cheaper) order of fries, especially when ordering them as part of a combo deal.

Sodas are served in the plastic bottle form only, which also means no free refills.

The service is reasonably fast, though no lightning-speed McDonald's stuff to be expected here. Also, they have windows that fully swing open during summer months.

Parking... Is Cedar-Lee parking. Can't hold that stuff against these guys. (And I'm not bitter. At all.)

Definitely will go back... Often."}
{"text":"This is another one of my occasional lunch time stops for food to go.  Located in a small strip mall.  I've been here several times and enjoy the food.  There's a small bench for you to sit and eat at but most people get it to go. The staff is always nice.

Very large menu of specialty gyros.  I usually get the Junior sized gyro if I'm really hungry or the Festival sized with small fries for a smaller portion.  There's a lot of meat on these gyros and the white sauce is a nice compliment to the whole thing.  The fresh cut fries are crispy and pretty good.  Best to eat them when fresh or they start to get soggy.

I would like to see some consistency on how the gyros are put together.  Sometimes the gyros are stacked and sometimes they are not."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. I've been here three or four times so far and I continue to look forward to returning. Delicious and they're always very kind and professional."}
{"text":"Didn't get to try anything but the baklava. And it is a huge, sweet, honey-soaked baklava. However, it wasn't very flaky or crunchy, it was mostly just a huge pastry globbed with syrup everywhere. Still, I liked it, despite it not being more traditional.  Cashier was funny and nice :-)"}
{"text":"This place was my go to for a cheesesteak while in Cleveland. It was cheaper than subway and definitely more tasty. I'm not a fan of the way all the sodas are canned and the ice cream tasted kinda old.... The gyro was ok, and the fries were ok. I did love the salads because they put a grilled pita on the bottom, and it was a tasty surprise:) I love the hours... don't pay to park, just go across the street and park in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"For a restaurant that is never that busy, it seemed a little pricey! Otherwise the food was great. I got a gyro and fries. Large portions. There is actually a lot on the menu besides gyros, I was surprised. Friendly workers."}
{"text":"Mediterranean Soul Food! Everything is huge and delicious. The falafels are a bit too big though and sometimes don't get cooked all of the way through. They should rename their Mac and Cheese bites to Crack and cheese bites. THEY ARE SOOOOOO GOOD!!! The service is great and they are funny too, especially the late night ones. It's not fine dining by any means, so don't expect that. It's cheap, delicious, good location, and open later than most things in the area. 

Price to tasty ratio - Awesome!"}
{"text":"Hubby and I had cheesesteak sandwiches with regular & sweet potato fries. The bread was soft & warm with just the right amount of meat.  I like that they chop the onions & peppers into meat.

Regular fries were hand cut with just the right amount of bite. Sweet potato fries came with cinnamon sprinkled on them.  Could have done without the cinnamon. Overall everything was delicious."}
{"text":"Positives:

Food quality and taste was great. Had a large menu with lots of options. Got food very quickly.

Negatives:

Price! In my opinion, the portions are not commensurate with the prices. Also only has one little table with a few stools to sit inside, so you pretty much have to take out.

Would love to leave a higher review, but I left hungry for what I paid."}
{"text":"Horrible food! The chicken is bland. The fries are not salted. The guy taking the order was least interested- felt as if he was doing us a big favor. Will never. Set foot here again."}
{"text":"This is a really great place. Their gyros are some of the best in town and the serving sizes are great. The also have great cajun fries. I highly recommend those. I would give a 5 star if the prices were a bit lower, similar to some of the other reviews. Not enough to make me not come back but I would come more often if I didn't have to spend $30 every time. I've never eaten in but the place is clean and the staff is nice. Check it out if you like gyros. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place makes a good gyro. I ordered the best gyro, which I figured was pretty much their staple. Was happy with what I got. Hot meat which was very flavorful on a pita with onions and sauce. You couldn't really fold it up to eat cause it was overstuffed which kinda bothered me. I ordered the regular size which I would recommend. Unless you are a competitive eater or a member of overeaters anonymous you won't need more food."}
{"text":"Their falafel on pita is good. Ordered garlic fries and got regular ones. Wtf!
Their falafel on pita is good. Ordered garlic fries and got regular ones. Wtf!
Their falafel on pita is good. Ordered garlic fries and got regular ones. Wtf!"}
{"text":"Tasty food, large portions.  If you want low carb food, the gyro salads are fantastic.  This is, as the name says, the best gyro place in the area."}
{"text":"Love this place ! The BBQ gyro and corn beef sandwich is amazing ! I always order food from here on the weekends when I don't feel like cooking , the good thing about it is they open super late too, which is a plus for my family since we usually like to eat late ."}
{"text":"Best Gyros is located on Lee Road amoung a lot of other restaurants. I had a taste for Gyros so I decided to give them a try.
The corner location is interesting. It's bright and reasonably clean in the lobby. It reminds me of a 90's Subway. The menu is quite large.,  but I only wanted a good Gyro. My order took a long time and I got an ok Gyro. 
Heating gyro meat correctly is essential. Crispy outside and tender inside. Mine was not correctly heated. The gyro was large and kind of expensive. There was a lot of raw onion atop it. I got fresh cut fries too.  I asked for them to be cooked longer.  They weren't. The inside of restaurant is decorated with nearly exclusively Coca~Cola decorations. Yet,  oddly they only offer Coke in 12oz cans. So I settled for a 20oz Barq's root beer. They also offer ice cream. 
Overall I was satisfied,  but not wowed."}
{"text":"i had phili steak gyros. the pita bread was well made, the meat scrumptious, and their cucumber yogurt was also satisfyingly cooling. definitely a good choice when you have cravings for gyros."}
{"text":"Literally the most disgusting falafel I have ever tasted . Fries were totally undercooked and soggy. Cucumber sauce is tasteless. Took forever to make too. Waited nearly 30 minutes. Gross, just gross"}
{"text":"Always open 24 hrs and the food is great!!"}
{"text":"Not sure why this place has such low ratings. Huge ass gyros for a decent price. And where else can you get fresh cut fries at 3 am? Not even the Melt serves fresh cut fries anymore (despite what the menus say). Lucky to have such a great late night option in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"This place is just great the Gyros are awesome all the great flavors ! Jamaican Jerk , Cajun, teriyaki and Chili pepper flavored Gyro they were great fast friendly service. There's a little bar inside if you want to cop a squat and eat there. Friendly staff they do require payment over the phone for orders , and they deliver. The best Gyros on the east side Kudos ! Best Gyros"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! I ordered the Cajun specialty gyro, which was absolutely delicious. The gyros were made to order and the meat was dry rubbed to perfection. The tzatzaki sauce was fine too. Out of all the gyros that I have ever had, that was the best one. I definitely wanna go there again."}
{"text":"Was up late when some cravings hit so we decided to give Best Gyros a shot (they deliver late on the weekends). Included in the order: 1 Jumbo Jerk Gyro (literally a mound of meat) with an extra pita (to help with the mound of meat because 1 pita surely would not get the job done), a side of Fries, and a Cheeseburger. 

1. The gyro was average. The jerk seasoning was a tad salty. They delivered my order so upon opening my tray I discovered one pita (soggy and completely inedible) placed beneath the mound of meat. Luckily I ordered an additional pita but now faced the issue of having more meat than pita bread. This was our first time ordering from Best Gyros so we weren't sure what to expect. If ordering a jumbo gyro I would suggest you request to put all pita's on the side to prevent condensation from destroying the meal (especially if you're having it delivered). Also, lettuce was soggy..lacked crispness. 

2. The cheeseburger was slightly below average. I ordered a plain cheeseburger (which is simply meat, bread, and cheese) but received a plain burger (bread and meat). I explained what I wanted but I guess the guy taking orders was too tired to double check *Shrugs*."}
{"text":"Not the best gyros in the world, but as far as late night food goes you cannot get much better. They have countless variations on gyros along decent fast food burgers. Also, they turned me on to the feta fries which are out of this world. Best Gyro is the kind of place you go to after a night out in the area or if you want something quick and tasty."}
{"text":"I have been eating at this place since it first opened up. I usually go during a late night cravings for gyros and chilli fries and it certainly does satisfy! The owners are very friendly and nice as well! The service is always attentive and assertive no matter how many intoxicated people come in during the late nights ! Their atomic gyros are really good and so are their chilli cheese fries ! One of my other favorites is steak and cheese! The brownie is really good as well! The prices are great! The portions are big! And the food is fantastic !"}
{"text":"Happy New Year! This place is like a 4.5 star for me!

They have ample things on the menu but the GYROS is all I came for. As you walk in you see the beautiful meat just rotating and thats exactly what you want. 

Got the regular size gyro and it was delicious and served with ample meat! Service was cool and really there isn't much else to say......cool service, decent price, ample food and delicious. Ill be back next time I'm back home to Ohio definitely."}
{"text":"I'm always staying in this town and that... and when I do, I always look for my staples.... Mexican, Italian, Chinese and Mediterranean.... Fortunately, my hotel provides a handy-dandy list of all the local eateries.... So, tonight was Gyro night....

Of course I'll always check Yelp for menus, and Best Gyros was on that list... I was instantly intrigued by their \"specialty\" Gyros, so I took the drive.... Now, mind you, up until now, I've only eaten \"traditional\" Gyros, so, I was in for an adventure...

I ordered the Philly Cheese Steak Gyro (hold the lettuce, add mushrooms).... and when I got back to the hotel, I opened the clam shell.... HOLY FREAKIN' CRAP!!! I had to use a fork to eat down all the tidbits before I was able to fold it!! (got the \"regular\" size). I love a good Philly... I love a good Gyro... but mixing them together resulted in a food-gasm... tender meat, freshly grilled onions, sharp cheddar, red peppers and mushrooms wrapped up in a soft Pita.... it was absolutely delicious!!! Ya gotta try one!!!

I'm thinking I'm going to skip Chinese tomorrow night, and make a return trip to Best Gyros.... (sorry, Chinese, you've been usurped).... ;-)"}
{"text":"It's in the same strip mall as a gentleman's club and they serve beer. Plus it's down the road from a great meat supplier( Northfield Park). Garlic fries are fresh cut and garlicky. I say WIN."}
{"text":"I had a second experience with Best Gyros, and again, the falafel was outstanding. And hey, this place really does have friendly staff. Even the delivery guy was pleasant. Really, check this place out. They're doing things right."}
{"text":"Giant portions.  More expensive than I'm used to paying for gyros.  We got the garlic and cheese gyro, the philadelphia gyro, and a small order of sweet potato fries.  The garlic and chesse really didn't taste very much like garlic, but it was completely drenched in cheese.  The sweet potato fries were the best part of the meal... nice crunch, sweet, yummy, just what a sweet potato fry should be.

The sauce was off the mark... Tzatziki sauce (if that's what it was supposed to be) is supposed to be a magical blend of cucumber, garlic, lemon, dill, that comes together in a greek yogurt symphony to work magic into your gyro.  Or in this case, it's just a thick blob of some unknown components that really doesn't taste like much anything... such a let down.  

I won't be back unless I'm starving, and it's the only place open near by... but if they are open late, and if you're drunk looking for food, it's cheap and likely to be open.  I guess I've had worse street food when I'm really hammered.  I would probably have given 4* in my drunken younger days.

-----------------------------------
Explanation of my rating system -
5*: Epitome of something, the best I've had, would LOVE to go back
4*: Great food and happy to go back regularly, but not the best of the category
3*: Food is fine.  I may spontaneously decide to go there based on convenience.  But no need to go back either.
2*: If you insist, I guess I'll come along. I'll find something to eat. But I wouldn't have picked it.
1*: No plans to come back.  I'll try to talk companions out of going."}
{"text":"I gotta say, this little place didn't get the name 'Best Gyros' for nothin' - truth be told, they most likely named themselves this, but the public surely won't disagree!  To attest to their greatness, as I entered the doors and mulled over the menu, I offhandedly mentioned to the cashier that I'd need a minute since I'd never been... two random people were in there, separate from one another, and both chimed in \"You'll love it\" One even added, \"everything on the menu is good... you can't go wrong!\"

So, being the Plain Jane I was this evening, I opted for a Jr. Chicken Gyro with added feta, SOLID choice for 50 cents, and some zucchini fries, because hey - I was feeling both healthy and bad greasy vibes.  Signature move for me on the weekend.  

Zucchini fries were $4.99.  Piping hot!  Served with a delectable creamy ranch.  Strong amount of zucchini to breading ratio, and nice lengthy sticks rather than hunks or chunks.  The breading itself was crispy and light, not too fattening feeling, but not super thin like some tempura battered styles I have had.

The Jr. Chicken Gyro had some nice chopped veggies atop a pleasantly seasoned sliced grilled chicken breast, with added feta for delish robust flavor, and a creamy cucumber sauce to tie it altogether.  I must say the pita these toppings floated amidst was the deal sealer.  Warm, fresh, doughy, not too thick, not too thin... one perfect piece of pita, friends!

Go check this place out if you're in the Northfield area.  It may seem like an awkward location, across from a gas station and next to a Subway, with interesting light up signs and maybe not the best outside or interior decor, but it's not about appearance with this smashing joint.  Added Bonus you may ask?  It's open for breakfast for you early birds, but also nice and late for us night owls!  Fulfilling the hearts of many, BG!"}
{"text":"Food is always nice and hot! The service is decent. The establishment is clean. I like how you can look inside the kitchen (that's always a plus) this is a busy place in a busy area. I don't expect outstanding customer service in a place that's always moving."}
{"text":"Very disappointed with this place. The food was par and the service was horrible. I wanted to support a local business and check this place out. The first time I placed an order for delivery, it took them 35 minutes when I was told it would only take 20 mins. I ordered breakfast and on the menu it mentioned that all breakfast items comes with Texas toast. It was not Texas toast, it was regular plain bread. I gave them another chance and came to the store to try their infamous gyro. The girl working that day was so rude! After we got our order we left. When we arrived home we realized that we never got the cucumber sauce. I had to turn around because it wouldn't be a proper gyro without the cucumber sauce! When I got back, the girl argued with me that she did put it in the bag. She proceeded to roll her eyes at me when I explained that it was NOT in the bag. Anyways, the gyro was plain even with the sauce. Needless to say I'm never coming back here again."}
{"text":"these guys are great !  I crafted my own gyro with chicken, garlic, lettuce, tomatoes, feta, cucumber sauce, and greek olives.   Best Everrrr!!!   Thank you!!!"}
