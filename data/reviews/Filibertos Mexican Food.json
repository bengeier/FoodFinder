{"text":"Parking - There is plenty of parking on site. There is no street parking.  Customer service - i've only dealt with one lady at the drive-through window and she always seems to be very nice sometimes I tell her don't want salsa but she still gives it to me anyway. Lol  Food - The portions are pretty big so come hungry. It is decent food but it's probably going to taste better when you're drunk. Lol The meat qualityok. You will get a few fat pieces here and there. I do recommend the breakfast burritos. I always get the bacon and they are delicious."}
{"text":"\"Breakfast burrito soaring in Phx, up 206%\" Young entrepreneurs are starting the \"meals on wheels\" cart looking to cash out on this trend. Burrito are made to order and piping hot! You can find them on twitter."}
{"text":"O.K. so the quality of the food varies greatly from store to store, how ever , this one happens to be one of the stores that is usually very good. Slow service all 3 times I have been there, so don't go expecting something different. My last order there was a burrito( adobada) that was so large , that I made lunch out of it for 2 days. The best part, 4.00 It was very good, and spicy , just the way I like it. They also have a salsa bar , so dig in !"}
{"text":"Great food, customer service was great also! Chili selection and variety was excellent, made my dad sweat! Will definitely come back :) A+++"}
{"text":"The three stars are for 1) the awesome green chile pork burritos and 2) having a drive-thru. I found the the chorizo and menudo to be thin and and greasy, not so good."}
{"text":"I'm switching to vegan. I'm sure that lifestyle and its practitioners annoy you. That said, while I may not be able to enjoy it that much longer, this is my favorite food any time of the day or night. I realize I'm ghetto for loving it so much. You can take a white boy out of Scottsdale but you can't take the hood out of my mouth. It's just sooooooo fucking tasty. Number 17 meal changes lives. The breakfast burrito? Heaven on crack. The horchata? Grass dewed with the blood of the patron saint of tacos wouldn't taste better or look more romantic at 3:00 A.M. on a Saturday night when you're looking impress that cutie you just picked up at the Vig or Glam (or Positino if you've got more game)."}
{"text":"The best fast Mexican in Phoenix.  Anywhere in city limits there is a bertos within blocks.  Best tortas and burritos. Best machaca in town. Huge portions for pocket change."}
{"text":"Went to this location on 11/19/2014. Its not there. Even Google Maps shows the Building is empty"}
{"text":"Been going to this location and eating at this restaurant for years now and still live it. This location is the only place you can get great bowls to eat and the service is always friendly"}
{"text":"We all know there are good Berto's and bad Berto's, this place is a good one for sure. Everything is always good and they are usually really quick and always friendly. The breakfast burritos are my favorite and the rolled tacos are as well and always so crispy. The only thing is I have noticed with all Berto's is the guacamole is horrible. I don't have to have it but if it was good I would like it with my rolled tacos. I always get a horchata to. This is a must. I posted a pic of my happy burrito!!!"}
{"text":"When in the Phoenix / Tucson area, this is the place for Mexican Food ('Tex-Mex' for you sticklers). It's a small chain of restaurants that extend to San Diego, CA. I wished they had one in L.A. They have hearty and generous portions and low prices. The food is great, too! The two locations that I've been to are very humble settings, but the staff are friendly and efficient. Very fast service! Just keep in mind that the portions are huge."}
{"text":"I couldn't be happier because they opened a Filibertos less than a mile from me.  Who needs an Egg McMufffin when you can get the best egg, bacon and cheese burrito around at Filibertos Drive Thru window.  Every once in a while, i get a big machaca plate breakfast to take to work and split it with my 2 teammates.  Breakfast for 3, and only about $6!  I have also noticed that the people who work at this location are especially nice and attentive."}
{"text":"Good food and good sized burritos. Would have a better star if employees weren't so slob like. Cashier got mad that they got my order wrong and tried to blame me for not saying what I wanted. When I clearly stated what I wanted and they repeated to me and still managed to mess it up. Horrible customer service skills. On top of all of that. They were talking a lot of garbage in Spanish as if I didn't understand it. Good food but horrible employees. One wasn't even in uniform wearing a bright pink shirt and pants. I asked for their corporate number and they refused time after time to give it to me. So I will be searching it up on line and letting them know how their store is being ran. The Mexican lady in the front acting as a manager was horrible. I would recommend the food just not the service."}
{"text":"Larger portions than other locations but not as delicious. It was eh. Rather have quality over quantity. Seems like they focus on quantity. Will go to other Chandler Blvd location from here on out. The beef taco had more beef but less flavor. Same with the tostados beans. Not tasty and unimpressed"}
{"text":"Always great. Fast. Friendly. Super Nachos are delish! Wife loves rolled tacos but I think they are dry. Get the adobada burrito add fresh jalape√±os if you like hot....tasty!  05/05/18 got something here you rarely get at most Ahwatukee places (ie Panda Express) after waiting a mere 30 seconds o got a \"sorry about the wait\".  Awesome!!!"}
