{"text":"I'm not sure that, set in a place with better restaurants, I would still be calling Bistro One a 5-star restaurant, but it's definitely the best dining in Madison. Just a few tables. Personable service. Great food and wine. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The talapia fish here is excellent.  Large portion, perfectly prepared with an awesome sauce.  Mushroom soup was good but not as favorful as some that I've tried. The house salad was fresh with a wonderful dressing.  Service was good.  If you get past the quirky wall paper, it is a nice place for date night.  Call ahead for a reservation."}
{"text":"Excellent and cordial staff.  We came in on a busy Sat. night without reservations and we were quickly seated at a window table.  Our server and the hostess were very attentive.  The appetizer, salad, bread, and main course came quickly considering the placed was packed.  The pork medallions were tender, juicy and tasty.  The Mediterranean chicken and shrimp was delicious. The tapenade and pita was great.    We even had a brief visit from chef Nick at our table. Will definitely come back here the next time we are in Madison!"}
{"text":"Do not take reservations here. I for one do not want to be dressed up for dinner and then stand and wait an hour. Very rude on the phone when I tried to make a reservation and told me they had to go because a call was on the other line. hung up on me."}
{"text":"For some reason it took an hour and 15 minutes to get our meals. We sat as others came in after us, we seated, fed and left and we still didnt have our food. Once it got there it was good. Loved the potatoes."}
{"text":"Great Mediterranean restaurant. Cool decor. Quaint with a full bar. The owner Nick is very friendly and spoke with us a couple of times. The filet was fantastic and the whole family enjoyed their meals. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"We visit Madison once or twice a year for a few days a year and stay at the Clifty Inn or the Clifty Falls State Park campground. Over the years, we have eaten at most of the dining spots in Madison and found that there is not much to find in the line of Fine Dining. We finally found a great spot in Bistro One. Being in our 70s, we like to eat our dinner early so we had not tried Bistro due to their hours of 5:30 to 9 pm. This year we wanted to try Bistro One, so we arrived at 5:45 and we greeted by Chef Nicos and who seated us at one of his best tables where our servers (regular server and a trainee) greeted us. They explained the menu and specials and took drink orders. They serve alcoholic drinks but do not push them at all. After reviewing the menu we decided on an appetizer to share and our entrees. We order the Stuffed Mushrooms for our appetizer, which is a large mushroom stuffed with a mixture of ground prosciutto and several shredded cheeses that is broiled to melt the cheese snake a crusty top. Very tasty!  My wife ordered the Parmesan Chicken. This was very moist chicken with a crunchy breading and a nicely melted and crisped cheese topping over a spaghetti type pasta with a tomato mushroom sauce that was favored just right with Herbs and was fairly thick. I had the special of the night which was grilled chicken and shrimp in a Mediterranean sauce that was favored well with Herbs. This came with the copper skillet vegetables that we done just right with some crunch in the ones that needed it and moist and crisp on the other ones. We both had salads we the meal with a variety of greens and tasty dressings. We were not pressured to finish or leave, so we ate our meal at a leisurely pace and found that it was approaching 8 pm when we finished. Fine Dining at it Finest.  We did not have room for dessert, but we did purchase a piece of an unusual lemon cake to share later. It was very moist and very tasty. The price for the evening was very reasonable. We will be back to Bistro One on our next trip to Madison"}
{"text":"The waitress had warned us that the chef/owner was Moody and typically he does yell from time to time. It happened that evening, he became upset at a different waitress and dropped a few F bombs in front of everyone. I was shocked that he would belittle someone that way in front of his patrons.  I probably won't go back because of his behavior towards his staff."}
{"text":"Awesome food and service. The hummus is to die for we had Mahi Mahi  that was cooked perfectly to perfection and the vegetables were cooked  in a Copper skillet was great the staff very friendly and very good service next time were in town we will go again definitely 5 stars!! Cindy our server was very friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Nice place - would go back again. The Morrocan Chicken and Shrimp with fig puree (confit?) was really good. A side of roast potato chunks, smoky cooked cabbage, fettucini and string beans came to the table in a copper skillet - tasted good and nice presentation. But side salad with creamy Italian dressing was plain and tasteless. And skip the Opa! flaming cheese with ouzo - not worth the price for a couple tablespoons of messy cheese."}
{"text":"The Cobb salad was insanely big.  Very good.  Very very good.  Wings were perfect.  But...we only got 9 wings not 10.  Funny!"}
{"text":"ONE Bistro that is no doubt NUMBER ONE !!  After walking in and dashing out of another establishment before even ordering we made our way back downtown to find \"different\" food.    A couple of trips hopping across the street we landed at Bistro One based on the posted menu outside the door.  We had a 15 minute wait before they opened for dinner so we visited the next door book store.   They recommended Bistro as the best and said to tell Nick the owner hello.  Walking in we were greeted by none other than Nick !  I passed along the well wishes and we were seated in the \"best\" seat in the house...(my opinion).    In this small Ohio River town I was blown away by the menu, the hospitality and the FOOD.  Nick is not only the owner but the chef..and his Greek heritage comes out not only in his accent but his food.  The special of the night was \"Chicken Virginia\"...okay, I'll bite and boy was I glad I did...chicken with Prosciutto, cheese, mushrooms and a special Alfredo sauce....Wonderful.  The \"Copper Pan Vegetables\" a specialty of the house  you don't want to miss added a candied sauteed red cabbage, linguine, broccoli, and Greek potatoes..  My daughter had the tilipia rolled in a special walnut crusted coating and sauteed perfectly.  Add the wonderful food to the most generous pour of wine I have seen in a long time and you have a meal that takes you to heaven on puffy soft clouds.  We indulged dessert,  the best Tiramisu I have had this side of the Atlantic.....  Have I sung enough praises for this place yet....???  In my opinion NO.  I would drive the two hours just to have dinner here again.    Now in closing ---- the cost -- Amazing !!!  All of the above, including wine and coffee and we left for under $ 30 dollars each.  I have paid more than that and scoffed at the meal.  I promise this is a place you will not want to miss if you are headed down to Madison, or anywhere on the Ohio...go out of your way.  You won't be disappointed.... and tell Nick I said Hello."}
{"text":"I love this restaurant. The owner always comes out to make sure that the dishes are up to your standard. They have delicious food and you can taste the freshness that they cook with. This is one of my favorite restaurants to go to when we are looking for a delicious fillet.  Anything that you get here you can guarantee it to be wonderful. The food is really worth what you spend on it. I have never had a bad experience at this restaurant."}
{"text":"I have lived in Madison, our small town all my life. My husband and I wandered into Nick's one of the first nights he opened and have returned weekly (at least). The menu changes but Chef Nick has not changed. He is a unique individual!!! Reservations are taken by phone but they are not required. The staff will honestly tell you if there will be a wait. The staff is wonderful. They are very attentive. All dress in black and white, very clean. The restaurant is cozy and charming. Though it appears upscale it is very affordable. It isn't an expensive night, but there are higher end items available. We usually start with the salad. I am a Ranch Dressing kind of girl, or I thought I was until I tasted the Bistro dressing. So good..... Fresh bread and butter is served at this time and I could fill up on the warm bread and salad. Of late, my husband has been ordering the Shrimp and Grits. The grits are creamy, cheesy they are topped with sausage and shrimp with a light tomato sauce. He keeps ordering it so it must be fantastic. I order the Steak Diana which is a New York Strip that is grilled to order (always just the way I like it, tender and juicy.) and has a creamy demi mushroom sauce. The steak is cooked to perfection and the sauce is to die for! I can't get enough.  If not as hungry, then I get a small plate Petit Filet, perfectly cooked or they would fix it immediately with a bourbon sauce that makes you want more. You are also served green beans and potatoes. The Entrees come with a \"Skillet\", which includes pasta, green beans, potatoes that have been cubed, fried, grilled, and the sweet red cabbage that is all great!!! If anything is the way you like the staff checks in often to help in anyway. The wine selection is very good and the make some good mixed drinks. I have nothing to complain about!  If we can't get to the Bistro we have ordered carry out. I like eating there better but we don't always get what we want."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful experience last night. We are on a special diet. The server was very understanding and the chef made us an exemplary dinner just as we needed. It tasted awesome. Nic is great!"}
{"text":"Love love love! Food is fresh and wonderful! Nick, owner and chef is a charmer! Calls you \"Love\". I wish he opened the restaurant more often!"}
{"text":"Was here for a wedding rehearsal dinner. We were a small party so just ordered off the menu, and agreed that everything was excellent. Service was great. Easily the best in Madison."}
{"text":"The owner/ chef Nicos Izamis works the table in his uniquely Greek style. The atmosphere is very warm and inviting. Arrive early or make reservations because the seating is limited and it fills up quickly on Friday and Saturday night. We had the Hummus Plate for starters. The hummus was flavorful and served with pitted olives, cucumber and tomatoes. This was followed by Potato Leak Soup de Jour that was served at the perfect temperature. The soup was creamy with a soft flavor of leak. The main course was a Petite Filet Mignon cooked medium rare and served with a Bourbon sauce. Steak knives were provided but not needed as filet melted like butter in my mouth. The bourbon sauce accentuated the filet to perfection. If you are in Madison this is a must stop."}
{"text":"Ate dinner there on 9/10/17, fast service and Nick greeted us after we sat down. Our server was great and Nick continued to check on us throughout our dinner. Highly recommended!!"}
{"text":"This little restaurant is a gem in historic Madison.  My friend got the lemon chicken and raved about it.  I was able to get a vegan version of the gnocchi which was also phenomenal.  Lovely ambiance and friendly waitstaff.  I would recommend this restaurant to anyone, particularly if you need a vegan or vegetarian option, which can be difficult to find in the area."}
{"text":"Great little place in downtown Madison. Mediterranean themed. Good libations. Great food. Romantic setting."}
{"text":"Needless pretension in this good but not great venue. The signage promises upscale dining, which is a matter of opinion. My dish was too laden with salt or Msg, neither good. Take the excellent ratings with a \"grain of salt\"."}
{"text":"We heard Bistro One was excellent and it was.  We were not dressed for such a nice place but on a freezing Thursday night they welcomed us and made us feel like valued customers.  We started with the cheese and proscuitto stuffed mushrooms.  There were five of them and they were outstanding.  The house salad comes with an interesting Greek dressing, a nice tomato wedge and marinated onions.  It was very good.  Steve had the Kalamatra Chicken topped with spinach and tomatoes and he loved it.  I had the lemon shrimp and it was outstanding.  The entrees come with a shared 'copper pan' of starch and vegetables.  The served linguine, a perfect accompaniment to the shrimp, potatoes, glazed carrots and steamed broccoli.  We could not even finish the copper pot and my 'I don't eat cooked vegetables' husband loved the carrots.  The wine selection was nice and I had two Chianti at $6.25 each.  Steve ordered baklava and it must have been good because I didn't even get a taste!  The bill was $71 plus tip and worth every penny!  The staff was gracious and the owner Nick was adorable. He came out and chatted several times and said he loved me as I left.  I love him too and if I ever get back to Madison, Nick's charming Bistro One is #1 on my list."}
{"text":"great Greek salad and deserts. we had a great and helpful waitress with question about the area--did not get her name,  would recommend this place.."}
{"text":"Yet an other very good meal with fun and friendly folks at Bistro One...superb calimari...amazing soup...watermelon something seafood stuff which was inventive and decicious...almost lebanese ??  Madison has some terrific independents...check em out !  A terrific mini vacation to be had in this area...lots to do...friendly locals....localy owned hotels and businesses...well worth your time and support"}
{"text":"Nick and his staff were really sweet (and funny!) the food was AMAZING! Try the mushroom bisque soup if you can! So many flavors in our main courses, good beer and romantic atmosphere :)"}
{"text":"Top notch homemade food beautifully prepared.  Prices are very reasonable and in my opinion the entree prices should be raised $3-5 given the quality and portion size, not to mention great  ambience and wait service.  A very pleasant surprise in a small town!  p.s. if you think you need to \"dress up\" for this restaurant, rest assured our family was the exact opposite of that.  We were welcomed despite arriving in shorts & T-shirts and looking rather grungy after a day of fun at the nearby Clifty Falls State Park."}
{"text":"We had a wonderful meal at Bistro One. The owner Nick is a gracious, and attentive, host. He engaged with us several times throughout the meal. Nick is the master with the houmous too. Best we have had anywhere!  All of our meals were outstanding, and the price was very reasonable, especially considering the quality. All in all, a great dining experience."}
{"text":"This was the perfect place for a fun yet romantic dinner.    We loved everything we ate.  We ordered the saganaki appetizer which is a flaming greek cheese.  The staff sings when they bring it out.  The house salads come with a greek dressing.  I ordered the Chicken Schnitzel and my husband ordered the Kalamata Chicken.    I wish we were staying in Madison longer so we could eat here more.  The food was excellent and there were so many things to choose from."}
