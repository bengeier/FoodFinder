{"text":"Quick and late hours delivery. I just keep getting piri piri half chicken .. this is awesone"}
{"text":"I order at this place almost all the time since I finish work late hours. Everything after hours is usually closed and this place is opened till 3am or 4am on the weekends. Usually places that are open super late have poor quality of food and or service. I must admit that this is not the case over here! Whenever I order by them late at night they are always super friendly and super quick!  The food is beyond amazing!  I loveee their chicken thighs. It's so tender and succulent. Woow and that sauce melts in my mouth! Iactually  love everything here. Their salads are amazing, the beets are deelicious. The rice is always fresh and warm. Their wraps are amazing. Omg try the club sandwich too its DEEELICIOUS!!!! They add mayo im surprised .. most plces like scores or st hubert never ever ever put mayo and their club sandwich is so dry. Ohh and im surprised they made me try their potatoes once and it was DEELICIOUS .. im not a big fan of potatoes but I must admit if you love potatoes you should definitely get some they are amazing. This place makes sure their food is top of the top!   I always have a pleasant experience and they deliver so quickly. Im super happy and will definitely be ordering soon hehe ;) Good job guys you deserve a lot of credit for the phenomenal fresh food and Exceptional service!"}
{"text":"Came here to eat a quick bite before some shopping and opted for their Club Sandwich Combo that consisted of the sandwich and 2 side options & soda. I went with their creamy coleslaw and potatoes. The price tag was $11 which is very fair for what it is.  The Club Sandwich was really good, chicken was moist and flavorful (probably fresh from the noon rush). Authentic white chicken. The coleslaw was good but I'd say the potatoes were mediocre which simply should happen.   There's only 3 forms to potatoes : Awesome, mediocre and vodka... I got the least desirable of the 3 options.  I will be back."}
