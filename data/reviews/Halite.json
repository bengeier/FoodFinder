Original revue...

An excellent dining experience with a quirky feel.  Not to be missed!

THE UP-SIDE:  A great selection of food that is always, always, always tasty and done just right.  With an eclectic mix of choices, you'll find something to please everyone.  ...and nobody will be disappointed.  Great marks for the small, intimate atmosphere and pleasant staff, as well.

THE DOWN-SIDE:  It's a little small, but that's part of the charm.  Thus, if you're going on a busy night, make a reservation (although I've never really had too long of a wait.)

THE SUM-IT-UP:  This is one of the best places for a high-quality dinner and great atmosphere in Ohio City.  If you're looking for a nice, quiet, first-date location, this is your place.  

As a side note, the owners of this fine establishment also own \"Fat Cats\" and the \"Lava Lounge\" in Tremont; two very fine establisments in their own right, and similar in quality and feel."}
{"text":"Alas poor Halite..  I knew you..  ok i guess.   

Your dinner, dessert and drink special was not to be beaten..   with poor foot traffic and no windows I guess I'm surprised you lasted so long..  Amazingly cheap for the quality... i guess some good things dont last..

{"text":"Yeah, this place has been closed since Butch Davis was coach of the Frownies. But I don't eat upscale much, so I thought I should reminisce about when i had money to blow on dinner. Great little spot in Ohio City with a kitschy 50's jet- set vibe. I had the lake erie walleye. It was much better than the sheephead they serve at City Club functions. My wife had the polenta lasagna. Thus began our love of the cornmeal food of the gods. She didn't even miss the traditional sauce-noodle-meat combo when presented with her ration. I also had brussel sprouts. I'd try to cook them myself, but they were horrible. Somehow Halite made them edible. The vibe was way more impressive than the food. I really wish i had gone there more. I'm not sure if the owners still operate lava lounge or fat cats. I guess i should get off of my cheap ass and go check those places out."}
