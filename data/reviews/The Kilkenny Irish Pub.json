{"text":"Food is all right, but service's beyond disappointing. Didn't get to enjoy my dinner while our server was giving us attitude."}
{"text":"I'd give this place a zero but one is the lowest option. Service was terrible, it took our server ages to take our order and forgot our drinks. She clearly had 'favourite' tables, sitting with them and giving them obviously better service. When we attempted to leave we asked for a box to pack the little food we wanted to save and our bill then watched her leave, sit with the 'favourites' and put her number into a different customers phone. After watching her forget we are trying to leave legally (so much temptation just to get up and walk out) we asked a different waitress for a box. She didn't look surprised our original waitress was being neglectful. Our original waitress came shortly after with two boxes and said 'sorry about that, I had to go all the way to the back'. Right.... We will go with that. Oh, and she forgot our bill. I don't care if she was 'new' like she claimed. Do rounds, check and see if everyone is okay. And for the love of god, don't lie to a customer when they can see you plain as day socializing. I would only come back if I sat at the bar and only ordered drinks."}
{"text":"Kilkenny Kills - Monday night wings, 17 cents each, yumma! Fair sized fried poultry parts served quickly. Unlike some other pubs, no ridiculous rules governing bevvies, you're not required to purchase an alcoholic beverage for every 10 wings ordered. Also you're not branded with a scarlet \"A\" or begrudged for being the DD & drinking only soda pop. Cheap deep fried deliciousness with innumerable flavors. City's most reasonable, comfortable, unpretentious, flavorful, wing locale."}
{"text":"My boyfriend just moved into the Brentwood area around The Kilkenny. After a grand Friday night of partying, our natural instinct was to head on down and try out the $4.99 Big Breakfast Special. Having never been to this pub before, my first two impressions were: 1. Woah, big place. 2. Where are the staff? No lies, we had a lot of trouble getting service here, and finally my boyfriend had to actually get up, leave his seat, and go get a waitress to take our order. Is this place really so big that the staff can't seem to get to the 4 tables with customers... or is it that Kilkenny is so sparsely staffed that this was the best service that could be provided? I can't really blame the waitress, though.  Anyhow, for $4.99 you get 2 eggs, 2 pieces of bacon, a sausage, a pile of overdone hash-browns, the strangest sausage you've ever seen/tasted, and two pieces of whole-wheat toast (watch out, it comes buttered). Not bad. I don't think I'd be really enthused to order another meal here; an appetizer dish perhaps."}
{"text":"We tried out the Sunday brunch this past weekend.    I was hoping to improve upon my last 2 star rating of this place, but alas, no such luck.  In fact, I am torn between one and two stars this time.    The experience:  We took our seats, and did not see a sign of a server at all (the seats were more in the corner, so not as visible as the main floor area).    After a significant amount of wait time, we proceeded to hit the buffet in advance of ordering drinks (this was one at a time, just in case the server ever decided to show).  With two separate trips to the buffet, and plates of food now on the table -- still no sign of our dear waitress.  Which was an issue, as there was no sign of cutlery either.    We weren't the only ones.  One table of three next to us had plates of food, and were sans cutlery as well.    Both tables could only stare longingly at the food, picking at what we could with our fingers.     After a couple of minutes, my brunch companion went on recon for cutlery, came back with a couple of sets, and then went on recon for the omelet ordering forms.    Meanwhile, with two sets of cutlery on my table, and myself sitting alone, the other table began eyeing them suspiciously:  \"Are you going to use both of those???\"    \"Uh, yeah... there's two plates of food on the table.\"  But in a leg cast, and slow on crutches, I was afraid.  Finally, after one of us (the customer) doing all the serving for our table, someone on staff clued in, and our waitress appeared.  She was fully attentive for the rest of the brunch.  It turns out, we learned, the Kilkenny actually ran out of cutlery, so perhaps the waitress was just in the fetal position hiding somewhere?    Anyhow, the buffet and the custom ordered omelet were actually pretty good, once we could eat it.  So that's the only reason I went with 2 stars versus 1.    The rest wasn't forgivable, so no improvement this time around."}
{"text":"The dry ribs aren't very good, I guess since they're 1c each, it's expected, but I'd rather not spend an hour trying to salvage any dry rib that exists on the bone. Usually overcooked and stale. Nothing else on the menu really appeals to me, also have had a wrap but wasn't good at all. Service is hit or miss. Usually miss it seems."}
{"text":"This pub used to be much better. We ordered the party platter ($35) and were disappointed at the quality of the food. The wings (sweet Thai) tasted like a weird ketchup mixture, the fried pickles were super greasy, and there was hardly any cheese on the nachos. In addition, most of the \"platter\" was potato chips... what a rip-off. In addition, the service was super slow even though the place was nearly empty. We won't be back. Terrible experience."}
{"text":"The food is pub food of course, but GOOD pub food.  The bar menu is excellent, one of the best in town.  The bar staff are attentive and the floor staff is poorly trained (or lazy when the boss is away...).  We wind up having to leave our table and sit at the bar just to get served too many times.  Five waitresses walked by our table and the table to our right got served twice while we were waiting.  It sucks that I have to leave and go to other pubs just to get a drink because I really like Kilkenny's."}
{"text":"Really wasn't a fan of the stale fries, burnt hamburger bun, or the ultra well done bacon. The service though... Meh."}
{"text":"This place was horrible!   The food took forever to get to our table, it was dry, no flavour. Stop being frugal with ingredients! Needs to be updated!  Service was bad!"}
{"text":"Sometimes I don't even care about service, which is a good thing at Irish pubs in town. The Kilkenny always takes a while to get food, but it doesn't matter because the beer always keeps coming and it's just a great neighbourhood pub to sip on suds and talk to friends. They have a nice patio that heats up in the late afternoon. At night, the bar fills up and it's always fun. Like I said, I've never had prompt food service and the food has never been exceptional either, but I keep going back and taking friends from out of town there, so there must be something to the place. It seems to be busy every night of the week and is a great place if you're thirsty and want to chat."}
{"text":"Love this pub. Best atmosphere and set up for an authentic Irish pub feel. Decent service and great place to be when there's a hockey game on!  Food is delicious. My fave are the mini yorkies!  All in all a great place to have a few pints with your pals!"}
{"text":"We went as a group with a reservation for 15-25 people. We were a bit early for our reservation but still waited over 30 minutes for our server to take our beverage order. I went to the bar and the bartender poured a perfect creamy Kilkenny. The next one I ordered from our server was totally settled cause it took her so long to serve it. When she checked out and the new server took over the service went further downhill. We rarely saw her and when we did order something it took even longer to get our drinks. Most likely not to return due to the poor service. The food was ok more processed than fresh."}
{"text":"Had lunch here with customers. I had the Irish stew in a bread bowl which was good. Never had it before so it is hard to compare. This is a typical Irish pub. Seems clean and doesn't have the weird smells of some pubs."}
{"text":"Awesome Irish Pub. Great food at reasonable prices. Yorkshire Tidbit is fantastic."}
{"text":"Table of friends going out for a nice dinner.  The waitress was running around like crazy, the food was ok.  We ordered Irish Coffees and they were a joke.  Cold coffee, made colder with a shot of scotch (NOT Irish whiskey) and served with a handful of creamers. For an Irish bar, someone needs to go back to bartending school, or find a new profession. Really really an embarrassment."}
{"text":"A fight broke out one time when I was enjoying a pint of grasshopper and I felt an ashtray zing right past my head...but other than that time, the Kilkenny has been an excellent watering hole.    The great thing about this place is that it's huge and you and your friends can always find a seat.  In the evenings it's filled with lots of different people (university students and local residents).  The waitresses are friendly and wear plaid miniskirts, which is a bonus if you're into that sort of thing (friendliness).  Tip: My favourite day of the week to go is Wednesdays because they have an excellent steak sandwich special.    If you're looking for a traditional Irish pub with a young energetic vibe then the Kilkenny is the place for you."}
{"text":"The Kilkenny has been a part of my life for a while.  They have decent food, Irish pub style.  The menu changed recently and they took off a couple of my favorite dishes, I was a bit bummed about that.  They have amazing mini yorkies though.  They also have 1/2 priced wine on Thursdays til 8pm.  Their happy hour is sad, its only from 5-6pm.    The one really good thing about The Kilkenny is that is is a great place to come watch a hockey game.  The back room is rounded with 5 or 6 TVs.  We always have a blast when we come here for a flames game.  It is good to get there early though since it does tend to fill up and there are a few spots where you can't see any TVs.  I have also bought their hockey ticket packs in the past, which were a great deal, its a huge bonus when you take a bus to the game!  The Kilkenny also has a fun New Years party!    Overall this is a great place to come for a pint and watch the game!"}
{"text":"Busy place service was below par and we had some food issues but they were dealt with to satisfaction.  Great value on 5 buck wings on wed good sized wings."}
{"text":"Although the barkeeps are a good time, the servers here are half assed and seem to have a giant sense of entitlement. If this place wants to be as British as they pretend, they should put the servers behind the bar and make it self service. It would be less agitating this way.  Although the 1l glasses of Coors are insulting to the German beer that should go in them, it's well worth the $8.50. That's the only reason I would go here. To get hammered for cheap, when I want a change of pace from Moose's.  Too bad the food sucks. The wings are from Sysco and the rest of the food is the same as the junk you can get anywhere else. Go somewhere else."}
{"text":"When my boyfriend used to work close to this pub, I would sometimes join him and his coworkers for an after work drink (or two!) They have pretty good daily specials with both drinks and food - wings, steak sandwiches, fish & chips, etc. and their regular bar menu (nachos and burgers) isn't too shabby.  Since the Jameson's nearby renovated I've noticed that this place isn't as busy as it used to be - could be because people are easily swayed by shiny new things. The decor in this place is typical of any Irish pub - dark with random knick knacks and heavy wooden tables and bar stools.  I don't love this place but I don't hate it either, it's a somewhere to check out for happy hour and some pub food."}
{"text":"Very attentive waitress and a great selection of beers.  Not much to review because we didn't end up eating anything.  A great neighborhood pub with quick service."}
{"text":"Tried this place tonight for my birthday, we walked in and thought we would sit on the patio. Well we had a group beside us that had a few drinks and were loud and obnoxious! I expected more Irish food selections as well as more of an Irish pub atmosphere not listening to top 40 music. We both ordered fish and chips, we finally moved inside as our meal was brought to us as we couldn't take it anymore. The meal was a huge disappointment, the fries were not very fresh like it was old oil or something and the fishes batter was not pleasant and the fish itself was dry and not what the Irish would serve that was an embarrassment. If I wasn't so hungry I would have sent it back and left. Will not be heading back there again, the owner should re-evaluate what an Irish pub is if that's what you claim to be."}
{"text":"Just had a work Christmas party here. The work management opted for buffet turkey dinner and it was fantastic. There was plenty of food, the food was excellent, the staff- super-friendly and quick. I heard mixed reviews about this place before, my own experience from today is that it is the great place to come again.  We will definitely drop in soon to check their specials and Sunday Brunch."}
{"text":"What. A. Cool. Place.  Seriously. Kilkenny is where you go when you want to be surrounded by laid-back, unpretentious, easy-going people, who are all there for the same reason you are: to have a good time.  I've been a couple of times and one of these times a game was on. Everyone was rowdy and fun!   We didn't go there to eat as much as we did to have snacks. We split the nachos and ordered a few bevvies. I'll be honest, the food isn't anything to write home about, but it's the atmosphere that will bring me back.  It's just a chillin' place to hang out when you're just not up for the dance club/meat-market scene downtown."}
{"text":"Its usually my local I would go for dinner during the week there the odd time but I went on a Saturday afternoon place was really dirty with mashed food into the floor dirty cutlery on the floor had to ask to wipe the table down server didn't seem to mind it whatsoever or apologetic  ordered a ice water and seems to have some yellow floaties in the glass (will attach photo when i log on my phone)  told server just got me another one no apologies nothing,  after a shockingly 55 minute wait for food (the server came over abour 40 minutes in explaining its on the way) food was only average which was shocking for the usualy service and food but i think my stomach was quite turned after i saw the dirty water and tables and floors  very disappointing and i brought an Irish relative from out of town who also wasn't happy with food or service, unfortunately wont be going back again"}
{"text":"We used to come here all the time about 6 months ago and it was great. I used to recommend Kilkenny to my friends who would come to town looking for a good pub experience with above average pub food. Used to. Recently, this place has been garbage. Overcooked steaks that take ages to be replaced, incorrect sides being served, lacklustre service, and an overall crappier menu. And this isn't just from our most recent visit, this has been the standard experience at Kilkenny for a while now. I was curious what might have spurred this so I asked our waitress last time what changed. Apparently they changed the head chef, and it's my best guess that the new guy is the spawn of two tasteless bridge trolls who also happen to be brother and sister.  Or something. I'm not quite sure. But either way he's awful at his job. Bring the old chef back and maybe I'll give you the stars this place used to deserve."}
{"text":"I am one of its regulars and have been for some time.  There is just something that keeps me coming back to this place.  I think it has something to do with the atmosphere that they have set up.  It really feels like a community hub just like the old public houses back in Ireland.  It is authentic & genuine; it feels warm and inviting just like your own living room.  There are couple of corners that have fireplaces and other spaces that can be booked for just about any size of group.  There is a TV everywhere you look and a massive TV in the back, which is likely the biggest in the NW.  At the front bar there is a gallery of TVs usually always playing a different game so you never miss a game; this is how I would set up a man-cave.  I have nothing but praise for the place.  I don't even live in the area anymore but I still go out of my way to to get there as do many of the regulars that frequent the venue.  Some come as far as Tuscany and Point McKay just to meet up with friends and share a pint.  I think that says something about the atmosphere that this bar creates.  The food menu keeps getting better and better.  They have some Irish staples, which most Irish pubs don't, which are great but they are moving away from that.  They now have an All-Day Breakfast - who does not like that?  Add that to the Steak Sandwich special over the lunch hour every week day - how can you go wrong with that?  Mondays are good for wings, Tuesday is tacos, Wednesday is burgers and Thursday is steak and wine.  Sunday has a good buffet, maybe one of the only buffets in the NW, with a few theme items that change from week to week as well as a roast beef and omelette station.  Happy Hour from 2-6PM (4-6PM on weekends) is great too."}
{"text":"The food is excellent, especially the breakfast menu. The food and decor really make it feel like your in Ireland, which I think is a fun idea. It's something new and fun. The service however is terrible. The last time I was there, it was lunch and there were only maybe 6 tables busy, and 2 servers going. Seems rather under staffed to me. It still took forever for service. I also think it would be worth it to get some bigger stools and booths."}
{"text":"The wings are so tasty. (Try their wings on Monday) Their Sunday brunch buffet is absolutely beyond the expectation. You will enjoy great food without limitation. Oh, I almost forgot to tell you about their apple pie. They start to bake it when you order it. I can't put it in a word... Amazing!!"}
{"text":"Had the fish and chips.  Large portions.  TVs are way too loud in here.  I mean, come on, you don't need the volume on, or at least not that high.  One of the great things about being in Canada during this time is the hockey playoffs.  I love it.  There's hockey everywhere.  I'll get home and maybe get to watch the Blackhawks at best.  We had a nice waitress here - from Sweden, in country only 2 months.  These guys also have a \"Crafty\" beer selection.  They list Alexander Keith's as a PALE ALE, though.  Ha!  Change your name!  Keith's is not an IPA!  Had the Maple Cream Ale from \"Gas Lamp\".  This is not a real brewery.  It's something else.  I'm thinking Granville Island Kitsilano Maple Cream.  It was decent.  Lots of maple.  Had the Rustic Red as well.  Meh.  An okay place.  Too loud, though."}
{"text":"Food: 2/5 Atmosphere: 3/5 Service: 2.5/5 Overall experience: 2/5  (1- Terrible; 3- decent; 5- Fantastic)  Most students from the University or those living in the area probably already been or heard of Kilkenny. I've been here a few times for their wings and dry ribs night and overall Kilkenny's is not the greatest pub to go to. I actually prefer Jamesons right across the street which has a better atmosphere, service and food. I don't really like drinking here because it's pretty expensive for a pint - about $7 for domestic; $8 for import and the bottled beer start at $5.50 for domestic and $7 for import. Their selection is limited and some of their beers don't taste very good. I sometimes feel ripped off. On top of that, their food is dreadful!  Kilks as I like to call it is a pretty big pub with a lot of uncomfortable seats and booths in the front and tucked away in the back. The decor is of an Irish pub, but can be quite dark and loud with a full house. The service sucks, as most of the waitresses don't really care about you and on a busy night it can be extremely slow.  Their wings are very small, cold and dried out especially when it's busy during wings night on Monday. I do however, enjoy their selection of 17 different flavours. Their dry rib special is on Wednesday (3 cents a rib, minimum 10 and maximum 25 with a drink). They are dry, and tough to eat with very little meat on the bone. Guess that's what you get for 3 cents.   The rest of their menu isn't so great either. They have a lot of traditional Irish pub food, burgers, pizzas, and sandwiches. I once ordered their lamb and guinness chedder burger ($14.50) with a side of salad that I didn't enjoy very much. The patty was extremely small compared to the bun and they grilled the burger too much that it tasted burnt. compared to other pubs, this is quite expensive for the quality you are getting.  Overall, Kilkenny's is not the place to go and I would recommend you hop on over to Jamesons!"}
{"text":"Pub dining is an oxymoron.  Kilkenny's does it as well as any pub in Calgary that I know, but the standard of pub food is pretty low in this city.  Rated as a pub it fares much better.  Actually, It's a sports bar in Irish pub disguise. Numerous big tv's and that relentless stream of blah blah pop music.  They do pour a nice Guiness, and for that just about anything can be overlooked.  No complaints with Kilkenny's, just with the current state of the art for pubs and pub food in Calgary ."}
{"text":"This review is for the Sunday Brunch only...  My (senior citizen) mom, 9 year old, my sister and I went there for brunch today. It's been a few years since I've been there at all, and the brunch has definitely gone downhill.  Initially we got seated in the bar, and after about. 10minutes a second person came along and informed us there were no minors in the bar. Not a problem - in fact we wanted to sit closer to the buffet. Yet, odd that we were seated there first. We were all settled in, and had to move.  The brunch is small. Eggs Benedict (meh), hash browns (good), waffles (has definitely been sitting there a while/hard), bacon (of course the bacon was good!), an omelette station (good but slow), and sausage and scrambled eggs.  Lunch items were a jalapeño Mac and cheese, an Irish stew, and a shepherds pie. All looked ok, but over warmed - didn't try. There was a roast beef at the omelette station too.   They had the usual pickles, cold meats, buns, cheese cubes, cut fruit and veggies that most buffets/salad bars have. Cheese was dried out, so we're the veggies. It was all just \"ok\". They had two salads - both with dairy in them. It was hard for our lactose intolerant family to enjoy.  Dessert is always the high point for the kid. It was disappointing for all of us. Hardly anything, and what was there was picked over. Stale brownies, a few tarts, a bread pudding, I saw chocolate covered strawberries, but there was only one left.  Lastly - beverages. Coffee is not included with the brunch price (seriously?!). The brunch is advertised as kid friendly, but they had no - apple juice, lemonade, milk, or chocolate milk. The kid was super bummed.  It was a cheaper brunch for $17.99, but I wasn't impressed. Service was slow and disorganized too. I won't head back for brunch."}
{"text":"It's huge. Massive. Big. Did I mention huge?   The first time I went on a Sunday afternoon it was very empty.. the food and drinks are your standard pub food. Nothing to fancy or great, butttt the desserts.. the chocolate mudpie (?) suppper good and is a great value!   When visiting on a Monday night I understood why this place is massive.. it's down the street from the uni and well students and cheap food (Monday night is wings night) go hand in hand. I think the \"Kilk\" (Kilk is the cool co-ed term) must serve at least 20% of the student body from the U of C on a Monday night.   If you're looking for a rowdy place to catch the game, or stalk out university co-eds this is the place to be on a Monday night. If  you're looking for a quiet place on a Monday.. search else where.     tonnnnnnnnnns of TVs for Monday night football - best seats are in the \"pit\"   tips: tough finding parking on a Monday night, and unless you're walking with a cane bring your ID."}
{"text":"I have come here on occasion, this visit was, it's the sponsored pub for our soccer league. Which is awesome they do it, and our team gets good deals.   The reason I'm giving a meh review is the service. SO BAD! I know it's a huge place, but there was maybe a dozen tables full.   I asked what they had for gluten free beers and she listed off the four and then said Budweiser. I just said ok ok, I'll go Bards. Now being a celiac I have heard the Bud debate, but after a lot of research I have never seen a definite answer either way, so it's pretty bad to be telling celiacs that they can drink this beer, when it hasn't been answered.   My team got the wings, which I can't have, so I got potatoe skins to go with my beer. Which were ok, I've had better.   I'm sure I will be back, but it's not in my fave pub list."}
{"text":"Love this NW pub!  Sunday Brunch always includes lots of frush fruit, opportunity to build an omlette, and of course lots of Bacon!!  Daily specials are great - personally enjoy the 2-bite Yorshires.  Recently tried the Yorkshire Tidbit - the beef & gravy are divine.  Almost impossible to finish if you start off with a bowl of the Potatoe Soup.  Parking lot may look full, but don't leave without checking - this place can handle alot of people!!  You won't be sorry, and I expect you will return!"}
{"text":"Good pub menu. Food is good. Service is great. Nice homey atmosphere, not too noisy- so a good place to have a burger and brew with a friend or friends. There is one thing that bothers me though. For many decades now, servers have been required to pay the house a percentage of their total sales. This money goes to the other service people who don't make tips, and more and more lately to subsidize the kitchen payroll. This is wrong. The wait staff shouldn't be required to subsidize the house's payroll. What really shocks me is that these \"tip outs\" have increased in order to subsidize the increase in minimum wages. That is totally wrong. So I make a habit of asking my server what the \"tip out\" (read forced payment to the house) is. I was shocked when I was told that at Kilkenny's, (and every other pub in this chain); are required to pay the house a full 10% of their sales! THIS IS NOTHING BUT ROBBERY!! So if on a decent night when the sales maybe $2,000; the wait staff are required to pay the house $200!! For this reason, I am boycotting this chain."}
{"text":"Large healthy tasty servings.  First time and I was nicely surprised.  The appies are large so order accordingly.  Those with me found the steak sandwich was excellent."}
{"text":"Service was good, and we didn't have to fight for a table even after a stampeders game. Had the pork belly Mac and cheese, which was really great. I would definitely recommend it if you come here."}
{"text":"Just tried the Quebec poutine, soggy fries, soaked in gravy covered in chewy cheese  Not a good example"}
{"text":"I got Thursday special, steak for only 11$. It was tasty and compared to the price a good deal! The good think about it is that you don't have to buy a drink! Great service, a friendly waitress. It was my first time and I'd definitely go again in the commig month."}
{"text":"This is the go-to pub for after work drinks with colleagues.  The place is larger than you initially think with plenty of room in the back. Parking can be a little bit of a challenge though. Plenty of beer choices, decent food assortment and they run regular specials on things like meatballs!  Good place to unwind, service has been good, you can seat yourself."}
{"text":"Excited to try this pub, every pub has their own atmosphere and this one so far was awesome! The whole wooden floor tables and fake fire pit was acceptable. Servers wearing kilts is very attracting, let's be honest. Fairly open spaces with tv's everywhere so you don't miss the game shows and etc. Parking space is sufficient enough and people appear to be friendly. Their beers are uniquely tasteful with smooth taste that is not harsh. The music is standard beats which is great to keep with the times. Showcases of old Irish antique dishes made it feel home-like. The food is quite pricey. Ordered the fish n chips for Friday deal and it was delicious, I'd definitely come back again with friends. Washrooms are fairly well maintained.  Recommended for the beer lovers and obviously good company of friends."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. A - List for the drinks and the atmosphere. A to B List for the food. B List for the service. Great place to have a drink and visit with friends. Older to mixed crowd, in general, through the day and early evening. The younger crowd takes over into the night - gets loud and annoying, although it appears most around don't mind. Food is good and varies from familiar to very good. Great ambiance. Service is adequate to marginally adequate, not spectacular or overly friendly, sometimes hard to track down the help (note to management - get more staff; most don't seem to care or mind or know what good service is...no matter... Go for the Friday afternoon kick off to the weekend or to watch a sports event. Interesting place."}
{"text":"I had high hopes for the Kilkenny since it was recommended by some friends as a good place to go with a group. There were 6 of us, and 4 people arrived and secured a table and ordered drinks while my boyfriend and I parked the car. We ordered drinks for ourselves when the server brought the drinks for the other 4. Drinks took quite a while, but where this place fell apart was the food service. For some reason the first 4's food arrived 15-20 minutes before the food for my boyfriend and I despite us all ordering food at the same time. I ordered the shrimp avocado wrap and it was about 60% mayo. And not good mayo. The drippy, bland, disgusting mayo. I didn't finish it, and our server never came by to ask how it was. One of the couples in our group wanted to pay and head out, and the server brought the check and asked if they would need a machine and they said yes. They even confirmed they would pay her and not pay at the bar, and she said she'd be right back with the machine.   She never came back. Eventually, about 20 minutes later, she reappeared by the front door and they went up and paid her at the hostess table. They asked her for the rest of our bills, and she brought the other bills back to us but didn't comment on my almost full plate of full, or asked anyone else how their meals were. Our receipt says our servers name was Billie, and she definitely left a lot to be desired. I'd give 0 stars if that was possible."}
{"text":"Kilkenny's is essentially Melrose with more wood and less gelled up Jersey Shore extras.  As a person of Celtic persuasion born and bred (IE, not born in Canada) the 'Irish theme pub' has been done to death in the UK and EU. Anyone opens an 'Irish' pub there now, be prepared to be laughed out of business.  It isnt 'different' it's generic. The pub only vaguely resembles classic English, Scottish, Welsh or hell, even Irish pubs. I've been all over Eire, and the pubs there don't look like that.  We don't use those silly nosebleed high round tables with teetering, uncomfy stools. It's BOOTHS people! The bar design is wrong. Too many chairs at the bar. No neon is normally present.  And, of course, it isn't a bar in Calgary seemingly, unless it resembles a branch of Future Shop. I swear most of the lighting was provided by blindingly bright TV's showing (what else), hockey. (yawn).   Perhaps 6 of them above the bar. Another to the right by the door. Oh, and heres the best part, apparently, signs crowing about the fact that they have an 80 inch Sharp Quattron TV!  Woopdeedo.  The more TV's a bar has, the less attention people pay to each other. You know? Those living, breathing bags of water you came in with? Those images on that idiot lantern you are slack jawingly gawping at over your human companions shoulder, are not your friends.  Oddly, the James Joyce 'Irish' pub is part of the same ownership, however the one on 4th st sw as far as I recall, has no TV's, and the Guinness is cheaper. Here I was charged an eye watering $8.95  One saving grace, they had at least one Granville Island beer on tap, which, although isn't the last word in taste and finish (There's always London Pride or Marston's Pedigree for that) at least is a beer that tastes and finishes like beer.  Otherwise, unremarkable. Nothing to see here."}
{"text":"A good, reliable place for pub grub. I had two interesting experiences here with my two visits.  The first time we went New Years Day and they were running this great special of a pub burger (bacon, lettuce, etc) for 2.50!! (Usually 13.95) And craft beers for $5.00 (usually 6.50) We all ordered burgers and I ordered poutine for the table. The poutine was delicious! And the burgers were great for the price. For 13.95 I would say the burgers should definitely be fresher... You could tell the were frozen patties. But for such a great deal, we were all happy! Great beer selection and good environment! The second time we went a few of us actually had to leave because they didn't have Canadian issued IDs, they all had US IDs and all looked definitely over 18. The only one that looked close to 18 had a Canadian ID. While the boys left to get their passports we ordered beer.  It put a damper on the visit, especially because we had bought alcohol several other places with our US IDs.. But it's understandable and we stayed.  The great part is that at the end of the night, when the server brought us the bill, she put our whole first round (for everyone, not just the guys that had to leave) on the house. It was a great gesture that we weren't expecting. It shows that they value their customers.   As for food, I split the steak sandwich.. It was cooked medium rare and actually was medium rare, the steak was pretty tough though but taste wise it wasn't bad.   All in all it seems like this place values it's customers, has a great atmosphere, and decent pub grub. I would definitely return. Oh also great beer selection!"}
{"text":"Been here several times. It is a big pub and yet sometimes it is full, so you can tell it is popular. This is part of the \"Calgary's Best Pubs\". Good atmosphere with good variety of beers. They have daily deals like Wing Mondays, Taco Tuesdays, Fish & Chip Fridays. Overall is a good pub to visit."}
{"text":"It was a nice peaceful lunch at the Kilk today, not too many clients but just enough to set a bar ambiance.  This bar is gorgeous, great architecture and done up like a nice ol' Irish pub except for 6 plasma televisions spewing Olympic coverage.  The service was great, our waitress looked kind of like Meg Ryan, and I mean how does she find the time? I ordered the lamb burger with yam fries and my friend ordered a burrito.  I have to confess folks, this was one of the best burgers I have had in a long time, it had caramelized onion and I believe goat cheese.  I was so happy and so was my friend.  We decided to celebrate our happiness with the chocolate mud pie.  Which again was huge and so delish!  I really like this space, Meg was super friendly and we took our time, while the bar cleared out.  The sun was shining and the it's a holiday feeling prevailed.  I heard they have like 4.99 breakfasts here, and even thought the Kilk is about a 15 minute drive from my house, I still would come here and try it out."}
{"text":"Came here on a Wednesday night with my team after playing our final basketball game of the season.  We sat ourselves since nobody was around to serve us.  The daily feature was a $6 Royale (burger) with cheese and fries and I chose that as my order.  It wasn't packed but it was fairly busy, not sure if they were short staffed but it was a long time before somebody came to take our orders.  Half of the table's food came and then the other half came about 15 minutes after.  The burger was a really good value for just $6, in hindsight adding onions and mushrooms would've made it even better ($0.50 each).  My fries were fine but the second batch that came with the latter order was too salty.    We're all ready to go, except our waitress hasn't come check on us at all since we got our food.  After a long wait, we managed to attract her attention and got the bill.  After an even longer wait, she came back with the machine.  By then we were trying to decide what to tip at all since the service was hor-awful.  Overall, the service sucked.  Food was mediocre, but a good value.  They were doing construction, so half the parking lot was fenced off which made parking a PITA."}
{"text":"If you've ever lived in the NW, surely you've been to The Kilkenny. The standard North American Irish pub in the neighbourhood, the place is always busy.  The pub is big, with a front and a back section and ample seating. The food's as good as any pub in Calgary, although they do a mean mushroom soup.  Good food, good service, if you've been to a typical Irish pub before, you'll know what to expect here."}
{"text":"Ahhh, my old watering hole.  I've spent many a happy, sad, disgruntled, joyous and casual evening at Kilkenny; usually on dry rib or wing nights.  The fact of the matter is this: If you go on a busy night hoping for amazing service, you probably will be let down. This place gets packed out and the servers can be extremely hit/miss. I have a terrible habit of sitting in the sections with the \"miss\" category, but I've been here more than a few times and been treated like the royal prince of saucy chicken extremities.   Anyways, the wing quality can sometimes vary from night to night, but typically you're in store for some really saucy, usually very hot wings. Yes, sometimes this gets screwed up too. But I'll look past it, because, HECK, Schooners are cheap and I like beer a whole lot.  Is this place perfect? No way. Not even close. But if you go and keep going, you'll find you and Kilkenny form a special bond. Are the booths plush and comforting? No. You're in an Irish Pub, not a friggin' spa. Get over it. Sit on your stool and drink like a MAN.   Are they going to bring you moist towelettes and prop your feet up for you? No. But on the best of nights, they'll bring your drinks promptly and give you service with a smile (even when they're stressed out and trying to bus tables for hundreds of hungry patrons who all want things done yesterday).   I guess you're wondering, \"why 4 stars? You said the quality of the food varies and the service can be mediocre!?\"  Well, the memories, I suppose. When Kilkenny gets it right, they get it really right. Enough so that I'll look past any of their wrongs.  Cue me up a schooner, bar wenches. I'm on my way."}
{"text":"Okay so I had one of those \"Waaaaaaaaahhh I'm so fat\" days so I decided not to eat any junk food for a whole week (if you know me, this is extremely tough for me).  I went Monday and Tuesday clean....feelin' so fresh.  Wednesday came along and I was doing pretty well....that is.....until my sister asked me if I wanted to joined her and her fiancé for dinner somewhere *SABOTAGE!!* -_-  Of course it isn't hard to twist my arm so I was totally down for it.  We all wanted something inexpensive, 'healthy' and tasty BUT that didn't go through as I wanted some pub food :) hehehehe.  Kilkenny is nearby so we decided to make the stop.  Kilkenny is located on Brentwood Road NW.  It's actually kind of hidden (depending on which way you come) but for me, its behind First Calgary Financial/Liquor Depot and beside Karma hair salon.  There is also a ton of parking!!  I've visited Kilkenny before when I was a young lass but I'm just reviewing this place now.  We entered and walked around to look for open tables.  It was pretty busy for a Wednesday night because of their 5 cent ribs and 5 cent meatballs deal.  We found a high top table and our waitress came by.  Kenny ordered a grasshopper while Dani and I just stuck with water.  I decided to go with the clubhouse with onion rings, Dani went with the Shrimp avocado wrap with season veggies and Kenny went with the special, honey garlic ribs and satay peanut meatballs.  FYI: You have to order a beverage in order to get the special.  Also, the ribs only come in 10s and the meatballs come in 20s.  While we waited for food, we chatted and noticed there are a bunch of TVs.  There was different stuff playing on each TV.  Womens MMA, Hockey, Baseball.... a good variety if you wanted to watch a sporting event with some buddies.  Anyway, we continued to wait and wait and wait.  Kenny was pretty much done his beer when the food finally came out.  My clubhouse was cut into quarters with a skewer going through all of the pieces...I thought it was very unnecessary and annoying as I was really hungry and I didn't want to be messing with the skewer but just dive right in.  I found the sandwich unsatisfying...I had wished the turkey wasn't processed but I guess that's what I get for assuming it wasn't going to be.  The onion rings were delightful, a good onion to batter ratio.  Dani enjoyed her wrap but the seasoned veggies were just frozen vegetables just heated up. Kenny enjoyed the ribs but the meatballs seemed bland.  I don't think the peanut satay was a good choice.  We all wondered if it was actually real meat as the 20 meatballs were only 1$.....probably not. haha   All in all, service was lacking, food was meh and  unfortunately, our experience wasn't the best.  I do understand they were busy but it just seemed like a very long wait and if the wait is long, I expect the food to be fantastic but this wasn't the case.  I must say that Kilkenny is popular on weekdays because of their inexpensive specials.  I do enjoy wing night."}
{"text":"We think this is an excellent local pub. It has been around for years, and although the service can be spotty sometimes, you just need to remind yourself it is a pub.  The servers generally work hard, and when your food is ready to come out, someone gets it to you while it is still hot. We live the special on the mussels, the burgers, and etc. The fish and chips are generally very good, and indeed most things. The draft beer is fresh, and the mixed drinks are generous.  Good place to watch sports, and to go as a group.  Not sure I would recommend it for folks with kids. Which for some of us is a good thing.  All in all, it's hard to go wrong here."}
{"text":"The Kilkenny is a great Irish pub, with good food and even better people.  It's a great place to spend some time any time of the day; lunch, dinner, drinks.  It's a nice place loosen up and chill out.  I love heading to Kilkenny around the lunch hour because they make the best veggie wrap!  It's a very simple dish, but not many restaurants make them right.  Kilkenny, on the other hand, is not one of those places.  They know what should go in a veggie wrap and that makes me happy.  Along with your main dish you get to choose a side.  I've never been disappointed by any of their sides.  They have a delicious assortment of salads and soups; my favourite is the wild mushroom.  Food aside, they have so many beers to choose from that I have a hard time making up my mind.  Each day of the week has something different to offer as a special, both food and drink.  Monday's are wing nights with Schooner's for cheap, Wednesday is rib night with Sleeman's on special and Friday is Yorkshire tid-bits and Molson until 8.  Kilkenny is a fantastic place for large groups of people to go since they have a ton of seating, both booth and tables.  This place can get pretty busy when the Flames are playing, or during a UFC fight, but it's always good times with good people.  Sláinte!"}
{"text":"I'm not really into the pub scene but at least once a year I do end up in one with a group of people who want to go.    As far as pubs go, it's a really nice one, typical mahogany woodwork, plenty of seating, courteous wait staff, lots of big screen TV's, huge drink selections and a fairly decent menu offerings.  As far as the wings are concerned, they were pretty awful.  Like some of the worst I've had in a while, could it have been an off night? Possibly.  My companions had the fish tacos and they said they were pretty delish but the Philly cheesesteak was a grease-fest, we shared the potato skins and they were ok and could have been seasoned a bit better.  On a positive note, our waitress was a sweetheart who was on the ball all night.  Place was pretty packed as it was a Saturday night and the crowd was mostly the 20 year old college/university kids.  Parking near the pub was very full as the plaza itself had another one near by so be prepared to walk.  If you are into the pub scene, this place is pretty nice."}
{"text":"I have been here many times and it's been OK. My partner and I are Vegan so we always look for foods we are able to eat at regular places.  In the past we have ordered the Malibu Garden burger. Told the server we are Vegan and didnt want any mayo or cheese or meat or egg and is this burger ok?  She went off to find that yes indeed the patty is Vegan !! Joy!!  Skip forward many visits...same burger order, different server. Manager comes out and tells us that the bun they use and have used this whole time is NOT vegan...and to use the Glutenfree one which is. Grateful she let us know, angry that we had eaten at least 4 times in past a bun with eggs in it!! Gluten bun was nasty nasty so now this option is no longer viable  Went there last night with the office. Ordered a Poached pear salad with no goat cheese..told they were out. Nothing left but fries and pickled spears...  Ordered the fries WITHOUT gravy and Ranch as I don't want or need it.  We all sat for almost an hour waiting for our food...there were 6 of us.  My fries come with gravy and ranch, to which I am told, \" don't worry it's free!\" That isn't the point is it? It is a waste and it gets tossed!!  My fries were all the little ends..no long fries, and I could easily see that my co-worker's were long.  And as a bonus, my fries all tasted like FISH.  Only redeeming part of this meal was my Bulldog!! Can't mess that up!  Drinks only there from now on!"}
