{"text":"Great and fantastic pizza... dirty place with not so friendly staff. Sometimes afraid to walk in there. Delicious pizza though!"}
{"text":"Love their pizza here. They have some sort of spice in the pizza that makes it so incredibly delicious! Also great is the fact that their special from Monday to Wednesday is cheap! I know most might be turned down by the appearance of the place but the food really is worth it. I used to go to this place since high school when I lived in NDG for slices and now even though I live in LaSalle I make the drive to get take out from this place, that's how good the pizza is here. My favorite is the pepperoni pizza. I highly recommend this place to any pizza lover, If you are visiting Montreal this is definitely a great place to try!"}
{"text":"Look. The place isnt clean. The bathroom is a nightmare. But it has a charn that maybe only people who live around here can appreciate.  I love the pizza personally."}
{"text":"My father and I went there two summers ago to grab pizza and fries as we were waiting for our meal someone of the staff was cleaning the floor a couple of moments later we got our meal we sat down to eat I turned my head to see if they had ketchup and I saw the same guy with the same broom clean the counter were they chop the vegetables and handle the food before my dad took a bite of his fries I stopped him and told him what I saw and we ask for our money back and never went there again"}
{"text":"The bright neon lights are great for accent the dirty floor and walls that haven't been painted in 20 years. This place has a certain charm, great pizza, friendly service... It's the local dive that locals really love."}
