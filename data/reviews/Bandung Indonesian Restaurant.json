{"text":"I've eaten here about 7 times and the food is always great.  The ambience is very pleasant too.  I've been to Indonesia (and even Bandung) and when I get a hankerin' for Indonesian, this is the only place in town, and probably the only place in the midwest out of Chicago.  We're fortunate to have such a variety of ethnic places in Madison.  Support your locally owned restaurants!    If you're not getting enough fish in your diet, they have some delicious and creative dishes. And, if you've never tried Indonesian/Malay food, give it a shot.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"First time to Indonesian food, interesting experience, food is ok, nothing too surprising"}
{"text":"Some of the reviewers here seem to think that the staff was putting on airs, but I found them to be friendly and helpful.   Our waitress wasn't checking in on us every two minutes like at some places, but that's the way I prefer it so I have no quibble.     The food was excellent all around, and there are ample vegetarian options.   The red curry squash was excellent.  The atmosphere is very relaxed and quiet, though it may have simply been that I tend to go after the dinner rush."}
{"text":"Delicious vegetarian options that will nonetheless satisfy a non-veggie. Proximity to A Woman's Touch makes it the ideal place to stop in for crab cakes after a vibrator purchase."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is one of my favorites. I usually don't write reviews, but Bandung has exceptional food at reasonable prices. I love them for their take-out as well as dining in. An extra bonus- they always pack up doggie bags for leftovers (or take-out) beautifully with extra rice."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch on Thursday afternoon. It was quite empty, but that didn't take away from the excellent food, drink and service Bandung provided. The friendly server suggested I try their Nutty Coconut drink (I can't remember the exact name) and boy was it delicious! It was made with seemingly fresh coconut milk with pieces of coconut on top. For lunch I ordered the Mega Sate, which was spiced well and was more than enough food for such a great price. It even came with an appetizer (I chose the coconut veggie soup - also great).  To top it all off, I was able to pay for my order in Bitcoin. Transaction went quickly and smoothly.  Will be returning!"}
{"text":"Bandung is one of the best Asian food services in Madison. Their preparations are well made and have a more authentic flavor than other Asian restaurants. It's better food quality than an average Asian restaurants and has a different taste altogether."}
{"text":"I came here for the first time with my partner last Saturday and we were extremely excited to try this place. Unfortunately, we did not get to actually try anything on the menu (hence the 1 star). We walked in and we're seated right away, as it was not busy at all. We started looking over the menus and as we were doing so, we noticed no one had come to ask us if we wanted any drinks. We finally decided on our drinks, appetizer, and entrees. Still, after roughly 7 minutes, no one had approached us. There were waitresses helping every table around us, but no one said a word to us for some reason. After 10 minutes, I started to make eye contact with the employees in case they forgot that they had seated us  (though I'm not sure how that could happen, as all 3 tables adjacent to us were being served), and still no one came. We decided to give them 5 more minutes. After 15 minutes of sitting with menus, no one approached us or said a word to us still. We decided that was enough time for at least one person on a not-so-busy night to help us, so we got up and left.  Needless to say it was a very disappointing experience considering how excited we were for this."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery. My food wasn't really warm when it arrived. I ordered the Red Curry Squash, which almost had no squash in it and was basically just bamboo. Overall it was ok, but for the price you can definitely get better food somewhere else."}
{"text":"Do stop in and eat if you get the chance.   Bandung is not much to look at outside, especially compared to some of the unique store fronts on Willy Street...but once my fiance and I sat down on the patio and had a glance at the menu, it surely didn't matter.  We dined on a Sunday evening, an evening when Bandung has a SUPER cheap menu of eats. Dishes are $5 and can satisfy a woman with a moderate appetite. He was still hungry with one of the $5 dishes and some kebabs. I'm guessing the $5 plates were likely a tad smaller than their regular dishes. We shared the Kebabs, an Ayam, Sapi, and Tempe, and oh my GOSH the sauce was amazing!  Much to our delight, the same sauce was drizzled over the Gado Gado, which we both ordered, as $5 plates on the patio. Steamed vegetables, tofu, and egg, with the delicious peanut sauce. MMMM.   I'm now googling Indonesian food to make at home."}
{"text":"Although I've eaten there a handful of times, Bandung is my go-to take out place. There are deals you can get by ordering online, and we usually order some combination of Pad Thai, Red Curry Squash, Opor Ayam, and Lumpia for our appetizer. Other favories include Galai Kambing,Sambal Goreng Ketang, Bihun Kari, and Asse Cabe. Our only complaint about the take out is that they never give you enough rice -- one big spoonful (probably about 1/2 cup) per entree. My husband loves rice so we always have to make more at home.   Although we order from there all the time, it is worth going there and checking it out.  They have EXCELLENT drinks. They also have clearly been working on revamping the bar area, introducing some bar food specials, etc. One time I played trivia there and it was pretty good except there wasn't really enough seating.   All in all Bandung is a unique place and a unique eating experience. In my opinion, their Pad Thai is the best in town -- and that's saying something!"}
{"text":"I have wanted to check out Bandung for a long time, because I love the tempeh they serve at Monty's blue plate diner and they get it from Bandung... So we ordered a lot of food, most of which contained tempeh!  First off, beer. Not a huge selection from what I saw, but If you are a fan of Magic Hat, they have 2 bottles here that are good and are the same price as their New Glarus, $4. I thought that was a good deal so I went with their Circus Boy heffeweizen. My bf had the Sprecher Abbey but then later had this sweet potato ale which was pretty unusual! He hated it, actually but I didn't. When first poured and still having a head on top, it was soapy tasting! He thought it tasted soapy, period end of story. But to me, the soapy factor went away when it sat for a few minutes and was paired with the mango curry dish. It really tasted like sweet potato pie, kind of heavy on the nutmeg and cinnamon, but it was a perfect compliment to the sweet, creamy mango curry.   For an appetizer we ordered tempeh sate skewers and they were the best part of the meal for me, and the only thing that wasn't spicy! Really delicious peanut sauce on these thick cubes of savory tempeh. We ordered more to take home with us, and writing this makes me think I should go eat them right now! Yum! This is the thing that will have me coming back to Bandung again, and the main reason for the 4-star rating.  For entrees we ordered the mango curry (which I really liked and would order again), the pad rum mit with tempeh which was really spicy, despite asking for it mild (I would hate to see what it would have been like had I not asked for mild, but I ain't mad at ya, this is just how Indonesia eats and I know I am a wuss) but was otherwise pretty smokey tasting and good, and a fried rice dish called nasi goreng which was tasty, though not impressive or special and also spicier than I was expecting. Basically, if you don't like spicy food don't come here for anything but the tempe sate. And if you do like spicy, this place is pretty fantastic!  The waiter was extremely friendly and jovial, but seemed a little spacey or something. Like they were busy, so I don't blame the guy, but he was inattentive at times when he was right there and empty handed and really shouldn't have been. But really, his niceness made up for it and the fact that I asked a couple questions that he didn't know answers to and he was very nice about going to ask questions of the kitchen even though he was busy.  The entrees took a pretty long time to come out, but again they were pretty busy. Though no more busy than Halong Bay usually is that time of night, and it took probably almost twice as long as my food usually takes at Halong Bay.  I liked the color scheme and the paintings, as well."}
{"text":"Far, far too expensive. The food is good, I don't want to mislead you; but at roughly $13 per plate for smallish portions it is incredibly overpriced. Had the martabak (deep fried ground beef and chive pastry) which was delicious. Very crispy exterior with lots of flavor inside.   The sambal goreng udang was in no way spicy as sambal ought to be, but rather very sweet. The taste was good, just not what was advertised.   Lumpia are ok and service is friendly, but I felt that the price was too high for the quality and quantity. If money is no object, I'd be here a lot, it's just too hard to justify coming here more than for special occasions."}
{"text":"Great food, incredibly egotistical chef/owner. Here's a tip; if it is \"inconveinent\" to deliver across the lake, don't include that region in your delivery zone. Do not, instead, cancel an online order without talking to the customer first. And especially do not fail to cancel the order, thereby keeping both the customers money and the food. And finally, when the customer arrives to pick up their food, do not cower in the kitchen like a three year old. Man up and take responsibility for your incredibly poor customer service.  Great food, cowardly owner.  Don't order delivery unless you're downtown. Not worth the hassle."}
{"text":"Not to impressed at all....food was not tasty....too salty, and egg rolls had a strange flavor, like the oil wasn't   good?  Won't go again."}
{"text":"The indo mac and cheese (no cheese added) is very good. If you can get one made, the jalapeño margarita is absolutely awesome!"}
{"text":"This place has some truly fantastic dishes to offer! I highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys big flavors. All the apps. are great. My faves are the Tahu Isi (stuffed tofu), and Martabak Telor (mix of beef and green onion,wrapped in filo-esque dough and deep fried). Everyone will be happy if you go here,vegetarian,or non. Really nice bar now too! Great speciality drinks. Have a great meal, and then follow it up with a cocktail next door. This is a great way to spend an evening,as I have done, many times. GGGGGGreat place to take a date!"}
{"text":"I've now order take out a couple of times from here and GUESS WHAT? They will send you coupons if you order online! What?! BTW, the Indo mac and cheese is amazing."}
{"text":"Tasty food and tasty cocktails. Cocktailwise, of particular note, is the motor oil and the vegetable oil, although the indotini and nutty ginger were also good. Food was quite good although I expected the rendang to be a bit spicier (and in fact the papaya dish was a bit spicier than expected).  Main problem was the 80 minute wait for our entrees. Staff stated that they had quite a bit of delivery and takeout orders that jammed up the kitchen. Would have thought the diners in the restaurant would take priority, but no denying the food was quite good when it arrived."}
{"text":"Haven't really been disappointed here, some really unique and interesting food. I wouldn't recommend the spring rolls, but the shrimp wrapped in wonton appetizer is awesome.  for entrees I stick with the osang osang or the Udang Goreng Mentega the spicy candle nut sauce on both of those is definitely sweet but great tasting."}
{"text":"Best authentic Indonesian food ever ! Everything on their menu is phenomenal and their take our tastes as good as their dine-in food. Love their tempe and nasi goreng."}
{"text":"It's too bad the food was decent because I will never go back go this place. The food took over an hour to come out, and while we were waiting, the waitress never even showed her face. When we got her attention, she told us that there was a big party, and that the kitchen was backed up. No apologies, no recourse. Afterwards, when someone in my party tried to complain to the manager in a very polite tone, he was thrown out! Someone, please open an Indonesian restaurant in Madison that isn't  by idiots and tools."}
{"text":"They were kind enough to seat our party of six even though they were closing in 30 minutes. Never rushed us and the food was delicious. Wish I lived closer so I could eat here more often."}
{"text":"Confession: I have been to Indonesia and had plenty of local Indonesian food. So my standards are high and my comments might not represent the masses.  First let's talk about the service. The waitresses were less than friendly/ professional. One of them interrupted my boyfriend when he was asking her a question. When I asked her what was in a particular dish, she said, \"exactly as it says on the menu: beef, onions, peppers, etc.\". I wondered if I looked blind or illiterate to her? Then when I asked her to heat up a soup dish because it was cold, she said \"well, it shouldn't be cold, because it just came off the stove\". I guess she either likes her soup cold, or she doesn't understand the difference between \"putting it on the stove\" and \"serving the soup after it boils\". It took her forever to take the soup back out to us. Shortly after we were done, she dropped the check on our table without saying anything. When we had to wait for change, she took so long we had to go up to the counter to ask for it.   Now let's talk about the food. Before I went to Bandung, I asked my Indonesian friend and my other friend who works there for suggestions. So naturally, I ordered the \"authentic\" and \"best dishes\" of the house: SATE KAMBING (marinated lamb skewers with rice cakes), RED CURRY SQUASH, and SOTO AYAM (lemon grass flavored broth with chicken breast, bean sprouts, green onion, egg and mung bean noodle).   Well, the Sate Kambing and Soto Ayam came out COLD, which they were NOT supposed to be. There was way too much sauce on the lamb, and the portion is very small for it's price ($12.95 for 6 tiny skewers). Also, the rice cake was very lumpy and mushy. I could barely tell that it was rice. The Soto Ayam was way too salty. Red curry squash was ok, but I could have had this dish at any Thai- or Asian-inspired restaurants. Meh.  This is one of the few situations when bad service coupled with worse-than-average food truly ruined my evening. I was very excited about going to an Indonesian restaurant and I went home completely unsatisfied and disappointed."}
{"text":"Love the food here, and I'm a big fan of their wine specials.  This is where we take our out of town guests, and one of my favorite restaurants in Madison."}
{"text":"Go for it.   Don't let the looks of this restaurant deceive you. They know what they are doing and they make sure that you are not disappointed.   I was on a vegeterean diet when I visited this place but to my plesant surprise they have a ton of veggy options. Eggplant curry is awesome. Portion size is just right. We were a group of about 10 and our unanimous opinion was Very tasty food with a neither not too less nor too much portion size.   Also they serve halaal lamb. They were very accomodating, may it be seating for a large group or cutting a Bday cake for my friend or extra rice of everyone on the table. I would recomend this to any one who like Thai style food. My friend ordered sizzling shrimp which he said was very good and it was literally sizzling for like 5 minutes."}
{"text":"I'm adding another star to my original review after I just experienced the vegetarian rijsttafel. We sampled over a dozen dishes and they were all fantanstic. It's a great deal for the city's best (if not, only) vegetarian feast! It's 24.95 for one person, $10 for another person to share OR you can opt to add a full sized entree for the regular price (about $12). We certainly didn't need the entree, but we happily took it home for lunch!"}
{"text":"We visited Madison last week (for the first time!) and wanted a fun food adventure. I'm vegetarian and my friend is off gluten. We found Bandung and called them when we were an hour out to make sure they would still serve us a half hour before closing time. When we got there, we were told that the kitchen had closed early due to some kind of unexpected event. (Not a big confidence builder.)  Next night for dinner we went to Monty's Blue Plate. The a/c was very cold (bad in my book), but we thought we would eat outside. I (\"the man\") was handed the only menu--not cool, even  in a retro way. The menu, which included the tempe from Bandung that we'd read about, didn't inspire us. Our greeter didn't feel welcoming either.   So off we went to Bandung. Voila! Warm welcome, outdoor seating, great service and great food. We were quickly given a small bowl of tempe \"chips,\" which were delicious. Our food came in good time. (I don't remember how long, so it didn't feel like we were waiting.) I had the Sampal Goreng Tempe.My friend had the catfish dish. My friend loved her catfish dish, though the raw veggies that came with it wouldn't have been her choice. Even so, she appreciated the balance of the lightness of the raw veggies with the heavier quality of the fish. My tempe dish was superb. The sauce was one I had never had. It was intense and needed the properly-cooked rice that came with to tone it down just a bit. It wasn't heat--it was a density of flavor. Wow! I found the eating adventure I was looking for. I savored every mouthful.  \"Tempe made fresh daily\" was a draw for me, and I wasn't disappointed. The tempe was delicious. This was the best tempe I've ever eaten! Next time we are in Madison, we will definitely make Bandung one of our stops."}
{"text":"My second time at this place and everything was delicious from appetizers to desert. The staff is very friendly and  knowledgable of the menu and ingredients in their dishes. Authentic Indonesian food...I am a fan, too bad I am not from the area, but if I ever return to madison in will return to this place."}
{"text":"The Pad Thai was described as the best in town: and it lived up to it, and for five dollars!  No beer on tap at the bar, which is strange, but they do have Rhinelander shorties which is pretty cool."}
{"text":"I've had almost everything on the menu and it is all so good. My favorite: pad thai. Im indonesian and this is honestly pad thai has came closest to my grandfathers cooking of all I've ever tasted."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place, but every time I order I end up disappointed. It's always too salty and overpowering in flavor.   This time I ordered Bopo chicken, which was described as, \"A healthy and delicious fire grilled boneless and skinless chicken breast on a bed of steamed vegetables topped with a ginger cilantro sauce.\"  There was max half a cup of vegetables, maybe only a fourth of a cup - definitely not a bed of them. That was extremely disappointing. I imagined a plethora of veggies but instead I got tiny pieces of cauliflower, mushrooms, broccoli, and onion.   The chicken tasted really salty, as if it was made from processed chicken and not fresh chicken. I can't eat too much without feeling a sodium overload.  It as not topped with this sauce, it was absolutely smothered in it.  This was absolutely NOT healthy and overall was very disappointing.   It's such a shame because their prices are right and they deliver."}
{"text":"Rijstaafel's a great deal for what it is.  Usually when I'm dining here with a friend, we'll split that and order another entree.  Service is pretty unremarkable, and food at times can be pretty inconsistent, but when it's good, it's great, and when it's not so good, it's better than most other food you can get in Madison."}
{"text":"I went here on a recommendation with a friend on Valentine's day. The decor is light and makes you comfortable. The waitresses are quite prompt and friendly. We had the Chicken skewer appetizers which were delicious. The Red Squash Curry was amazing too, and one more dish who's name was funny hence hard to collect. Really loved the food. The waitress was able to help us pair a red wine for our dinner.  The chocolate lava cake was quite tasty, but I've had better (very few times though).  All in all, a great experience. Will definitely recommend to friends, and also planning to visit in the future."}
{"text":"First time having Indonesian food, turned out to be very good. The food was delicious, especially the duck. The skin was a little crunchy and the meat was flavorful. I ordered Pandan pudding cake as desert, which was made of Pandan leaf. also very good. Love the restaurant, definitely will go back again."}
{"text":"The food here is phenomenal.  Great veggie/vegan options."}
{"text":"I always enjoy going here, but I've never had Indonesian food before, so I have nothing else to compare it to. The dishes have similarities to Thai and Indian food. Very quick and attentive service, and a nice seating environment. Just an observation: it seems to be a requirement for everyone on staff to be a dark-haired girl with lots of tattoos and facial piercings."}
{"text":"I admit I am not an expert on Indonesian food (to the extent there is such a monlithic thing, given regional variations), but the food here rang true to my experiences on Java, less so on other islands. We arrived there after a protracted happy hour, but had the wisdom to check their hours and call ahead. We were told they stopped seating at 8:45, and made sure we arrived a couple minutes before. Service was pleasant, good, and we were not hurried at any point during a lengthy meal. We chose to dine outside and lamps were promptly brought and relit for us. The dishes I had were well prepared, generous, and spiced to my preferences. Bandung also has a fine, reasonably priced selection of beers and ales that complement the food. I am puzzled by some of the other comments I see about authenticity of the food and the quality of service, but we each have our own expectations. Mine were well met."}
{"text":"Bandung is a must visit restaurant for us when we are in the area. It is the only Indonesian restaurant in the WI-IL area. I love the food there and have never been disappointing. My favorite dish is the Soyur lodeh which can be made into an entry size. My husband loves the chicken sate. I am vegetarian and normally don't like tempeh but theirs is delicious and always tastes great."}
{"text":"This place is very enjoyable.  I really liked the atmosphere. It was nice and cozy and felt as if we were in another place on vacation (Say... Indonesia) instead of good old Madison, WI.   The food was yummy!!  I ordered the Nasi Rames, it was an awesome combination platter with beef tenderloin, soybean cakes, and potatoes with green beans in a curry sauce. Mmmmm what tasty flavorful spices it had.   My mate got the Mahi Mahi Special and I was also very impressed by the great flavor that had as well.     I thought the Long Island Iced Thai Tea was refreshing and was soo adorable with a flower on top.   We thought the service was great and the server did a great job explaining the different choices available.   For dinner I thought everything was fairly priced, We ordered 1 appetizer, 3 specialty drinks and 2 dinners and it was $50..   I think thats well worth some good food!    I am not a vegetarian, but if I was I would suggest this place as they have quite a few vegetarian options.."}
{"text":"Best place to get pad Thai in Madison. The lumpia are also great. Delivery is always speedy."}
{"text":"Generous portions and ample vegetarian choices made this spot a great place to celebrate a friend's birthday.  The service was good, the food came out very quickly, and the price was just about right."}
{"text":"I've been for dinner and drinks and greatly enjoyed both. I'm typically an unabashed carnivore, but when I'm eating with a friend that's strictly vegetarian, I try to follow suit. I had their seitan with my curry and not only was it extremely spicy just the way I liked it, the seitan added a texture and flavor that was completely different from meat which I really appreciated. Indonesian food is fantastic and this is a great place to get it."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times, as a couple and with friends. While I appreciate their bottled beer selection, which do go on special, their food and service is just okay from my experiences. I've tried the tempeh chips (complimentary), sambal goreng tempeh, bopo chicken, holy basil, pad thai, and indo mac. The holy basil was too liquidy for me. Though they are usually not my favorites elsewhere, the pad thai and indo mac were hands down the best items I've had here and look forward to tryng them again (likely at the Taste). Service is very slow but very friendly; it's typically unclear if one should seat themselves or wait for attention. This summer, I waited for my companion on one of their small outdoor tables. I haven't seen other Indo restaurants around and their location on Willy St and John Nolan is mighty convenient."}
{"text":"I've made several trips to Indonesia over the years and this is the first place in the States that serves food comparable to the fare I had there..  The food at Bandung is excellent and the service is first rate. Regrettably, I find myself in Madison only two or three times a year.  Otherwise, I'd be a very regular customer."}
{"text":"Chicken Pad Thai w Lumpia for delivery  -The order arrived promptly -The chicken was very fresh and tender -There was a pleasant kick: spiciness was not overwhelming -It's a pretty big portion: The price point is not bad for what you are getting -It had a sweetness to it that I wasn't a huge fan of   For this to be my first time having Pad Thai, I am satisfied and can see myself ordering this again. Nice job, Bandung."}
{"text":"This place is hit or miss. I've gone and had great food and service. And sometimes the waitstaff are incredibly rude, as some other commentators have mentioned. I ordered delivery. It took them 1 hour and 40 minutes to deliver the food! (The estimated wait time was \"only\" 1 hour.) I live just a few blocks from the restaurant. When I called to inquire where the delivery was, they hung up on me! I had to call back several times to get an answer, they kept saying, just 10 more minutes. Finally the food arrived cold, right before my friends were picking me up to go out for the night. I had enough time to eat 4 bites before I had to leave. They were incredibly rude about it too. Probably won't go there again. I give it 2 stars because sometimes the food and drinks are good, but really not worth putting up with rude service. There are other great Asian restaurants on Williamson St."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants in Madison. All of their dishes are great, and I'd definitely return to try them all. Eating in is great, but they also do delivery really well. It compares well to Indonesian restaurants all over, including Indonesia. Crazy that Madison has somewhere this good!"}
{"text":"The food was amazing. The mega satay was full of flavor and the Indo Mac is a must have. Service was great and the prices are reasonable. I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"The place was awesome. Food was EXCEPTIONAL. And definitely reasonably priced. Check it out. I know that I will be going back."}
{"text":"Excellent!  After multiple recommendations, we finally were able to visit Bandung.  I made a reservation for 8pm on a Friday and I was glad I did, the place was quite busy.  Our server was quite friendly, helpful with suggestions and attentive, even labeling our to-go containers at the end of the evening (always a nice touch, me thinks).    We started with a couple IPA's ($4-5) and I ordered the Red Curry Squash ($13.95), requesting it mild; our server did fairly warn me that not much having to do with curry can be made with zero spice.  Fair enough, and it was a wee bit spicy, but I survived.  Their strategy of leaving a carafe of water on the table helped too.  The flavor was excellent and the veggies fresh and yummy.  We gobbled up the Lumpia ($3.25, veggie eggrolls) which served two and were piping hot.  My dining companion ordered one of the noodle specials, an Indonesian mac n' cheese, and let's just say HE didn't need a to-go box (no good food left behind!).  Dinner entrees are not cheap here, but at least they are quite good.   The restaurant itself is split into two areas - the dining area and the bar area. It seems like they have quite a few events and specials during the week in the bar area that may be worth checking out, I was informed their Facebook page is the spot to go to keep up with all that.   BOTTOM LINE:  Bandung Indonesian may fill the void I've felt from a lack of good Thai options in the area (true story).  I have a feeling we will be back here quite a bit!"}
{"text":"We had a party of 16 for a celebration, plenty of advance notice, but the Bandung was not quite up to the task. Firstly, we were immediately told that they were \"out of tempeh\" the delicious Indonesian version of tofu that forms the basis of many of their signature dishes. How did this happen? Secondly, there was a wait of about an hour between our appetizers and the main dishes, just too long. The lack of tempeh was felt, although the variety of veggie and meat dishes were well spiced and tasty (although sometimes skimpy on ingredients, such as a dish that featured mushrooms but included only a few bits and pieces of *canned* mushrooms. Have been dining at Bandung for many years--they need to get their act together again, use only fresh ingredients--and never run out of tampeh!"}
{"text":"Went for $5 pad thai and trivia! I was surprised that it was so hard to get a table for trivia... I would like to come back to try some of their other food, but I give this place 3 stars because my pad thai noodles were a bit undercooked. It was pretty tasty though! I'm not sure how exactly they make the dish, but I have made pad thai at home before with a sauce that I bought and it tasted exactly the same... We also got cream cheese wontons for 50 cents each and they were really good :)  Their cheap eats menu during the trivia was amazingly cheap. It's fun to get the buckets of rheinlanders too. They are so cute~"}
{"text":"The only Indonesian ethnic food in town. I love the flavors, but only found the food not as spicy as I like, and a little on the expensive side.  HOWEVER, as I discovered from Yelp's Boozing and Schmoozing event this week, there's cheap eats happy hour from 5-9pm at he bar area Sun to Thurs!!! AGAIN, SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY 5-9PM. Eat at the BAR. There are 5 to 6 dishes from $6-8, full sized entrees, and tastes AMAZINGGGGG. Also, drinks are at happy hour price between 5-7pm.   The owners here are a couple; the chef/owner is from Bandung, Indonesia, and is the only cook for the restaurant. HOW DOES HE DO IT! His wife, Julie, is a friendly american lady, thus ensuring the ethnic food can cater to local tastebuds as well. If you want solely AUTHENTIC Indonesian flavors, then no, this is not the place for you. Both drinks and food are headed to the fusion category, so Indonesians might find the tastes different. (P.S. also, different regions of Indonesian have vastly different flavors for dishes of the same name!) Drinks try to infuse local delights like old-fashioned, punch with Indonesian flavors like star anise, Indonesian liquors. Great job, drinks taste really good.  Food/drinks (from the bar menu) - LOVE IT Gado gado - peanut sauce is AMAZING, but can we have more please. this dish is gluten-free if you don't get the rice!  Indonesian mac & cheese - i don't find it tasting of cheese, but the great curry flavor in a dried stir fried noodle is awesome!!! Mega Sate - beef skewer on fried rice. oh i love the rice. ohhh the skewer is GIGANTIC, like an entire piece of skirt steak. so delicious and worthed it Chicken wings - so juicy and I LOVE THE BATTER. yay Pengsit Keju (Cheese wontons) - i have no idea where this idea came from, but I love the cheesy wontons....!!  Also, nasi goreng is amazing here.   I tried Surabaya sunrise, great if you love sweet drinks, very very easy to drink. Also tried Indonesian punch, not as sweet but great flavors! great job bartender Emily!  Also, there's karaoke night on Tuesday. (WHATTTTT. how did i miss that!?) I definitely have to be back for more cheap eats! hurrayyyy!"}
{"text":"I love this place.  It's true I tend to order the exact same meal every time I go (Nasi Goreng), but I've also had the pad thai and it's delicious.  It's a bit expensive for lunch but it's a worthy treat, and they deliver!  I order at least once a month, and have done so for over a year now.  So much that my co-workers all know it's my favorite restaurant."}
{"text":"We waited for an hour after ordering our food. Apparently no one in this restaurant cares that much after all."}
{"text":"I ate at Bandung last Friday night with my adult son. It was UW graduation weekend. It was packed. We arrived late, around 9:30 and was seated right away. The place was hopping but it was clear people were happy and getting good service. . We had a fabulous waitress who never rushed us, really understood the menu and was able to clearly describe the food and cocktails. Everything we ordered she recommended based on our likes and dislikes.  We started with beef and lamb satay which had a think and luscious sauce ($2 per skewer).  They were the perfect match to our cocktail which was bourbon and some sort of ginger and spice concoction. The class was large and filled to the brim. The rim was lightly covered in sugar and cinnamon. It was absolutely delicious. We held off ordering our entrees until we had the skewers in hand. We never felt rushed. At one point another young woman asked if we had been waited on and just wanted to be sure everything was okay. Nice touch!  I am always watching my weight (up and down) so I was sad to see that just about everything was fried. But if you have to eat fried food, eat it here. My son had Krakatau (chicken with a sweet tangy garlic sauce) and I had Sizzling Shrimp with a sweet and tangy sauce. The shrimp and chicken were lightly breaded and not heavy at all. I was pleased to see that the sauces were not the same and each complemented the protein to a T. Both dishes came with perfectly prepared veggies which still were slightly crisp, The waitress told my son that his dish was like general Tsao's chicken- but good. We laughed but she was right. Each dish was about $15.  I hadn't been to Bandung in ages. They have remodeled and there was a new bar/lounge added. That night there was live music and a belly dancer. That area was also quite full.   I had an Entertainment Club coupon. She brought the bill, I added my 20% tip and signed the receipt. The waitress then told me that the tip had already been added so I should take my tip off.  Honesty.... always appreciated.  We took home some leftovers and kept commenting about our wonderful meal. I will definitely return to Bandung. i just have to take off a little weight first."}
{"text":"Bandung is one of the best among the numerous Laotian/Indonesian/Thai restaurants on Madison's near east side.  The squash curry and pad thai are two of my favorite menu items, but in addition to the standard curry, noddle, and pad thai dishes, they also have more \"entree\" type items - fish, etc.  Everything is delicious, and service is fast.  Bandung is often busy - every night of the week - but with the recently opened addition there is rarely a wait for a table anymore."}
{"text":"First time here and the food was excellent. We got a basil fried rice dish and a curry noodle dish with chicken. Both were great!"}
{"text":"I've been to Bandung a few times and it has always impressed.  The menu is extensive and can seem a little overwhelming at first, but the waitstaff is friendly and always knowledgeable.  The food has never let me down.  One aspect that is particularly nice it their seasonal specials.    The other day the special was a seared flank steak with peanut sauce served over a bead of rice and perfectly cooked vegetables.  The steak was well cooked - tender enough to be cut with a fork alone - but had a good char that added just a little something extra to the dish.  I don't eat steak often, but when I do I have high expectations.  This dish certainly met those expectations.    With great staff, good food, and plenty of beverages available to pair with your dish Bandung is a place not to be missed for the initiated and uninitiated to Indonesian cuisine."}
{"text":"Food was fresh, hot, fast, and inexpensive. The pad Thai, red curry and nasi goreng are excellent options. They have some unique mixed drinks, such as the Nutty Coconut. On many nights, there is live music by local musicians. The interior is casual, but not a dive like so many inexpensive Asian restaurants. Highly recommended for a restaurant in its class."}
{"text":"PAD THAI! YUM!  I got their GrubHub takeout deal which was Pad Thai, and app and a soda for something around $12. Pretty good deal, eh?  I got the cream cheese wonton bites for my app and they were so yummy. Especially with the spicy dipping sauce that they came with. Then came the Pad Thai and I was in heaven. I've been looking for a delicious, reliable Pad Thai in the Madison area and I think I've found it. It was the perfect amount of spice and sweet. So good!  It was made extremely fast too. Only took about 15 minutes and it was ready to be picked up. I can't wait to try something else off of their menu!"}
{"text":"This is another place I always meant to try when I lived in Madison but never did.  I had a gift certificate from restaurants.com and decided to use it with a friend. We started with some ginger tea, which really hit the spot since I have a cold.  There are these ginger chews I adore and this tasted like a hot, liquefied version of that.  I took the package along with me to find it. We split an order of lumpia, which were brough to the table hot and crispy with a sweet sauce that had chopped peanuts in it. I had curried eggplant.  Great mixture of veggies and tofu.  Warm and comforting. We had to reach a minimum amount, which gave just enough room to split a dessert of fried plantains.  They were dipped in batter and fried.  With a dusting of powdered sugar and raspberry cream sauce on the side they hit the spot without being too sweet. It was a lovely evening playing catch-up with a friend.  I wish I had dressed a little nicer."}
{"text":"Ok, so this place is great.  I know, I gush over a lot of restaurants.  But, I do enjoy this place a lot.  The food is delicious and served promptly.  The place looks very nice and has very clean bathrooms.  The service is amazing and the people are nice as hell.  I had the Pad Thai (I know, lame...) but it was delicious, spicy and the vegetables included there in were crisp and fresh.  My ex got the Sate Tempe and thought it was real meat.  She panicked.  She flipped.  She almost cried.  I told her it only tasted and felt like pork, but definitely wasn't.  She didn't believe me.  We had to ask the waitress.  The spring rolls?  Some of the best I've ever had.  No joke.  I love it.  Absolutely loved it.  The sauce they were served with: not sugary but still sweet!  OH MY GOD!  So, this place is great.  I love it.  You gotta try it if you're in Madison."}
{"text":"Wow Bandung!  Stopping in before a play at the Broome Street. Bartender, Julia, is a hoot and a half - friendly, fun and knows how to make some awesome e cocktails!  Happy hour prices on a Friday is nice, and the selection of cocktails, beer and wine is excellent.  Had the duck. Simply fantastic. Plenty of perfectly cooked meat and a great sweet and spicy sauce.  Friend had a mango tempah vegetarian dish that was also excellent.  Great drinks, great service, and great food. Well done Bandung!  Don't know why I have not been here sooner. And can't wait to come back for the salsa dancing and the belly dancing!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite places to dine in Madison. Was just here celebrating my sister's birthday. We ordered a bunch of appetizers to split. The food is always very tasty. I needed to down grade a star because I'm continuing to get frustrated with their service.  From the time we entered the restaurant (when we arrived there were 3 other people dining) to the time we finished eating and left was 2 hours!  The service is SOoooo slow! The restaurant was not busy - we waited a quite a while to be greeted by our waiter, we ordered drinks and placed appetizer orders right away. He didn't come back to take our dinner order until after the appetizers were already out. He rarely checked up on us and forgot things that we asked for.  It was quite frustrating.  Because the food is amazing, I will be back - but don't go there if you are in a hurry!"}
{"text":"This was my first time eating at an Indonesian restaurant. Despite not recognizing many of the dish names, everything we ordered tasted familiar, like the fried tofu with chili dipping sauce, and coconut red curry with squash (both great vegan/vegetarian options). I love how they suggest tasty local beers with some of the dishes, and I think they did a great job with the pairings.   The food was carefully prepared and served in reasonable portion sizes. We were informed that their pad Thai (the only thing on their menu not Indonesian) is rated the best in Madison, and it was pretty good. I'm glad we tried it so we can move on to the other dishes next time. The interior has a serene feel, and it is a great choice for a nice dinner out in Madison if you're tired of eating Italian.   The dessert menu wasn't inspiring, but their late night menu was like a siren's call across the isthmus. I'll have to come back for it -- after one appetizer, two dishes, and  three beers, we didn't have room for much else."}
{"text":"Love love love Bandung!  I've actually only been here once for a Christmas party for work. But I've ordered from here through Grubhub multiple times... especially now that I found out that they deliver! They have a handful of awesome 'Grubhub Deals' I generally order the Pad Thai deal which comes with an app and a drink.. my go to is the Cream Cheese Wonton bites, and the Mango Orange juice.  Honestly those are the only things I have ever tried here. I can never get myself to order anything else, cause every time I think of ordering Bandung I think of the their Pad Thai, and the amazingness of it. Maybe one day I'll venture out and try something else on the menu, but probably not for a very long time. Pad Thai forever. :)"}
{"text":"Their special combo plates (entree+appetizer+drink) may not be the best thing in mankind, but it's pretty damn close.  3 delicious items for $11.99? Shut up and take my money!  Anyways, Bandung is literally amazing. Delicious, delicious food (I'm looking at you, Red Curry Squash and Daging Rendang), extremely affordable prices ($8~12) and enough food to last for days (unless you were really, really hungry like me, in which case, it'd last you a few hours).  On top of that, it's pretty healthy too.  If you're still not sold after reading this, then I lose all hope in humanity."}
{"text":"Finally got here. The food is excellent and if you ask for spicy they give it to you spicy and assume you can handle it. That in itself is worth it.  The veggie curry was superb, they have an excellent wine selection. Staff was friendly and they even brought out extra rice when they saw that we were running low."}
{"text":"Been here twice, once for lunch and once for dinner.  Food is consistently good. Lots of vegetarian choices.  Wait staff is a little quirky, but friendly.  Decor is dated especially the bar and the parking is somewhat difficult at times."}
{"text":"Really wanted to love the food as we love trying new things and this region of the culinary world is our favorite, but it was so, bland, and that's a word I rarely feel the need use.  Ordered 3 appetizers and 2 entres.  Lumpia (good flavors but the peanut sauce was an odd pairing, more flavorful sauce would be nice)  Tempe Goreng (good fry but the peanut sauce again didn't fit)  Rujak Cuka (this was the winner, sweet and citrusy)  Bopo Chicken (tasted zero flavor from the cilantro, jalapeño, or onions?)  Bakmi Goreng (zero spice used?)   There was no asking us about spice level when we ordered, nor any options for us to add at the table, so we were kinda bummed out.   But it wasn't even a spice issue, it seriously lacked flavor of any kind.   I even reread the menu after, I feel like there were several missing whole spice ingredients, especially on the main dishes.   That being said, the staff was very nice, service was not slow, and volume of food was appropriate for the cost, especially considering the location.   But, I feel that I'd rather try another place next time, this left a very bland impression on us both."}
{"text":"We sat at the Nutty Bar and ordered the bartender's hot toddy and the buttered rum blend. She was hilarious as we talked and watch Xena and infomercials. Meals are much cheaper (about $1-2 less per entree) on this side of the restaurant, although my pad thai was on the dry and only-short-rice sticks-side. The indo mac was the star of the night and my husband had more than enough to share with me. We liked the music and artwork, and of course, we really liked a piece that was already sold. Cool place to hang out."}
{"text":"How did it take me 2 years to find Bandung? The food, drinks, and service are all superb! On a whim my husband and I stopped in on a Thursday night and were excited to find some great happy hour specials in Bandung's Nutty Bar. We indulged in the $2-off specialty cocktails, scrumptious Pangsit Keju (cream cheese wontons), beef satay slider, chicken pad thai, and chicken pad see ew. Julia, the awesome bartender, makes fantastic cocktails! The \"spice island\" was a wonderful concoction of rye whiskey, cardamom, allspice and ginger beer (I think I am forgetting something), with a fine sugar/cinnamon rim. Divine! The addition of lemongrass to her take on a margarita adds such a bright note. The food is top notch as well! The HH (Sunday-Thursday) food menu serves up some great noodle dishes for incredibly reasonable prices. The pad thai and pad see ew both hit the spot with well balanced sauces and perfectly cooked noodles. The inventive sliders for $4.50 offer small bites that pack a punch of flavor.  We will definitely be adding Bandung to our rotation of go-to places to eat in Madison!"}
{"text":"If you want the best fried wontons ever, you HAVE to visit this restaurant. My sister and I had lunch at Bandung a few weeks ago.  We both ordered daily specials.  Unfortunately, it's been too long and I can't remember exactly what each of us ordered.  What I do remember is how good the food was.  Both meals came with an appetizer.  My sister had the egg roll, which she said was good. I had the fried wontons, which were to die for.  They were in very delicate wrappers, much thinner and tastier than the ones I usually get in a restaurant.  The filling was flavorful and the whole thing was fried to just the right temperature.  I wished I'd had more.  Our meals were also very tasty and even included an orchid, which was edible.  I can tell we both really liked it, as when we were finished, neither of us had left even a morsel of rice left on our plates.  My only complaint would be that even for lunch, the portions were small.  Will I go back?  Absolutely!  Just to make things more attractive, there are coupons for the restaurant in the Entertainment coupon book too."}
{"text":"I was excited about coming here after sampling their food at the taste of Madison over the summer. we made a reservation for a party of 8 for 6:30pm. After waiting patiently for an hr, we went up to the front counter to ask about our order. the waitress just explained that they had a lot of deliveries ahead of us and our food won't be ready for another 10 mins. she never stop by our table to keep us updated nor apologize for the long wait at any point. the food was OK except for the curry chicken dish. we inhaled our food pretty quickly since we were starving by that point. she didn't refill our water at all. it took another freaking 30 minutes to get our check..we were just kinda abandoned like sad orphans. they also forgot to give my friend her leftover. there's an automatic 18% gratuity for over party of 6...and I was joking about how they are not obligated to give us a decent service since that's included. we ended up getting 20% charge since we asked for a split check. never again. the most shitty service ever."}
{"text":"Recently went here for lunch with my man and his fam... Super cute place, odd that its in a strip mall, but the interior is cute. Pretty large drink list with fun cocktails, wine, local beers and thai beers! I of course got the tofu pad thai... I had to :)  It was pretty good, the best I have had in Madison so far. My man got the red curry squash (?) which he really enjoyed.  His mom got a different curry dish which she enjoyed and his dad got the lamb kabobs, which look great and I guess tasted amazing!  Plus, at lunch time you get a choice of one of four appetizers; vegetarian eggrolls, cream cheese wontons with sirracha, a coconut soup and.... I forget the last one.  But I can say that the wontons were super tasty and the eggroll were a-ok.  We all had an appetizer lunch and a beer for under $50!  What a deal!  And the server was awesome... It wasn't too busy but she was so nice and explained everything to us! We will definately be back, they have a ton of vegetarian options!"}
{"text":"Great service and delicious food. I recommend the nasi goreng with basil and the nutty coconut! Happy to get my Indonesian fix here!!!"}
{"text":"We discovered this restaurant accidentally, because the place we were really trying to go to was closed.  I am so happy that happened, because this place was super good!  They make their own tempeh in house, which is great for anyone looking for vegan or vegetarian options.  The tempeh satay was so good.  Omg, you have to have it.  Overall, the prices would be what prevent us from going there regularly.  We're on a tight budget, and meals can be around $15 each.  The atmosphere was very nice, and felt slightly upscale, but not in any snooty kind of way.  Definitely try this place."}
{"text":"I pulled up to this place with a few Madisonites who told me about a place that makes really good Pahd Thai...I had not really paid attention to the name till we pulled up and I had a wtf moment ...\"Crap! This in Indonesian...not f'in Thai!\" so I said heck no to the Pahd Thai and ordered the Indonesian food instead and while not crazy good like I have actually had in Indonesia, was definitely pretty tasty.  This place does what I would call straits food with bits and pieces that you might find in an open stall market in Singapore or KL.  I tried the tempeh goreng (a hit with crispy well fried tempeh, good sambal for dipping), rojak (not so much of a hit for me, the dressing was too sweet I got bits of veggies that were just not very fresh), the martabak (not crispy enough, though the filling was pretty okay) and an order of satay.  Again the satay was too sweet for me, but the companions enjoyed it. The tempeh and beef satay were definitely the winners.  On a second trip I did the red curry squash and the rendang.  The red curry squash was perfectly cooked, tender with a bit and the curry was a perfect combination of chile, lemongrass, lime and a tinge of what tasted like dried shrimp (not unusual). The rendang on the other had was a bit of a disappointment (seriously ..steamed broccoli??). The dish itself was probably okay if you have never ever had a good rendang before, but for a practiced eater, yeah this was not it.  First of all it was a tad watery and then rice which was ordered was just not right for the dish. Rendang is a slow cooked dish which ends up with pieces of tender beef just coated with a very thick coating of a slow cooked spice mixture which should be a good combination of slightly sweet, spicy, lemony and salty and this was none of that.  My dining companions enjoyed the dish though.  A few more trips and it is about a 3 star for me foodwise, but the service has always been just great in this place. So with that and props for even trying to do good Indonesian food leads me to give it 4 stars. Worth a shot if you are craving Indonesian food or have never had it.  But if you have had Indonesian food, then stay on the appetizer side of things. They are done quite well."}
{"text":"Had the Pad Thai... not the best I've had, but I would definitely go back and try something different on the menu.  GREAT customer service and very friendly wait staff."}
{"text":"The Pad Thai is as fabulous as everyone raves about!"}
{"text":"I wanted to give more stars... Had only there had been more of the main ingredient in my Eggplant curry.  :(  the flavors were very well blended, a little sweet with a hint of heat.  Unfortunately, the bamboo shoots out numbered all other ingredients... Had I ordered \"Bamboo Shoots Curry\" I would have been extremely ecstatic about the meal... Unfortunately,  two tiny spears of Eggplant was very under whelming and disappointing.  :(   No where near the place I remembered & had been longing to return to..."}
{"text":"Affordable pricing, pleasant atmosphere, and in my mind the best Thai/Indonesian spot in Madison. The pad Thai is my go to and incorporating a plethora of flavors and spices it's well worth the visit."}
{"text":"Easily ordered delivery here half-a-dozen times this year. I usually grab the chicken pad Thai which is great but sometimes inconsistent (be careful with spicy-levels when ordering).  My most recent order was the Mega Satay and Indo Mac and Cheese w/ chicken. They were both items off the specials menu which costs $3 more per item when ordering by phone vs online :(  Mega Satay.....5 out of 5 Chop Sticks  Great dish. The meat and rice and cucumber salad go perfectly together and the dark sauce they serve it with was awesome. Bigger pieces of meat for the satay please!  Indo Mac and Cheese....2 out of 5 Chop Sticks  Despite having no cheese at all, this dish tasted pretty good. However, the noodles were dry and sort of stuck together, and the amount of chicken that we got was pretty weak. I live trying new things, but for me, it just didn't wok."}
{"text":"Overall we liked Bandung. The restaurant is cute and small and we were seated immediately on a Monday night. To start I ordered a Thai Ice Tea and it was okay... It was a bit watered down and not sweet enough for me. The free tempeh chips were nice too!  We ordered the Pad Thai with tofu and Pad Rum Mit with chicken. Both entrees were good. The sauce on the stir fry was awesome and the pad Thai could have had more sauce for my liking. I did like the large amount of peanuts and bean spouts- a great crunch!"}
{"text":"Ate here for the first time food was pretty good I'm a novice at Indian food so went with some friends my choice was pretty good.  I would go back but do not get the Donald peanut sauce stuff my friend got that and hated it."}
{"text":"Hmm. I've had the rendang here before and it was pretty good. I had my first taste on the island of Sumatra a long time ago. The rendang at Bandung tasted pretty dang close to the real thing! For this reason alone I am giving it a higher rating than our latest experience.   Our last experience was totally underwhelming. I raved to my husband about this place and how much I liked it. I had it before I met him so he had never been there. So, we finally decided to check it out together.   I ordered the lumpia for my son to try. The lumpia was pretty good. My son gobbled up both pieces in a flash! The wings, on the other hand, were not so great. It wasn't that the chicken wasn't good, because it was fine. It was more that they were normal wings with a tiny side of peanut sauce. The peanut sauce was really lumpy and hard to dip or spread on the wings. The wings also had a date on the outside...like if you bought them at a grocery store. Say what??? I don't want to order food from a restaurant, where I expect it to be fresh, to have a \"sell by\" date on it. Next we tried their Pad Rum Mit and Holy Basil. Granted, these are both more Thai than they are Indonesian, but whatever. Both dishes were pretty soupy and lacked flavor. The Pad Rum Mit maybe had 4 pieces of chicken in it. That's right, FOUR! I didn't order a mcnugget happy meal! Without flavor and chicken, we were extremely disappointed.   I'd go back to try their rendang again, but I definitely won't be ordering much else off the menu."}
{"text":"Really delicious food! I have been there a couple of time with my friends and each time we tried different dishes - they were all pretty good. I specifically liked their Nasi Goreng. The service was great too. Would surely go there again!"}
{"text":"The chicken pad thai was UHH-MAY-ZING. Perfect sauce with a little kick. My boyfriend and I will be back!"}
{"text":"Came in with a party of 20 and the restaurant gracious accommodated and set the table up, a welcome respite from the chill outside. Being from SE Asian, got to say the beef rendang and sambal goreng tempeh was pretty legit! Would have given this a 4 star if not for a little hiccup.   Checked in via Yelp! and was pleasantly surprised with a 10% discount coupon. :) Kudos to Yelp! Went on to promptly share the platform to the rest and I think I got the entire table to sign up if they haven't! Was later told that we could only use 1 coupon per table and needless to say this was not going to work for the 20 of us.   But 10% difference was not going to spoil the evening!"}
{"text":"I will never say no to Bandung.   Happy Hour: Sun-Thurs, 5-9 in the bar area only. The abbreviated \"cheap eats\" menu is fantastic. I could eat anything off that menu every night of the week given the choice. The drinks are $5 for some of the most imaginative cocktails this side of Merchant. My favorites are the \"nutty\" drinks featuring coconut cream based drinks with your choice of another tropical fruit. These cocktails get me through the long cold winters by bringing me a piece of the beach.     Entertainment: Some Saturday nights they have DJ's spinning in the bar. Its a little known 'event' with a laid back atmosphere. The bar has rotating display of artists on the walls (the art is for sale, so it serves as a bit of a...gallery?). Monday trivia is really fun but very packed. The bar has a couple TVs, and its a low-key place to watch football or basketball games if you're not looking to wait 30+ minutes for a table at buffalo wild wings.   Dinner: Get the Lamb curry or the squash curry.  You will not regret it."}
{"text":"Pad Thai was too spicy, and I'm not sure why. Went at 6:30 on a Thursday, one other couple in the place. Prices seemed normal, but food was meh. This is a 5 out of 10...would you go back to a 5 out of 10?"}
{"text":"I've only been there once but I'll defiantly being going back again. We ordered the satay, eggplant curry and pad Thai and everything was excellent; great taste and cooked perfectly. Nice chill atmosphere and comfortable space and outdoor donning area. Would recommend."}
{"text":"WOW. So many options that I really didn't know what to order. Ended w chicken pad Thai and a lamb skewer. Really great flavors with a nice kick at the end. Tastes really fresh. Also pretty large portion."}
{"text":"Man, what terrible and rude service.  The food was so-so, but in no way was it worth having to deal with the staff."}
{"text":"Favorite restaurant in Madison by far. Their fried tofu appetizer is fried to perfection and comes in a large portion. The Bakmi Noodle dish is the stuff of dreams - fried noodle yum. They also give free tempeh chips to sample."}
{"text":"Real good food, real nice staff - especially the hostess! Although very busy, she was greeting people, seating people, working with the kitchen by bringing food out, and even helping out a newbie waitress on her first day alone - all with a smile on her face. Nothin' but kindness, which only added to the cozy and warm atmosphere here.  When it comes to food, you cannot go wrong with the Krakatau. We chose chicken, which was served sizzling, in a sweet garlic sauce. I did not taste garlic, but it was damn good nonetheless. Another item we enjoyed was the Bakmi Goreng - a very large portion of egg noodles flavored with soy sauce, mixed with an assortment of veggies. Definitely a filling and delicious meal.  Although stuffed, I could not pass up on dessert. Ordered the Pisang Goreng and I fell madly in love. I've posted a photo, and yes, it does taste as good as it looks."}
{"text":"TLDR : solid food with warm friendly service.   I ordered the beef satay with peanut sauce and cucumber side salad. The beef was fairly tender and tasted fairly good. It doesn't compare to the satay I've had in roadside stalls in Malaysia but it was solid. My friends ordered the mango and butternut squash curries which they thought were absolutely delicious. I tried some of their curry and it was fairly tasty.   Our service was fast and friendly with a very warm waiter who smile a lot and was attentive to our water needs   Ambience was slightly dark making for a more intimate evening. The restaurant wasn't loud and I could easily hear my friends.   Overall a good experience and I would come back to try their other dishes."}
{"text":"Really great pad thai with tofu + thai iced teas.  Have quite a few vegetarian/vegan options  Love that they do delivery through GrubHub!"}
{"text":"I was in Madison for a week, and I ate here twice.  I think I could have been happy eating every meal here.  I tried the bakmi jahe and the pangsit keju (cream cheese wontons) for dinner.  It was excellent, but my favorite thing was the sambal goreng tempe that I had for lunch.  This is a dish with tempeh, green beans, potatoes, and lemongrass, in a sauce like a thick sweet and sour sauce.  If I lived in the area, I would gladly eat that at least once a week.  Lunch specials also come with a choice of an appetizer; I had the soup.  I don't remember what it was called, but it was a spicy vegetable and tempeh soup that reminded me of yellow curry.    The prices here are reasonable, delivery to my hotel (near the Capitol) was quick, there are plenty of delicious vegetarian options, and the food really hit the spot on a cold day.  Now I just need to find my local Indonesian restaurant."}
{"text":"I don't know how I hadn't gone here sooner. The Indo mac 'n' cheese is exactly what I hope for when I get rice noodles with my curry instead of rice. The noodles are perfect and the curry is so creamy! The appetizers are comically small, but I found that more endearing than anything else. I'm excited to go back again soon! Very impressed. :)"}
{"text":"The rangoon-type starter was absolutely delicious, filled with oniony, garlicy cream cheese and provided with a spicy sauce, it was the best I've ever had.  The Sate Ayam was perfectly cooked and the sauce was very tasty.  I really didn't like the rice, I thought it was bland and sticky, but if it is traditional Indonesian, I don't have a problem with it and it really didn't mar my meal at all.  The cucumbers were wonderful. Service was fine, I went there for lunch and was the first one in the restaurant so I had no trouble at all.  The server recommended the rangoon and I am very glad she did.  I will definetely be returning."}
{"text":"I love great Asian places with reasonably priced noodle dishes. This is one such place. Flavorful, varied menu, nice atmosphere, good service. The strip-mall location is a little devoid of character, but it's a great place."}
{"text":"Dined here twice in the last few months. This is a Madison gem that stands up to any of the southeast Asian restaurants in town.   Lumpia (small crispy spring rolls), Satay, Pad Thai, Nasi Goreng (Indonesian fried rice), and Indo Mac were all winners. I especially recommend the Indo Mac and the Satay entrée.   I have yet to try a cocktail I didn't like!  Service both times was friendly and excellent, though the kitchen and bar can get backed-up sometimes."}
{"text":"Great food tonight. I stopped in to grab a to go order and wanted a dish that they had made during restaurant week. Come to find out they don't really have the same dish on the menu. The name is the same but it's was completely different.  A lady helped the young lad with my order and when I got home I was extremely happy with the way it turned out. The only thing I wish was that I had been offered something to drink while i waited for the food. It's not a big deal obviously as I have a 5 star. Good customer service and the food was o  point. Thanks to the staff and kitchen for the modifications on my food order."}
{"text":"remember Boutros Boutros-Ghali?  remember how fun it was it. mouth it with me. your corworkers wont laugh  boutros bourtros  now let's say gado gado  gado gado  and it's delicious. and rich. and cheap. and, down the street.  gado gado"}
{"text":"We try to eat here whenever we are in Madison.  Creative and unique food choices abound. We had the rice table, which is a spread of about a dozen small plates.  The ranged from excellent to OK.  The chicken dish was outstanding.  Beef dishes were the weakest -- advertised as tenderloin, but was not.  Probably chuck or round roast, as some pieces were tendon-y and not edible.  Overall, a unique destination and a good value."}
{"text":"Food is not so exciting: salty, americanized; like most Madison Asian places the veg are too frequently over cooked, some of it tasted watery & bland from being steamed. (?) Cleanliness & service are extremely spotty: I don't like to get food from servers with chipped nail polish, gross. (Or any nail-polish, really, I like cleanliness in restaurants) I also don't like fawning hipsters for servers; I guess college kids /  trendy people think that adds to the \"cool\" factor, I just find it tedious. I prefer professionalism to faux friendliness. For the price you're better off cooking at home."}
{"text":"Great food, with great meat free options. The tempeh is especially good."}
{"text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Madison.   The staff is always great, and they make wonderful suggestions.  Once a waitress added gratuity on our bill told us about it and came back to tell us again when she realized we added an additional 15% on to it.  How very considerate! The vegetarian options are numerous.  I especially like the red curry squash and anything with the sweet and spicy candlenut sauce.  I've been told that the opor ayum is wonderful."}
{"text":"Don't let 3 stars discourage you. To receive 5 stars the food, service and atmosphere has to be outstanding. Bandung has a pleasant setting. The food is tasty, not authentic Indonesian, but a nice change from typical fare that one might find. The waitstaff are friendly and try hard. While I was there the restaurant was constantly busy on a Wednesday night. The food was presented promptly so if you don't have much time you can get in and out pretty quick. On of the interesting things that I overheard was that they were completely out of white wine. In my opinion that should never happen. It is not like there is a multitude of places that the restaurant manager could make a quick run to and purchase some temporary replacements until they get a new delivery. Also, whether this is the norm or not, there were a lot of young families here for dinner with very young children, and yes they were all well behaved and quiet. No guarantees for the future though."}
{"text":"After eating at Bandung several times, I have one take home message for you, and it is the following:  GET THE TEMPEH!  It doesn't matter what style or dish you get the Tempeh in, because it will be great either way. The Krakatau is fried tempeh in a sweet sauce, and it rocks. The Oseng Oseng is the Tempeh in a more traditional stir fry, and it rocks. The Sate Tempe is skewered smoked tempeh, and it rocks. They just know how to cook with the stuff, and that's what makes Bandung so much more appealing for me over similar cuisine restaurants. They also have a good beer selection, decent cocktails, and a consistently pleasant wait staff. So Bandung for sure makes it into my restaurant rotation, and for good reason!"}
{"text":"I have tried Bandung twice and both the times I did not have a reason to complain about their service or staff. I would first like to say that the management has excellent staff and take out service. They deserve one star entirely for this. Coming to the food, the Pad Thai stands out! I ordered it without eggs and spicy and thats exactly what I got. I loved the spice added to it. We also got the red squash curry with tofu which I felt was extremely thin.  Being watered down, it was really hard to make out any flavor in the dish. The Thai Basil stir fry was also the same, watered down and hard to discern any flavor. This is probably a place for people who do not like their food strong in flavor and spice. I would go back for their delivery (through Eat Street) which is really quick and efficient."}
{"text":"The boyfriend and I first had Indonesian food in Amsterdam about 3 years ago. And we haven't had it since. Why, you ask? Because somehow, there isn't a single Indonesian restaurant in Chicago. I know, right?  Anywho, we were in Madison for the day visiting his sister, and since all we did was eat nonstop, as soon as we got to her apartment, we started planning dinner. The boyfriend jokingly asked if there were any Indonesian places, so I entered it into the little search box, and lo and behold, Bandung appeared.  We arrived at around 7ish on Saturday, told the wait would be 20-30 minutes, and were seated after about 10.  We went for the Rice Table, which isn't cheap at $25 pp, so we got enough for 2 people and an additional entree. They charge $10 for splitting, but the waitress informed us that if you order another entree, they take off the charge. Good to know.  I have no idea what we ate, but everything was delicious. The standout was a chicken curry dish- shredded chicken with coconut milk and curry. It was very beige, but very delicious.  The beef dish was very tasty as well- really everything was great. The only dish we all agreed was the least favorite was the hard-boiled-then-fried eggs. Not so much on that one.  The cocktails look fun and dangerous, but we didn't imbibe anything fancy.  Overall, the food is great and definitely satisfies that hankering' for Indonesian cuisine."}
{"text":"Decent size restaurant. seemed family owned. For a Sunday evening in Madison, the place had a steady stream of customers...it was maybe half full by the time we left. Service was friendly. We didn't try the drinks but their cocktails all had an Indonesian twist.    We ordered the small portions of the BoPO chicken and the bro had the Culai Kambing with lamb. BoPo was very clean dish  with white meat chicken with ginger, onions, cilantro and jalopenos. The lamb dish was a tad too salty but it was fairly tender. the type of rice cake in the dish was new to me...it was rice that was sorta pounded and formed into disks but there still was full grains of rice (I was expecting something like the Korean rice sticks which completely smashed and reformed). I didn't care for the tempeh chips."}
{"text":"The food here is excellent.  The atmosphere was really cozy.  Service was a bit long but it is worth the wait.  I had the Salmon dinner and WOW!!!!  Amazing!!!  My friends and I shared the Key Lime Cheese cake, and it WAS delicious!!!!  When I visit Wisconsin again, I will definitely come back to visit."}
{"text":"I'll start off by addressing what some other recent reviewers have mentioned: the long wait for food. We actually didn't experience this when we went. Our food came out in a timely manner; it may have even been faster than what you usually get at most restaurants (we were there for a 6:30 reservation, for perspective).  As for the food, my opinions are mixed. On the one hand, the food wasn't bad. It wasn't great by any means, but it was passable. For the mid to low teens that you pay per plate, it's fine.  As for authenticity, it seemed like they had some authentic dishes, but that they were not authentically prepared. Be this due to laziness, lack of knowledge, or watering down for the midwestern palate I don't know, but it didn't seem anywhere near spicy enough.  Overall, I wouldn't come here again. It was interesting to try, and it wasn't a bad experience, but nothing really wowed me enough to merit a return visit. In summary, meh."}
{"text":"I think this is a Top 3 Madison Restaurant for me.  I've never been less than 100% satisfied upon each visit.  Their Curry Fried Rice is Curry Fried Ridiculous.  Ridiculously awesome, that is.  They have a curry dish w/shrimp and potatoes that's fantastic, too.  It was a discovery of my ex's that when you pour the sauce from the shrimp-potato dish over the curry fried rice, you're left with a sinful, drool-inspiring juggernaut.  As he put it, \"Curry goes really good with more curry.\"    They have an awe-inspiring lunch special, and are otherwise kind of pricey.  Do I mind?  Not at all.  I would eat here every other day if I could afford it.  It's making my tummy rumble just thinking about it."}
{"text":"Food was great. Drink was questionable. Service was truly sad. I'll try it again, because I've got a $25 certificate, and the food really was that good. I'll report again after that."}
{"text":"I second Jessica F of \"love love love Bandung\".  Excellent $$, portion, interesting menu, service and deals!  DEALS -- (1) 10% off from Yelp, (2) 15% off online order, and (3) lunch specials for $8 with free appetizer.  It's a night of cakes (fish and rice) and lemon grass!  OTAK OTAK -- must love fish to enjoy dish.  As soon as you unwrap it, whoa...smells like fish.  LOL. Interesting.  Leftover repurpose to Asian soup add-in.  GULAI KAMBING ($15.95) -- with rice, serves 2+.  Stew.  Good flavor.  Adding sambal (chili) would overwhelm the delicate light curry flavor. Excellent balance of ingredients.  I chose this dish as it has the same meaning in Tagalog, GULAI means vegetables and KAMBING means lamb.  Tone may be different.  FRIED BANANA (4) -- ordinary.  Serves 2, but I ate it all.  Raspberry and Vanilla sauce was frozen.  BEER PAIRING -- the only casual dining with beer pairing that is typical of fine dining.  Lots of local beer selections ranging from $4-$6.  Plenty of Cider selections.  Woo hoo!  SERVICE -- Endearing!  Lee is happier than I.  LOL. Then, someone drew a heart on the \"i\", see photo.  A very thoughtful act of adding date to brown bag is appreciated.  There is an absolute sincerity to help and provide fantabulous service.  VENUE -- better than Batam, Indonesia vibe.  Left to right table arrangement is spacious but tight from north to south.  The back room is cluttered.  Next dish...the aromatic sizzling plate!"}
{"text":"Went here with a group of 4 last night for dinner.  We ordered the rijstafel (rice table), a mixture of about 10 entree items served family style for sharing.  On top of that, we ordered the duck entree.  All of the dishes were fantastic as usual.  With the rijstafel, you get shrimp, beef tenderloin, chicken and egg dishes, as well as a cucumber salad and Indonesian-style crackers.  At $25 per person, it's not cheap, but well worth it due to the variety, quality, and quantity of the food.  As many people are not familiar with Indonesian cuisine, this is a great way to try a lot of dishes at once without having to decipher the menu.  There's also a vegetarian-only rijstafel option, and many vegetarian dishes on the menu using tempeh and tofu.  This would have been a 5-star review, but service is almost always cripplingly slow, which I believe is due to understaffing.  Servers are increibly knowledgeable and eager to share useful recommendations, but are often rushed through service due to having far too many tables.  For example, our server was able to describe everything on the menu up and down, and recommend that we order 3 rijstafels for our group of four, with an additional entree for even more variety.  However, when she came to deliver the food she had to rush through all the descriptions and even apologized for it before running off.  Unfortunately, she apologized several more times for things running extremely slow, but it never got better, which is a shame.  Owners, if you're reading this, add another server during peak times!"}
{"text":"Oh how this pains me! I first experienced Indonesian after living in Amsterdam and struggle to find it when we are in the States. After recently moving to Madison this place kept coming up on searches. Wistfully last night I decided to give it a whirl by ordering pretty standard affair.   Lumpia was the only acceptable portion of the order. The tauco sauce was as expected and the lumpia tasted okay. It does not come with Leeks, but more served as you'd find in a Chinese takeout place. So if you are thinking Lumpia as a dish, think again. It is standard Asian takeout vs. Indonesian style.  The Nasi Goreng was pitiful. What was delivered appeared to be Rice-a-Roni with some chicken pieces and egg. No Kerupuk? No Acar? No Bawang? This was truly a box of fried rice with some McD's style onions sprinkled on top. If an Indonesian place can't do the national dish correct, there is something wrong.  Delivery was quick and easy (Thanks EatStreet!) and the transaction from a business perspective done well. But if you are in the mood for Indonesian this will not satisfy."}
{"text":"Since there is no other Indonesian restaurant in Madison, there is no competition. Still the food is really good. Make sure to get the desserts there as well. I like the ambiance there as well - cool artwork."}
{"text":"To catch your attention...this place has some outstanding food!  Some friends invited me into their group of once a month dining at international restaurants in the Madison area.  They had not been to an Indonesian restaurant, it was my month to pick and Bandung was our destination!  Bandung is not a large restaurant, but there is plenty of space.  They have a bar area in which you can socialize, grab a drink, and even eat a meal is you so desire.  We had a group of 14, so I picked a Monday night and made a reservation.  When we arrived our table was set in place and they did not rush us from the bar area to sit, which is nice.  The food:  fantastic.  We all like to try something different (hence the group picking different nationalities each month for dining) and not a single person had even a minor complaint about the food.  I ordered the Satay - Kambing which is skewered lamb marinated and grilled, topped with a sweet peanut sauce served on a bed of Indonesian rice cakes (lontong) witha side of cucumber salad (acar).  It was all delicious.  Not spicy at all, and not too sweet.  I am not a big lamb person, but this was great.  And the cucumber salad was amazing too.  I did order the Lumpia (spring rolls) for an appetizer and they were okay, but not great.  I know the person next to me got the Krakatau Shrimp and loved it as well.  The service:  again great.  With a party of 14, it is difficult to serve everyone at once, but they did a fine job getting us the food together and while it was still hot.  Our drinks were consistently filled or re-ordered.  I will be going back to Bandung some time and sooner versus later."}
{"text":"We walked in at 8:50p and they said they wouldn't sear us because they stop seating at 8:45p.  Ridiculous. Won't have to worry about ever seating me again."}
{"text":"We showed up and it was a full house, including a party of 35.  Apparently, this party of 35 just showed up, no reservations, no warning.  Given that information, we were VERY understanding and willing to wait, because we really love the food here.    However, juggling a large party, and the bevy of usual Saturday night diners effectively was apparently beyond their capabilities.  Based on previous reviews it sounds like my experience was not an isolated incident, they just CAN'T handle it when it gets that busy in there.    Unfortunately, they only had one server working the entire dining room that wasn't part of the party of 35.  She was almost running the entire time and looked totally frazzled.  She brought us appetizers and took our order.  One hour and forty minutes later, the minor at our table was threatening to eat the napkins, and my other dining companion was ready to walk out.  Over an hour and half wait for the main course is ridiculous, but what makes it even worse was the fact that our waitress didn't stop by even once to tell us what the hell was going on.    Things became even more ludicrous when we realized that several people had come, sat down, ordered, eaten, and left in that 1 hour and 40 minutes, and we still hadn't even seen our food yet.      One hour and 45 minutes later our food arrived, and our waitress said she was sorry it took so long, that it was crazy in the kitchen because of the party of 35, and that's all we got.  We waited all that time, didn't get refills, no extra apps to hold us over, no discount on the bill, nothing.  We ate in 15 minutes and then we were done.    It was the the most outrageous, unprofessional behavior we have ever encountered in a dining establishment. They might as well have told us to \"get the F out\" when we walked in the door, it would have been less insulting."}
{"text":"I came here because I didnt know where else to get rendang beef. Unfortunately, this was the worst rendang beef ive ever had. It was more dry and less flavorful than what im used to. That being said, every other rendang beef ive ever had was nothing short of incredible, so this was still a fairly tasty dish to eat for dinner.  Although I was disappointed with my order, I find myself tempted to come back and try ordering something else. The atmosphere is cool and the service is friendly and accomodating. Plus, they do a lot of deals and specials. I feel that I wouldve given them 4 stars had I ordered something better.  Pros: friendly staff, lots of deals and specials Cons: disappointing rendang beef"}
{"text":"I'm never disappointed with the food. Flavorful and healthy. They make homemade tempeh and it's very tasty. I asked them to switch out the egg plant and green peppers in my dish and the substituted other yummy veggies. Plus there was classical guitar musicians playing."}
{"text":"Simply put, if you're eating ethnic food out in Madison, this is the place to be. Otek Otek is fantastic appetizer. These steamed smoked fish in banana leaf with sweet nut sauce are light and tasty. Opor Ayam, a chicken curry in coconut sauce, was incredible!! Pulled chicken and potatoes are transformed by the sauce into something sublime. Sambal borek papaya is also a stunning dish, and complements the Opor Ayam nicely. Green papaya is cooked to perfection and accompanying sauce is tasty and doesn't overpower the flavor of papaya. We shared dishes and the server was nice to bring out extra plates. It amounted to a great time. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Well I just order online yesterday for dinner the food taste was awful, I order martabak was burn, rendang taste blend whatsoever sate kambing and ayam taste blend also includes Tempe sorry I don't want prefer anymore"}
{"text":"yyyyyeah, i'm gonna need more stars.  (i think i maybe delayed writing this review because i subconsciously enjoy this place being a hidden little secret.....then i realized, that's not very yelp of me!)  the food here is so good it actually feels like i'm being transported TO indonesia.  or at least what i imagine it would be like there.....flavor heaven!  first off, being vegan/vegetarian does not limit you much on this menu - that's fun, and rare.  house-made tempeh and amazingly creative combinations makes everything i've had here pop.  aaaand, the staff is very willing, able, happy and a bit intuitive in helping you decide - even making up things not on the menu!  very fun.  and then add the delightful company of corey d. into the mix..... yyyyyyyeah, i'm gonna need more stars.  *and at dinner they have this cool thing that's a super sampler of small sized entrees that you choose, i want to say the name is actually dutch for 'rice table', anyway, i highly recommend that for your first time.  great way to get a broad brush experience of the place and find out what you like.  that's what i did, and it hooked me."}
{"text":"Easily the best food I had in Madison. Vegan Indo mac & cheese, mango curry, vegan thai iced tea, \"Motor Oil\" cocktail (Old Rasputin stout, Jameson, espresso liqueur in a pint glass). Quick, attentive service, and pleasant eclectic atmosphere. I want to try at least 10 more of Bandung's imaginative cocktails. If this had been the first place I went to on my trip, I might've never tried another restaurant."}
{"text":"Dairy-free mac and cheese?! In, done, delicious.  I came here for an IYE with my fellow yelpers on Trivia night. Appetizers were delicious, especially the spicy chicken wings. I could eat those all day. The star of the meal was definitely the indo mac and cheese. This plate was spicy, creamy goodness without a hint of dairy. I've contemplated coming back every day for this treat. However, I'd probably only come back on any other night besides trivia night. I thought our food came out a little later than I had hoped, but I saw some tables receive their dishes after nearly an hour. Yikes!  Overall, amazing food, great appetizers. I look forward to coming back on a night with faster service. But I will most definitely be back."}
{"text":"Did not make me want to go to Indonesia. Sorry this is so brief but there was nothing extraordinary about any part of our meal. Service was so so. Probably will not return. Very pricey."}
{"text":"I look forward to eating at Bandung every time I am in Madison. Usually once per year. The Vegetable Curry with bamboo chutes is so fricken good, you'll lose your mind! The bamboo is so tender, you'll think they're noodles! From the sound of the other reviewers, I seem to get lucky with the service. They've been friendly enough to me. Or perhaps I go at the right time, because I don't seem to to recall it ever being too terribly busy. The prices seemed fair and decent to me too. I don't blame folks for docking stars for bad or nasty service, but for those reviewers who don't seem to care for tasty international flavors nor the price of a $7.95 lunch or a $9.95 dinner...may I suggest Swanson® Frozen Foods."}
{"text":"We go here a lot for lunch work events. It's a fantastic restaurant that is interesting and delicious and we all seem to enjoy it. They don't really give a hard time about the check deal where you have to work out who owes what. They're usually pretty polite and the food is delicious!"}
{"text":"Pad Thai = 5 boom towns. It's just that good. Also, decent beer selection!"}
{"text":"Ordered the Indo Mac n Cheese w/ Chicken and was not disappointed. I love this place. I've only ordered delivery, but I will soon be making a personal visit. The rest of their menu is calling my name."}
{"text":"My husband and I went to Madison when we crossed Illinois to go to South Dakota but now I think we went to Madison for this restaurant. I am Indonesian and since I got to US my husband and I are kinda in a mission trying all Indonesian restaurant. We found this restaurant accidentally from their website. We were quite impressed by their website and it makes our expectation quite high too. When we got to the plaza where this restaurant is placed, we were just ok. When we stepped in and greeted by their staff, we felt so welcome. We didn't wait too long for the usher and our server was incredibly nice. Bandung restaurant has great ambience, neat, clean and it really brings Indonesian uniqueness by displaying some of Indonesia crafts. After we were seated they gave us water and tempe crackers, nice!! Now the food, we ordered spring rolls and martabak telor as appetizer and we both satisfied with them. They served it fast and hot and tasty. Myhusband order small shrimp sizzling. He likes if, for his American tastebud who like spicy in food he said it wasn't that spicy and for my Indonesian tastebud it is good, it tastes like the food that I ate in Indonesia. I ordered Ikan rica rica which is fish, mahi mahi in chilly garlicy sauce which is sooo nice and good. We both ordered small portion which is really small. My husband shrimps dish had 4 pieces of shrimps and mine had 2 small pieces fish. If you are hungry please don't order small portion but if you are not sure with Indonesian food, small portion is perfect. Really, if you are all interested in trying Indonesian food and around Madison area, this restaurant is highly recommended, it is really like what we have back in Indonesia. My husband and I definitely will be back for another dish."}
{"text":"Really great food, can't wait to return. Went here for a date night. Great service, started with Sayur Lodeh (great soup) and finished with Pad Thai. My date had the special and we shared our meals. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"I would be willing to try Bandung again but I would say my first experience was disappointing.   I had checked out their menu online and was debating between getting delivery or just picking it up myself. I decided to pick it up myself because there was a note that said it would take up to 45 mins. I called and placed my order and was told it would be about 20-25 mins.  I got there on time and I had to wait an additional 20 mins. I'm a patient person but if that was the case I would have gotten delivery. Also if you place your order online the prices reflect if you opt for delivery not if you pick it up (prices are higher), just an FYI. I was not given a total before hanging up so so I ended up paying more than I would have liked.   The indo mac I would say had a great flavor to it. But I was hoping for a lot more chicken and veggies and felt like it was 75% just noodles. The lumpia was neither good or bad just average I would say.  They do trivia on Monday nights if you are looking for a place to go!"}
{"text":"I was very impressed with Bandung. The first item I tried was the mango curry. It was delicious. My most recent order was pad thai with tofu and their version of egg rolls for delivery. The food arrived within 20 minutes on a Saturday evening. There are few places that can deliver that quickly, especially on a Saturday evening.   The food was hot, fresh, and delicious! The portions were huge and lasted me 2-3 meals. I highly recommend them and will definitely be ordering again!"}
{"text":"My husband and I went here for a date night. I thought the prices were pretty fair, and the service was good. We started out with beverages (I had the ginger martini, it was amazing, he had a beer).  We're both vegetarians and were impressed with the amount of vegetarian/vegan offerings on the menu.  We started with a sautéed tofu appetizer, which was pretty good. I loved the dipping sauce.  Our food came out in decent time. I had the red curry squash with tofu, as I had read it was good, and it didn't disappoint. It was really delicious, and I'd definitely get it again.  My husband went with the sate tempe, because we were curious about the house made tempeh. I think it would have been perfect as an appetizer, but it was just way too much as a main course. If you REALLY love tempeh this would be perfect. As it turns out, we weren't such big fans of that one, but the peanut sauce was excellent.  We did end up ordering desert, which I assume wasn't house made (some sort of caramel cheesecake), and it was decent.  All in all, we would for sure go back."}
{"text":"I love asian food. I've been to most of the asian restruants in Madison, and I have to say, this has go to be the best one in town. Pad thai, I know, is kind of cliche, but man I think Bandung has perfected it. They have many other unique and wonderful indonesian meals also, some come sizzling to your table! They are very vegetarian friendly. They also accept Bitcoin!"}
{"text":"Second time here with fellow employees. Great atmosphere and food. I recommend ordering the Rijstaffel. It is Dutch for \"rice table\". Make sure you have a group of 5 or more so you don't get charged a sharing fee."}
{"text":"Oh gosh, I don't even know what day my boyfriend and I went in, but it was definitely a lunch day sometime before this past Christmas and I will just say that when a place boasts about having the best Pad Thai in town that they better have the best Pad Thai in town. And they do! On top of it our server, a younger lady with brown hair, was incredibly professional and super natural and nice. Good service is always a win. We were the only two in and we were attended, but not over looked after. We also god shrimp with sweet tomato sauce and rice. I can't remember the name of the dish, but it was very good. Moderately priced and good atmosphere."}
{"text":"Cool place to eat. Awesome cocktails as well as food. I love the coconut cocktail and the Ikan Rica Rica. They just opened a bar."}
{"text":"Cheap eats Sunday through Thursday in the bar area. Select dishes (pad thai, Indo mac & cheese, something that was vegetarian that I don't remember the name of, and fried rice) for $5. Portions are more than sufficient for one person and are tasty (try the Indo Mac & Cheese. It's really just noodles with a red curry sauce, bamboo shoots, and your choice of protein). Thursday night at 9pm there is adult trivia (X-rated!) in the bar area (aka The Nutty Bar) so be warned. The bartender makes a good Mai Tai."}
{"text":"I was expecting an authentic indonesian restaurant in madison. reason is that there are many indonesian student in Madison. but apparently, not. don't get me wrong, it is not bad, because the food is now tailored to american taste. I'm kinda surprise to see soo many people in the restaurant, and I'm the only non white. I ordered empek2, sayur lodeh, tahu and some other items. the food don't even look right (close), but it don't taste even close to what it supposed to be. if you think you've taste indonesian food and you think that place taste good. wait till you taste the real good one. it will blow your sock off.  good place to get to know indonesian food. but for people who are looking for good indonesian food, not here."}
{"text":"Great food.  Take a long time to get it..... And why no one offer desert at the end? You can make more money..."}
{"text":"Delicious food!! Tons of great options for vegetarians and omnivores alike. I recommend the Rujak Cuka, vegetable curry (the seasoning was unlike any other, I loved it), and the tempeh. I ordered delivery and received exactly what I requested!"}
{"text":"I'll be honest, I've eaten here off and on for the past 6-7 years and have ordered the same two dishes every time.  We peruse the menu, say 'oh, that sounds good' and then proceed to order the pad thai with only vegetables (no meat, no tempeh) and the ikan rica rica (mahi-mahi with a sauce so flavorful it puts us in a trance).  Both are, obviously, are delicious (hence the years-long trend) and consistently good.  The service is perfect, and the ambiance is warm and welcoming.  They've added a bar with live music and craft cocktails.  My husband and I did not partake in either, but I spotted some patrons on the dance floor which was a delight.  We've tried the lumpia (egg rolls) a few times as well.  The sauce that accompanies them is fantastic, but the rolls are forgettable and the little chips on the side are crumbly - my only criticism!"}
{"text":"Very accessible from madison downtown for lunch. There is a lunch portin and you get lumpia with it. You will never get bored with the tempe."}
{"text":"I've eaten at Bandung many times, both in the restaurant and via delivery. It's always very tasty and fast! However, I just had a pretty terrifying realization -- this restaurant does not take allergies very seriously.  I have an egg allergy and I've made that explicitly clear every time I've eaten at the restaurant. This evening, after ordering, I got a phone call informing me that they have *always* marinated their meats in egg. How this hasn't made me sick in the past is beyond me, but hopefully this can serve as a warning to all you fellow allergy sufferers out there: Bandung may not take your allergies seriously and may serve you food that contains the allergens you've warned them about.   If you have any serious food allergies, I'd recommend avoiding this place entirely."}
{"text":"Extra star for the incredible service! The hostess was so so attentive, it was like being invited into someone home. I am really impressed!  The food was very tasty! I went with the vegetable curry, and it was mild, sweet, and well balanced. The portions are pretty decent for one person, but if I went again, I would want to try more dishes, family style."}
{"text":"My new favorite!  My boyfriend and I checked it out after being wowed by their award winning beef dish at Taste of Madison and we're so glad we did. The menu makes me feel like a fool because I can't pronounce anything on it but the servers are kind about correcting and helping you learn. It hardly matters anyway - as far as I can tell everything on it is delicious!   Go here if:  You love tempeh, in which case, prepare to have your expectations exceeded.   You want to grab dinner after 9pm - a constant struggle for the boyfriend and I with late work hours, so thanks Bandung!   You'd like to eat outside - it's cozy and there always seems to be open space.   What's with you Madison, how is Bandung such a quiet, well-kept secret? They have a good beer selection and solid pairing suggestions on their menu. Honestly - is there anything Bandung hasn't got going for themselves?"}
{"text":"My wife and I both had the Pad Thai - incredible! Best Indonesian food I've ever eaten. Food was fresh and light, but filling. Will definitely be back and will tell our friends. Well done."}
{"text":"I can't resist their food, especially the gulai kamping, it the best food considered as a piece of art, delicious, traditional, and well prepared.. You can make it spicy if you enjoy spicy food as I am.. I honestly order it with extra extra extra spicy.. Everything they offer is good spicy or not.. Is it so far my favorite restaurant here in Madison.."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch and it was relatively empty, but I was at the tail-end of the lunch hour.  I ordered the pad-thai and my sister ordered the indo-mac. We ordered tempeh chips as appetizers. The chips were interesting, but in the end tasted like fried chips - similar to potato.   I thought the Pad Thai was good, but not the best I've ever had. It was very sweet compared to most other pad thais. The heat level left a bit to be desired and they don't give you the choice to order spicier.  The bite I had of the indomac was good. It has a very weird mouth feel - very creamy. This dish was also extremely sweet - sweeter than the pad thai.  I'd be very interested in coming back to try a curry."}
{"text":"I ate here a long time ago but was impressed by the peanut curry I had and the friendly service. The waiter was knowledgeable about what was vegan or what could be made vegan.  The atmosphere is pretty nice here, too and the restaurant could serve as a good date spot."}
{"text":"A lovely restaurant with tasty food! I've been here a few times as a couple and in a lunch group and always enjoyed the food.  I wowed my friends by setting a birthday lunch here and they even let me bring in my own cake.  Everything on the menu I've tried so far has been good but my favorites are the crispy cat fish dishes, all three are wonderful.  The lunch special is a good deal - a choice of appetizer and entree for about $10. We tried the egg rolls and cream cheese fried wontons and the wontons were a big hit. I only have a few downsides that lost this place a star.  First, they have terrible parking that's always full because of the nearby restaurants.  We had issues all getting spots and almost gave up and left. Second,  they only had one high chair for kids. I guess it's not a family oriented restaurant but we had two toddlers in our group and couldn't seat them both in high chairs. Last, the lighting needs to be a little brighter. I can understand a dim light for romantic dinners but at lunchtime it was way too dark. Other than those complaints I love this place and will go again and again. Plus, their lamb is halal!"}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite restaurants in Madison. The first time was for a rehearsal dinner back in 2003. It is located in a small strip mall and the outside looks pretty average. Inside, it is pretty with lots of Indonesian art on the walls and dim lighting. The food is the real show stopper though; I especially love the rendang curry. The seafood and produce always taste really fresh. They are clearly all about quality products and bold flavors here. Can't wait to go back next time I'm in Madison!"}
{"text":"Nice variety of Indonesian dishes (several vegetarian, with tempeh!) and drinks, creatively presented. Food was tasty, well presented. I had the mango curry with tempeh, a small portion size which was just right. It was all so delicious we forgot to take pictures before gobbling it down.   Can't believe I haven't visited this place for as long as I've lived in Madison. Will be back."}
{"text":"Bandung's food exceeds expectations.  Although it was slow for the waitress (who turned out to be the helpful and cheery manager) to get to us at the start, everything else came in a timely fashion.  The spring rolls are amazing, we had to order seconds which swiftly came out.  The chicken pad thai claims \"best in town\" and I couldn't agree more.  Definitely check this place out!"}
{"text":"Good food and service. Been there multiple times. Tried the red Thai curry and the yellow curry rice which tasted amazing. Nice music too !  Went again and this times favorite - Mango curry with tofu :)"}
{"text":"I hadn't been here in years and was happy it hasn't lost quality. Our party of four had the Pangsit Goreng as an appetizer. It was good. I wouldn't necessarily run there to get it again, but it was fine. Beer list was good for an Indonesian restaurant. Local and regional micros were available. The entrees and service really shined. We had: Indo Mac, Pad Thai, Sambal Goreng Udang and Holy Basil Stir Fry. Everyone was very happy with their entrees. The Indo Mac was near PERFECT. Great flavors and perfect heat level for me (could've been spicier, but I would've enjoyed it less. I had a wonderful heat left in my mouth).  Serving sizes were spot on for dinner. I can't wait to go back and have the Indo Mac again."}
{"text":"We got takeout from here. I appreciated the parking lot - quick in and out. Staff greeted me right away and was helpful. Prompt service, many vegetarian options. The food was solid - I got sambal goreng tempeh which was really flavorful (some tempeh dishes can be bland) with a bit of heat. The most notable thing is that they take Bitcoin here!"}
{"text":"I don't understand.  I just don't get it.  Why doesn't this place have a bajillion reviews? There's nothing else like it. Why is it that nobody knows what I'm talking about when I mention it?  Why is it always empty at lunch?  Maybe people are so overcome by the flavor profiles they aren't certain what to write?  Maybe I don't know enough adventurous eaters?  Maybe everyone goes there at dinner?   LUNCH IS WHERE IT'S AT YOU GUYS!   Dishes range from 8.50-11.00, pack quite a punch and offer up the perfect amount of food. This is probably the one place in town where I don't get the same thing time and time again, because the menu is so interesting... so diverse and it'll take you months to try everything.   I thought I had a favorite, you can read my earlier review, but the catfish today blew me away. Sweet, salty, spicy it had everything I look for but didn't leave me feeling over full. The crisp veggies and perfectly portioned rice round out the meal. And if catfish isn't your thing, eye over their other seafood options. They are plentiful, and servers are equipped with tons of knowledge about each dish.   Go. Eat. LOVE.  I look forward to the day I go at 12:30 and they say, \"Sorry it's going to be about 25 minutes until we can seat you.\""}
{"text":"Want to keep your bandungkadonk in shape? Try the variety of fresh, healthy Indonesian and fusion dishes at Bandung.  I highly recommend the Ikan Rica Rica, a filet of mahi mahi served on steamed vegetables and covered with a delectable spicy sauce.    The service is a little slow, probably because everything is made from scratch, but the very flavorful food is worth the wait.  They have a good beer list with several exotic offerings such as Lion Stout from Sri Lanka.  The 10 percent off entire bill with Yelp check-in is a nice bonus."}
{"text":"Awesome food and good service. Takes awhile to get food but worth it. Squash and eggplant curry are 2 favorites. But, another outstanding dish was a catfish special they have on occasion."}
{"text":"Their pad Thai is the best in town (as advertised!!) and the environment is really cute. I go to this place like every month and absolutely love their pad Thai and thei egg roll!!"}
{"text":"Good vibe, love the food, strangeish bar. Enjoyed pad Thai with chicken most recently."}
{"text":"Yesterday 11/28 ordered dinner from Bandung and item named Tempeh Goreng had all white fungus inside it, DISGUSTING!!"}
{"text":"In the mood for comfort Indonesian food? It exists!  We ordered from Bandung about a year ago, and I know I loved my indo mac n cheese. We somehow never made it into the building itself until a Yelp Elite event. Yay!  Nice interior, and especially nice bar area. Big and open. The bartender was sassy and funny, and made us some great cocktails. Helloooo, Thai Iced Tea. We also nibbled on bites like cream cheese filled wontons and chicken wings (well, Derek did that one).  For our meals, Derek got chicken pad thai and I got the tofu fried rice. We ordered them off the small bites/happy hour menu. SO cheap! Derek's pad thai was much better than my fried rice. It was peanut-y and not too sweet. My fried rice was just a little too dry for my taste, but I liked the flavor overall. And each plate was piled high.  Thanks for a great treat! Can't wait to visit again and try something new."}
{"text":"I had Indonesian food in Amsterdam and love it.  We don't have any Indonesian restaurants in Minneapolis-St. Paul, so I was excited to find one in Madison, WI!  Upon review of the menu, I found about 6 or 7 different entrees that sounded great, and had a hard time choosing. So I asked the waitress about something I'd tried in Amsterdam: an arrangement of small plates with samples of many things on the menu.  And, great news - it's called \"a rice table\" and they had it (but it wasn't listed on the menu, so one has to have some insider information - or a proactive waitress). For $26/person,  you get to try many things and walk away a satisfied customer."}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoyed our experience at  Bandung! It was pretty slow when we stopped there on a week night, but service was still a bit slow. We didn't let it get to us, though. The chicken pad thai and curry eggplant were both tasty!"}
{"text":"I ordered ahead while I was waiting in a car wash line.  My order was ready for me when I arrived.  I was asked if I needed any utensils and I asked for a fork.  Minus a half point for the spork.  I would have asked for chopsticks had I known.  When I got home and unwrapped my items, everything smelled wonderful.  I got the Pad Thai with chicken.  It is a generous portion with a nice little kick.  Always use the lime wedge that is provided.  I also ordered the Beef Sate served with rice and Acar.  This was good but a bit different that I remembered.  The peanut sauce was thicker and bolder.  After I scraped some of it off, I really enjoyed the beef.  I might ask for the sauce to be added with a lighter hand or on the side next time I order that.  The Acar is always good.   This restaurant is a gem of Madison and I need to remember to stop in more often."}
{"text":"The best fried rice. The best pad thai. The best little cream cheese wonton things, the name of which I never remember. AND!? The best happy hour type special in town.   Seriously. You can get an appetizer, a heaping pile of pad thai, and a beer for about $12 if you eat in the Nutty Bar (the bar inside of Bandung).   Their \"cheap eats\" menu includes a bunch of favorites including thai fried rice, pad thai, indo mac & cheese, chicken wings, those cheese wonton things, and more. SUCH a good deal, and it is of the same quality as the restaurant menu.  Added bonus - the Nutty Bar has a nice low-key trivia night on Mondays, some of the best specialty drinks in towns, and some super friendly bartenders.  By far one of the best spots in town!"}
{"text":"We had the opportunity to visit this restaurant for dinner last night while we were in Madison for a night. We got seated right away however it took forever for the server take our order. We finally had to ask them to take our order.  The restaurant had vegetarian options which was really good for us. We ordered a cold salad as appetizer and a mango curry with jasmine rice. The food was phenomenal. I guess I can say the wait was worth it but not when you are starving.   I am not sure if I would visit this particular restaurant again as there are a lot of other cuisines and options for meals in this university town."}
{"text":"The flavors are awesome. This is coming from a person who makes Indian food, so i know flavors and spices a lot. I am coming here next time too. I had catfish (Kari Lele) and it was tooo good."}
{"text":"I went to Bandung with a friend today and it was relatively quiet. We ordered 2 appetizers, 2 entrees, and Thai teas, for under $65. We came away very satisfied, everything was unique and full of flavor.   Details on each dish below:    Drinks: I'd highly recommend getting the Thai tea. Its a sweet, refreshing drink not unlike Vietnamese Iced coffee.   Appetizers: We ordered the pangsit keju and Martaban tetor to start. Both were fantastic but portions were pretty small. The pangist keju were little deep fried cream cheese balls. Similar to crab rangoons, but the filling was much tastier and had a good spice. Martban tetor were little pastries filled with ground beef and rice noodles. I'd describe them as a great 'egg roll' alternative.   Entrees: For entrees were ordered Daging Rendang and \"the best pad Thai in town\". The Daging Rendang contained savory beef and potato pieces that contained complex flavors and spice. Highly recommend it. The pad thai was perfectly spiced and had all of the classic elements you'd expect. I've tried quite a few pad thai's and I'd say this is definitely one of the top takes on the dish."}
{"text":"This is the second time I have ordered delivery from Bandung and I am beyond impressed! Not only with the quality and flavor of the food, but by the delivery speed and complete order accuracy. Can't say enough good things about this restaurant! Would give more stars if I could!"}
{"text":"Overall, it was a nice ambiance but I found the food underwhelming. The tempeh chips were yummy, but they needed some sauce to go with them. My husband and I had Sayur Lodeh which was yummy. The rice was served too far before the entrees and was cold by the time the entrees arrived. We were in a large group, but there is no excuse for cold rice. The Mango Curry and Holy Basil had too many bamboo shoots and not enough tempeh. Also the tempeh was very bland.  Additionally, the Holy Basil dish tasted like licorice (which I don't like) and did not say it on the menu which is odd. The best part of the meal was the dessert, Mango Sorbet. Not enough for us to return however."}
{"text":"I always order for delivery from here. For the last (almost) 2 years, I've been living abroad and ordering Pad Thai remotely on Thursdays for the Pad Thai Palooza. When I still lived in Madison, I would order it for my father, Co Workers, and myself, now I'm just ordering for my father for this tradition that will never stop. The wait staff and people answering the phones (well done, Matt Long!) make it so easy. I'm excited to actually go in and have the Pad Thai there in person as I remember it as Pad Thai don't here in Israel is not as authentic."}
{"text":"Hands down our favorite restaurant in Madison.  Another fun ethnic food option in town.    Favorites here include the Oseng Oseng Tempe (they make their own tempe on site), and the Holy Basil with chicken.  Meals are flavorful with several options depending on your tastes.  Also they often times have discounts available through Groupon or the local Bucky Book so look around if you plan to stop."}
{"text":"The Pengsit Goreng were really tiny and couldn't taste anything but ginger and pepper in the Curry fried rice. Food here is expensive and the 2 stars are for also for the quick service and friendly staff."}
{"text":"I have been here twice and each time the food was underwhelming. Not bad, by any stretch, but quite bland. I am not sure if that is specific to the genre (I have never tried Indonesian food before) or if it speaks more to a restaurants attempts to cater to the midwestern palate. Be that as it may, I would never proactively choose to go here; that being said, I also wouldn't reject it if suggested by a friend."}
{"text":"Ok, I preface this with the fact that there was a LARGE indonesian community back home where I lived, and there was probably a significant portion of my life where I existed on Nasigoreng and lumpias.... Was this healthy, hell no.  But I was 14 and had the metabolism of, well.... a 14 year old... Sigh.. those were the days..  So everytime I go to Bandung, I am a *tiny* bit saddened that they don't \"do it like they did back home\" (he he he... that sounds.. ahem!).  Which is why I've started having cocktails before.  Their Long Island Iced Thai Tea is a dream.  It's EXACTLY what a LIIT should be, a poor excuse for trying to get as much alcohol as possible in one container.  Add the creamy goodness of a Thai tea, and WOW... you've got a sweet and exotic drink that will satisfy the masses.  The lumpias are so crisp and delicious.    The nasigoreng...well... I've had better, but they do make a good job at it, I WILL say.  I think it's got to be something with the tofu.  I *thought* they don't season the tofu, and thus when you eat the nasigoreng, the rice and veggies are really good, but maybe if you leave the rice for the next day, the taste will seep in the tofu.  Well.. Thanks to their GENEROUSLY sized portions, this is exactly what I did.  I tasted the nasi the next day... PERFECTION.  Too bad I can't exactly recommend to them to give me last night's nasigoreng.... hehe.  Fried banana dessert (hey, I'm ALL about desserts), is a dream....."}
{"text":"A disappointment. I used to LOVE Bandung, but it has certainly gone downhill.   First off, we were a group of six and initially we had a very charismatic and attentive server, but midway through, they switched us over to someone whose service was a bit slower, but not entirely bad. So, overall, service was probably the best aspect of the meal.   The meal itself was bland, flavorless, and unfulfilling. The curries were soupy and lacking meat. We had the following for appetizers: martabak telor, tahu goreng, pansit goreng, rujak cuka. The tofu was tough and flavorless in the tahu goring, the rujak cuka was $5.95 for garnish, the pansit goreng was a tasty little fried, stuffed wonton but wasn't particularly inspired, and the martabak telor was flavorful but much too greasy.   As for the dinner entrees we split the following: daging rendang, gulai kambing, kari lele, and red curry squash with tofu. Squash curry is my all-time favorite food but it was reduced to an insipid coconut-flavored puddle with a few pieces of squash, eggplant, and tofu when we went to Bandung. For fabulous squash curry, avoid Bandung at all costs and head to Lao Laan Xang or Sa-Bai Thong. Unfortunately the curse of watery curry also afflicted the gulai kambing. The other dishes did not leave lasting impressions, with the exception of the kari lele, which was spiced nicely, but woefully overdone.   ***All of these things didn't make the experience of dining at Bandung one-star-review-worthy. However, the party in the next room did. The restaurant hosted a \"private\" party in its adjacent room (note: only a wall separates both rooms and there are open doors). The party was not private in that we heard everything happening, including the most atrocious karaoke singing heard by sober ears for approximately 30 minutes (someone even attempted to sing \"Bohemian Rhapsody\"). This was not a good environment for a friend whose parents had just come in to sit down for a leisurely meal with him and his friends.***  Not cool."}
{"text":"Wow! This is a solid 4 stars authentic Indonesian Restaurant in the middle of Madison Wisconsin. Geographically and Climatically about as far away as you can get from Indonesia, I am surprised at just how good and authentic this place is.  I was so excited about this find, that I ordered about 3 times more food than I needed.  The peanut sauce rice cakes, the satay, and the squash curry were my favorites. The dark peanut sauce is deliciously addictive."}
{"text":"Excellent food.  Great staff; both very friendly and very patient.  Lots of vegan options (and nonveg as well).  If you ask for spicy, it will be spicy.  I love the heat.  Plus the homemade tempe is delicious too.  I wish it were closer to me in Chicago.  Right now it's the closest Indo food to me."}
{"text":"The food was always good there. The only reason I did not give it five was the seating, it was too small a table and people have to sit really close. I am not a big fan of being close in person and the table also made it hard to order a lot of things at the same time."}
{"text":"It had been a long time since I'd been to Bandung, and I remembered it being delicious so my husband and I stopped last time we were in Madison.  The service was great, the drinks were good, but the food was all very bland.  There's so many good restaurants in Madison, we definitely won't be returning to Bandung again."}
{"text":"I recently moved downtown and now Bandung is a 2 minute walk from me, which sounds dangerous.  Surprisingly, I've only ever gotten takeout from here - even before I moved downtown. Their takeout service is quick and they have you sit at the bar where they give you water and make sure you're taken care of.  I ordered the Eggplant Curry to-go. I loved it. They gave a really good portion. I couldn't finish it. The curry wasn't too spicy either, which is perfect for me.  In the past, I've gotten items with tempeh. They cook tempeh really well! Their vegetarian dishes are really good, so definitely bring your vegan/vegetarian friends here!"}
{"text":"I've dined at Bandung of my own accord and with a Yelp event, and both trips were unique in the dishes and flavors I was able to try.  My first experience here was on a chilly day and I ordered the perfect entree to warm up. I settled on the Pad Rum Mit, which was chicken stir fried with broccoli, fresh mushroom, napa, baby corn and pea pods in a light spicy garlic sauce. White rice was served alongside the hearty plate and made for a great deal of food.  The next time at Bandung was with Yelp and we sampled the pangsit keju (cream cheese wontons) as a group. I then ordered the Gado Gado as my entree, which was a steamed green bean, carrot, cabbage, broccoli, bean sprouts, egg and tempeh topped with mild peanut sauce. The peanut sauce made the plate. Without it, I would not be loving this dish so much as the combination of cooked and raw veggies, along with the ever interestingly textured tempeh, was weird. When topped with peanut sauce though, I could pretty much polish the plate.    I will certainly be back to try more of their dishes once the weather cools down and curries begin calling my name."}
{"text":"We wanted something different but still Asian or Asian-ish and Indonesian fit the bill. So we came across this cozy restaurant with bar attached in a quasi-industrial strip mall next to a bike shop off the corner of downtown.   They make their tempeh in house and in my opinion it was the highlight of the dinner. We tried tempeh in the Sayur Lodeh (veggie coconut soup) as well as a complimentary side of Tempeh Chips. The soup was a bit bland but the Tempeh Chips were better. Texture was good. Tasted more fresh than tofu. The other appetizer we got was the Otak Otak, fish cake in banana leaves. I've had a couple fish-type-things in banana leaves, but never fish cake. It was really good and came with a spicy sauce.   For the main dishes, we got the Bebek Bekar (roast duck) and daily special which was yellow curry over mung bean noodles with Tempeh. The curry was good from start to finish. The duck came with a sliced breast and a couple pieces of leg. The spices were phenomenal and the texture was spot on. But the sauce it came with was just a little too sweet. It reminded me of Chinese Peking duck (it may be based on that) but a bit sweeter.   Prices are fair and you get 10% off with Yelp check-in. Service was very friendly."}
{"text":"no offense but the waiter or the server should really need to learn that the rice and the curry should be placed into two different boxes to go!"}
{"text":"Long Island Thai Tea is the best drink ever. The house made tempeh is incredible. I ordered a small portion but I should have gotten the regular size. All four of us loved our food. Try going during happy hour at their nutty bar for really good deals on food and drinks."}
{"text":"I am giving this 3 stars because we all thought the food was delicious. The wait staff was horrendous! We did not have a reservation and were told there was a 20-30 minute wait, so we decided to wait. The waiting area has some tables and what appears to be a bar. We were handed a drink menu and when we decided and tried to order we were told they could not get us a drink as they were all too busy waiting on and bussing tables! In our 30 minute wait, we never got a drink. We waited forever for the one glass of water we had for the evening. Our water glasses were never refilled, we were never asked if we wanted a second cocktail. Every time a server came to our table (there were a total of 4 throughout the night) they apologized for the wait, the slow service etc., but it never got any better, The place was full, but I do not think that was the reason for the poor service. This has to be the worst run place we have ever dined at. One person in our party ordered a martini with an olive. When it arrived, no olive, but a promise of one soon. It was at least 10 minutes until the olive showed up. Our food was tasty, but small portions and pricey. We had a gift certificate, but failed to let them know ahead of time. I am pretty sure they tack on 18% for having the gift certificate!!! We noticed the sign on the way out to tell them prior to ordering that you have one. I wonder if our service would have been even worse then??? All in all we were there over 2 hours and had the worst service of our lives! I can't imagine not wanting to improve it. Judging by the other reviews here we were not the only ones to experience this"}
{"text":"Went in for dinner today and thoroughly enjoyed the food there. I ordered a nasi goreng, aka Indonesian fried rice, and thought it was superb. It was dry and very flavorful. I will definitely come back the next time I am in Madison."}
{"text":"I love Bandung!   I've been in a handful of times now, and every visit has been a wonderful experience.   The cocktails at the Nutty Bar are fun and creative. The Thai Long Island Iced Tea is truly an amazing creation. Be careful, they go down easy!   As far as food goes - omg. You will not be disappointed. We always start with the satay skewers. You can get it in chicken, tofu, lamb or beef, but I prefer the beef. Tender, succulent morsels of steak served in a creamy, flavorful peanut sauce. The peanut sauce, for real, you could put on anything and make it wonderful.  I've tried a few of the noodle dishes now and I don't have a favorite. They have all been really great. Flavorful, well spiced, good texture.. you can't go wrong.   Service especially has always been on point. PJ has been the bartender a few times when I have been there, and most recently he was our server. Super attentive and offers great suggestions.   Overall - 12/10 recommend!"}
{"text":"Good food. A great selection of dishes. The atmosphere is very relaxed but several dishes are on the pricier side."}
{"text":"My third time here, this time for drinks and dinner before a show. Pretty awesome place! The guy in the kitchen knows his stuff, the staff is super nice and friendly, they have a great happy hour and bar menu and you gotta get the mega-satay (beef). It's certainly my new place for Phad Thai. Yum!!"}
