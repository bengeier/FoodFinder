{"text":"If you are Foodie like us and enjoy weekend unique breakfast places Or midweek this is a MUST!  The service was great and the chef came out to the tables and talked with patrons. The waitress was super knowledgeable and even gave the history of the chefs. There are delicious cookies, muffins, and doughnuts. They have all kinds of coffee drinks as well or mimosas and more. They smoke their own meat on their patio which was yummy. We enjoyed eating outside on their awesome patio.  My husband & I think it the BEST  in Vegas. yum!"}
{"text":"The prickly pear mimosa is a great drink to start off your day, there are also many other flavors where that came from and a good selection of beer. After getting some mid morning drinks in me I then moved on to the tostadas for an appetizer, they were damn good with a great combination of flavors. For the main course I got the Green Chile Pork Belly, great portion size and an excellent pairing of flavors. There are few things I love in this world and brunch is towards the top of the list, if you're anywhere in the Las Vegas area this place is worth the trip to come and check it out. Little chilly right now hit the outside patio area looks like a great place to have a Sunday brunch get together."}
{"text":"After we arrived we were told it would be a 5 minute wait before a table for 2 would be ready. Of course this was fine. I requested to be outside and have a high chair for my son and decided to wait inside in front of the hostess stand to enjoy the ac before moving outside. During my wait, several parties came after me and got seated before me, so after 30 minutes I ran out of patience and asked about the status of our table. It was ready as soon as I asked and the hostess just told me she forgot about us! Remember, I was standing in front of the hostess stand 5 feet away from her all this time! Then she guides us to a table inside and I told her we requested a table outside. She said that they put all the tables together outside to make them available for larger parties, but half of them were empty and when I checked in she did not mention that an outside table would not be an option. Did she just tell me that I did not get what I requested and that I waited for 30 minutes and other parties went in front of me because my check would not be generating sufficient revenue? I did not want to make a big scene and decided to take the table inside, but at that time I already felt so unwanted! As a paying guest in a restaurant! We ordered and ate the food but no matter how good the food could have been, we had a nasty taste in our mouth that would not go away. We ate quickly and paid our bill and went on our way. It's a shame that I did not enjoy this place at all, because we just moved into the neighborhood and usually like to have a \"go to place\" and this is not going to be it. The 2nd star is for the wait staff because they were nice and I can't blame them."}
{"text":"I love when I came in here how friendly the staff was, the food was excellent, fast service will be coming back in the future"}
{"text":"Small, confined area. This place can get busy with some crazy wait times. Food was good, light, not too heavy on the stomach. Ran out of monkey bread"}
{"text":"This is a place to stay away from.....please help boycott this place until they clean up their unsightly garbage cans and trash surrounding their restaurant.  The health department ought to shut them down.  The local neighbors have fought with their incompetent management for months on this issue.  Please stay and away and support local businesses who don't trash our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Food is great however service is terrible. Been there over 5 times because the food is good but service fails every time. I don't mind the long wait for a table however service has to compensate the wait. This was my last time, waitress forgot to put order. Took her 15 min to check, never she came to tell us until I got up and asked. I have seen people leave before because of service or lack of. Overall, the food is amazing, just the service and wait times are out of hand."}
{"text":"I went today with some Friends for first time. Cozy place , café amaizing And my Classic benedits extreme delicioso. Service excelente. Totalmente recomendable!"}
{"text":"The best breakfast and lunch spot! The food is always amazing- every dish is great. The staff is friendly and accommodating. You may have to wait for a table, but it's definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"On the way from LA to Vegas, Had the pork belly eggs Benedict ... It was heavenly. Will be back to try the rest of the menu items, very interesting creations. Wish I live around here!"}
{"text":"Food is good. The vibe is warm and inviting.  But the wait time is absolutely horrible and there are always multiple open tables.  That is the reason people go in and buy pastries and coffees before their meal. ..they are starving.   Also, the host staff ignores you even when you are standing right in front of them.  Not an isolated incident.  I've tried the restaurant a couple of times to check.  I'd love to go back.  But,  there are too many other options where the operational flow is dialed in."}
{"text":"Best place for breakfast. We went here on a whim to try something new and didn't regret it. One of our new favorite places to eat breakfast."}
{"text":"Duck confit omelet was delicious, although I did not get much of the duck flavor, it was still good. There were so many good things on the menu I need to come back and try. Such an adorable atmosphere, very cozy and quaint. Did not get to try the monkey bread or cinnamon rolls because they ran out, but I will definitely need to go back for those. Took my vegetarian friend here and she loved it. We tried the egg white frittata and the vegetarian eggs benedict, both fantastic and a must try!"}
{"text":"I live in the MacDonald Highlands development, across from Kitchen Table. I was excited when a new breakfast restaurant opened up! My husband and I attempted to go one Sunday, but wait was 25 minutes... We left.  We tried again the following Sunday and we were seated in less than 5 minutes. I had the short rib Benedict with foie (additional $13) & mimosa. The short rib itself lacked flavor, potatoes were good. My husband had the Egyptian, it was too simple for his taste and Crafthaus IPA beer. Servers were friendly, but waited a bit for our drinks and food.... A guy who arrived AFTER us, got his food before us!! The staff all seemed to know him, so it seemed like they serve base on favoritism. I really wanted to like this place.  Hi Antonio,  Thank you for taking the time to respond. I think it's awesome to acknowledge regular customers. I feel customer service tends to lack in some restaurants these days. So it's nice to hear your staff takes the time to meet expectations. Though for the record, the gentleman did not order poached eggs and oatmeal. It looked a lot more elaborate, such as a country fried steak."}
{"text":"Antonio gave me the most amazing service! He catered to my cousins allergy (gluten and dairy) needs and made it an amazing experience. I've been coming here ever since they opened and will continue to keep coming back! The food is on another level. There's nowhere else like it! Love this place!"}
{"text":"Great food, great service!  We had the pork belly benedict and the chiliquiles... both outstanding.  Antonio, the chef/owner, came over to introduce himself... not only talented, but a nice guy!  We will be back... often!"}
{"text":"If TEN stars were possible,  I would give this place ***** ***** Ten stars.  Food - Started with the monkey bread. Served in a mini cast iron fry pan, it was delicious, I ate it all through my meal, and then had a little for dessert. Shorty - Braised Short Rib Benedict,  as awesome as can possibly be!  Service - Every single staff member was smiley,  energetic, and happy as can be!! Excellent staff,  working really well together.   Decor - In a generic strip mall, but the open kitchen and big country style tables provide the perfect brunch atmosphere.   And then there is the expansive patio, with a big smoker,  to make all that pork extra delicious."}
{"text":"I've been here before. My fiancé loves the food. But the wait time is incredibly long. Knowing this I called the day before and asked how best to avoid the long wait. Their advice was to call in and put your name on the list an hour before. So today I called at 12 pm arrived at 1pm the hostess told me that they were waiting to seat a table of eight and they were backed up... ok so we stand in the corner full of other people also waiting for tables. 15 minutes go by I check in and am assured that my name is at the top of the list. They start seating some of the people around us who have been waiting. 30 minutes  go by I again check with the hostess and was told the owner is making them seat people ahead of us because of business deals and they are doing as told in order to keep their job.  Another 15 mins go by after they seat a party of six who arrived after us and we finally sit down. A grand total of 1 hr 45 mins of waiting...This is a terrible way to run a business"}
{"text":"Another yummy breakfast/lunch/brunch spot in town. Yummy, diverse menu with gluten free options. Wine and champagne available plus coffee bar. Maybe not the best place to take kids but you can. The place is small and not very fast on service so be prepared to wait and have to talk loud to your dining companions."}
{"text":"The food is still good, but the recent experience, which was yesterday, was not so good.  We arrive at the restaurant around 1:20 pm and waited about 30 -35 minutes before seated. We were place at the 2-person table right behind the check-in counter.  If you have been to the place you know exactly which table I am talking about. It took us less then 5 minutes to order our food (around 2pm) , but it took the kitchen 45 minutes to prep our 2 entrees.    It would have been a okay experience, except 1) the kitchen ventilation was insufficient, so while we were there we sucked in enough burned kitchen grease to last us till the next visit which wont be soon; 2) the 2 person table needs to be removed or avoid it at cost.  It faces the kitchen where the greasy smell is overwhelming at times and staff bumps your chair everytime when he/she need to get/drop off utensils and plates.  Very annoying!; 3) please improve your food prep time!!  45 minutes for 2 entrees - a Frittata and a shorty, was excessive.  We come the restaurant on average once a month; however, due the recent experience we won't be coming back soon, unless the location improves it s ventilation system and improve its food prep time or I have 3 hours to kill and missing the greasy smell of the kitchen."}
{"text":"Fantastic food! Tried the Crispy French toast, Meatless Benedict, & Monkey bread...all delicious!"}
{"text":"Fantastic food . We went on a Wed at 1:00 so there was no wait and we had superb service . I had the Croque Madame & my husband had traditional French toast , served with amazing syrup & whipped cream . A guest near me commented on the salsa so I asked our server for some . Yes... I know ...not a traditional accompaniment for a Croque Madame but it was amazingly good salsa. We will be back ...often. Sit outside if a nice day."}
{"text":"This place is beyond amazing and is our Sunday ritual to have breakfast at! We always get the monkey bread, which I can't spoil because you have to experience it yourself! But their menu is simple and designed to leave a great taste for you to comeback and help yourself to a different type of dining. There are tables designed for you to sit next to a complete stranger bench-like but allows you to be open and able to ask your neighbor what they are having to eat! They even have tasty desserts to finish it off. Overall a great experience dining there and recommend it to everyone in the henderson/ Las Vegas area, I'm sure they get many visits from all over! Kudos"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying, the only thing saving this place is the food. Aside from that, don't bother coming here unless you want poor service and long waits. This is my third time coming to Kitchen Table and most likely my last. After waiting for 30 minutes for our table we ordered iced coffee and monkey bread only to find out there was no ice or any monkey bread. We then ordered our entrees only to wait another 45 minutes for our food to be brought out. To make it even better, we watched three groups of people who sat after us get their food well before we got ours. Although the food is very good, the experience as a whole was severely lacking."}
{"text":"Very good food and service was excellent.  The owner came out and greeted us. Never had that happen before  Shows a lot for him to do that   Will definitely refer people to this place and come back frequently"}
{"text":"The breakfast taquitos are amazing!! They have a great variety of comfort food with a twist. The biscuits and jam are my fav to start out with."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast for the first time on a Friday.  Figured the wait wouldn't be too bad.  It wasn't - waited about 15 min.  The food was good - I got the huevos tacos and my wife got the ham and cheese crepe.  The tacos were good but wouldn't get them again.  It came with potatoes that were cold but had good flavor.  I had to ask twice for ketchup.  My wife liked the crepe other than said the ham on the top was cold.  She slso liked the mimosa.  The place was busy which appeared to be due to no one wanting to sit outside.  The service was weak. No offer to refill coffee but the coffee was good and came with real half and half not just the little non-dairy cups. We will go back and try different things."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch with my sister just before noon and it was packed! We had to wait about 30 minutes for a table but it was worth it. The waiting area is small but the blackberry mimosa made it seem not so bad. We ordered the pork belly Benedict and the country Benedict and they bother were delicious. Great contrasting flavors and the eggs were cooked perfect. The portion size of the potatoes was pretty small and they were not that warm but no big deal. Will definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"It was Friday morning, walk in there with a friend, told the hostess, we just needed to grab a bite to go. She showed us to the table at the casher, to order. Granted it was busy but common courtesy, the cashier could if said, we will be with you in a minute, that would've probably made me wait longer than the 8 minutes standing there being ignored."}
{"text":"Hype, hype, hype. I've honestly had better. Don't get me wrong, the food is pretty good, but their service is non-existent. We waited an hour to be seated then another hour for our food to be brought out. They don't even seat ppl in order that they arrive; they seat by preference. I understand that seating is limited in such a trendy and new restaurant, but having such a cocky attitude doesn't help for their lack of accommodations . I probably won't recommend nor will I be back considering there are many other brunch spots that satisfy your appetite without making you feel like you're an unwanted nuisance."}
{"text":"I've been here 3 times, each time I've tried to go for something different, there's a lot on the menu. I like their biscuits and jam, but the biscuits haven't been as good as the first time I went. I like to get there when they open to avoid the crowd of people, so maybe I shouldn't expect fresh biscuits, they seem like they're from the day before. BUT they're still good. The empanadas and taquitos are really good, too, and you can really taste the corn masa in the empanadas.  Everyone is always nice and attentive, I'm sure the service is also a reason people keep coming back."}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast meals my husband and I have ever had!! Great service and amazing food."}
{"text":"First time here, over 45 minutes and no food yet. Waited 20 minutes to get a table. SMH. I was going to finish this review when I got the food, but still no food. The restaurant decides to comp the meal which was very nice of them. Food did come and was well prepared. No issues with the food itself. Very good quality. Sad that the tardiness ruined the meal."}
{"text":"I read about Kitchen Table from Eater Vegas on Facebook. Learned it was up the road from my house so checked it out for a late lunch with my family.  Food was absolutely outstanding, didn't take long, came out all together. Prices are fantastic for the quality of food. We ordered the pork belly Benedict, Jersey Joe sandwich, and bacon and egg bagel. Wait staff was great.  Host staff was the only reason for the loss of one star - we didn't receive a normal level of customer service to be expected when we entered. An enthusiastic greeting/farewell would have been the icing on the cake.  We enjoy supporting local businesses so will definitely go back to try to sweet side of the menu and coffee."}
{"text":"Went to breakfast this morning. Place is kinda hidden in a corner.Nothing special. Food was ok!  There were a lot of servers but none of them care to pay attention when I waived for help. They just walked past our table and pretend that I did not try to get their attention."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that the food was very good, but unfortunately the service was some of the worst I've ever experienced.   My boyfriend and I decided to try this place this past Saturday and expected it to be busy so we didn't mind waiting. We decided to sit outside as it looked less crowded and there were seats in the shade. However the hostess took us to a table sitting directly in the sun even though there were two empty tables in the shade next to us. Apparently those tables were reserved for friends of the staff and manager (who did not have to wait in line to be seated and already had their food on the table upon arriving 10 minutes after we did). The silverware and glasses were too hot to even touch but there was no where else we could sit.   My boyfriend wanted a cinnamon roll to start with and the waiter said they were out. Two minutes later I see him bring one out to his friends at the table next to us even though they didn't order one! Throughout the whole meal we needed refills on water since it was so hot sitting in the sun but all the waiters and manager bypassed us to talk to their buddies. Even when we tried to ask the waiter about items on the menu he would interrupt us to talk to his friends. Our waiter did not check on us until he brought the bill.   My boyfriend always finishes his meal before leaving a table but we were both so annoyed and hot that we just gave up and took most of our food to go. The service here was so poor that I probably won't be going back, which is unfortunate since the food was tasty. The staff needs to focus on taking care of paying customers instead of hooking up their buddies."}
{"text":"Restaurant is fantastic. Best breakfast in town. If you're looking for something healthy the vegetable hash is amazing. If you're like me and go for flavor with a little bit of chubby to it, then the biscuits and gravy are the most unique meal I've had there to date. I've been to this restaurant 3 times and about 5 daytime. And it is yet to disappoint"}
{"text":"Have enjoyed the kitchen table many times before but today I must tell you today was the best.  I ordered the pastrami sandwich, recommended by my server.   It was by far the best pastrami sandwich, outside of  Katz's Deli in New York ,that  I have ever had.  The meat was warm and flavorful.  The bread fresh and the condiments perfect and accompanied by the home made chips-the perfect lunch.  I highly recommend the Kitchen Table-always good. Always fresh and very enjoyable."}
{"text":"I have absolutely nothing bad to say! I was looking forward to the monkey bread and when I was told they were out of this our waiter then brought me a yummy berry twist goody! The croque Madame was well worth the Saturday wait of only 30 minutes ( not too bad for us from Seattle ) my only complaint could be that I am not here long enough to try everything on the menu.... Blessings from the Foodiette"}
{"text":"After reading several good reviews about Kitchen Table in Henderson we (three of us) took the 15-20 minute drive to Henderson from the strip. The restaurant itself is tucked away in the corner of shopping center and not easy to recognize until you see the temporary signage the have hung outside. upon entering you are immediately struck by the amount of delicious looking pastries in the front with the kitchen immediately to its right and an expediting table in front. The dining room is attractive and spacious and will love it when the outside temperatures allow dining.  The three of us got the sausage sampler, smoked salmon and caviar blinis, and deviled eggs to start followed by three different egg benedict preparations and the french toast with foie. Loved the coffee, not the best I have had in Vegas but very enjoyable. The sausage sampler, with the two dipping sauces (maple syrup and a bourbon one) was fine, not great. The smoked salmon caviar blini were excellent bites and well delineated flavors. The deviled eggs were just ok. The thing that threw us off was how chilled the eggs were. I'm not sure this is a health department requirement, serving devil eggs chilled, but for this preparation it stunted the overall flavor profile of the dish.  The three different eggs benny war a bit of a mixed bag with the Pork Belly and Shorty better than the Country. The complaint about the country is while all the ingredients separately are great, we were not sure the biscuits held up well enough to act as a vehicle for eggs benny. Alone the biscuits were great but the one quality that makes a biscuit great, tender and flaky, detracted from the dish as a whole as the biscuit soaked up all the gravy and egg. I'd also say that the fried steak itself really lacked a great crust seeming a bit wet, as off the oil was not up to temperature for frying. Just my guess. Finally, the french toast and foie was fabulous. The caramelized pears with the nuts worked great with the toast and when you added the foie to the bit, simply bliss. My one gripe, which seems to many peoples complaint, was the minuscule size of the foie. At $22 they really need to step up the cut of foie to justify the fare.  Finally the best part of the meal was the staff and owners. Holy cow! What a pleasure it is to dine at an establishment that has such attentive, nice, proud, vibrant and beautiful people! From the bubbly hostess, wonderful waitress and nice owners, the Kitchen Table is what makes for the perfect start to any day in Las Vegas. I highly recommend, if you have transportation, making the trip to Henderson to start any day when you are in Las Vegas or if you live there."}
{"text":"This was my first time and definitely will not be my last here! The service was great! The food was amazing! The Chef (Pedro) came out to make sure our food was up to par. And the manager Sarah went above and beyond to make sure my little service dog, myself and a friend were well taken care of on the patio. Service like today's was hard to come by and I can't wait for their new location to open! Also, try the pork belly bene, SO GOOD!!!"}
{"text":"So I will admit I checked out this place due to Yelp. This is a for sure EXCELLENT Yelp recommendation/review.  I went in Thursday around 9am. Semi busy but not super. My party of 2 was seated quickly.   The service was excellent. We had an appointment we had to make at a certain time. Asked for our check, received it promptly. Drinks were refilled with barely any wait time. Even after signing off on the check, our server came back to make sure everything was still going OK! That is a star within itself.   The food was PHENOMENAL! Believe the hype , it is real. I am from Texas and since moving from there, chicken fried steak is a hard thing to find done right. This place does it well. So well, it is now my second favorite chicken fried steak. My dude ordered french toast. He doesn't normally take food home. He took this home.   Don't be surprise if while eating other tables will talk to you. This place attracts a happy crowd. The only sad thing is they don't do dinner. Yet if you feel like my dude, one specialty is a great thing!"}
{"text":"This place was so cute! And the food was so good!   This is the perfect spot to drop by for a good brunch. Keep in mind that this place gets packed. Be ready to wait, but it'll be well worth the wait. You'll find traditional breakfasts dishes here and some with an added twist. I swear, they really craft on quality of the food and aesthetics here. The place was super clean and from the looks of the food we ordered, it was obvious that presentation of their food should match the setting of their restaurant. I'd love to be a regular here if I lived in the area!  Tip: Try their spicy Jalapeno Bacon! Each bite is filled with spicy (and tolerable) goodness."}
{"text":"Very noisy and in the summer the air conditioning isn't very good.  The wait was 45 minutes or more and the hostess admitted our wait was longer because a friend of the chef showed up with some friends and took our table.  That might not have been a big deal except the restaurant is so small.  There was a singer that was ok but way to noisy to talk in a breakfast place.  Not all the food got there at the same time and we had to start while one person waited almost five minutes for her food.  The food was very good but if I was nitpicking there was very little hollandaise on the eggs Benedict.  They have food to go which is the way to go, since the food is good but everything else brings it down. The service was marginal at best and my friend said the rest room  was a mess!"}
{"text":"The best food I've had in Henderson. It has a farm to table vibe that I like. The food is unique (something Henderson lacks) and you have the option of eating healthy if you want to. I've had their veggie hash and I think it's delicious. Also, the coffee is great!"}
{"text":"I heard a lot of great things about this place, and so I decided to come try it out! After being here 10 min, I ordered a cinnamon roll and doughnut. Once I bit into each, they weren't soft and weren't tasteful. Not to mention they were out of monkey bread and have only been open 2 hours.. Their response was \"early bird gets the first worm.\" However, this is really just a lack of leadership and preparation. They need to prepare ahead of time for the amount of food people will buy. That's how corporate chains thrive. Made me feel like this is such a \"baby\" company. From a business standpoint you have to know what's popular and over prepare, because at the end of the day, it's about making a great experience for the customer. On top of that, the server wasn't very kind, criticizing our order and kind of making fun of it when asking questions about healthy omelette options. Also, all of their boosters and high chairs don't have buckles for safety. Huge parent's points fail. Overall, I will not recommend this place to anyone that I talk to because the food is mediocre and so is the business side of the restaurant. They have a lot of room for growth before I come back and spend $13-$15 on a meal. If you expect me to pay for high standards, you better match what I'm paying for."}
{"text":"Pretty good.. excited for the opening at Grammercy.  Henderson location is packed"}
{"text":"Food so good I forgot to check in and write a review while I was there. Foie French toast is best French toast I've ever had. My only regret is that I cannot eat here every week."}
{"text":"Breakfast is exquisite here, the Chilaquiles are delicious and so are the pancakes. The white sangria is tasty. Highly recommend it ."}
{"text":"Heard about this place from word of mouth.. Had Benedict ham. When food arrived I asked for salt took a bite and didn't need It. Favors were great. Will be back"}
{"text":"I made the dumbass decision to eat here on a Sunday at 1:30...it was worth the money. I had the pork belly Benedict. Very tender BBQ belly and delicious. It came with real home potatoes. The potatoes were too salty but tasty.  The food here is 5 stars. I give the joint 4 stars because it's just so fucking loud. Hordes of taking people crammed into a small space and then on top off that din the restaurant is playing loud fucking pop songs on top of it. My ears are still ringing. I would suggest eating outside or going at an off peak time. I'll go again but not on a fucking Sunday."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and never disappoints. Personal favorite is the Pork Belly Benedict which is delicious! Also tried the Shorty Benedict, which is also a great dish, but still not my favorite. Accompany your meal with their creme brûlée latte and you're set!"}
{"text":"My family and I LOVED this little place.. great food, great service and loved the set up.  Hot chocolate with large charred marshmallows is to die for!!"}
{"text":"I had the country Benedict and it was delicious. The steak was very good for chicken fried steak. Breading was delicious too. The biscuit hit the spot and poached eggs were perfect. It came with potatoes. I could eat those potatoes all day long.   Very filling! I only ate half."}
{"text":"The most amazing breakfast in town. Make sure you check this place out!! Sausage sampler is amazing, mimosas are amazing, and everything else."}
{"text":"Loved. Loved. Loved. They even accommodated for my little nephew's food allergies. Wonderful place for brunch. Make a reservation!"}
{"text":"Geez.. Everyone's a food critic on Yelp.. Look, if you are looking for basic breakfast that you get at \"basic\" breakfast joints, then you're probably only in it for the huge portions sizes and you don't truly appreciate good quality food, put together whole heartedly.. Kitchen Table brings you a wide variety of traditional breakfast and lunch with their own twist.. Quality food, tasty dishes, portion sizes were perfect and not overwhelming, which is how breakfast should be.. Staff is personable, polite and fun. Chef Antonio is very friendly and I never saw a smile leave his face. He loves what he does and that's enough for me.. I plan on being her once a week;) Did I mention the DONUTS... Oh my gawd, the donuts! If you're looking for the same old boring breakfast stuff, you won't find it here, the food alone gets me excited, every time. If you've had the same hairstyle since 1986, Kitchen Table is not for you, unless you're ready for a change. The right people will love you guys! Keep up the good work!"}
{"text":"OMGosh! Their food is incredible. So delicious.  Everytime I come to visit - I have to stop here!!!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for months now and have LOVED the food but the service has always been lacking. The wait time has always been long, so we always prepare to have extra time when eating here. But the food always has us coming back! We ate breakfast here this morning and it was very pleasing how fast and wonderful the service was. I believe they have a new manager named Sarah. She came to our table to greet us and make sure everything was great. A wonderful change of pace. Definitely will tell everyone to try it out. If only the baked goods at the front counter were back...seems the selection gets smaller each week. But definitely a five star breakfast joint for us!"}
{"text":"Well, all I can say is that - it says something when two Jews (NYC and Israeli) are agreeing that there are zero complaints to complain...  Great place...!"}
{"text":"Oh how I would have loved to try this place. I tried twice within two days. I was so excited to go for Mother's Day and asked if I can make reservations I was told no,if you're coming early morning just call ahead an hour. On Sunday morning I called ahead and they put me down for 8:45 a.m. we arrived and they were busy which is understandable because it's Mother's Day. It took about 5 minutes to check in and when I did the girl said she didn't have me on her list she would check with another to see if I was on that list. 5 minutes later she came back and said she had the table but could not seat us because they were behind. We would need to wait another 20 minutes just to sit down. There was no way we could do that with having a 19 month old with us, again, why I called ahead.  We left and that pretty much ruined Mother's Day.  I was still very excited to try it so, today,  on Monday,  I figured I would go in and grab something to go with my little boy. I walked up to the to go bar and there are three people standing back there all talking amongst themselves and don't even so much as bother to acknowledge me. Then,  they look at me and all walk away from the counter.  I have been in customer service, as well as business development for over 20 years and this is not the way to run a business. I called to speak with a manager and was asked who's calling and I just do not have time for this. I figured it would be best to articulate my experience online for the manager to look over."}
{"text":"Awesome food, friendly and attentive staff, great ambiance and did I mention the food is mind blowing!!! Had the pork belly Benedict and it had so many wonderful flavors, the sweetness of the pork belly, the savory flavor of the egg and sauce, the spiciness of the jalapeño, the tartness of the greens all blended so nicely. Will definitely return again!!"}
{"text":"Kitchen table in Henderson has got to be one of the finest Breakfast Brunch lunch type restaurants that I've ever been to. They have a wonderful staff amazing food and the Ambiance is beyond great. Not only do they have the indoor seating which is a lot like family style they have an outdoor section with tables both in the open and under canopies with music playing and just wonderful to sit in  when the weather's nice. Again the food is really amazing. They have unique dishes that may not seem to go together but when you try it it's absolutely amazing. If you're in for a great brunch lunch or breakfast, it's worth the drive no matter where you are in Vegas"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! First time eating her and the ambiance is great! Nice chill little spot with big flavor! Pork belly Benedict was delicious! Definitely coming back asap!"}
{"text":"4.5 stars  I treated my dad for Father's Day and they had live music (a guy with a guitar), which was a nice treat. Although the wait was long (as expected--about 45 min to an hour), it was worth it.   I ordered the Duck and Cheese omelette and I guess I didn't believe the menu when it said duck confit and Mac and cheese. It was so good (and heavy!).  My dad ordered the Meatless Benedict which has fried green tomatoes, a poached egg, avocado, etc and comes with fruit. I didn't try it, but he said he enjoyed it.   Service was good overall, I think our waitress was a bit difficult to flag down at times, but I don't really remember so it must not have been that significant.   I'll definitely be coming back to try more of the menu!"}
{"text":"This was an OK experience. I wish I would have tried other items then I had. Our server was a little scatter brained. Flavors were a little bland but their pork was very good. It's worth a try but maybe not worth the drive. Our crepe was under cooked and the chilaqueles were missing color and flavor. Hollandaise sauce was good and the pancake was very good."}
{"text":"I first visited with some friends for lunch and I was pleasantly surprised. We waited about 20 minutes for our table and were seated outside under a nice, big, shady umbrella. The wait staff was very friendly and helpful. The food was delicious! The cinnamon roll with a twist is warm with icing, you just have to finish it. I can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I came here because of all the raving reviews - it's was my 1st time and I only came and bought from the counter to go - I'm SAD to say that my hostess was not the happiest - I got the impression that I was interrupting her ..... FIRST impression are everything!! Another try another day"}
{"text":"This place is so good we go out of way (when traveling through Las Vegas) to stop for breakfast. Our standard plan is to check out of our hotel in time to have breakfast or brunch here before heading back to Arizona.  Creative dishes, healthy ingredients and good vibe."}
{"text":"My wife and I arrived at around 745 on Sunday morning to try and beat the crowd. When we were greeted we were told 5-10 minute wait( there were at least 6 tables inside that were available). After waiting 10 the hostess informed us it would be another 5-10 minutes because they had to set up the patio tables and the server had not arrived yet for that section. We were finally seated at the patio and placed our order at 830. Our server never apologized for the wait or delay. In fact his only words were to say \"I'm so tired, I got off from my second job at 3am\" . Our food arrived shortly after 9. My wife ordered the traditional Benedict and I had the Chorizo Omelette. The Benedict clearly sat in the kitchen window as by the time it arrived to our table, the medium eggs cooked through and the potatoes were ice cold. The flavor in my omelette was great, but also cold. When we asked for salt and extra lemons, our server casually went to the service station on the patio and stood and talked with the other servers until my wife had to go up to them and remind him about the salt. Finally when he returned to the table, he made no apologize for the delay and another snide comment of \"did we chop down enough lemon trees for ya?!\" All in all, the taste of the food saved this from a zero star review. It doesn't matter how good the food is if the hostess is unprepared and the service staff simply doesn't give a damn. I don't think we will return. There is comparable food and much better service at other local breakfast joints."}
{"text":"I can't review the food because we couldn't even get water. We were seated at the back and every time we thought we were getting water they didn't make it that far. After a while they seated someone at the front and water was given to them as soon as they were seated. No one cared when we left. It is extremely noisy there."}
{"text":"Food is so good. Still working out kinks I think. Waiter was not very good. Had to literally get up from table to ask for drinks since we didn't see him for about 20 minutes. Wait staff really needs some training. I might be picky since I've been in restaurant business for 19 years managing. I hope they can get it worked out. Great concept and owner is awesome to fix what goes wrong."}
{"text":"We have been to the Kitchen Table once before and absolutely loved it. That time I had the Smoked Salmon Benedict.   Today our meal was not that great. Started off with cold coffee then my husband's kielbasa was cold and did not taste completely cooked. I seem to recall that they served big country potatoes last time. This time they appeared and tasted like they were from a store bought frozen package.   The oatmeal was nothing to write home about. Despite the menu reading that it had raisins & dates, mine was served with 1 raisin and 2 very small pieces of date.   I don't know if today was an off day but we will definitely be back in hopes of finding a great breakfast again."}
{"text":"My nephew referred me to this place and it was excellent! I had the pancakes with the tart peaches along with a side of jalapeno bacon and my husband had the chorizo omelet it was quite delicious."}
{"text":"Our server was Mike. Ladies if you flirt with him and give  a nice tip he will give you free bottles of liquor and free food your next visit. Also your food will look and taste fresh.  Men and kids you have to ask twice for drinks, extra plates and etc. Your food will look not fresh and look like it was sitting out for a while."}
{"text":"The service and the food are next-level. As a cook myself, I appreciate the quality of food and the menu selection here. I am always greeted warmly, the staff are excellent, and the low prices and gratuitous portions always surprise me. This restaurant is the gold standard of the area for sure."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday around 11 and our wait time was 1 hour and 45 mins., which ended up being about 45 mins. The place is pretty small, semi clean, and workers who didn't even want to look at you because they were so busy doing other things.   We decided to wait and in the mean time ordered a muffin. We stood there for a good 5 mins. for someone to even look at us and ask if we've been helped. I thought that was poor customer service for how many workers walked by and were fixing drinks right in front of us. At least take the time to look up and acknowledge us.    Other than that, the food we ordered was pretty good.  We tried to get the monkey bread and the empanadas but they didn't have either. We had the egg shooters (4/5), duck and cheese omelet (5/5), the burger (3/5), fruit crepe (4/5), and the salmon Benedict(3/5).    My husband liked it more than I did, I'm not sure if it was because of what I ordered. Maybe next time I'll have to choose something else."}
{"text":"I had the Egg Mac Kitchen Sandwich (close item in the photo) and the Ms. had a Montecristo (far item in the photo). The Egg Mac Kitchen is an egg, guacamole and potato sandwich which was excellent! The Montecristo left much to be desired. It was very dough-y and lacked flavor except for the raspberry fruit topping. I had an ice tea which was great-and I'm not a big ice tea drinker."}
{"text":"There were 9 ladies and two toddlers.  The food was great and our service was excellent with Griffin.  Thanks a bunch for making our ladies breakfast outing fantastic!  Oh, and the hot chocolate with charred marshmallows was very tasty. We will definitely be back. Very casual dining."}
{"text":"Absolutely insulting treatment for their customers   Arrived at 9:00 am was told would be a 15 to 20 min wait   30 minutes later was told maybe 20 more minutes   They could care less  We left  Will never be back and will tell others about my experience"}
{"text":"This place is overrated and not good. Food was nothing special and was overpriced.  Was charged extra for an open food item for no reason and no explain and signed for custom tip and was billed higher than I signed for, I called back out of principle and it was just blamed it on their \"computer system\" felt like it was shady and the manager was unapologetic."}
{"text":"Lots of people here on Saturday. Mostly brunch crowd but I had lunch. A chicken sandwich with chips. Very good. Monkey bread was good too. Nice outdoor area so a good pick when the weather is nice. Kinda small inside. Noisy. Prices are right. About 15-20 a person."}
{"text":"Love this place.  The second time I've been here and have enjoyed both of meals so far.  And who doesn't love a mango mimosa!  The menu is exhaustive.  My goal is go go through every item they offer!  Great service!  Thanks for being so close and fabulous!"}
{"text":"Very good can't wait to go back. Wanted 10 items on the menu but only got four.  We had the donut, which wasn't over sweet good texture 4 star, tostada 4 star, taco huevos omg great comb of flavor's, and last the chilaquiles was great. Waiter was great, and the owner  I'm assuming came around and made sure everything was to our satisfaction."}
{"text":"This place rocks! Excellent food, fast and riendly staff, highly recommend. May need to wait for a bit to get seated but they offer beverages while you wait. Grab-n-go menu is almost as full as dine-in menu and receive food very quickly."}
{"text":"The Kitchen Table is open for business! A warm, friendly and social atmosphere that truly brings the community together.  When you walk in you're greeted by a collection of fresh and perfectly-sized pastries (muffins, donuts, coffee cakes). You're a guest, better yet, treated like FAMILY...and you're sure to return for another morning. I wouldn't want to start my day any other way! Try the almond-cran muffin, the walnut maple donut, and/or the coffee cake - nothing here disappoints."}
{"text":"I came here for breakfast and my expectations were blown away! We had to wait a little for our table but it was so worth it! The staff recognized this and our service and food were outstanding! I love eating at busy restaurants because that means the food is good! I will be back and bring as many of my friends as I can! This is the perfect place for brunch! They had a lot of gluten free options for us as well!"}
{"text":"Wait for a table long. There were a couple of empty tables when she took my name but I'm sure there was a reason. So I went in to order mimosas to help take the edge off from my hunger. I stood at the counter for several minutes without any acknowledgment. There were a few people back there so I wasn't completely sure who to ask for my order. I finally just interupted the gentleman who stepped to the register asking who could take my order. He said he would. I waited another few minutes to recieve my mimosa. Granted, they were busy. After about an hour (and 2 mimosas later), we were seated. After all that, the service (Landon) was excellent and the food tasty. The Mr had the Pork Green Chile and I ordered the Foie Mac Muffin. We started with the Bacon & Egg Shooters and Breakfast Taquitos. The chile was fantastic and shooters were yummy if you don't mind a creamy deviled egg. The muffin was good too but probably try something else next time. The Taquitos were not our favorite. Overall, I would probably go back to try something else at an earlier or later time to avoid that long wait."}
{"text":"Very good find. Breakfast and brunch only. Creative and delicious menu, beautiful breads, and muffins! Gets pretty busy but well worth the wait. Every item I have seen looks amazing. They have beers and mimosas. The only downfall is No Bloody Mary's. Loved Griffin our waiter too but they might need a little more staff but very cool place."}
{"text":"I hate posting a good review because that means more people will go.  But seriously, best brunch in Henderson.  Just use the wait list on Yelp to avoid a long wait on the weekend."}
{"text":"I really only have one word. Delicious.   Coming from San Francisco, I'm really picky about the quality of ingredients that go into my food. You can tell that Kitchen Table uses the best stuff. Their food just tastes better. Anyone who is a food snob knows that I'm talking about. When you consume a lot of locally sourced ingredients, the other stuff just tastes bad.   The staff was also pretty great. My girlfriend and I stumbled in after an all-night dance party and the hostess bemused us, asking questions about our night.   All in all, a very delightful and surprising experience. This California girl is discovering that Vegas has some pretty good local eats and Kitchen Table is one of them."}
{"text":"The menu has limited options, and some food are only available on the weekend. Nonetheless, it's a cute restaurant with outdoor tables. Services were great but a little slow. My french toast was super yummy, but the cappuccino was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"Awesome. I know that word is overused, but it's the only one to describe this place. Others have commented on the nice decor and patio, but the food is truly eclectic and extraordinary. I had the smoked salmon wth quail eggs and caviar, placed on small pancakes and it was phenomenal. I ended up sharing some bacon and eggs with my husband, the eggs were perfect, as was the bacon.  Very good service even though they were quite busy during lunch; no wait due to one of the communal tables we sat at, which gave a nice sense of community because of briefly chatting with other diners.  All the other tables were individual ones like other restaurants. The chef is personable and has a good rapport with customers. If I could give more stars, I would. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"This is a new favorite brunch spot. We started out with the bacon and egg shooters, the avocado toast with poached eggs are so good.  Snickerdoodle latte sub with almond milk or the Mexican hot chocolate are literally to die for.  The pork belly Benedict was very tasty but I really enjoyed the meatless one a little bit more.  Something about a fried green tomato!!  Don't forget to get a bucket of mimosa.  Personal favorite was guava and blackberrry   Loved sitting outside on the patio.  Such a beautiful restaurant inside and out. This is a must stop for brunch or lunch.  The plates come out so beautifully that you don't even want to eat it.  Finish off your meal with monkey bread and your day will be just right. Thank you to all the staff for taking such great care of us."}
{"text":"Place is amazing. Visiting from Pacific Northwest where food is everything. This place does not disappoint. Chef greets you and ensures quality. Don't miss out!"}
{"text":"I called ahead of time to reserve a table for inside they told me 20 -25 mins so I got here in 20 mins when I show up they didn't even put my name in the waitlist then later they said I have to wait for he next table to leave and I was fine with that then next table was sat by someone else I got up to confront them to see why we didn't get seated and they said I have to wait another 30-45 mins worst customer service I'm never coming back here again it's become unorganized ever since owner wasnt here, he was sooo nice and we knew him even before he opened up and loved the food here but the team has been slacking lately and it's no longer in my to go place to eat anymore don't go here if your hungry, place is soo bad!!! Get a new team!!!"}
{"text":"Once upon a time I left a 5 star review. After my experience this morning I'm changing that rating and never coming back which is unfortunate. We sat outside where we ordered breakfast. Someone in my party who happens to be gluten intolerant ordered gluten free toast. The toast was brought out and she took a couple of bites and determined it probably wasn't gluten free. We call someone over to take it back. Here's where it goes bad. The manager came over to apologize which didn't end up being much of an apology but more of an opportunity to sound incredibly stupid and racist. She stood at our table and said \"honestly our kitchen is all Mexicans and they don't get it\"  Um excuse me? Hold up real quick as I pick up my jaw off the floor.   Fast forward 2 min, a blonde girl with a nose ring brings us the rest of our food and stands in front of our table looking at the food she's carrying as if she's never seen breakfast items in her life  \"Here we have the ummmmmmm.......toast?\", she says looking at the plate.  It was eggs in a basket off the menu and some other egg dish one of us ordered ?Like wtf. Honestly I was waiting for Ashton Kutcher to run out with a team of cameras for the newest edition of punkd  I'm completely appalled that a manager would have this type of attitude towards her team. Along with being offended, as I'm a proud Mexican American, I'm embarrassed for kitchen table. I can't support a business that makes racist comments about their employees"}
{"text":"We went this past weekend with a friend that was visiting us from St. Louis.  Certainly a busy venue.  Our service was good and the food flavor and quality was very good.  The reason I only gave it 3 stars is because I felt it was dirty. My wife and her friend both mentioned how dirty the restrooms were. I also found the kitchen area to be quite dirty. For a restaurant that closes at 3 pm you would think they could maintain a cleaner restaurant."}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about this restaurant. The food is incredible, the ambiance is enjoyable and their prices are fair.   Definitely one of our favorite locations to grab breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"The place is.nicely decorated and has a homey feel, with a couple of family style tables. The menu is varied, if oozing with \"trendy.\"  My wife ordered pancakes, which were outstanding, served with an excellent maple.syrup. My daughter had the tacos with egg and avocado and thought they were good.  So, now the reason for only 3 stars. I had the  \"Country Benedict\", which is chicken fried steak, on top of two biscuits, topped with poached eggs and a chipotle, sausage gravy..This dish should be all about the gravy, which is where the dish went downhill: the gravy resembled a chipotle bechamel, rather than a sausage gravy, with the mild spice and smokiness of chipotle. The biscuits were okay, along with the chicken fried steak - nothing to write home about. The potatoes had lost most of their texture.   The server forgot the one coffee that was ordered and never offered refills of the water. We finally flagged down another server for refills.  Also, the woman moving the food to the wait staff area had long hair with no hair restraint worn and rare use and change of gloves without hand washing in between."}
{"text":"Food was 4-5 stars, service not so much.  We waited about 30 minutes, hoping for outside but there was a large party taking up all the seats.  Seated inside and after about 10+ minutes no one had come by to offer water or to take our order.  About 15 minutes in someone (not our server) came by to fill our water and we said we had a bit of a time limit so could we get a server?  She took our order.  While we were waiting for our food to arrive, our \"server\" came by to introduce himself and tell us he knew what we ordered and it would be out shortly.  It did come quickly, and it was delicious.  I was disappointed that our \"server\" never came back to see if our order was correct, or if we would like fresh drinks (we ordered mimosas while we were waiting, and had three empty glasses on the table).   About halfway through our meal the \"server\" brought the check, put it on the table and said \"no rush.\"  Still didn't ask if our food was okay or if we would like another drink.  Our party of three all looked at each other and said \"eh, not sure if I'd give this place another chance.\"  Too bad because the food was great!"}
{"text":"I have been there twice. Would have given it 4 stars for first visit. Second visit I had the monte cristo. Could have been delicious however I've never seen a fattier piece of ham.  I would definitely give it another try.  Just really turned off by the fatty ham."}
{"text":"Food is excellent but 3 stars for slow service. I went on a Saturday for brunch and they need more servers. A pet peeve of mine from working in the food service industry is having too many tables that you can hardly deliver the experience the customer wants. Please hire more people for your brunch rush! I got the avocado toast it was delightful."}
{"text":"Great food served hot.  Brunch w/old friends so wanted to linger w/service that would be attentive but not hover - - which staff provided.  Assortment of egg dishes were great as was the pastrami on rye."}
{"text":"We had the breakfast taquitos, the ham and cheese crepe, the country Benedict, and the chilaquiles. All were very good! Oh and we had the original French toast which was probably THE BEST French toast I have ever had. Very impressed! We will be back :) High five for the diffuser going in the restroom too! Nice touch!"}
{"text":"After being told we'd have a 35-45 minute wait, and then checking back at the 35 minute mark only to be told it's going to be 20-25 more while we watched people -who did not check in online- get seated first, they'll never get my business. Hopefully they can teach the hostesses how to tell time......"}
{"text":"Finally.... a breakfast experience that has all the finest ingredients. .. atmosphere. .. service... and unbelievable , home made comfort food! You have to experience this Gem! It has become our number one place for our family!"}
{"text":"Ok let's be honest about this place,I drove all the way to Henderson to try it,I met my friend for brunch at Kitchen Table,I did not see her for a whole month so I wanted to pamper her to a nice place,I've heard about this place from other people and looked on Yelp! And all this great reviews made me want to try it! First off my friend said she wanted to go to Denny's,I suggested this place! Kitchen Table its behind some garbage dumpster,kind of odd.,even though there's a sign that it suppose to lead you to the restaurant it still hard to guess where it is.After driving around we made it! Yayyyy!! Walked in,no one greeted us,they had a 25 min.wait,we didn't wait that long. While waiting I looked around,crowded,loud and small restaurant. I really wanted a cup of coffee while we were waiting so I got up to the counter where the register is at,the girl behind it was talking to a server they both were drinking soda I guess,they both knowledge me,but no one care to ask if I needed help. Their pastries on top of the counter have no cover,so I wonder if it's safe to eat you know! What if someone sneezes?? Hmmm,have health department been there?  At our table.while we were trying to have a conversation it was impossible to listen to each other,seats are weird  and tables are just to long,we had to like lean forward on the table to be able to hear! (Too Loud)  Looked at the stapled menu they have,everything sounded good for two hungry friends,I ordered the country style Benedict,with potatoes and eggs,because I told my friend I wanted to eat like a pig (not thinking I was going to get leftovers)my friend ordered the pork belly one! Food came out quick it smelled good,first bite was interesting I thought I was eating at Denny's,my friend even said your steak looks and taste like it's been in the freezer for months,I laughed! Hers was too greasy. We rushed ourselves out,because we wanted to have a nice conversation.,our server never bothered to ask how was everything! KITCHENTABLE I really wish you the best!"}
{"text":"I come here all the time and the service is amazing and Chef Antonio is absolutely amazing!!! food is unbelievably good. I don't believe I will get sick of this place. the caramel iced coffee is so bomb and the pancakes are a must."}
{"text":"Our first great breakfast experience since moving to Vegas. Everything was soo good. Although stuffed we left wanting more. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Grand service, the food is yummy and the waiters are quiet nice at Kitchen Table. The one thing I hate the most in Kitchen table is people singing some country music or whatever and most people are trying to eat peacefully and converse with friends and family. there was also this whining patron that continuously said his eggs looked bad tasted bad and it looked fine. I tried just some of the eggs Benedict and their eggs are amazing. I think that person was a lunatic. 4 Star but I recommend it enough as a great place."}
{"text":"I got the traditional eggs benedict at 230 in the afternoon. It was well seasoned and very hot. It was a nice place - I did not try one of the more unique dishes but I will be back! You can see their awning from the road - when you park you will walk thru an outdoor courtyard to access the restaurant."}
{"text":"I joined a friend here for brunch a week ago. We made sure to get there early to beat the crowds and it was a good thing we did. It was a very cute and quaint place. I got the strawberry shortcake french toast with a side of bacon. It was pretty good and was more like a dessert. I never get french toast, but I love strawberry shortcake. I was happy with my dish. The service was OK. I'm sure I'll be back."}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our lunch there today.  Food was good and nice sized portions.  I did order a salad that never came but after eating my sandwich I couldn't have anyway.  There were a few mistakes but I know I'll go back."}
{"text":"Unfortunately i just tried ordering while I'm driving so I can pick it up on the way home, and they refused to take my order. They said I have to do it online. Such a shame, what if people don't have access to Internet???? What kind of restaurant doesn't take phone orders??? Way to turn down business.   Was going to try them but now I won't."}
{"text":"Sunday fun day with the family. We are so blown away by this hidden gem. The food was amazing and the atmosphere is so us. Great service, and each plate has such good authentic flavor!! We love it here! Bravo to the chefs at Kitchen Table"}
{"text":"My husband and I went to have lunch today, and this restaurant has the worst service I have ever experienced!  When we first arrived we were told by the hostess that there was a 10 min. wait to sit outside which was fine, but they had plenty of tables open which I thought was concerning.  As we were waiting a lady came in after us and was given a table right away. Finally 20 min. later we were seated at our table.  We sat at our table for another 15 minutes before a waiter came over to take our order.  We ordered our food waited another 1/2 hour, and two sets of customers that ordered after us received their food, as we sat there waiting for ours to arrive.  Finally, I asked a bus boy where our waiter was and why our food was taking so long? After another 10 minutes we finally received our food but not together.  Luckily, the food was good, not worth the long wait and poor service.  The management really needs to work on their customer service!"}
{"text":"Very understaffed, no one to serve or bus. Food runs out early on weekends. Only go if you get there by 9 am on a weekend. Espresso drinks are average. Not a fan of communal seating because you can't talk (people who come here treat the tables communally meaning they will participate in your conversation). I had the avocado toast. Mediocre I'd say. The challah bread was the wrong type of bread to use and sliced gigantic with only a thin translucent spread of avocado. The side salad was very over-dressed and soaked in oil. Go to Craft Kitchen instead."}
{"text":"My wife and I have had breakfast here 3 times and each time the food was wonderful.  I usually have buttermilk pancakes.  They are among the best I have had, but most importantly they are served with real maple syrup.  I also had their eggs Benedict which were also outstanding.    Highly recommended, worth a drive."}
{"text":"Found this place on Yelp while in Henderson (we live at the opposite end of the valley). Glad we stopped by!   I like the community-style seating, but sometimes it can feel *too* close. Not at Kitchen Table!  We started with the empanadas and they were vegetarian and yummy!  I had the Duck Philly, and it was very greasy (which you expect from duck), but sooooo good.  The service was friendly and fast. We'd come here more if we lived closer!"}
{"text":"I gave this place ZERO stars, the place is filthy, floors, windows and especially the kitchen is so disgusting dirty. I'm suprised they're not in dirty diners! The chef/owner is using the same towel to wipe his sweat to carry plates because it's so hot. They don't use AC inside at all. I don't  even wanna get into the cooks how they touch every food with their dirty hands. We were waiting for a table but after watching how they work and how dirty this place, we left. I will never recommend this place, it might give you food born illness symptoms. Being fellow restaurant owners ourselves we find this place to have been a major disappointment."}
{"text":"I'm going to start out by saying that the decor and ambiance are wonderful. It's a beautiful, cozy and comfortable atmosphere, and the staff are all very friendly and attentive.  I came here for lunch, after a long morning of appointments, including a personal training session, so for me it was more like a late breakfast. I didn't want to derail my workout, so I was extremely happy when I saw steel cut oatmeal on the menu.  If you're a fan of steel-cut, you already know it's an entirely different taste and texture than regular old fashioned rolled oats, and hard to come by at restaurants.   When our meal arrived, I was incredibly disappointed to see that my $8 steel-cut oatmeal was nothing more than regular rolled oats. The flavor was good, but overall very dissatisfying. I didn't want to make a big deal of it, as my boyfriend had suggested sending it back for something else, but I really didn't want to have his food get cold while waiting for me to receive a substitution. Maybe the rolled oats were just a last minute replacement on their part, and it just happened that was the day I ordered oatmeal, or, they honestly are not aware of what steel-cut oatmeal actually is. How does a disorganized tourist trap at SLS know the difference, but this place doesn't??? It's a shame because based on the appearance and incredibly thoughtful and unique menu, you'd expect an establishment like this to get something as simple as oatmeal right.  I'm certainly in no rush to go back, but I suppose if I do, I'll stick to bacon and eggs or a simple pastry."}
{"text":"This is such an adorable restaurant! It's perfect for a Sunday brunch with your friends and family. Their food is delicious and they have a bunch of options. They offer s great variety, so there's sure to be something for everyone. The atmosphere and vibe in this place is just delightful. I recommend their amazing granola French toast!"}
{"text":"Only been here once but their staff is so attentive- and their chef even walked around and asked how the food was.  Def coming back. Their huevos tacos (meatless but amazing tacos if you like potato tacos) and peach pancakes were bomb- gotta try more on the menu.   Recommend using the waitlist option on Yelp if you're coming in during peak brunch hours!   Parking in a lot. It's in the corner of the plaza."}
{"text":"This is one of the best breakfast places I've ever been too! Thanks to all the yelp reviewers that directed me here. I had the croque Madam : soft toasted challah bread - topped with ham, with Gruyere cheese white sauce, and sunny side up egg. Flavor explosion.  Then I had the homemade monkey bread - which I took the last serving of the day since it is so popular. If you go here, ask for it at the beginning before they run out . Well worthy of a diet cheat day."}
{"text":"Only in town for 2 nights and this place was delicious. We tried to add our name to the wait list through the yelp app,but there was no  wait, it said come in in. I ordered coffee and my friend had a cappuccino. Both were very good. I had the chilaquiles and, my friend had the crab po boy. Both were absolutely delicious. Our server had some recommendations too, so that was helpful. The baked goods look scrumptious too, but we restrained ourselves.   Great vibe, service and food. So glad we tried it. If in the area again, will done here again."}
{"text":"What brunch is suppose to be! Food is 5 stars. Delicious and gourmet without the price tag. The place was cute and smelled great. But I think the A/C was broken so they have a plug in unit which helped but it was still hot inside, which is why I gave them only 4 stars. Service was friendly but a little slow. They were packed and we waited 45minutes to sit but totally worth it. Fresh pastries and interesting meal options. Had the daily special of braised short rib hash in a sourdough bowl and hamburger helper omelet (seriously amazing!)  Will go back!!"}
{"text":"The only reason I am scoring this place a 3 star is because the food is AMAZING but for the service it is completely unacceptable. Everyone seems to be running around aimlessly without any rhyme or reason. The waiter I had today was rude and his behavior was unacceptable. When I asked about an item on the menu his response was \" didn't you look at the menu in front of you\"? I was shocked this is your job to educate me and create a relationship with your guests. So overall good is awesome but service SUCKS!"}
{"text":"Fantastic! Have now been here twice, amazing food, great service!  If you are looking for somewhere special, go to Kitchen Table.  Will definitely be back as soon as possible."}
{"text":"It's hard to give an accurate rating for Kithcen Table. A friend and I came here around 10:15 on a Saturday and was told a 30-40 min wait, which was fine. The wait ended up being an hour and 10 mins not because tables were full but because they weren't being bussed fast enough. Our waiter was a little too friendly ( close talker) but helped make menu choices. My friend ordered the salmon bagel and a carrot muffin and I chose the standard breakfast fare- eggs, bacon, toast and potatoes. The flavor of the food was decent but everything was really greasy- even my friend's food. So here's how I would rate kitchen table if it had categories:  Atmosphere: 5 Food:3 Service: 3 Prices: 4 - everything is priced decent  I would probably return on a weekday and try something more adventurous because it is a really cute place,  located fairly close to my house."}
{"text":"First time here and even something as simple as a bagel sandwich tasted anything but simple.... So AMAZING!!! On top of it I showed up here 15 minutes until closing and for sure thought they would tell me they weren't serving anymore but they gladly seated me. Service was friendly even with her probably dying to be done with her shift. I will most definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I have had this place on my radar for months. I live in summerlin and today decided to drive out. My quick and short review is excellent food, horrible staff and experience. I so wanted to like this place! They seated us outside (*its 110 today) okay no big deal, but she seats us in the only table for 2 thats directly in the sun. How was that even an option in her head? There were open tables everywhere. Is this okay she says? Um no. Fast forward. I realize we have sat there 10 minutes and no one even came over. Not even water delivery. I counted 5 different servers outside and not a single one acknowledged us. Now im pissed. I ask to be moved inside. They say give me 5 min. We sit out there another 10. Waitress says what do ypu want to order? Ummmm im moving inside. Ok and then I had to go back in and remind them I am moving inside? The rest of the experience was average inside and very slow staff. Wont be back and disappointed because it was such great food. Not how I planned to spend my birthday breakfast."}
{"text":"The wait was worth it!  Great variety on the menu. Home baked goods. The food has good flavors. Service is friendly. Good vibes in the restaurant and love the social tables!!"}
{"text":"Huge menu but that's easy if you don't really have all the dishes.  Ordered straight Eggs Benedict - no ham or Canadian bacon available.  OK do it with smoked salmon - whoops!  Only on weekends.  Forget it, I'll order eggs in a basket, bacon, no potatoes and sourdough toast.  Comes with lots of potatoes - tried them - rubbery.  Eggs nice and hot.  Toast has about 1 square inch (seriously) of butter.  Asked for more - got 2 well frozen pats.  Everyone with toast at our table had same problem.  Good service though.   Is this place on its way down as so often as so often happens with restaurants that start off OK then fall off as staff changes, boredom sets in and the owner takes his eye off the ball?"}
{"text":"Went in for breakfast and had a good experience. Food looks good and tastes good. Flavor profile is mild, peerhaps a bit bland. It's a little pricey for what it is, your paying for ambiance and food presentation.  Service is a tad slow."}
{"text":"I haven't been here for months but was scrolling though my phone's photos and had to write a review because I was so deeply offended by this portion and I was TRIGGERED all over again by seeing this pic.  I ordered the smoked salmon and caviar and my boyfriend at the time ordered some kind of traditional plate (not important, not even my boyfriend anymore). Received my plate by our nice server but nearly threw myself off of the sofa I was sitting on because I was in SHOCK of how small these were. I looked on Yelp beforehand and yall must have zoomed in super close because that was a LIE.  I had to order a plate of french toast afterward (which was good), but seriously? Why wasn't this in the starters menu? How is this considered an entree? I understand that caviar and quail eggs are pricey but this TINY blini? This HINT of smoked salmon? COME ON  The lighting in this restaurant was phenomenal tho! Bright and sunny with the large windows. Great restaurant for snapchatting AND getting slightly ripped off!"}
{"text":"I'm assuming our waiters name was  Mike..Hec was amazing  with personality!# wait time was reasonable.  Champagne  while waiting. .Food amazing. ..Hec was awesome. ..Will visit this establishment  again! !"}
{"text":"If you are looking for a new breakfast place, the Kitchen Table is the place for you. They offer unique and delicious breakfast items in addition to traditional breakfast favorites. My favorite is the Pork Belly Benedict. It is spicy and has a distinct combination of flavors that brings this meal together. Their season potatoes are delicious and their drink options are fantastic.   On a previous visit, I had asked the server if they served passion fruit iced tea. He asked me what types of fruit I liked and prepared a mango flavored tea that was a hit. The servers are highly attentive and the atmosphere is warm and inviting. It feels as though you are eating at a friend's home.   I was happy to hear that they have or are in the process of opening a new location in Summerlin (closer to home). However, I would not hesitate to drive 45 minutes for this breakfast place."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious food...we took my mom there for her 82nd birthday...this is a great addition to the neighborhood....I have not had a monte.cristo sandwich in 20 years.....delicious  can not wait to go back....wish they were open at night....our server was excellent and bus staff superb....he even opened the door for us when we left..that was a nice touch.."}
{"text":"Best avocado toast EVER!! We also enjoyed the French toast and Greek yogurt!  All were top notch!  Prices were also really good!"}
{"text":"Great local Henderson brunch spot. The place is very busy and the seating is very close to other tables/patrons. The menu had a variety of breakfast items and Mexican style dishes. I had the pork bell green chili and it was good. The red sangria  was refreshing. I definitely will go back to this restaurant as I want to try other items on the menu. If your a local you gotta check it out, I used Yelp to get on the wait list and it made it smooth getting seated."}
{"text":"This place is super cute! A little weird to find when you are parked, its kind of tucked behind the hot place. When you walk it in smells so good and they have several baked goods displayed to get your mouth watering. We had the short rib Benedict, the bagel and egg sandwich with bacon, and the blueberry French toast.  The short rib Benedict was really yummy, and the eggs were perfectly poached. The meat had lots of flavor without being salty, and the hollandaise sauce was delicious, and actually pretty light tasting, somehow. The breakfast potatoes were also soft and flavorful, though I personally prefer a little crispyness, they were still tasty. The breakfast bagel was a surprise hit, for being such a simple dish it was delicious, again the eggs were perfectly cooked, and the jalapeno bacon was unbelievable, so good, and of course, cooked to perfection, the bagel was griddled which added a buttery toasty crust which was delicious, and a nice touch. This dish also came with the same breakfast potatoes, which were good. The blueberry French toast was also good, the bread was high quality and the dish was good. The blueberry compote was a bit sweet for me, but I am not a huge fan of sweets, or blueberries for that matter, so take that for what it's worth.  The service was friendly, and perfectly adequate, we weren't wowed but we also weren't displeased. Overall we would definitely recommend this place to friends, and we will be back if we are in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Great find while staying at the Green Valley Ranch! We ordered the breakfast burrito & mimosas . Sundays they have mimosas for $3 instead of $6. Will be back"}
{"text":"They're pretty quick with the service. Food is good. Can't wait to try other dishes. Got the crab cake, peaches and cream pancakes and smores with a shot of espresso. Happy!"}
{"text":"The food is very Unique and scrumptious.  Service is great, there was a misunderstanding about the food I ordered and the waitress fixed the problem right away.   My biggest issues that makes me give them a 2 instead of a 5 is that when we visited 7/30/2017 it was so hot inside. And it's no fun enjoying all these great dishes when you are sweating. You are hot, your environment is hot, and your food is hot....just no.   There were flies all around us. For the price I am paying to eat out I don't want to have flies buzzing around me. It's a good thing I didn't bring my daughter who screams bloody murder every time she sees a fly. If this was the case outdoors, I wouldn't complain, but indoor setting shouldn't have flies.   Lastly, the table have nails coming to surface. That scratch your arms."}
{"text":"Again five stars & yes cause of the same amazing food, beautiful server & Chef Pedro coming to check on our meal.  Thank you all!  Prickly Pear Barbie looking mimosas, Pork Benny & Eggs in the Basket.  My best friend said specifically that he hoped his Pork Benedict was served in heaven.  We shared our breakfast, happily & cannot wait to come back.  Chef Nunez & Javier are fantastic & though we haven't been back in a while we wish we both lived across the street!  Chef Pedro said that in October they are opening a new restaurant in the Gramercy Park for breakfast, lunch, & dinner!!  We really cannot wait.  Thank you all for such a hospitable, wonderfully delicious place."}
{"text":"Unique food and seating arrangements. I'd recommend this place if only you have two hours and are fine with people eating so close to you. This place has great food, I just wish it was bigger."}
{"text":"First time here, was about a 30 minute wait on a Sunday morning which is to be expected. Ordered the chicken fried steak, it was salty and the meat was the skinniest piece of meat in between thick breading. The breakfast potatoes were good, service was good, but not impressed with the chicken fried steak. The tables are also too close together so you end up hearing your neighbors entire conversation."}
{"text":"I have to give this place 1 star. The food is decent so normally I would give it a 3 or a 4, but the staff here is terrible. Ive been here 3 times now and each time the service was mediocre at best and the staff members are rude and unprofessional. Theres tons of great brunch restaurants near here. Skip this place and go somewhere your business is appreciated."}
{"text":"We went based on good reviews.  Started out with water.  Ice was a special request?  Mom got the eggs benedict and I got the veggie version with no meat.  Mom's had almost no meat so I could have gotten that.  The fried green tomatoes on the veggie one were inedible.  The english muffins were tough.  The hollandaise was completely tasteless.  It said with avocado, but only a TINY slice on the side.  No potatoes.  Mom's came with potatoes that were cold and hard.  Potions very small. Manager came out to talk to us.  We told her what we thought.  She didn't know what the green tomatoes were supposed to taste like?!?  And she said it was their 'version' of hollandaise.  No lemon taste whatsoever.   I sent mine back and left hungry. We sat outside.  The seats were torn up.  We had to climb over wires to get to our table.  They have a beat up metal shed in back that they keep stuff in and keep going in and out of.  Some of the tables were like old pallets.  Just a big mess.  Don't bother with this place."}
{"text":"This place was so good!! The service was amazing Our server Rafael was top Notch.. everything tasted so fresh and homemade.. we will definitely be back when visiting our daughter.. the chef came out Pedro  and asked if everything was good!! Which I like.. you will not be disappointed.. the only Con would be sitting right next to someone that you don't know.. other then that AWESOME"}
{"text":"Probably my favorite brunch place in all of las vegas area. I have never been let down. It can sometimes get busy- so i recommend making a reservation through yelp.  Service is always amazing and the food CANNOT BE BEAT. Everything i've tried here has been impeccable- but i'd have to say the best appetizer is the gluten free bread with homemade jam and for entree any of the Benedict dishes. oh and the potatoes are a must. Love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast place I've ever tried. And I eat out daily. Everywhere from LA, Ny, Seattle, even international spots in Europe and Asia this is one of the best places I've had. They actually specialize Breakfast dishes and take it to a new level. Very hard to find an amazing Breakfast spot that doesn't make you feel like you can just create it at home. The Pork belly Benedict is one of the best tasting dishes I've ever had."}
{"text":"So so so yummy!!! Such a relaxing brunch spot if you eat outside. Delicious every time"}
{"text":"Attended a wedding event this evening. It was perfect.  The atmosphere, the food and the service. Thank you for a beautiful evening good job"}
{"text":"Was a very cool spot with nice ambience. And good waiters/waitresses. Good food and quick service . Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"So glad we tried this place! took my mom and two little boys here for valentines breakfast. the wait time was a little long, but you could order drinks and pastries while you wait if you'd like. We were told it would be a 40min wait, but we ended up getting seated after 25mins. The service was good, the chef (i think he was the owner) sat us at our table, and brought color pages and crayons for the boys to color and stay busy while we waited for our food. we ordered the breakfast taquitos to start, they were delish! Pancakes and eggs for the boys were good too, and the chiliquiles was bomb as well. we will definitely be returning again, there's so many yummy things we still have to try!"}
{"text":"I told my husband that we had to take one for the team and go on a scouting trip to check out breakfast places for when family is in town...  He happily agreed to join me and off we went to Kitchen Table.  Unfortunately, our first attempt was on a Monday Holiday and the wait was 40 minutes...  Good for them, bad for us.  We did not wait but returned the next morning to find no waiting.  A lesson in timing. We started with a lemon loaf and a cinnamon twist.  Delicious!  Moist and sweet, perfect with a good cup of black coffee.  My only recommendation is to bring more people with you so you can try more items from the bakery counter.  (Unless you are Michael U and order for 12! haha)  He ordered the Blue Collar and I ordered the Monte Cristo.  I am always on the hunt for a good Monte Cristo, so could not pass up the opportunity.  This was good, but I probably will try something else next time.  Just a little too heavy and crispy for me, but very tasty.  The Blue Collar was said to be excellent, eggs cooked perfectly and crispy bacon the way he likes it.  Somehow I missed out on getting a bite so will have to take his word for it...  The best endorsement is that he said he would happily return, which is a high recommendation.    The service was top notch, which we discussed after leaving.  We often have 'favorites' that are as much or more due to the service as opposed to the food.  The food of course has to be good, but we are going to cut them a lot more slack if the service is good.   At Kitchen Table, it was the best of both.  Excellent service and food. The family will be pleased with the mission's outcome."}
{"text":"I stopped in here after I had tried for a few weeks to find the time. I got there 30 minutes before they closed but they were happy to serve me. I had sent my son to try it last week and he had already been back for more. The food is so great, tons of flavors, and fresh. The menu is just printed on several sheets of paper, which can only mean that it changes regularly which is a great thing. Get over to this place and try it....soon!!"}
{"text":"The place is very hip. It was busy but it was also sat at noon. The staff was courteous. The food looked better then it tasted. Maybe it was what I had? I had the chilaquilles , they were a little salty. I'd come back and again and try something else."}
{"text":"This is one of my new favorite breakfast/lunch/brunch places. EVERYTHING Is delicious here. Our group has come here twice and we have shared so many amazing dishes it is hard to pick a favorite. My kids love the monkey bread and the stuffed French toast. We have tried the chicken fried steak egg Benedict and the short rib benefit, grapes, chicken sandwich and the croque madam.  Best thing we ate hands down was the short rib Benedict. Love that they have fresh orange juice and champagne/mimosas. Only downside is the wait (but what do you expect for a place this good) and no bloody Mary's. Love the open kitchen where you get to see the chefs, the outdoor patio seating and the music is on point."}
{"text":"Vegetable Sandwich. The best veggie sandwich I've ever had!!! Roasted bell peppers, grilled squash, toasted pine nuts, and mozzarella cheese squished between toasted ciabatta bread.  It was sooooooo cheesy and delicious!!!   I'd definitely recommend this sandwich for all of my vegetarian friends,even if you're not a vegetarian, this sandwich is a must try. The pine nuts in this sandwich gives the sandwich a roasted taste and the extra crunch to it. The mozzarella cheese makes the sandwich very cheesy.   First time I've been here today and I'd definitely go here again..  The place is cozy buy it is very small. It does have outside seating, however, during their rush hour, be prepared to be on an extra long hour waitlist.   About two months ago, I came here to eat on a Sunday, and I couldn't get seated for an hour and a half. But if you can hold your hunger for that long, it's worth the wait!!!"}
{"text":"Food was underwhelming. I got the french toast. It was not hot when I received it, and bread was soggy? It had a texture that made it kind of inedible for me :/ however the mimosas were great, so many different flavors! And the egg shooters were also good. I would go again but not going to get the french toast!"}
{"text":"This place makes it to one of my best brunch list! The food and service here are the best in the area. The menu has something for everyone, If you want traditional, this is more on the inventive side but don't let that stop you, it all taste scrumptous! Seriously, I wanted to try all their baked goods, but my tummy was full from cleaning my plate. They have outside seating, but I'm a bay area girl and preferred to be seated in the cooler inside. It was summertime. Luckily, hubby and I missed the crowds, so we enjoyed both our meals 2 days in a row back to back. This will be my go to breakfast place in LV. Notable Dishes: Peaches and cream pancakes (sweet but so good) short rib benedict. Really, you can't go wrong with any of the dishes. All depends on what your in the mood for!"}
{"text":"My walking friends and I went to breakfast here.  I have been several times with my family.  My friends enjoyed the food and the service was great.  We ordered our food and within a few minutes we were able to enjoy our breakfast.  Neatly to say we will be back."}
{"text":"A little disappointed with this, based on all the good reviews. To be fair, this just might not be my type of place. But anyway...  Being a Sunday, my boyfriend reserved a spot ahead of time through Yelp. We got there right on time and the hostess (very friendly) told us it'd still be a 15-20 minute wait. We were fine with that. Then we noticed that the outdoor tables were mostly empty, so we said we'd sit out there. She said it was still a 5-minute wait. We weren't sure what the hold up was since there were so many empty tables, and we definitely waited longer than that.    I was shocked at the lack of selections, but then we realized that my boyfriend and I had two different versions of the menu, and mine seemed to be missing stuff. I ordered the All-American breakfast (eggs, sausage, toast, potatoes). It was ok. Not bad. Not extraordinary. What I didn't like was that the food was dripping in oil. I haven't felt very well since. My boyfriend ordered a prickly pear mimosa, French toast, and a smores crepe. He was happy! The ice water had no ice, and it took us quite awhile to get one straw. Just one.   Our waitress was very, very nice. I think that maybe they were overworked. The place was PACKED (so the food must be good!). Numerous times, food was brought out and served to the wrong table, or they didn't know at all who ordered it. Maybe they needed more waiters so that the service could be a little better.   I see all the great reviews, and this place was full of customers. So I think maybe this was just my experience. I don't plan on returning, but I think others would enjoy this (maybe not on a Sunday, though)."}
{"text":"A really good breakfast/brunch/lunch place in a part of Henderson that desperately needs good places to eat. I came in on a Saturday around 1pm and had fast great service from our server Joseph. A relaxed place to eat that totally makes you feel at home. We will be back!"}
{"text":"So freaking good!  This place was amazing. It was a slight wait to be seated, but that was expected for being prime brunch hours on a Sunday and this place was packed.  Worth the wait!  We smacked on some delicious pastries while we were waiting for our food and my favorite was the banana bread. I've been told the monkey bread was awesome, but they were all out ... I guess next time!  I got the ham and cheese omelet and it was delicious, one of the best crepes I've ever had. I will be back many more times and will be telling everyone about it!"}
{"text":"OMG Amazing! We ordered the  pork belly benedict with jalapeno hollandaise and the shorty short rib benedict with bearnaise/red wine reduction. By far the best benedicts we've ever had.  The smoker was going outside, where we first attempted to sit before we were smoked out, but they did warn us prior to seating us and said they would be done in 20. So we moved inside.  We also ordered iced coffee (black, no sweetener or flavors), and it was a little bland/watered down, like it was hot coffee that they threw on ice. Not bad, but not the best. Don't let this hold you back!  Waiter and other staff were very friendly. Would highly recommend to anyone in the area."}
{"text":"This is most likely one of my favorite go to spots! It is great for breakfast dates with friends, family, or that special someone in your life!  Some must eats are: Chili Colorado, Strawberry Shortcake French Toast, Chilaquiles, Country (Fried Chicken) Benedict, Short Rib Benedict, and well... basically the whole menu! Your tummy will thank you afterwards!    *Don't forget to get one of their lattes!"}
{"text":"Back again for breakfast!!!! Just LOVE their pancakes...and I really don't even like pancakes~ theirs are the bomb! and their syrup is outta site. be sure to ask to heat it up tho!!! we had a new server that we hadn't seen before.....a VERY nice you girl with a most welcoming smile.  The only issue at KT is the host stand, front desk or whatever you call it. In the past a young girl who always seemed a little lost, or disinterested maybe she is just untrained I don't know. She is still there and now they have added another gal, a tad bit older and she looks to be the first girls boss OR at least giving her a lot of instructions which is probably OK however there were guest trying to check in, and we all were being ignored...no \"Hello, please allow us one moment\", No\" well be right with you\", and the topper was the S--T bomb was dropped..... quite inappropriate. (at least to me) Look this job isn't rocket science,  ( I should know as I trained the host staff for Ruth's Chris for 5 years~) you do need someone personable, out going and with an understanding that the most important person is the person standing in front of you. The 2 owners are so nice & personable, the food is DELISSSSH & very nice servers, this is the only crack in this restaurants façade."}
{"text":"I really love this place!  I tried the chilaquiles and was pleased by the layers of flavors. Another time I had the Monte Cristo sandwich with a side of house made jam. Yum!  Be prepared to wait... this place gets packed!"}
{"text":"I Love Breakfast! And this place is amazing. Big portions and feels like home. Everyone seems to enjoy working together. Great music. It's a little hidden on the corner. Wish little easier to find. Cuz if it was that place would be crazy busy. We had their potatoes, French toast s'more (crazy good), eggs and ham. Hot Mocha with marshmallows. Ever come to Vegas again. I will drive here to make sure I eat breakfast. One of The Best Breakfast spots in Vegas!"}
{"text":"Great food. Wonderful gluten free options. Just make sure you get there early, because things are made each day they can run out.  The staff is also amazing!!! They are so thoughtful and make sure you will have an outstanding experience. My family has come in multiple times and have now met the owner and manager. They are wonderful and creating a wonderful atmosphere in the community."}
{"text":"LOVE Kitchen Table! What a little gem, I almost don't want to leave a review in fear it will get busier but the food is amazing, the staff is super nice and it even tastes great for take out. It's hands down one of my favorite brunch spots in Henderson. I love the pork green chili, huevos tacos, chilaquiles, the empanadas, the french toast is BOMB also... and they have a solid Americano. 5 stars for sure."}
{"text":"Love this place however I would only go here with my wife. Good food, service and atmosphere. Save this place for when you want to go on a date with your wife."}
{"text":"Love love love this place! Was introduced to it by a friend and have gone 3 times so far. Only reason I give it 4 stars is because I've ordered avocado toast that was soggy and sunny side up eggs that were slightly undercooked. Other than that, the service was great and I enjoyed the atmosphere even though it can get a bit crowded and congested the later you visit."}
{"text":"Really excellent, creative, great food ! You can add foie gras to anything for such a low price it's insane not to try it ! Everything is fresh, all baked goods made in house and it tastes like a home cooked meal; that is if you lived with an excellent chef . From the sandwiches to the pancakes, waffles and muffins, the food is just so tasty and the flavor combinations are excellent . This is sure to become a hit, make sure to make reservations and plan for some time to chat as dishes come out. There's a real home feel to this place, and it's a great meeting place or family spot . The food rivals any expensive restaurant at the strip . The foie gras is the best I've had in Vegas . All the ingredients, even the syrups are selected for high quality and taste. Truly a great find and a must try, you'll want to go back and taste everything on the menu. Come with friends and family so you can share more and prepare to leave stuffed . The chef was also so warm and inviting, managing to converse with every table which I thought added a great personal touch ."}
{"text":"Best breakfast/brunch spot in Vegas hands down and it's not even close. Just go and you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"A small place that's tucked in the corner was the best brunch. The service was amazing and the food came out fast and was delicious. It's all pretty light so you can try a few things. And definitely try their coffee! Any kind the Mexican coffee or creme brûlée latte is amazingggg"}
{"text":"This restaurant is a breath of fresh air. It is about time we have a good local restaurant with great food.  Great staff and great food. Fresh and delicious. Chef Antonio and Chef Javiar should be proud of themselves.   Thank you for a great place. It is all about the food and people."}
{"text":"My husband and I recently had lunch at Kitchen Table and really enjoyed our meal. I ordered the duck philly...perfect balance of salty/sweet with the caramelized onions and a type of jam (one of the servers suggested putting green habanero sauce on it which made the sandwich PERFECT). It is definitely one of the best things that I have eaten in a very long time.  My husband ordered the crab cake po' boy and that was also very good and a generous portion. He says that he'd order it again, so, I guess he loved it!  I was bummed that they were out of pastries, but it was also already almost 2pm so I will have to show up earlier next time. We did get a chance to try the biscuits and those were perfect.  I had a special treat (Mexican hot chocolate - turned into a mocha by adding espresso) and it was delicious. Anyone who loves spicy/sweet combo should try it!  The service is friendly, the space is cool (a little loud but not too bad), the Executive Chef stopped by to say \"Hi\" and to let us know about their new location opening up.  I can't wait to try their brunch!"}
{"text":"Tried again on Feb 18, 2016 at 11am.  Was seated in the same spot as before.  I requested the Monkey Bread again. I was told that there was none. I informed the waiter that we have been told this before and I know that they keep some in the back. That is all I want for breakfast. He said he would go check for me.   The waiter never came back.  The other person with me was served with her breakfast and no one asked if I wanted anything else?   Your wait service found it appropriate to serve one person and not the other AND not ask any questions ???  No monkey bread and now my guest is eating without me ?!?!  Finally I flag down someone to get a menu while my guest is eating.  No one ever comes back to take my order and my guest finishes. I ended up going else were for breakfast.  While your service staff is quick to brag that the owners stole them from STK (and I really doubt that these people were stolen, these are obviously the rejects from STK), your what staff needs some serious training.   Also, just remove the MONKEY BREAD from your clipboard menu. If you don't have it at 11am on a Thursday, you really never have it. Don't try to lie to customers and say that people come and pre-order it at 7am."}
{"text":"We stopped in for brunch and it was fabulous.  The country fried steak benedict was amazing.   Everything we ordered was great.  Definitely coming back."}
{"text":"Not cool. Called to inquire about brunch reservations and the girl that answered was rude, short and hung up."}
{"text":"The ambiance is absolutely lovely here.  They truly make you feel at home. The staff are positive people and always find a way to make you smile.  The chef Javier is the nicest guy and has such a creative style of cooking.  Just looking at the food alone is so appetizing, and it's always worth the wait and literally anything on the menu is amazing.  I kid you not, I'm here ALL the time for a reason.  The pancakes are the fluffiness pancakes you'll ever have, I'm not a pancake person, and these are by far the best pancakes ever! Definitely worth ordering. Like I said anything you order at this lovely bistro is worth ordering, and I come here time and time again just to order more and different things."}
{"text":"You will not believe how amazing this food is. Homemade bread, jam, everything. I wouldn't be surprised if they kept chickens in the back for fresh eggs. It's beyond delicious. And the outdoor seating area is amazing."}
{"text":"So this is the second time here. I wanted to give it another try before I reviewed.  The front of the house has issues. Same as the first time the hostess does not seem into her position.  We waited at the front and were looked by at by three people and addressed by a chef who came from the back??  The hostess finally jumped in and sat us and then gave us an eye roll when we made small talk. Crazy. The place was not even busy.  How come I feel like I am imposing when I come here and give money for bad treatment.   My wife spoke to the manager who apologized.    Our server was good and the food was too but tough to overcome the initial treatment.    There are too many places that will appreciate its customers.  This place is just not for us.  Not gonna come back."}
{"text":"The food was just above mediocre and the service was terrible. Considering there are hundreds of places in Las Vegas that are breakfast/ lunch spots, one would think an establishment would try harder than mediocrity. You're suspect kitchen table!"}
{"text":"Love this cute restaurant.    I ordered the Monte Cristo and it was great, the sandwich is big so I got to bring home the other half.  One thing I love is good hot tea, and I drank every last drop of it.   My sever was awesome!! I wish I got her name.  She refilled water and checked on us. The service is fantastic and I am happy I got to have a great lunch there.  Food is fresh and quality of it is awesome!!!!! I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"Came here for the first time with my main squeeze for our 6 year anniversary. Here was our experience:  * wait time was 30 minutes on a Sunday close to around noon - awesome considering other restaurant wait times are about the same time, but this place is made to order  *  we were seated and nobody served us or even came by, but the table next to us was seated 10 minutes later and was taken care of ( drinks and app ) my main squeeze was livid. I on the other hand had a tough decision on what to eat because everything  looked awesome ( reason why he didn't complain right away)  * main squeeze complained to hostess and chef/manager/owner? overheard and came to our table and genuinely apologize for the miscommunication and took care of us- a big plus in my book.   * my food had lots of flavor and my shorty Benny was super tender. Main squeeze liked his chicken fried steak and loved the chipotle gravy, but steak was a little tough. Their potato was awesome  Love supporting local businesses. Will be coming back. Thank you!"}
{"text":"Love this fabulous restaurant!!!  Came to celebrate my son's 23rd birthday for brunch yesterday and it was our first time here.  I have to say WOW!  Food and service was impeccable - my only sad part was they were out of monkey bread which I hear is a fan favorite. But everything else was sooooo good!!  I highly recommend the pork belly bene- one of my sons had the white chocolate French toast and said it was fantastic!  The rest of the table raved the rest of the day about their meals too!  You must must must try Kitchen Table!!"}
{"text":"The selections! The wait staff! The chefs! This place is great. We waited 40 minutes for a table but worth the wait. The green chile pork, the crab po-boy minus the bun and my chiliquoles - all amazing. Way out of the way for me but worth it. I will be back... Even ran into friends here."}
{"text":"Unbelievable food and service!! First off we came here because of my lovely gal pal from Montana had a raving review facebook.  The entire experience was amazing. The service outstanding. The mimosas, delightful. We had the mixed berry, peach, mango and BlackBerry with a bottle of champagne. David had the chorizo omelette, let me say, he travels to a lot of different places. He said, and this is huge coming from Mr.fussy about everything,  the best omelette he has ever had anywhere!! A huge shout out to Javier (I believe) the owner. You're on point with your hospitality. Our server Maria, you delivered above and beyond quality service. Last but not least Abby, you made our 25 min. wait well worth the wait with your attentative sevice and fantastic mimosas. We will be back!"}
{"text":"Best brunch I've ever had! This is my 3rd time here, I live in Summerlin and it's totally worth the drive!! The service is great and the GM Melanie came by and is so sweet!!"}
{"text":"Their service is horrible. We called and was told we'd be seated immediately if we chose to sit outside - and we were totally down! So once we got there at the designated time they told us ten minutes. Which is whatever - who cares, it's ten minutes on a Sunday morning!  Thirty minutes later we asked about our table. There were huge parties being served before us. (We were waiting outside - dying in the Vegas heat. Other guests that were waiting had iced water I'm assuming they got from the restaurant) So the hostess didn't apologize or anything and said it'd be two more minutes! Our party was excited! We're in Vegas for the weekend for a bachelorette party and we were starving.  So after waiting anything 15-20 minutes after being told '2 mins for our table' we went back up.  No apologizes - the hostess barely took the time to look up at us and told us another ten minutes.  At that point we were done so we walked out.  Overall very disappointed and will not go back."}
{"text":"This place opened right around the corner from where I live and thought my husband & I should finally give it a try.  I've been looking for a small, quaint place to go for coffee where I can disappear, other than Starbucks or Panera.  So, the location is obviously perfect & we tried it on Sunday around 930-10; it was packed (obviously a good sign)... We had to wait about 40 mins.  There's indoor and outdoor seating; we got seated indoors.    So, the only thing I HATED was the seating arrangement, which is huge for me (I almost gave 3 stars because of it).  There's several tables & booths throughout that are very tiny and close together.  Then there's one long table that I believe has seating for 16-18 people.  They seat multiple parties at this one table even if you don't know the people; it's completely awkward and uncomfortable.  So, you are basically sitting right next to people you don't know & can hear their entire conversation.  We were seated there first (we had our toddler with us) and I told the host ABSOLUTELY NOT!  He wanted to give us a booster seat for a chair, which is completely unsafe.  So, he kindly moved us to a corner booth seat, which is the best seat in the house.  The only other complaints were that they didn't have the air on.  Omg!  It was stifling... I felt like I was having a never ending hot flash.  The other complaint was the music was too loud for a family-type upscale joint...it felt like a bar atmosphere with the volume level.  Now, the most exciting part was that they were playing 90's R&B music (kinda weird with the rustic chic decor), but I was in heaven.  Not to mention 80's music including, none other than Ghostbusters... My fave!!!  We ordered coffee, which tasted amazing!!!  The menu offers more upscale food (i.e. Duck, quail eggs, caviar) and my immediate thought was, uh oh, I'm not going to find anything I like.  I came across the Frittata, which consisted of egg whites, zucchini & cauliflower puree.  OMG... The puree was unbelievable; the best I've ever had. It was pricey ($13), but I was not disappointed.  My husband got eggs Benedict and he didn't leave one crumb on the plate.  All in all, I would definitely go back for the coffee and am excited to try other entrees.  The downside is definitely the seating arrangement; very awkward & kinda pricey.  The owner should think about expanding because it was jammed pack and the wait was a little too long.  If I had somewhere to go after, I would not have stayed.  Several parties left after they were told how long the wait was.  Oh, and the staff was amazingly friendly; our waitress was on the ball."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast in town! Yes wonderful food. Unique, eclectic,and delicious. Even better the service. My husband and I go at least once a week, usually more, for the staff treats us and everyone else extremely well. There is a strong sense of family, just like Cheers. They know most everyones name and are so pleasant to be around. The entire team makes an effort to ensure you have a wonderful experience; from the servers, management, owner, and chefs. I love this place dearly. Primarily server Maria. She's on her game! Beautiful! Personable! And expedient. If it wasn't for her perfected service i wouldn't be there weekly. Thank you to Maria and kitchen table staff."}
{"text":"Food was okay. Honeycomb cappuccino was amazing. The pork belly was not pork belly and more like short ribs. Server very rarely checked in on us. The stars are for the coffee. Served is way better and on the other side of the parking lot"}
{"text":"We went on a Sunday afternoon which is apparently a terrible time to go! We had an hour wait, and then once we were finally seated it was another half hour or so before our food arrived because they forgot our order! When the order arrived there was no compensation or sincere apology for the wait. In fact, they credited us for being the ones to check when that should be their job! Plus it's like 90 degrees with 80% humidity in here! I don't know what that's about. My poor husband was literally sweating! The food was pretty good, but the service was super bad! I have been waiting to come here for months now and I'm just super disappointed with the way this turned out. I am willing to give them another shot in the future, but my husband is not /:"}
{"text":"This place is soo goood! I loved the atmosphere in the outside seating. Food was delicious. I don't think there was anything on the menu that wasn't good. Love it love it! I would give it more than 5 stars if I could."}
{"text":"Great brunch spots are popping up all over Henderson lately, and this one is definitely worth the trek from Summerlin. As Chef Antonio informed us over multiple visits to the table, everything here is made in house or made specially for this restaurant, from the bacons (yes, plural) to the baked goods.   CHOCOLATE CROISSANT: Unfortunately this was our only venture into the baked goods offered here, but it was a solid one. Not quite shaped as expected but filled with a rich, fragrant chocolate amid a lovely risen interior. EMPANADAS: My favorite dish of the morning! Simply served as a trio of tiny filled pastries over a bed of black beans and greens, these are filled with ample asadero and veggies, topped with a delicious crema and a spicy salsa.  TOSTADA: Happily served as a duo despite the singular name! The tortilla itself lacked the crisp I had expected, but was generously topped with shredded pork and slaw, as well as a fried quail egg. This needed a touch of something else, maybe the salsa from the previous dish? CRISPY FRENCH TOAST: I'm not a French Toast fan, but our server recommended it. The toast itself was crusted with granola, but wasn't particularly crispy. The creme anglaise and coffee flavors made this only lightly sweet, but it went unfinished at our table. CROQUE MADAME: I haven't met a Croque Madame I've liked until now. Usually the layers of ham and cheese and bechamel are just too rich and salty, but this version on challah highlighted the salty gruyere and showed restraint with the sauce. The egg was perfectly poached and the side salad lightened things up.  SHORTY BENEDICT: Worth the hype. Generous amounts of tender short rib (roasted on site!) and more perfectly poached eggs top the grilled bread with a bernaise-red wine reduction. This could have used just a hint of salt but it was pretty great as-is too. The side of house potatoes were nicely crunchy.  The menu alone makes this a spot I'll return to try more- there are still so many tasty things I want to try here! I especially enjoyed the personal touch of service that Chef Antonio provided, visiting each table and chatting with patrons. Our server was very sweet but could be a bit more attuned to timing. I enjoyed the crowded yet friendly atmosphere, very welcoming and homey, a successful execution of \"social eatery\"."}
{"text":"I'll give the service a solid four stars. They were helpful with the menu, greeted us right at the door, and made sure to keep our glasses full.   I wish I could say the food was just as good. It wasn't mind blowing but it filled our bellies. The menu reads impressive but the food just didn't live up to the descriptions. The biggest let down was the added side of foie gras for $13 that was over cooked. It was way too charred and pretty much ruined the foie. I honestly would give this a three star review but bumped it to four on the strength of their service."}
{"text":"Cute place, good service, food was unique, but taste was lacking some refinement. Ordered the monkey bread and the duck and cheese omelet. Monkey bread hit the spot! The omelet was an interesting idea but didn't work. It was filled with a cream like cheese and Mac n Cheese (yes, pasta), and had pieces of duck on top. The side of potatoes were cooked to perfection but seasoning was WAY off. WAY to much pepper. I was choking over the spice. I did really like how they were prepared besides the pepper though. Im happy I tried it, but it's not a place Id return to again and again."}
{"text":"Stopped in here on a late Monday morning as my parents were heading out of town. Place was packed. I didn't realize that a lot of their seating is at a long large table. I am not a fan of that type of seating. I was there with my elderly parents who do not like this type of seating arrangement either. It was hard to talk to them since the noise level of the other patrons was so loud. They also had heavy thumping music playing in the background which caused every person to talk louder. I am OK with music but make it something lighter & softer as then people tend to not talk so loud. Ordered the Blue Collar ($9), Kielbasa ($11), Pastrami Hash ($13), & Green Chile Eggs ($12). My Mom said the Pastrami Hash was spicy. I've never known Pastrami to be spicy so I guess maybe this is Kitchen Table's take on it? The Kielbasa was OK but I wasn't impressed for the $11 it cost. All the salt & pepper was dumped on 1 spot in the middle of the eggs. The Kielbasa was hard to cut so I don't know if it was the skin on the Kielbasa or their knives need to be sharper. But I wouldn't order it again. I also was not of fan of the house potatoes as they were mushy instead of being crispy. I did like the rye toast. My Dad enjoyed his Blue Collar although he mentioned the toast didn't have hardly any butter on it. We asked on of the waiters (not ours) for butter & he said he would get it but never did. Once our waitress came back around we asked for it again & she promptly brought it to us. My brother said the Green Chile was good but a little too spicy & he likes spicy food. The chef had came out & talked to many of those around us to see how they were but never bothered to see how we were doing. Overall since there's other items on the menu I'll give this place another try."}
{"text":"Have to say I was disappointed. We ordered an appetizer to-go and one to enjoy, along with our  entree. Before any of our food was delivered the waitress apologized Incase she would forget our appetizer to go.....? When we did received our appetizers both were served, along with our entree. What's the purpose of an appetizer if it's served with your entree. The waitress once again apologized for pushing our food on us.   The food was okay to say the least. I'm happy for the experience, but doubt I'll go back."}
{"text":"Tucked away in this little complex, is an exceptional spot for breakfast/brunch! Mexican hot chocolate with \"big girl\" marshmallows was warm and rich. We had the chorizo crepe and green chile dishes. Delicious spicy goodness!!! Service was friendly and helpful!"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast today, only waited about 5 minutes because I added us to the waitlist through yelp. The food was delicious!  There were six of us and everyone's food was yummy! Between all of us we ordered the tacos huevos, traditional Benedict, country Benedict, fruit crepe, traditional French toast, strawberries and cream French toast and monkey bread! All of it was yummy! I'm glad the weather was nice enough to sit outside because the patio seating was nice!  Would definitely recommend this place for breakfast, I know I will go back!"}
{"text":"Good food, very helpful and friendly staffs:). However, it is kind of small and the wait is a bit long especially in the morning.   If you are looking for a quite breakfast place to hangout with your family, this is NOT the place.   I feel like I am at a bar minus the liquor and good dance music."}
{"text":"The place is small, was a longer wait than shown online check in. The food is tasty and unique however they over pepper everything! The decor is cute but the tables are less to be desired, they are wood planks and while picking up my glass to drink it almost spilled because of the grooves,that would've been very bad. Is this place a repeat? Probably not, parking also not so great."}
{"text":"Amazing food and wonderful service.  Everything we (4) had was excellent. Generous proportions and presented with elegance. Definitely a return."}
{"text":"Been exploring breakfast/lunch places in the area and this one is definitely at the top of the list. Everything I had from the bacon and egg shooters to the ham and cheese croissant was amazing. And I can not leave out the white and red sangria. Our server Maria was pleasant and prompt. I highly recommend this and will be back soon for the foie gras pancakes and monte cristo sandwich."}
{"text":"A little too up scale for my usual taste, but the food did match the setting. Ordered the some sort of French toast deliciousness and it was quite memorable. I would highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The brunch here was excellent.  I passed by it so many times but never stopped.  Very well done with the menu and food presentation.  I love that it's close to home.  I'll be back."}
{"text":"Another new brunch spot in Henderson worth waking up for!   --FOOD-- Their foie gras breakfast selections is what first caught my attention, and honestly left me less enthusiastic for a repeat visit at first. I loved the french toast with foie, don't get me wrong, it just felt too rich for me to have in the AM and slight drain on my wallet as well.  Luckily everything sounded so tempting and one month and 9+ visits later, it's pretty obvious I really dig this place!  Going off by memory  Page 1 - starters & 'small' plates - the tostadas with tender seasoned pork and topped with quail egg, rocks!! My #1 favorite light meal/post workout grub to have here. The empanadas and the sausage sampler (with sausage made in-house) are delicious and great sharing plates.  Specialty - Chicken Fried Steak.,.after seeing and tasting it when I met up wit Teri W., it's on my list order.  Benedict - Pork Belly is my fave, then the Meatless one with fried green tomatoes. Still have yet to try the country one with chipotle gravy.  The lunch section has sandwiches and salads. I guarantee you from peeping at what other diners there had, you cant go wrong pastrami. The short rib sandwich that I shared was pretty good. Although not crazy with the bread that day.  Pastries - I tried them on community soft opening event they had. Pistachio donuts, monster cookie, warm biscuits all delicious, and perfect for a pastry /coffee meetup, but my tummy belongs to the fantastic pastry chefs over at GSS and Ck.    Mexican Hot Chocolate..with those puffy charred marshmallows is my Achilles heel!!  I tell ya, hats off to Chef Antonio and Chef Javier for pulling off such an ambitious and diverse menu, everything is so delicious.  Touching on service.... Everyone always on point for me. It's either Landon or Nicole and why I know their names, is they already made it a point to know all their regulars. 2nd visit in with Nicole, she remembered my previous order from the week before...then again, who orders a table full of food for one.  Same with Chef Antonio and Javier, always has a warm welcome for everyone.   My last visit here, a server passing by, stopped walked back and noticed the water pitcher was empty and offered to have it filled. I thought wow, pretty attentive. So great teamwork on KT crew's part.   Orders are at times a tad slower coming out, but understandably so.  That tiny kitchen can only cook so much orders.  Speaking of space....the dining area is a little more cozy since it's a \"social eatery\" so if you are looking for privacy, this ain't the place for it. Tables are lined up and down on either side.  There's the communal aka the 'cool kids' table too! So don't mind me when butt in and ask what you're having...lol ...  Love the vintage-country-glam going on in their decor with varnished wood tables they did themselves to the warm colors in their stoneware dishes. Love the huge cloth napkins.   There's so much more to say, but I'll save it for a future update after I try the rest of the menu!  FYI:  Since this place is fast becoming a popular spot in our neighbors and local celebs, be prepared to wait for a table during peak brunch hours.  If you are an early bird, no wait time at all. Worth waking up for! Happy to invite family and friends to dine at the Kitchen Table."}
{"text":"At the Montecristo and an ice tea for lunch outstanding highly recommended not greasy not overbearing very good sandwich"}
{"text":"Seriously the best little breakfast/lunch spot around!!!  From the super not fake friendly vibe. Then there's the food! Ohhhhhh the food is so amazing. So much love put into everything they do! Favorite spot reasonably priced."}
{"text":"If you love breakfast food, this place is a solid choice.  We had to wait about thirty minutes to be seated (there were four of us) but I've heard it's usually pretty crowded there, so be prepared to wait.  They have a small pastry bar by the indoor waiting area and everything on it looked delicious. There were also employees making mimosas behind the counter.  The menu is fairly large, which made it hard to choose what I wanted (also seeing all of the food on the tables around me) but I decided on the traditional eggs benedict. It was delicious, the eggs were poached perfectly. Every bite was full of flavor. The potatoes served on the side were really good too, could have been a little crispier, but that's just personal preference.  My girlfriend got the meatless eggs benny, which features a fried green tomato. We also shared some of their monkey bread, which was good but probably would have been even better if it was a little more fresh.  Our waitress was nice, the food came out fairly quick and even though the place was small we weren't forced to sit too close to the people next to us.  My table wobbled and it was really annoying. I tried putting a napkin under the leg but it didn't level it out enough."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch after a few of my friends mentioned it. It's a small place so be prepared to wait a bit, especially on weekends. The staff was all friendly and very efficient. Started with the prickly pear mimosa, which was delicious.  I had the kitchen Mac: eggs, avocado, salsa, potatoes & corn all on an English muffin, the flavors were amazing. Hubby had the short ribs Benedict and enjoyed that too."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a great place to eat you should definitely stop by here! The Country Benedict is too good, perfect spot for a celebration brunch. Will be recommending it to all my friends, family members, and my Real Estate clients!"}
{"text":"This was my least favorite place that I visited this trip.   The ambiance was nice, the service was sub par. The guy seemed a tad uninterested in serving us and we arrived a little over and hour before closing.   It took forever for the food to arrive when I just preferred eggs and sausage.. The eggs were unimpressive and the sausage was okay. After spending almost $40 I would have definitely expected more.   It was something new, I tried it and probably would not try again."}
{"text":"I have been here more than once, however, this is the first time I sat outside. The hostess sat us outside as requested but she had few words to say...we had no idea if she would be back, someone would come over to us, etc.  While someone filled our waters shortly after arrival, we were not able to order our coffees for about fifteen minutes yet meet our actually server.   It was hard to flag our server let alone any other one, and communication between them seemed disjointed.  However, when we had any server's attention they were nice and apologetic, but still things were forgotten. Seems as if different people have different tables and only look out for those and if your server doesn't come around then well you are for the most part...* out of luck.    The food was excellent and prepared as ordered.  So no complaints there...Love this place I hope they can get service to match the food. None the less we enjoyed the outdoor space."}
{"text":"The coffee was good. The cinnamon roll was delicious but we really wanted to try the Monkey bread but they were all out. I guess we got get up earlier to get some. the avocado toast with poached eggs was good but the bread was a little too soggy & the salad had too much dressing. The ambiance of the restaurant was really nice I would totally recommend this restaurant"}
{"text":"My husband decided to take me out for breakfast to one of my Yelp bookmarks.  Kitchen Table was perfect as it was close to home.  Located on the corner of Horizon Ridge and Valle Verde, it's easy to find.    Kitchen Table offers delicious and unique items. They have fresh pastries staring at you when you walk through the door.  All look fantastic and eventually one day I will indulge!    Service was really great.  She came by frequently to refill my coffee which is always good.  The coffee, by the way, is delicious and full of flavor.    We decided on the Country Benedict and chorizo omelet to get a taste of each.  The Country Benedict is served on a biscuit with the poached egg and chicken covered with a chipotle hollandaise.  Yum.     I wished I had a bowl of that sauce to take home.  Fantastic.    The omelet had a great flavor from the chorizo. It's also filled with roasted chilies, braised onions and oaxacan cheese.  Spicy and that's just the way I like it.    It was especially nice to chat with the Chef.  I'll thank Mrs Shirley B for that little bonus.  I really enjoyed our breakfast here and I'm looking forward to trying many more of their menu items."}
{"text":"Fantastic food and adorable setting! Went there for Easter brunch and had the best waitress. The hue is rancheros we're to die for!"}
{"text":"Wait time was understandable. We were told everything was made to order, that we should order a muffin or doughnut to start as food might take a while. We got a white chocolate pistachio muffin, which happened to be the best thing we ordered. Muffin was warm, moist, and not overly sweet. I ordered chicken fried steak with a bagel (instead of toast). Steak was so chewy that I couldn't finish a quarter of it. It took me a long time to cut and chew (lol). The breading was soggy and greasy. It fell apart from the steak. The country potatoes and sunny side up eggs were good. Bagel tasted more like old bread than a bagel. So I basically paid $15 for some potatoes and two eggs.  My husband ordered chile verde. Green sauce was good; pork belly was tasty, but the fat layer was so thick and not crispy that it felt like we were eating straight up pork fat.  We might come back just to pick up some muffins."}
{"text":"Love the decor of this place. Outdoor seating is a must when weather is perfect! Loved it!  Service was very good and laid back.  Which I prefer when eating at a neighborhood spot. Our server was great. 5 stars for him.  The food (3 stars):  First time having a monte cristo. It's this fried lightly battered bread with ham and melted cheese inside and topped with a berry jam. It was interesting. Glad I tried it. But not really my thing.  Bacon egg shooters were just ok. It's not like a deviled egg but rather a hard boiled egg cut in half than cooled. With some kind of light aioli and topped with bacon bits and pickled jalapeños.  Jalapeño bacon was the best thing I tried. The side of hash was good too!"}
{"text":"The service was great. Food was amazing. I definitely suggest trying their sausage sampler.  We got on the waitlist on Yelp and when we got there we had to wait only a few minutes before we got it table.  I am a coffee lover and their coffee was so strong is made me shake.  Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Love this place! The owners are so friendly and inviting. The food is amazing. This is definitely one of my favorite go-to brunch spots. Try the Benedicts! And the mimosas here are so good. I haven't ordered anything here that I didn't like. I would write a list of recommendations but honestly everything on their menu is worth a try. It's definitely worth the wait."}
{"text":"Seriously, sitting having tons of time to write a review because we are here starving and has been waiting for our food for almost an 45 mins ro an hour! A table next to us came after us and their food came way after. Even if the food might be good... I probably wont come again! Also, it was our first time here."}
{"text":"Arrived at 11am on a Friday to find a 30minute wait-always a good sign when a restaurant is that busy on a weekday. We were seated in 32 minutes-so they were true to the wait time. Service was a bit slow-but you could tell they were busy. Ordered the meatless Benedict which was delicious! My friends ordered the duck n cheese omelette and the country Benedict-and they both enjoyed their meals. Didn't have a chance to try any of the mimosas but the coffee was decent! Will definitely be returning to this spot!"}
{"text":"What a great find!  We always try to find new great places when visiting Vegas.  This one is permanently added to our list.  AMAZING food and service. Our waiter had so many great suggestions and they were so accommodating with making some minor changes to their already great dishes (e.g. Adding an additional egg tot eh crepe!). Everything we had was spectacular:  fitatta, veggie hash, ham and cheese crepe, pork belly chillie relleno. We will be back and can't wait for their second location in mid-2017 which will offer dinner!"}
{"text":"I'm a sucker for \"New American\" cuisine. Maybe it's the millennial in me - but I love the casual cool brunch vibe that this place has. The venue is rather small and doesn't take reservations. I came on a Friday morning and my group had to wait for about 15 minutes before we were seated in the outside patio space. Our table was right by a speaker blasting covers of top 40 songs from the 00's. One of the waiters even made a joke about how we were sitting right on top of the speaker. It wasn't annoying as much as it was bizarre. I guess we just lucked out with the prime seating.  The service was attentive. Our waiter was polite and patient. I ordered the vegetarian hash with a coffee. The hash consisted of squash, potatoes, and similar tubers topped with two eggs over easy. The food was surprisingly filling. The coffee was good as well. I liked the look of the speckled earthy stoneware plates and mugs - imagine something out of a Pier 1 Imports.  As a Hendersonite, I'm glad I can get cool brunchy food close to home without paying the Strip premiums.   I'd recommend this place if you have friends visiting and want to go somewhere with good food and good mood."}
{"text":"Awful experience. The hostess was extremely rude. Food was average. My friends meal wasn't cooked at all. The jelly is awful. The manager walked around looking like she had zero clue what was going on. We asked three times for water. Omelet was super greasy. Probably the most overrated place I've been to in Henderson. I would never go back."}
{"text":"This used to be my go to brunch place when having family and friends in town and now I will not be coming back.  I ordered the tacos huevos, the same dish I order every time I come in and it tastes totally different and had no flavor and I actually couldn't even bring myself to eat it.  Kitchen staff were arguing and all around bad morale. They took the dish off our bill but I'm Super disappointed as this is not the typical Vegas restaurant but it has gone downhill in a bad way.  They are opening another location on the southwest side and I wish them luck, but will not be making it a top priority to visit."}
{"text":"Went to the kitchen table cafe, today for brunch. The food was delicious ! Have a great menu, lots to choose from. Great service we really enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"Waited for OVER AN HOUR for a table and were continually passed over for people walking in.  When your \"3rd on the list\" as we were told for 45 minuets there is issue!!   No food is EVER goin to be with this!  Absolutely ridiculous!!  DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place! Staff was very friendly and we were seated promptly when we got there. Food comes quick and it's delicious. really cool place, if you have free time - definitely visit this place!"}
{"text":"Great and unique food. The servers are all friendly and the atmosphere is fun. We'll definitely be coming back for breakfast."}
{"text":"Serious eats. I could go here for breakie everyday. Try the press pot coffee. Sooo good. Smoked salmon beni. Sooo good. Ill be back."}
{"text":"The food is staged on a counter at the front of the establishment with no sneeze guard or protection from patrons walking in and out. Definitely not sanitary."}
{"text":"This is a hidden gem in Henderson. The service and food were on point. The portions are huge so be prepared to take some home. The only down side is the pork belly Benedict that I had was rather tough and dry--the opposite of what a pork belly should taste like. Next time will try something new!"}
{"text":"The place looks run down and disorganized. I was told the food is great but unfortunately I didn't stay to find out. Maybe I'll try it at night, that way way I won't see the Cluster F"}
{"text":"Came here for brunch on a Sunday. The food was great. Big enough portions to have left overs. The service was great as well. Very cute ambiance. Will definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"I first tried this restaurant about a year and a half ago...I wasn't impressed. I went a second time, and had a similar experience. I'm so happy I went back again (twice more now)! The croque madam was really good, and the monte cristo was excellent. One of the best I've eaten. I'm trying the empanadas next. My only comment would be the air conditioning doesn't seem to cool effectively, And I'd like to request GREEN chilaquiles be added to the menu, please."}
{"text":"Divine! If there is one word that I would give to describe this place, it will be the word divine! My little sister is here for the weekend from San Diego and on her first day in town, we take her to Kitchen Table. Upon arrival we saw the magnificent Arely, location manager and she came out to the waiting area outside with brunch Mimosas for me and my party. This is a great surprise! She made a statement to us by this gesture that she will take good care of us during this visit.  When we sat on our table, Arely personally approached us with a bucket of a full Champagne bottle and two juices for more Mimosas! This arrived immediately before we even placed our orders. Wow!  Nicole, our hostess is very friendly and she gave my sister and I great recommendations for our brunch meal and her recommendations did not disappoint! What a marvelous woman, Nicole is. When you chance visit Kitchen Table, ask to be seated where Nicole is and you will be taken care of. Our food are delivered immediately and each dish are flavorful with the right amount of seasonings and garnishes. Yummmy!  Needless to say, we are happy and content patrons whi will definitely keep coming back!  Service and food at its best! Recommendation and satisfaction guaranteed !"}
{"text":"Brunch less than 5 minutes from where I live, and it's not a chain, and it's delicious, AND they have delcious mimosas? Dangerous game my friend. I'm willing to play though. I'll play every weekend.  The menu here is extensive, but there is something on it for everyone. Seafood dishes, dishes for the meat obsessed, dishes for the meat haters. It's all there. The entire menu has a Southwestern touch, which as a former Arizonian, I appreciate this greatly. While everything I have had on the menu is great, and I've had a lot. The thing I continue to be most impressed by are their baked goods. The pasties here are unique in favor combinations and so delicious. Oh, and they have amazing Monkey Bread here. You need to get here early though, cause it goes FAST.   The mimosas are amazing. Fairly priced and they don't mess around with the ratio of champagne to juice. 85% champy, 15% juice. Praises! Plus they have a wide variety of flavors so you can switch it up.   As a seasoned bruncher, I ALWAYS want to order a savory meal, but I need to have something sweet on the side. Kitchen table makes this easy, the French Toasts are decadent and easy to share, and the pancakes are massive and probably the best pancakes I've ever had. And just because they can, they make their own syrup here, and it is amazing.   Who knew a place like this could pop up in Green Valley Ranch. I didn't. But I'm so glad it did."}
{"text":"This restaurant makes everything taste extraordinary! I've been here many times and ordered something different each time and have never been disappointed. Their breakfast foods are the majority of their menu but they have some delicious lunch items too, and their pickled tomatoes they include in their side salads are to die for. The chefs are strip-experienced and the high quality food they make shows that these guys really know what they are doing!"}
{"text":"You can't hide in your tucked away location! I know where you live now! Great food. Open till 3, hoping they do open for dinner or at least carryout dinner. Service was a little lacking considering there were only 3 tables of other diners, but it was almost closing time so maybe they all had to go clean something. The muffin was a little lackluster. The veggie sandwich as amazing. Cute ambiance but the fake flowers detract. I think foie gras should be banned for animal cruelty, so that was a con as well."}
{"text":"Great place and the food is excellent. You should call in advance if you don't want to wait"}
{"text":"Such a perfect brunch location! Came here on vaca with my two littles, and the patio was the most perfect setting. The food was delicious, and the service was good. I would definitely return if in the area!"}
{"text":"Food was really good.. service was lacking. Wife ordered ice t and server did not hear her. Basically said she didn't order instead of just rectifying the situation. Decent prices with 15-20 min wait to be seated on Sat morning."}
{"text":"So first of all the food is just amazing!!!! I'll go ahead and put that first because, honestly, that's where all the stars are earned.  I had the pork belly Benedict and it's by far one of the best I've ever had!  The flavor was phenomenal and I HIGHLY recommend it!       The service I wish I could see say the same. It took almost 10 minutes to be acknowledged by our server today. I get it, it's Sunday brunch, they're busy, but as someone who used to serve for many years, how hard is it to say, \"hi guys, I'll be right with you.\" ???  That alone takes a star away automatically for me. Other than the slow initial greeting our server was not very attentive and hardly checked on us, she didn't even check on how our food was. The numerous bussers roaming around checked on us more. I'm super laid back and would never complain to a manager about something so trivial but a lot of reviews mention the lack of actual servers on the floor. It seems like a place as busy as this, and being a \"turn & burn\" breakfast/lunch spot they would have at least one more server. The faster people get acknowledged, orders in, they eat, and pay, that's another table sat and money in the server's and restaurant's pockets.  Seems pretty simple.       It's pretty far from us, we live in the southwest, but I wouldn't be opposed to the occasional drive for the pork  belly! If you aren't pressed for time I definitely recommend this place for brunch."}
{"text":"This is our second time here, food is just as delicious as last! the ambiance, and the presentation of the food is beautiful! The server is amazing, Landon, very knowledgable on the menu and super personable. :) Love the tacos and mimosas!"}
{"text":"Had breakfast after the gym with my girl here and we may have our new go to spot.We loved everything, I could even go on about the water, nicely chilled and with a fresh clean wetness, think I am one of \" those people\" go see for yourself. Quite the bakery and I shall have to go back for that alone, a doughnut sandwich is also calling me and a sausage sampler. Everyone there was so pleasant and our server , Landon, we were glad to have met. If you live across town, this will be worth the drive."}
{"text":"Glad to have a great non-chain food great local place like this in Henderson. The food was all made with super fresh premium ingredients. The orange juice was fresh and I was given a large portion (not a shot glass). No complaints, keep on doing what you're doing! Hopefully next time I'm there early enough for some monkey bread before it sells out."}
{"text":"I really liked this place initially due to the menu however some of the shine came off in subsequent visits after I began to notice it is often not very clean. Dirty glasses, floor, over flowing trash, yes it's busy but if that's how it looks in the customer areas I can only imagine the back. The severs and hostesses are definitely not professionals but nice so that's good enough for me.   Bottom line regular through daily cleaning will bring it back up to a 4-5 star place in my book as the fold is good, but Get on that side work, y'all!"}
{"text":"I've been hearing a lot about kitchen table and decided to try it today (Saturday around 10:30) for a brunch date with the hubs. I called ahead for seating and when we arrived only had to wait 5 minutes at most. We were sat at the long table in between two parties. That is my only negative. I didn't like being squeezed into two groups for a party of two. Besides the seating, the food is amazing.   We started off with the breakfast toquitos to share. They were crispy & full of flavor. The filling is a chorizo potato mixture (like mashed potatoes) and not spicy. But the sauces & slaw has a kick. But the creamy avocado sauce & slaw also provide a refreshing contrast. Would definitely order again. 5/5  I ordered the pork belly benny. The short ribs are cooked in a BBQ sauce & I felt like the pork belly was too saucy, making parts of the English muffin mush. But the taste was delicious with the jalapeño hollandaise. It is served with breakfast potatoes. They are diced in tiny cubes with peppers and onions. I would order again but ask that the pork belly be not so saucy. 4/5  The hubs ordered the chorizo omelette. It was a very generous size filled with lots of chorizo. I didn't have a taste but he said it was very good. Also served with breakfast potatoes."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast this morning and was not disappointed. Had the salmon and caviar and short rib benedict. I added the foies gras on the side, because how could I not. Everything was perfect. Smoked salmon was so flavorful, quail eggs perfectly cooked, and the micro greens were a great fresh flavor. It was hard to stop eating the short rib benedict. It was extremely rich and filling. The kind of delicious, nap inducing breakfast I was looking for, quite opposite the light but flavorful salmon dish. I don't think I need to mention that the foies was delicious. Most impressively, we had a breakfast laced with foies gras and caviar for $60. I would definitely recommend this place, and will be returning every chance we get!"}
{"text":"Very disappointed! My husband and I had been hearing about this place for a while and decided to get up early to try it out before they were busy.  The hostess was very nice and welcoming. She sat one party in front of us and then sat us. There was also a party after us who was seated shortly after us. This party was a party of two waiting on one other person. Once seated we were never acknowledged, not asked what we'd like to drink, not I'm really busy I will be right with you, nothing. We left once the party after us, who was still waiting for part of their party, was asked what they'd like to drink and served their beverages. There really was no excuse. The establishment was not busy at all! We weren't acknowledged as we left either."}
{"text":"You guys are right! Killer empanadas. Strawberry shortcake pancakes have accurate strawberry flavors from the homemade compote on top, and are nicely accented by the rolled shortbread cookies (extremely light and airy; how do you do it??) The short rib Benedict raises the question \"Why make it with anything else?\" The care shows. Bravo!"}
{"text":"First I would like to say that I really enjoyed everything about this place. Small cozy and the patio was nice. Patio needs a makeover to hide some of the back house things. Also nothing more annoying then a rocking table. With all that small stuff aside the food is incredible. My son had pork chili Verde. It was awesome. The pork was moist and chili Verde was not overpowering. It was there to compliment the pork. Also came on top of chips which added a nice corn crunch to it. I had a pork belly Bene. Everything about this dish was top notch. Eggs cooked to perfection. Pork was very good and the English muffin under it all was still nice and crunchy not soggy. I give them a 4 star only because they were having kitchen issues. Food was coming out real slow. The patio was nearly full and only one table had food. Our server and forgive me for forgetting her name but was on top of things and offered us some of the tastiest muffins. Banana nut and a chocolate chip. Sooooo good.       Also being on the patio we were provided some entertainment by a pigeon. Some people might find that gross or annoying but it took our mind off of how long our food took. I will return the next time I'm in Henderson. Kitchen aside 5 star for the food and the friendliness of all the staff. Great place!!!! Go!!!!! EAT!!!!! NOW!!!"}
{"text":"My best friend went here first and the next week she told me that I absolutely HAVE TO COME HERE  We had the crab po'boy and the duck confeit omelet... Neither items would I have attempted to try on my own but it was the best breakfast I've ever had Now I'm bringing another friend with me because its THAT GREAT!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I have driven by this place multiple times and it's always busy. Heard great things and decided to finally check it out.   I ordered the Pork Belly Benedict with Jalapeño Hollandaise sauce,  sooo good! My boyfriend ordered the Country Benedict and it was also delicious.   Drinks were yummy I enjoyed the blackberry mimosa, he ordered the bloody beer and they were both awesome. Also had some monkey bread, it was great to try but probably won't order it next time because it was a lot of food!   Service was amazing! I know a lot of people have complained on here about service being bad...but our experience was great. Our waitress was very attentive and checked in often! I would recommend checking in on Yelp because we got in within 5 minutes of arriving. People who arrived when we did and didn't check in were barely sitting down when we were leaving. Food came out very fast... awesome place. I highly recommend Kitchen Table and I will definitely be back soon :)"}
{"text":"Delicious brunch today at the Kitchen Table. We had to wait about 20 minutes for a table (Sun 10 am). .. But it's worth it. I ordered \"eggs in a Basket\"  A great breakfast where the soft boiled egg was in the middle of the toast, topped with bacon and some greens  with breakfast potatoes on the side. It was delicious. The pineapples mimosas were wonderful.  Skip the chain restaurants and support local!"}
{"text":"I really like this place but on this day the service was just terrible.  Our order took forever (they messed it up, people who arrived after us were practically done with their meals before ours even came) and all they really needed to do was be upfront with us about it, maybe bring out some complimentary monkey bread, etc etc. I totally understand when there are errors and delays but really all you need to do is make it right with the customer when it's happening. They did the right thing By taking an entree off the bill, but sadly it put a tarnish on our Fathers Day lunch there."}
{"text":"This has probably got to be my favorite local spot! First time here and the wait was not even 5 mins. The decor is comfy and the staff is great! Brooke was awesome with dealing with my food allergies and being attentive. I first ordered the empanadas made out of squash! Those were pleasantly delicious and would order again. I then ordered the foie and apple skillet.  I paired all of that with a prickly pear mimosa...say what!!! The flavors were outstanding. Who would have thought to put those two together? I would definitely recommend coming here and I guarantee I will be coming again, there are so many others items I need to try!"}
{"text":"Fabulous brunch!!! Get the jalapeño cheeseburger helper omelet. It's one of the best I've had! Probably a 30 minute wait on a Saturday but well worth it. We wanted to try the monkey bread but they were out so they gave us free cinnamon rolls!!"}
{"text":"Neighborhood vibe is cozy, welcoming the gathering of friends paired with yummy plates of creative delights, Visit ASAP."}
{"text":"I've had Kitchen Table bookmarked for a while and finally gave it a try today. I left satisfied but not blown away (especially given the wait time).  We had the peaches and cream pancakes and the country benedict, both of which were good (8 out of 10). Pancakes cooked perfectly, the peaches, cream and syrup weren't too sweet. It's also a large portion, enough for leftovers. The country benedict was a biscuit with country fried steak, poached eggs and chipotle gravy. Great flavor and filling.  For $12, the crab and avocado dip was disappointing. It's more like a queso - 90% cheese, some poblano pepper, about 1/3 of an avocado, and very little crab.  I love the waitlist function thru Yelp, but the wait was longer than estimated and I noticed some people who arrived after others (no reservation, no waitlist) and yet they were seated before them. Once seated, service was also very slow. It took a while for the server to take our order and a long time for the food to come out. As a frame of reference, we put ourselves on the waistlist at 12:35, arrived at 12:50, seated at 1:30, received our food at 2:15pm - on a weekday :/"}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today and was impressed! Tucked behind Paradise Shabu Shabu so it is difficult to locate from the outside, but they have a giant sign pointing to the restaurant once you are in the parking area.   The place is very cute, you really do feel like you are sitting in a kitchen. We got there at around 11 and they were full, a few minutes later and we should have had to wait. Service was very quick, hostess was friendly, water was brought out and orders were taken very quickly.   We shared The Cavier, which was 3 little pancakes topped with smoked salmon, quail egg and a little caviar on top. This was amazing! I have never been a fan of smoked salmon, but their smoked salmon was amazing. The fish was fresh, firm, not too salty , didn't smell fishy at all and simply delicious!! Definitely recommend this dish!  I had the Pork Belly Green Chili. Came with breakfast potatoes, topped with chips, pulled pork, two poached eggs and green chili...absolutely delicious! The had two big chunks of pork belly along with some shredded pork scattered on top. The green chili was sour and salty, tasted so fresh and delicious! Portion was huge, could not finish the dish on my own.   My sister had the Pork Belly Benedict, this was also really good. The BBQ sauce on the pork belly was sweet and savory, two big slices of english muffin, lots of pork on top with two eggs, served with side of breakfast potatoes. I liked the potatoes but they were very soft, my sister would have preferred if its as more crispy.   The only negative thing about is place is that it is quite small, tables are very close together, it was very awkward trying to sit and get up without hitting people at the next table.   I will definitely come back, they have a really big menu with so many items to try, so many items sounded good and it was difficult choosing which dish to try. Until next time..."}
{"text":"Food was alright, service was decent (slow) but overall not worth the wait. They have a good selection of mimosas but I did not get to try some that I wanted because they were out of certain flavours. There are better breakfast places I'd rather go to."}
{"text":"Phenomenal food and fantastic presentation. A really great place for breakfast or brunch, serving mimosas and short ribs for the hungry. Everything is fresh and made to order, taking time for all of the details. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"So delicious! I had the traditional French toast and a blueberry muffin. The French toast was so flavorful and the syrup they use is divine. The blueberry muffin was honestly, the best muffin I ever had. My girlfriend got the eggs Benedict and had nothing but good things to say. Our server was awesome and friendly. New brunch spot for sure."}
{"text":"Isle and Melanie served and waited on me ! They brought an amazingly friendly aspect to the already inviting environment. The food was to die for as well as their mimosas! I highly recommend for anyone. Coming from out of town it was nice to feel at home and taken care of.  5/5 for sure!!!!"}
{"text":"Very good food. You can't help but feel like a sardine in a can though. There is very little space inside."}
{"text":"Fabulous.  Gem in the desert. Hidden away but so worth finding.  Food is plentiful and delish. Served efficiently by very friendly staff.  Great place.  Can't wait til my next visit."}
{"text":"Very good food. All of us really liked what we ordered. The wait staff is very attentive. The wait to get in was worth it, and showed how good the food is. I recommend Kitchen Table highly."}
{"text":"Absolutely one of the best places to eat! Loved the atmosphere! Loved the staff! The food was outstanding! Will definitely return and keep returning!"}
{"text":"amazing brunch spot. the chef is the owner so the food and the details are all there."}
{"text":"I am really surprised by all of the 4 and 5 star reviews. Did we eat at the same place? Don't get me wrong, some of the food was good. But I don't think it was $75 good. My friend Rachel and I came in for brunch on Sunday 2/21. You can find this place in a small shopping center where BFE meets Far as hell. (Horizon Ridge and Valle Verde). It was pretty busy, but we only waited about 30 minutes and then we were seated inside at a small table in the back. I would have preferred to have eaten outside because it was such a beautiful day, but luckily our table was all by itself, although it was still a tight squeeze. We were given room temperature water, with no ice, and then some menus. We had a game plan and knew we wanted to try a bunch of things, so we both ordered what we wanted and then split everything. We tried:  Peach and Pineapple mimosas $6 each- I had the peach and thought it was tasty and reasonably priced. I wish they had a bottomless option though, because who doesn't love bottomless mimosas during brunch?   Croque Madame $11- This was very good. This sandwich was made with challah bread, thick ham, gruyere cheese and a sunny side up egg, then the whole thing was covered in bechamel sauce. It was savory, salty and cheesy. It came with a side salad of arugula and tomatoes with a vinaigrette dressing which was good  Pb&J pancakes $13- Probably my favorite thing I tried. The pancakes were really sweet although there was minimal pb&j. I added some of their housemade vanilla syrup and yeah I'd like to purchase a bottle of that stuff asap.  Social Pecan Roll $3- We originally wanted the monkey bread but they were out, so we got this instead. It came out warm and had a nice flavor.  Jalapeno Bacon $4- It's bacon and it's jalapeno flavored. What's not to love?  Biscuits $3- The biscuits came out hot and were served with house made jam. These are the poster child of how biscuits should be-flaky, buttery and delicious.  Tostada $8- There are actually 2 tostadas to an order, which was perfect since we were sharing. The tostada had pork, black beans, slaw and a quail egg. There was also some sauce drizzled over the top of the tostada.   Breakfast Taquitos $9- The taquitos also had a slaw on top of them, this one was a lil spicy and had jalapenos but was quite good. I found myself eating the slaw by itself after the taquitos were long gone. The taquito itself was not memorable though.  Rachel also got coffee and a fruit cup for her son, which by the way took forever to arrive. I don't know if they don't have highchairs but we weren't offered one, so maybe think twice about bringing young kiddos. Our total for both meals was $75. Now I am by no means cheap, but this is ridonkulous for brunch. Looking back, I can't believe we spent that much money especially since we only ordered 2 main plates. We did get a military discount and that did knocked the price down $14, but nothing was so amazing that I have to come back and spend that much money again. All in all I think this was my first and last time here. The service was intermittent. Our food took about an hour to come out of the kitchen. They were out of 2 of the items (monkey bread and empanadas) we originally ordered so we had to settle for other things. And it was really warm in the dining room and made our dining experience a bit unpleasant."}
{"text":"I've been looking to try this place as it's right next door to my house! It was busy with one table available inside the restaurant. We weren't able to take this table because we weren't a party of five. They put us outside instead. Ten minutes latter still no service, not even water. We got up and went to the breakfast restaurant next door. Poor service and disorganized."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is fantastic! It's popular and often has long wait times on the weekends- but it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"Excellent excellent excellent. Service is great, chef is great, food is amazing. The pork belly green chili is outstanding. I almost stopped eating threw my fork at the wall, stood up and danced in the restaurant."}
{"text":"Let me start with a warning.  Expect a wait.  Maybe even eat a little snack before you go.  You know..to avoid the hangry.  But don't let this scare you away - you most definitely want to wait for this food. We went on a Sunday and were told it was a 30-40 minute wait for a table.  So we did what any person wanting instant gratification would do.  We ordered food to go from the coffee counter.  You can order anything from the menu to go.  And we did! Avocado toast, Salmon Benedict, a chicken sandwich, and monkey bread..and a caramel macchiato.  I was disappointed that they didn't have chai lattes or fresh OJ but my macchiato was divine.   The food though! Absolutely scrumptious and a ton of it.  The avocado toast comes with eggs as well.  The benedict came with matchstick home fries - does that make sense?  And they were sooo good.  The eggs were poached perfectly as well.  The chicken sammie was served with chips, I assume housemade? All in all the food was wonderful and we got it in about 20 minutes!  To-go FTW. The prices are a little high but not when you consider the quality you are getting, and really I couldn't even finish my benedict there was sooo much food!   I can't wait to go back and try the breakfast tacos..and the cinnamon roll...and about 10 other things I saw on their menu..including mimosas!"}
{"text":"The wait was long (granted, it was a Saturday morning during brunch time). Once we were seated, our drink and food orders were taken right away. Maria and Lily (sp?) were the best and took very good care of us! However, the food was very bland. That is why this review is getting 3/5 stars. The only thing I thoroughly enjoyed was the cream of potato soup. I had the braised pork Benny and my boo ordered the pork belly Benny. Both of us agree that the food needed more flavor and that our experience was NOT worth the wait."}
{"text":"Cute place. Great service, but the flow of the store was a bit crowded.  We got the sausage sampler, it was good but not anything different from hilshire farms really. I ordered the foie gras french toast and it was delectable and filled me right up. My husband ordered the crab po' boy, the salad along side was refreshing. The lump crab meat was sumptuous and tasty. We would consider coming back if we were in the area.Coffee was nothing to rave about, I wish they had more brunch items though."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere of social eatery! The service is excellent and the food is yummy. I'm grateful that they have vegan options."}
{"text":"Great selection, unique menu and only once (of many trips) has it not been amazing fresh food. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The flavored lattes are amazing! The food has always been great. I have never eaten something that wasn't good. Perfect portions. Great service. It is usually busy but always worth the wait!"}
{"text":"Love going to the kitchen table for Sunday brunch.  A server named Joe is always inviting and friendly, makes us feel at home."}
{"text":"I was uncertain for the first 1/2 hr of our visit how the rating would pan out by the end. I called at 7:30 to see if I could make a reservation for 1030a since we were going to be a large party and wanted to a least give fair warning . They don't take reservations but put us on the waiting list out of courtesy for a large party which I thought was nice. When we got there we were seated within 10 to 15 minutes and began to order.none of the sweet pastries i.e. monkey bread cinnamon rolls are even really worth eating so I started to get nervous. But once we ordered our regular breakfast and it arrived that all changed. Crêpe was excellent, Benedict was excellent, chicken fried steak Benedict  was excellent, white chocolate French toast was excellent, monte crispy was great. They do need to work a little bit on the timing of getting the food out since a lot of it came out 5 to 10 minutes before the others at our table . Service was decent but not great. I would still recommend it"}
{"text":"I love everything about this place. The chef is just the coolest guy, really makes you feel like he's having you over to his home for brunch. Adorable decor, very high energy. Usually a short a wait for a table, but I promise it's worth it. I have loved most of what I've had - which is almost everything on the menu. Favorites: croque madame, the benedicts, and the pancakes (especially bananas foster). Only thing I disliked was the donut sandwich. Sounded like a great idea as I imagined an egg sandwich on crisp, sweet beignets...but it ended up being on regular glazed donuts and topped with a salad tossed in vinaigrette, which ended being really, really weird. So I'd stay away from that. I also wish they'd serve fresh squeezed OJ, even if I have to pay a pretty penny for it, it would be so lovely with their breakfast. Anyway, you must try Kitchen Table. You'll love it!"}
{"text":"Came here for father's day and it was incredibly packed which is to be expected.  We put our name in and waited 45 minutes which sucked a bit because it was so hot out.  That being said, I am so glad we decided to wait.  Although they were sold out of some of the dishes, the food that we got was absolutely amazing and gorgeous o look at.  I almost didn't want to touch it but when I did I couldn't stop.  It is very homey inside which is comforting.  I can't wait until I come back here!"}
{"text":"Jalapeño Bacon!!! My friend recommended this spot and it was soooo good. They have great indoor and outside seating. Also multiple flavors of mimosas like blackberry, mango and etc... The food was good as well. I had the duck omelet because \"why not.\" It was good and was sautéed in a white gravy over eggs. The breakfast potatoes was good as well. The only thing I didn't like was the avocado crab dip. They used imitation crab meat which I hate. I am a southern girl I rather the real thing. Other than that it has great ambiance and good service. Also you must try the Jalapeño bacon it was the best part!!"}
{"text":"Loved this place! Great atmosphere, good service and yummy food! The prices are so reasonable. We got a bottle of champagne for mimosas, an appetizer and two entrees and it was only $50. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Good little spot for breakfast (only time I've been there so far) the inside is small, but they also have an outdoor patio which unfortunately we were not able to sit at since there was a chance of rain. Our waiter was very nice and accommodating. I started off with a cup of fruit for my daughter. The fruit was fresh and large portion. For my first plate I got the rolled taquitos, and they were great. The combination of flavors all worked. I liked the spicy red sauce they put on top so I had to ask for more. For my main course I got the chilaquiles with scrambled eggs. The chilaquiles were good not mind blowing. I would like to try more of the menu. Overall good experience."}
{"text":"The food is sooooo good! Came here for my Mom's birthday with my Grandma for lunch. The food is a little bit on the pricey side but for the quality it's worth it. We had the meatless benedict and the kale salad. Both were delicious! Their cappuccino was also good, especially in a cute mug. Seating inside is pretty small so you might have to wait a little bit for a table to dine in house."}
{"text":"I took my mom here for the first time today, and we were absolutely blown away. So much attention to detail is paid to every little thing on the menu. The two chefs, who are also the owners, prep everything on a wooden table which is visible from the main room. As soon as I saw them hand sprinkling sea salt on the dishes I knew we were in for a treat. We ordered the Pork Belly Benedict and the Foie & Apple skillet cake. Both were just out of this freaking world.  They smoke their own pork outside in this giant bbq, so the flavors were just insane. And the skillet cake was so savory and sweet, definitely a must have if you like foie gras. Our waitress Nicole was fun and informative, and definitely added to the experience. She also told us that they get their food delivered daily, so they don't freeze anything! It's so refreshing to go somewhere that is owned by chefs. A lot of the time places will cut corners when it comes to quality, but you can tell they have pride in everything they do here. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I had an amazing experience at the Kitchen Table this week. The place was packed, every seat was full. That is always a good sign. I ordered the breakfast tacos and my mate ordered the Eggs Benedict. Both dishes were phenomenal. We also ordered a bottle of champagne with a side of Guava juice to make mimosas. I can not express how incredible this experience was. Incredible service, food , and atmosphere."}
{"text":"What is there not to love about this place! They have great variety of mimosas and the food all looks so good! We had a table for three, that typically would seat two - and it was just the right amount of room for my friend and the two bigger guys with her! Be prepared to wait for the experience, but it's worth it. I would venture to say this place is always hopping, it was my first time here and it won't be my last!"}
{"text":"Wow... delicious!  And accommodating!    There were about 12 of us ladies for brunch and they were able to offer us separate checks!  How's that for customer service!  And they sat us all together in the pretty patio.    The food was big, hearty and super tasty!  I ordered the Country Bene... think of an Eggs Benedict... minus the ham and add mini country fried steaks on each English muffin... and it was a gravy-style Hollandaise sauce... OMG.  I was in heaven.  It had a bit of spicy kick to it which complemented the dish well.  I'd definitely order this again if I were in the neighborhood!   I also ordered a guava mimosa and while it was really good... I don't think it was worth the $8 for that little flute of it.  I tried the white sangria and that was delicious too!    If you're in the area, give this place a try... you won't regret it.  Huge menu  with decent prices.  Parking is a breeze since it's in a strip mall.   ."}
{"text":"This is my new \"go-to\" breakfast and lunch spot in Henderson. Great food!  Be prepared for a wait, sometimes up to 30 minutes. Well worth it."}
{"text":"This place is hidden behind a shopping plaza. Food was ok nothing special. We were charged extra for no reason and also the server gave herself a higher tip than what was written on our credit card bill. My husband called back and they did credit us back but didn't even apologize. SHADY!"}
{"text":"Dropped by for brunch around noon on a rainy Sunday. It was, of course, busy. We waited about 30 minutes for a table. Not too bad.  Our server was very friendly and quick. The decor and ambiance is comfortable.  Ordered a Gluten-Free Cinnamon Toast, Duck and Cheese Omelette and Ham and Cheese Crepe. Everything was delicious.  You may have to wait a while for a table, but it's very worth it."}
{"text":"Such a cute little spot with great ambience. Ate the doughnut sandwich the first time and it was delicious, but VERY filling and sweet. Tried the tacos huevos the second time and they were also delicious. Friends that have come with me enjoyed the bagel breakfast sandwich and the jersey joe. Iced coffee is also very tasty. The service is great, although it gets packed for breakfast/brunch! Price is pretty average and worth the quality."}
{"text":"Our first experience here this morning, very nice dining, something different from the norm. Will return for different dish."}
{"text":"Talk about a nice hidden gem in Henderson. The worst part is lost count over the years the amount of times literally ran past Kitchen Table doing loops from the Multi-Gen for triathlon training. Thankfully my beast partner Suzy H reminded me about this place and one day got together for lunch at Kitchen Table. It was the first time for me. No doubt not my last time.   I got the Monte Cristo. It been long time since had one in general. Talk about bringing back all the best things about a perfect Monte Cristo. The batter was perfect. It was fluffy, golden brown on the outside, and crispy. The inside the cheese was dripping to perfection, the ham tasty, and one of the best Monte Cristo in Vegas. The raspberry jam was top perfect compliment.   Suzy ordered the short rib eggs benedict and french toast. The eggs benedict was amazing. The short rib just alone stood out BIG time. It was braised too perfection. The meat was super moist, with tons of flavor, and had nice little spicy kick in it. I could have had bowl of Short rib braise by itself or pair it with anything else on the menu. Short Rib heaven on earth. The poached eggs were nice not over cooked then top it off with traditional hollandaise sauce. It was truly classic Eggs Benedict just taking another level with the Short Rib braise well well well done.   I enjoy the decor. The big Kitchen Table sign once walk in definitely give the place character. The outdoor patio area is nice on perfect days. You might even see a yelper running laps past you for brunch. LOL."}
{"text":"Not impressed. When my mom brought up this place to eat at, I looked it up and got excited because it looked great. Got there and it was a different story. The servers were running around everything and I felt like a packed sardine in the dining area. Not to mention the small amount of choices on their menu. The food was okay though. Don't think I want to go back ever."}
{"text":"I ordered the Country, peach mimosa, and jalapeño bacon. Everything was very delish. A party in my mouth. My server was very nice. The manager walked the restaurant to check on all the guest. I will be back to try the white chocolate French Toast"}
{"text":"Worst customer experience since moving to Vegas. I can't attest to the food because didn't have a chance to eat. Was told wait time was 45 minutes. After an hour was told it would be another 45-1 hour and there was a hold on the door. I asked for an explanation given there were 2 dozen people outside and a lot of empty tables. Said no explanation needed and the wait was the wait. I asked were they going to actively inform people a hold On door and was told no. I have been pleasantly surprised at how much customer service oozes out of every part of Vegas, not just strip. This was the worst i have experienced. Everything i have seen says the food is amazing, but first impressions last. I won't go back."}
{"text":"First, let me express how happy I am that a second location will be opening up at Gramercy in Feb. 2017! Yaaasss!   I really like the offerings here, they cater to nearly all tastes. I can, and have, brought guests from all walks of life, and everyone has left happy and full.   My favorites are the chopped salad, the egg white veggie frittata, the tortilla soup, the empanadas, the turkey bacon club, and the monkey bread. They also have a great offering of mimosas, and will mix the juice for you (cranberry pineapple for the win!)  The egg white dish is really unique because they use a whipped cauliflower puree on top that resembles a béchamel, without the guilt. Brilliant!!  The only negative aspects can be found if you are dining on the patio. While I enjoy smoked meat, the smoker is overpowering and I have left smelling like woodsmoke more than once, and had to go home and take a shower and change clothes.   Also, service seems to be far less consistent on the patio...as in, you can expect to not receive as much attention from staff if you are sitting outside. I've sat outside as many times as I've sat inside, different time of day, and days of the week, and this has been an obvious difference each visit. Don't fret though, your frustrations will (probably) subside when you get that side of their jalapeño bacon."}
{"text":"Let me first start by saying me and my 2 friends are extreme foodies and are pretty hard to impress at this point. We walked in to a packed house (that's a good thing) and while we waited for our seat we hit the coffee bar up front to find the best coffee I have had in Las Vegas. The manager Melanie had treated us to some sampling of a pie and chatted with us a bit about the menu, her favorites and introduced us to the chef. I was extremely impressed and I hadn't even sat down yet. Melanie had recommended the Country Benedict, so I gave it a shot. WOW! This was amazing!! This place is an absolute MUST! Plus you can throw foie grais on just about anything you want. The service here was absolutely flawless in every way from start to finish. The food was flawless. I can not wait to come back and eat my way through their very impressive menu. Huge thank you again to Melanie for elevating an already amazing experience. This is a new go-to spot for us in Vegas."}
{"text":"We love this place!!! Finally a breakfast place that is not a chain and is not serving the same (low-quality) food as all the others. I have been looking for something like this since I moved to Vegas! I am so happy we found it and I love going there since it reminds me of the wonderful cafés in Europe! Very \"chilled\"! The interior is uniquely \"rustic\" (very cosy) and the outside seating is wonderful as well. Last time we went (Sunday) they had a fantastic singer playing for us on his guitar! The food is DELICIOUS! I can never make up my mind of what to order since it all sounds great! Service is awesome! My favorite breakfast place in town for a relaxing Sunday morning!!!"}
{"text":"We ordered the monkey bread to start and we both got the eggs in a basket. All of the food was great and we really liked it, but the service was super slow. We didn't get our monkey bread until after we received our meals and a lot of people around were sitting around waiting for their food or their check. They were also plenty of empty tables and extra waiters, but there was at least 10 people out front waiting to be seated. I might come back again, but only if I don't mind waiting around for awhile. The location is also kind of hidden. Nothing too exciting."}
{"text":"Too much potato servings and they added bell pepper. No one in our group ate the side of potato with bell pepper. Perhaps, have a choice next time?  A bit on the pricey side, too. Food was ok. French toast for 3 pcs at $11 plus is a bit expensive. Chorizo omelette was good. The ribs were great per my daughter. Will come back perhaps next time we're in Vegas. Gotta earn more to afford breakfast here :)"}
{"text":"I'm sure this is what the food in heaven tastes like.  It could not be any better. I ordered the pork belly Benedict and I don't even like Benedict usually. The best part is that my meal didn't cost any more than the big chain restaurants.  The waiters and staff are so friendly.  I'm giving them another 5 stars for a total of 10 stars.   Don't bother looking at the menu. Just order the pork belly bene. And let me know if it tasted like heaven."}
{"text":"I overheard great things regarding this establishment. My first time experience was quite the opposite of positive. The front staff were very rude the moment we walked in. It almost felt as if bringing two children for breakfast was frowned upon. The staff informed me of a 1+ hour wait, never looked up to make eye contacted, and turned around before I could answer.   We had the bagel egg sandwiches, which were very oily and heavy as a result. The jalapeno bacon was very soggy and eggs were over cooked. The egg wrap was half decent, probably a 3/5 given it was somewhat dry and overcooked.   I will give a 5/5 for the bakery items... the muffins and bread are both amazing. I'll likely return for a muffin and call it a day. Certainly will not return for an in-house meal, I'll take my muffin to go."}
{"text":"Kitchen table is a beautiful breakfast spot in Henderson. Has awesome communal vibes with a nice selection of mimosas, the prickly pear one is my favorite. The only downside would be that they do not have a bottomless option. The chile quiles is my favorite dish on the menu. 5 stars for kitchen table"}
{"text":"Came here on a Thursday for a nice brunch and the place was busy! But we got seated right away. We asked the server what was the most popular item on the menu and she suggested the pork belly Benedict & the country fried chicken Benedict. She also said that anything with pork is delicious. We went ahead and got what she suggested. Also, added a buttermilk pancakes on the side. I didn't like the country fried chicken but I did like the Benedict part. Who wouldn't like eggs right? My boyfriend really liked the pork belly Benedict maybe I just ordered the wrong item. But overall service was good breakfast was good but I'll come back and get something different."}
{"text":"Wow, so lucky to have found this place. First if you go off of map quest it's tucked away on the side of the building, or took a little hunting but mean was it worth it. We had the peaches and cream pancakes and eggs Benedict and a side of the jalapeno bacon. The eggs Benedict had a little more vinegar flavor than I'd prefer but everything else was ON POINT!  Our server was awesome and the environment is fun and up beat. Definitely will be back!"}
{"text":"Disappointed. We were seated only to watch four parties seated after us receive service before us. For context, we were the only Latinos seated and the other parties were white. Then there was a delay in our meal because they lost our ticket. They decided to pick up our tab and the food was fine, but I had lost my appetite by that point. As someone who researches race and racism, I'm aware of the subtle and not so subtle ways it manifests itself (e.g. stereotypes about racial groups and their tipping practices). I recommend that the manager or owner consider sensitivity training. I'm happy to change my review when they do."}
{"text":"Breakfast was great. Had the Country Egg Benedict with gravy vs hollandaise sauce. Coffee selection is good as well. Bakery items look fantastic!"}
{"text":"Awesome menu, very different. The food was amazing, service was fabulous. Great place!"}
{"text":"monkey bread was on point, so was the guava mimosa, and course the pork belly bene, also service was amazing"}
{"text":"Great atmosphere and food!  The white chocolate pancakes are delicious!  The chef is out in the open doing quality checks on all dishes.  Music was different versions of popular songs.  Very neat place. The food is rich though and kind of pricy but it is different and worth it."}
{"text":"In short:  Positive: Food Service  Atmosphere  Negative: Noise level  Portion size to cost ratio  Wait time  The service was pretty good and the restaurant has a great concept and so does the food. Personally, I give this place 3 stars because I didn't walk out full. The food was decent, I had the french toast and it was 4 stars. The only caveat was that I like to eat a lot and I like to sometimes have bacon, if not some eggs and hash browns along with it. The French toast was $12 and I got 3 (on the smaller side) pieces of toast. I walked out full because I didn't want to spend $60 on our breakfast by ordering eggs and bacon. It was sort of hard to talk to each other and the server. I found not only myself but also our server asking to repeat what we said multiple times. The atmosphere and decorations were pretty cool. I like the idea and am a full supporter of mom and pop places. On the bright side, the food is good and so is the service.  For the most part, I believe my opinion was contingent on the choices I made. The restaurant is not bad, just a little over priced and loud. If you sit outside noise isn't an issue I'm sure and if you order something like foie gras or have a smaller appetite, it's worth it."}
{"text":"It was ok.  Reviews are great, but my wife and I were not overly impressed.  If you like trendy places, you may like this."}
{"text":"Best breakfast in Vegas. Maybe anywhere. Croque madam is a favorite as well as the empanadas. Loved everything we've ordered here.  Service is top notch. Don't debate. Come here. Get the social bucket with prickly pear."}
{"text":"We made a reservation, got a text confirmation and arrived at scheduled time. When we arrived they told us they didn't have our reservation. After showing the text and confirming this was the correct restaurant, they just blamed the \"new girl\" they didn't do anything and we're not accommodating. So terrible. You clearly need to get your act together and have your staff not blame other staff. We invited guests and your error and lack of action set a terrible first impression for 5 locals."}
{"text":"Lovely neighborhood spot.  So nice to have good local food options popping up in HENDERSON! God bless em they've been very busy from day one but handled it well. I get warm and friendly service from the owner to every server. Food is interesting and tasty. More than anything it's nice a warm setting to relax before work or take in brunch on the weekend. Highly recommend"}
{"text":"Update to my review.  Unfortunately, this place seems to be back sliding a bit.  I've been here a few times in the last year and a half and each time I've walked thinking to myself it wasn't worth it.   The whole place feels tired to me.  From the menu to the food and the restaurant itself. We were handed 2 menus you could barely read due to being so worn out.    We sat outside and there is a shed that looks like it came from an episode of Stranger Things (from the 1980s)  with used kegs visible behind it.    The food, that also seems to have taken a turn.  We ordered the heavily recommended pork green chile and a po boy.  The pork green chile had minimal pork and zero salt which meant no flavor.  The po boy was unexceptional and felt like a mistake while odering it, but for $15 it should still have redeeming value of some sort.  The po by came with a \"green tomato salad.\" Yea, it had 4 tiny pieces of tomato on some greens.   It's unfortunate, but for a $45 brunch for 2 in this town the options are limitless."}
{"text":"My wife and I enjoy this quaint little restaurant.  The food is good, the staff is very friendly, and I would recommend this establishment for breakfast.  A little expensive,  otherwise I would give them five stars..Overall, we really like it.."}
{"text":"The short rib Benedict and the peaches and cream pancakes are to die for! Our server was amazing and attentive, and there seemed to be endless drink and pastry options. It's a must try"}
{"text":"My favorite place for breakfast/brunch. Pork belly hollandaise is a must. The service is great and the atmosphere gets you away from my the usual Vegas vibe. A must try."}
{"text":"Great breakfast spot. Delicious food and the place was super cute. Had a lot of very cool choices in the menu. Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"Great brunch spot, but the wait for a table gets super long, super quickly. Every item we tasted was amazing!"}
{"text":"Sunday brunch with my husband and son. It was a 45 minute wait but completely worth it! We ordered a bottle of bubbly with fresh blackberry juice for mimosas. Yummmm! The hubby ordered pork huevos rancheros and I had the smoked salmon benedict. My son had a pancake. The food was exceptional!!! Our server Nicole was fantastic! The chef stopped by our table twice. He's a super nice guy and is very passionate about food! What a great new spot in Henderson! Definitely adding this place to the brunch rotation! P.S. We LOVED the music!!! Bringing it back to the old school!!!!!"}
{"text":"\"It's not about time, it's about choices. How are you spending your choices?\" - Beverly Adamo  Pork Belly! Foie Gras! Short Rib! Chicken Fried Steak! If this list catches your attention then Kitchen Table is the place for you...besides, why have bacon when you could add foie to your pork belly? Kitchen Table offers an impressive variety of breakfast and lunch options. I don't know many places where you can choose from a Monte Cristo, Croque Madame, Chiliquiles, Duck and Cheese Omlette, Chorizo Crepe, Pork Green Chilie, and Lox & Bagels, but you can at KT...Comfort food on steroids to say the least.  I was glad to have the opportunity to check out Kitchen Table. We split the Beef Short Rib Benedict and the Chorizo Crepe. In general, the dishes were heavier and richer then what I'm typically looking for. Still, what they do, they do well. I think I would have enjoyed a smaller sampling of several items quite a bit. There are a few healthier items on the list, but I feel like these are more appropriate as attempts to appease guests of those coming to eat the dishes that Kitchen Table has become known for. KT also has a nice selection of baked goods, though there were only two of us and we were not hungry enough to share more. It did make me think that this would be a nice place for a larger group to come and share some items.   It was too cold for what I would guess would be a happening patio during warm days, so we sat inside on a 2-top...one chair and one sofa/banquette. The banquette has a serious issue however. It is 3 inches too short for the tables and chairs, so unless you are over 6' 6'' then you are eating somewhere around chest level...making for an uncomfortable situation.   In the end, although it's not a spot I'm going to rush back to, I can appreciate what they are doing at Kitchen Table. 3.5 Stars seems right for me, but I'm rounding to 4 Stars since my love awarded 3 Stars and I can justify balancing things out in my mind."}
{"text":"After having waited for at least 15 minutes with no service we finally left. We were completely ignored we were seated way in the back and nobody came to to take our order. The noise level in this place on a noise meter registered around 86 which is very very loud. We saw other customers come in and get seated and have their orders taken while we just sat. This is the second time we tried to go to this place and it was a complete failure again. In all fairness the first time they were just overly busy."}
{"text":"Love this place! Today was our first visit and would definitely return again.  The environment is comfortable and loud with conversation, which works out perfect for bringing our 2 kids, their noise blended in with the chatter of other diners lol. The wait staff was wonderful, so kind, smiley and attentive.  The food was amazing! I got the pork belly chile, just the right amount of spice and the pork was SO tasty! My husband got the chile quiles. He said it was great and it must have been because he wolfed it down before i knew it. This is a great spot to go for a nice date, to bring family to when visiting or just a nice sit down with friends!"}
{"text":"I took my wife and mother in law to the Kitchen Table after looking at a few selections on Yelp. I understand Mothers day would be crazy. We waited nearly 2 hours and after a little frustration we were seated. The hostess is very clueless to customer service. That being said, this place is ABSOLUTELY AMAZING! I wish I had tried the jalapeno bacon but now I have something to go back for! Adam, our server was on his game 100%! We felt very much like family! He talked to our 6 year old son asking him how he liked his food! Javier, the owner let us bend his ear about the hostess and cared! Chef Antonio, the food is beyond Excellent! The plating and presentation looked like it came of the cover of a fine dining magazine! I was so excited to eat I forgot to take pictures! My wife ordered the breakfast taquitos, mother in law got the chorizo omelette, son got strawberry short cake French toast, and I ordered the Smoked pork belly benedict! WE WILL BE BACK! THANK YOU JAVIER AND STAFF!!"}
{"text":"Made a reservation ahead of time so we didn't have to wait very long before we got seated (Super crowded on a Sunday morning).  Staff was great and food was delicious!  Also many mimosa options!  Will definitely be back with my girl friends!"}
{"text":"Amazing customer service! From the hostess to the waiter to the chef! They all greeted us and made sure that our meals were perfect and that everything was to our liking. The place is super cute and super chill I went with my girl friends and we were catching up. We. Ever felt like they were kicking us out or anything. If anything they continues to serve us until we left. Some restaurants stop serving you after you've paid them. The chef Pedro was super sweet and he came over to our table to thank us for eating there and he told us about their new location. I will back for sure and I will be visiting their new spot as well.  Let's talk about the food!  Super yummy. I got the chorizo omelette and it came with house fries. The house fries were bite size which I love. The omelette was delicious and it tasted so authentic. I orders a coffee and they gave it in a good sized mug. So cute. They serve you chilled water without asking. And refills were never missed. I highly recommend this joint."}
{"text":"Trying out the Amazing Kitchen Table today. Great ambiance and very cozy open kitchen brunch environment. I ordered the duck mac & cheese omelette and it was fantastic! All of the food coming out of the kitchen looked phenomenal! Found my new breakfast spot when I'm up. Even with all the great breakfast places in the area, this place shines. Even got my mom to try it after I went & she loves it"}
{"text":"We're always on the hunt to try new places and today it was Kitchen Table. At first glancing at the menu just knew that it was a place for my wife and not me, but surprisingly I had a very good experience and delicious food. I had the biscuit and gravy, sausage selection, and Pork Belly Benedict which were all delicious but the Pork Belly was phenomenal! Now my wife went with the Empanada, Monkey Bread, and Avocado Toast your more healthy side, and it was bad, but what do you expect with a healthy selection (HAHAHA). However we were very pleased with the service (Rapheal, very courteous, and knowledgeable), atmosphere, and presentation of food (definitely something that you would expect to find only on the strip). Though the wife may not had a good experience with the food, it's important that the man paying the bill is HAPPY  Regardless would recommend anyone to try this place. It got 4 out of 5 because I had to deal with the consequences"}
{"text":"First time here and I'm in love. The customer service from our waiter Rafael was amazing, very friendly, happy, and he very much showed that he cared about us being satisfied with our meal and our experience. We got a guava mimosa and monkey bread on the house because our food took awhile to come out. The mimosa was very yummy and perfect to match our meal. We ordered the duck and cheese omelet and the vegetarian hash. Both were pretty generous servings. Overall the food was delicious, the seating outside felt very nice with an umbrella to cover us from the sun. We can't wait to come back! Thank you Rafael for your service and kindness!"}
{"text":"Love this place! They've got the best twists on the eggs Benedict that I've ever tasted. I had the Country Benedict. Full of flavor. It had the right amount of sauce on it. Not drowned in it. It has a Mexican taste. The fried steak was cooked very well. You have to eat it fast though so that the steak can still have that crisp to it. Javier, the owner and chef, was there during that time, and he was very nice!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here and it was amazing ! Food was great, service was awesome, and the place is super cute. I got the chorizo omelet, and I highly recommend it. Im pretty positive everything is homemade which makes it even better. I will for sure be coming back here."}
{"text":"Foodie Paradise! Everything we tried was unique, delicious but not too off the wall. Loved the biscuits and gravy, sausage sampler plate and dipping syrups. Wish I lived closer! I will be back every time I'm in town. Attentive service and a chef who cares. Antonio was in the kitchen and out and about in the dining room to talk to customers-a nice personal touch. Although they are know for their monkey bread-it wasn't anything different than I make at home."}
{"text":"Employees are real polite and the food is amazingly delicious, the location is real small and tables are shoulder to shoulder but real calm and quiet ambience."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing! This is my second time eating here and the food & service is great. Kitchen table has become one of my favorite brunch spots to go to. The way they make their drinks is just ! Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We have been trying to go here for a few weeks, but every Sunday when we go, the wait is an hour, and we never have time to wait. Today, we were told the wait was 45 minutes, and decided to be patient. While we were waiting for our table, we stood in line for the coffee/pastry bar where we ordered a latte and mocha. It took us about 20 minutes to get through the line and get our drinks, which was a little on the long side in my opinion.   Service: All of the staff we interacted with were very friendly. Our server was attentive and helpful. I asked for hot sauce, and she brought a few, pointed out her \"favorite,\" and it was the best hot sauce I have ever had. I will need to go but some from the store soon.   Environment: So a \"social eatery\" apparently means \"we don't have much space, and don't use our outside patio space well, so we are going to cram as many tables in a room as we legally can, and have multiple parties sit at the single long table.\" That part didn't bother me in any significant way, but we kept laughing throughout our meal because we felt like we could hear every word of every table's conversation in the place because we were so close to each other. There were also A LOT of screaming children in there when we were there, and in such a small place it was rather disruptive. But we have come to accept that parents who live near the Green Valley area are the worse type of parents out there, and let their overly privileged children run around screaming and putting their mouths on every table/surface in sight (yeah that happened, with two different kids while we were there). My final note on environment that I mentioned in my picture, the patio is not a well designed use of space. I could easily fit 15-20 more seats in the sectioned off area, hire 1-2 more servers and reduce the ridiculous wait times here and get more customers served. I just do not understand why that area was set up that way at all (it almost looks like they ran out of money for furniture and just gave up as 50%+ of the patio is just empty space).   Food/Drinks: The drinks from the coffee bar were decent, not the best I've ever had, and both were disappointingly room temperature. The mimosa flavor options were pretty impressive. We loved the prickly pear! Both of our entrees were really good. Relatively simple dishes packed with a ton of flavor. The food made the overall wait and environment downfalls worth the trip. Of important note, the prices were also reasonable given what we were served. It would be easy for them to charge another 2-3 dollars per dish and get away with it, but they don't, and that is appreciated.   We'll probably be back, but probably later when the wait isn't so ridiculous and the children are all at home napping....   2016 Yelp 100 Review Challenge: #30."}
{"text":"What a cute restaurant! The wait list thing is a little weird because I did sign up on the Yelp wait list and when we arrived, we still waited for about 30 minutes to be seated. That wasn't a bother, we were able to get something to wet our throats while we waited and it was pleasant outside while we did.   The food is really amazing. You can taste the home cooking. My friend who joined me said that she has never had better pancakes anywhere. They were melt-in-your-mouth tasty.   I had the chorizo omelette, and it was melt-in-your-mouth, perfectly portioned, not too spicy and presented beautifully.   The food didn't take very long to come out and the servers were all attentive.   The food itself was well priced.   Will be back, likely very soon."}
{"text":"Not a diner, not snobby-trendy, pleasantly casual.  Not Antonio's, but Javier's place.  The menu does not even hint at the eye-popping creativity of the dishes.  From the classic oatmeal with real maple syrup and choice of toppings to the exceptional melted cheese, tomato and egg sandwich on excellent bread, a vegetarian will find plenty to indulge in.    We meat-eaters are in our glory though.  Try the chicken fried steak made with a filet cut, the burger with bacon smoked on premises, the ham and cheese crepe that will make you sing... Order one of the Benedicts with chipotle gravy and you'll want a tanker full to travel.  Great coffee, white sangria, mimosa, hot chocolate topped with toasted marshmallow, beer.  I am lucky to live close by. but it is worth a drive to get to.  Just a few blocks off the 215, plenty of parking.    Naturally, there's a wait at noon and on weekends, but order a beverage and enjoy the patio.  Say hi to owner and hottie, Javier. or manager Arely from Peg."}
{"text":"We went here on a Tuesday morning just on a whim. The staff was excellent along with kitchen. We ordered the short rib Benedict and the country (chicken fried steak over a brisket with gravy). Both plates were delicious. Neither one of us would really share bc we enjoyed our own ordered dish so much. This is officially our favorite breakfast spot now. It's a hidden gem."}
{"text":"Wow! My family and I had Easter brunch here and the 13 of us will definitely be returning. The staff was so nice and went out of their way to accommodate our large group. The restaurant has such a fun atmosphere with big farm tables and upbeat music from the 80's and 90's. The food was amazing! I had the avocado toast with poached eggs. The greens that came with it were so fresh and dressed perfectly. I also tried some of my dads pork belly bene and it was also very good. I just might need to order that next time! So flavorful. The chef came around to our table to make sure we were happy with our meals and was such a nice guy. He even complimented my young son's clothes. I highly recommend this restaurant! What a great brunch spot. A must visit in Henderson."}
{"text":"We keep coming here and trying new things, and never leave disappointed. Excellent flavors, braised meats, high quality, fresh ingredients. Fantastic mimosas too.  Love to avocado toast as well as the salmon / caviar blini. Have also really enjoyed the suckling pig tostadas and pork belly green chile that had tons of flavor and just enough kick."}
{"text":"Talk about a hidden gem! Staff were a delight and the food, top notch!"}
{"text":"Had heard a lot of buzz about the Kitchen Table and was eager to get myself down there to see for myself. Being a Thursday at 9am my girlfriend and I were sat immediately and the place was not too crowded.   First and foremost the decor was rustic which I liked and the plates and mugs were all very in tune with the atmosphere. You certainly get a comfy neighborhood vibe within the kitchen table which I also enjoyed.  Our waitress Nicole greeted us promptly and was attentive throughout the service as well. Water glasses were never empty and she was present throughout the meal without being intrusive.   As for the food I got the the Shorty Benedict which is an eggs benedict made with braised short rib with béarnaise and red wine reduction. It was astounding. The meal was hearty and left me very content for the remainder of the day. All the flavors complimented each other extremely well and was only made better by the side of potatoes that accompanies it.  My only gripe as a self proclaimed coffee snob was that the price point for the iced coffee is a bit high for what you get. But that alone was not enough for me to even consider wavering from a 5 star review of the Kitchen Table. Absolutely must try new venue in the Henderson area."}
{"text":"My friend and I met here for Sunday brunch a few weeks ago and we were not disappointed!  I had heard the wait take a while on Sundays, so I called ahead and was placed on the waiting list before we left. It was quite crowded and the wait for walk ins was about 45 minutes, but we only had to wait about 10 since we had called ahead. Once seated we immediately ordered cocktails and some monkey balls. Both were delicious!  For the meal my friend ordered the frittata and I ordered the avocado toast. Both were excellent.  The atmosphere in the restaurant was very cozy and the staff was friendly and attentive. We will definitely be returning soon!"}
{"text":"We stopped by Sunday afternoon for brunch on a recommendation from a family member. The wait was 45-60 minutes, but we got skipped over on the list and it was more like an hour and ten minutes.   We finally sat, then waited another 10 minutes before the water guy came. Another 5 before the waiter came and brusquely asked what we wanted. Another 30 went by before we gave up and left since the couple before us gave up and left and they had been seated about 15 minutes before us.   The service was terrible, we were basically ignored. After the one couple left, their food came out and the waiter just started passing it around, being fairly rude about it. We weren't unique, the entire restaurant was full of people and we saw four dishes come out in 30 minutes and only three tables had food.   If you're looking for a up to two hour wait for food and iffy service, this is your place. It certainly won't be somewhere we would return to. As a small business owner, I'm appalled at the lack of service and inability to deliver food to that many waiting customers on a busy afternoon."}
{"text":"This is a great restaurant. It was my first time here as I am on vacation but my boyfriend lives here and has been wanting to come check it out for a while and he loved it!! He is definitely coming back!   The location is a little tricky to see from the parking lot but it's in between a sushi place and a math tutoring place so look for it!  As for the food, everything is made to order and fusion brunch meals which is fun. The head chef is onsite to ensure that everything comes out looking good.  I ordered the vegetarian benedict which sounded amazing on the menu; avocado, fried green tomato, and poached egg. Unfortunately when mine came to the table it was missing avocado but they were very prompt with rectifying the situation so that was good.  We went on a weekday and apparently they don't encourage drinks like their fun variety of mimosas during the weekday because we had to ask for a drink menu. They also feature local beers...yum!  The decor is too cute...loved the furniture and the long family table. They also have a fabulous outdoor area you should check out!"}
{"text":"Awesome Customer Service!!!! Cute place to have breakfast. Tables are close together, but that's probably why it's called Kitchen Table because the atmosphere is like your at home sitting at your kitchen table."}
{"text":"I had the meatless Benedict, and it was amazing! Fried green tomato inside, yum!! My PIC had the veggie sandwich, also really good. Friendly service."}
{"text":"Read a review on this place in the Henderson View. Had to come and try it and definitely glad we did! Hubby and I love breakfast/brunch spots and this is a new favorite. I had the foie gras pancakes and they were heaven! We ordered a donut to start, but along with that came two decadent cookies \"on the house\" so keep that in mind when ordering with your stomach!  The empanadas were also perfectly cooked, great texture. There was about a 25min wait to be seated that's not uncommon with breakfast spots on the weekend."}
{"text":"45 minute wait for......?  This place was definitely not worth the wait. The ambiance was so so, and the food wasn't the best. I ordered the pork belly bene with a few minor adjustments (eggs over hard, no onions and peppers in my potatoes).   Potatoes were super oily and still sporadically found onions in them.  The best part of this place was the staff, thank you to our waiter Maria and the food runner Lilly with the speedy clean up and assistance!!!"}
{"text":"First time here and it was a great one. Service was fast and the staff was very friendly and inviting. Would def visit again"}
{"text":"Great food and the place is something different from all the other boring food places. Customer service was great!! Sarah there made us feel welcome and with great food and people like her I'm going to make this a regular visit. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Finally got to check this place out yesterday for lunch. Bustling and busy on a Monday, which was a good sign.  Food was very good but the service not so much.  We were seated and I told the waiter I would just like water and he asked me if I would like lemon with that.  He returned without lemon and then I asked two more times and he never came back with lemon so I let it go. My friend ordered a crab sandwich and I ordered a smoked meat Jersey Joe's sandwich - I believe that is what it was called. The waiter raved about how they smoke their own meats and it was fantastic and blah blah blah.  I also ordered a side of avocado with tomato as my salad. Our food comes out by another server and she brought me the vegetarian sandwich, which I refused. The crab sandwich was correct and so was the side veggies. The waiter came back over and asked me incredulously why I didn't want the vegetarian sandwich and I told him that's not what I ordered. I reminded him how he explained to me how awesome the meat sandwich was. Of course they were busy and it took a while for my correct sandwich to come out. When it did it was delicious but my friend was done with his meal. The manager she came over and apologized, but the server never did and pretty much avoided our table after that. I did not buy the lunch so I don't have the servers name or I would've included it in here. I will probably go back sometime but I will definitely avoid that guy.  I think every customer's pet peeve is for servers that don't write down the freaking orders and then screw it up. Please just use a pad and write it down. We only want our order to be right."}
{"text":"Food is great.... Different cuisine for breakfast then you will find anywhere else. Pastries are awesome. Would be five stars but a little pricey."}
{"text":"Kombucha was $12 and my Monte cristo was $11. The sandwich Monte Cristo was an epic FAIL. ALL dough ... like two inches of dough and one slice of HAm that was picked out of a pre packaged container . Service was great but food was a major let down.Glad we didn't wait too long for this."}
{"text":"I promise to give this place another try. After hearing friends rave about it and reading wonderful reviews, my daughters and I checked it out for lunch. The atmosphere is nice. We were seated shortly after arriving. I ordered the vegetable sandwich. More bread than vegetables and very difficult to eat. Unfortunately the vegetables did not have much flavor and there was no type of dressing or cheese on the sandwich. My one daughter ordered the taquitos, which she said were dry. The other daughter ordered the Turkey BLT which she said was just ok.  I am looking forward to going back and trying something else on their menu!"}
{"text":"This is hands down the best breakfast spot in town-nothing compares. My boyfriend and I eat here on a weekly basis. The eggs in a basket reminds us of our childhood and the vegetable sandwich is to die for! The food is reasonably priced, the service is great and the mimosas are good. It's nice to be able to sit outside on the patio if you wish. Love love love Kitchen Table!"}
{"text":"This is our favorite breakfast spot in town! My kids beg to go here as they have the most amazing pancakes.  I have tried so many things and loved them all. It's so hard to decide what to order because everything is amazing! The service is always impeccable! You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Wow, the dining experience was very pleasant.  We did not have to wait to be seated even though is was a full house. We made the staff aware that this was our first visit. The menu has such a variety to choose from. Our server knew the menu well so he really guided us to experience familiar items with the \"Kitchen Table\" twist.. I order the Salmon and Begel then topped it off with a plan crepe. My palette was pleasantly surprised. It was just enough food to fill my late morning /early afternoon appetite. I would definitely recommend this restaurant. It will now be my go to brunch spot. Great for breakfast and lunch. I will be recommending to others."}
{"text":"Let me first start off by saying the food was not bad, but the prices were horrendous!  I really feel like this place is just about the hype? Or maybe the beautiful setting that they have outside. No doubt, it looks like a beautiful place to have brunch but not after you find out there is an hour wait!  Or that one crab cake was $15! Or how about a crepe that was (I think) around $12?! I honestly was still hungry when we left this restaurant.  The food was tasty, but not worth the price. Although I must note that when you order a coffee, it comes in a huge soup bowl! I thought that was pretty cool.  Or if you don't mind prices but are looking for a cool place to catch up with friends, this place would definitely be it. Don't forget to \"skip the line\" with yelp!"}
{"text":"Eh , Well, I really want to leave a 2 star review but I will go ahead and leave a 3 star for now.  So I came for a late Mother's day brunch with the fam bam. OMG that Vegas weather is killer hot. First impression after walking in, Like all the baked goods were sold out already , yeah that sucks.., and MAN it was SOOOOO hot in there. Turn up the AC past a tickle will ya ?  We put our name on the list, went to go run a quick errand, and were like seated in like under an hour or so.  What we ordered:  chiliquiles country fried steak benedict croque madame and * cant remember the exact name of my dish but it had short ribs, english muffin and egg w/foie gras  Le sigh.  I was like soooo excited to try this place, you can add Foie to anything?? Could this be too good to be true? But sadly, I left seriously sick to my stomach. Puuhhhlease look at my pics and you will see why..  Anyways, Everyone enjoyed their food, BUT me. I tried a little nibble of the short rib meat, eh.. plain. So , the short rib meat lacked flavor, but that would have been bearable, Nothing a little hot sauce can't fix right? I checkout the plate, and literally EVERYTHING is swimming in straight oil! Whyyy... Whyy would you do that?!??!  I ate the egg, picked at the meat, but the salad was wilted from the hot oil bath, and the potatoes and the muffin bread had also absorbed some of the excess oil. Well well... this is the first time foie has lead me astray. WTF happened u say? It was obvious that the oil used to sear the Foie gras was also dumped onto my food, ALL OF IT, ALL OVER MY FOOD. Since we were there celebrating Mommas day, I didn't want to mention it, but when our server came around, I finally decided to tell her. She saw the oil, and said she would tell the chef about it. She comes back to tell me, Foie gras is supposed to be oily. Uh yeah the Foie itself is fatty, but my food should not have been swimming in the oil it was seared in.  Mr. Chef Antonio, Did you even look at my dish to see what had gone wrong? It was a simple newbie mistake that someone in your kitchen made that could have easily gone noticed and fixed. However, you were too busy meeting and greeting guests instead of checking the food quality before sending it out. Yeah people pick your jaws up off the ground, I did just say that. Oh no she didn't ! While its nice to mingle with guests, food needs to be up to par before socializing etc.  I'll probably be back when visting fam again since they enjoyed their dishes, but I will steer clear of the Foie Gras."}
{"text":"Little hard to find but worth the effort.  Prepare for a bit of a wait to be seated and to get your food.  It's well worth the wait but if you are in a hurry then you may want to go elsewhere - but you will be missing out on some really good food"}
{"text":"Disappointed- especially after reading all the reviews! My Husband & I are traveling home from Vegas & looked on Yelp for a place to have breakfast or lunch. Found this \"Kitchen Table\".... We always looks for 4 or more   Did the wait list on line for a table - was told the wait is an hour, but we can come & Check-in, so we did.  While waiting to sit outside we ordered drinks at the very busy, and disorganized counter/bar. PS don't order the Bloody Beer!!! Very messy! , I had to go to the restroom just to wash my hands from all the stuff.... the restroom was disgusting ~ paper towel dispenser was not working ~ toilet paper all over the floor, pee on the toilet seat, etc. totally gross! If we hadn't ordered our food, I would have left right then!!!   We were seated outside, per our request (unfortunately)  the table behind ours had a dog!!!! It kept shaking its head & drool & slobber was being slung all over!!!! TOTALLY DISGUSTING!!! Not sure why a dog is allowed outside next to other patrons & wagging its tail & the owner would not keep it next to HIS OWN table!!!!  The best thing about this place was our server, Ilse- she was very informative about the menu & had good suggestions too.   I'm very surprised this place had so many stars for their rating!!!!  Just a heads up, look before you are seated & order!!! You may change your mind & go elsewhere!  They need new management or a Manager that takes pride in his or her place of work!!!  We have been traveling all over this country - I'm honesty saying ~ keep looking!!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this place! Duck and Cheese Omelette is to die for, and my boyfriend loved the Country Benedict, he was almost licking the plate clean.   Usually request to sit outside though, due to poor air circulation inside.   Wish there was a location on the northwest side of town."}
{"text":"This place is awesome! I've been wanting to try it for forever but the wait on the weekends is insane. Had a chance to go for brunch on a Monday and there was no wait at all. We got to sit outside and the patio was really nice. We started with the tostadas, which were huge! Messy to eat, but good. Unfortunately I am a spice wuss so with the sauce that was on them my mouth was on fire. I had the croque madam,  and hubs had the chilliquillas. Mine was SO decadent with all the cheese and the amazing sauce. Hubs said his was amazing, but I had to take his word for it because I could SMELL the spiciness lol. We will definitely be back to try more goodies."}
{"text":"Very creative dishes and all around delicious meals. I had a pastrami hash that was great, and around the table we had berry waffles, banana foster's pancakes, sausage, bacon, muffins, and more - everything was excellent. Great place for a brunch for sure. The chef came around a few times to talk with us, which is always appreciated and a nice touch. Look forward to coming again."}
{"text":"Hostess is HORRIBLE! Sat her friends while there was a over hour wait. Was told an hour wait then checked again 45 minutes later and told it'd be an hour. Rude and needs to learn how to tell time. Will not be coming back.. food is not worth the wait."}
{"text":"Finally! Henderson gets a breakfast, lunch and brunch place you can be proud of! Kitchen Table is by far the best foodie place around. From their French Toast Foiegras, Short Ribs Benny, Chilaquiles  and the amazing Slow Roasted Pig Tostada. The menu is amazing and plenty of healthy options as well! Try Kitchen Table ASAP! You will not be disappointed! The coffee is wonderful and the service is impeccable. This is the spot to be if you are an experienced foodie or one who wants to hit the next food palette level."}
{"text":"It was my second time coming here and service is great.  The first time around I had the french toast, the portion was large and super yummy. I got the monkey bread both times and it is so yummy, gooey and warm.  The decor is beautiful inside and so is the outdoor seating!   The second time around I got the American breakfast. I asked for extra crispy potatoes and what I got was not very crispy. I don't know how soggy they would have been if I didn't ask for extra crispy.  I got my eggs scrambled and they were weirdly smelly, not sure if they use real eggs.  The toast I got with it was the best part and super yummy. But, the breakfast as a whole was not the best.   Another con is that their water glasses kind of smell like \"wet dog\".  The first time I was here we asked them to get different waters and the second glass was somewhat better. The second time I was here, the glasses smelled the same and I just used a straw.   Pro: great seating, great decor and decently good food, awesome monkey bread  Con: smelly glasses, smelly eggs, mediocre potatoes  Next time, I would probably try a different spot then return."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! They have amazing different flavored Mimosas, I love the variety of eggs Benedict's the Country fried chicken eggs Benedict with biscuits and gravy are to die for! My absolute favorite thing is the Jalapeño Bacon. It will really change your life and ruin all other bacon for you. Plus you can add yourself to the waitlist right here on yelp! Talk about convenient! Highly recommend this hidden jewel!!!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!! Omg!! I totally recommend every dish.  I had the most amazing experience here too with the server, great customer service all around!  wow!"}
{"text":"The service and good were both top notch. Our server had umbrellas shifted around so the sun was not in our eyes. It was a wonderful way to spend a Sunday morning with a friend!"}
{"text":"I have wanted to try this restaurant for so long, when my friend was visiting from Colorado I finally decided it was time. We had plenty of time so I wasn't worried  if there was a wait....but there wasn't!  We were still early about 10.30. The staff and waiter were very welcoming. I love the small cozy atmosphere ....not alot of tables so no wonder there is usually a wait. We orderd the monkey bread.....@#$! $%&***** so good I am glad they brought it with the meal ...otherwise  I would have not had any room FOR  my meal. We both had Benedict's The original and No meat. Delicious  ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS. I can't wait to return and sample the rest of the menu!!!!!"}
{"text":"Went for lunch on a Monday with my girlfriend and the wait time to be seated was horrible. That's fine, it's a busy lunch hour rush. Not a big deal. Then we get seated and it takes twenty-five minutes for our order to even get taken. Again, that's fine I guess, our fault for coming at a busy time. After we order though, it's another twenty minutes before our food is served. We ended up spending over an hour to get our lunch. Then we had to wait for our check... another twenty minutes.   It wasn't the waiter's fault, he was awesome. It was the management. The food was good but it wasn't amazing. I can't say that I would come back for lunch anytime soon. I would normally give this place a 4/5 if I was just reviewing the food, but the service was so bad I just can't.  Just a tip for the management, the faster you take an order and deliver the check, the faster you can turn tables and serve new customers. I saw 6-7 people leave the restaurant because they couldn't get seated in a timely manner. People only have so much time for lunch before they need to get back to work. The atmosphere and the food is good, you just need to work on your service times."}
{"text":"Sunday Easter was packed. We were 8 and I understand it takes longer time to get a table. You can order a drink any kind water coffee or alcohol while waiting to be seated...which is very nice. We waited for ever for our food...I was patient because it was Sunday and it was a busy house. The food was looking great but the chilaquiles were bland. The pork was not even flavorful and the sauce was bland, no spicy flavor and they were very dry.Service did forget to serve my crab cake after everyone at the table had their food. The crab cake was really good so I think it's was just a bad day to go because it was too busy. I do recommend this place give it a chance...your experience might be different than mine. Also the cream brûlée late is good."}
{"text":"Was in Vegas for Superbowl weekend and decided to check out this place at the recommendation of my good friend. So we took the 15 minute Uber ride to Kitchen Table for brunch and we were glad we did. I ordered the Chilaquilles with pork and my friend ordered the Tacos Huevos - both were delicioso! We also ordered the empanadas and those were delicious as well.  Very reasonable prices and good portions.  Highly recommend that you check in on Yelp and get added to the wait list as you will likely need to wait. Bottom line, worth the wait, worth the drive out there."}
{"text":"Came here twice to make sure our first visit wasn't an \"off\" day, especially since there were so many good reviews. Every dish was lacking seasoning both times, and very oily. Sausages came out barely warm. Coffeecake was just okay, dry. Booths are much lower than the tables, very awkward.   The cappuccinos were delicious, as well as the homemade biscuits. The decor is cute and trendy. Overall good concept, just poorly executed. Will not be going back a 3rd time......"}
{"text":"When I first tried this place I went back another 3 times in the same week. By far one of my favorite places to eat breakfast/brunch in Henderson. A real gem.   Definitely try the pork belly Benedict and the French toast!"}
{"text":"A brunch date with my niece this morning.. We decided to try this place seen the pics looks good, and it does taste good as well.  The restaurant inside isn't too big but they have a outdoor patio which is nice to sit on a nice weather.    We ordered Tostadas for starter, comes with shredded pork, slaws and quail egg top with theirs be, salsa.  We shared pork belly Benedict.. Which was SOO tasty, very flavorful and very tender.. love this dish very much!!   Croque Madame... NOT very good, we both did don't like this dish at all.. Very blah blah, ham, cheese, egg and bread.. No flavor Wat so ever..  There dish comes to a total $36.. Not bad..I'm glad I drove all the way to Henderson, tried it once is good enough!"}
{"text":"My new favorite place in Henderson. Found this place on a whim surfing  through Yelp. So glad I did. Great ambience, knowledgeable staff, and amazing cuisine. Can't wait to visit again and try some of the other items."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing food, fast service, friendly wait staff and huge coffee mugs! All the win!"}
{"text":"Great food. I haven't had a bad meal. I've tried almost everything on the menu  I love this place"}
{"text":"The menu was monstrous with many unique and wonderful dishes bordering on food porn. The kitchen is small thus giving one a feeling that this may be all flair no substance. We where sat after a 10 minute wait so as not to put the kitchen in the weeds... Ok good/bad. The service was timely and very good by a tattooed, man bun sporting waiter who was very knowledgable of the extensive menu and was very accommodating of the picky and inquisitive chef of our group.  Coffee out of this world and did not need the little dose of Bailey's which we could of got and you may now get as NV gave and temp.took liq lic because of red tape.  The food all came out of the small kitchen beautiful and delicious. A true breakfast culinary experience. I will be back soon hopefully as I want to go for Breakfast and Lunch as well as try the Micheladas they have on the menu after a night of revelry."}
{"text":"I've been holding off on reviewing Kitchen Table because I wanted to check it out more than once. But, now that their second location will be opening soon on the westside (closer to me) I doubt I'll make the trek back to Henderson.  What I tried on my lone visit was outstanding. The sweet, warm, pillowy soft monkey bread was everything I thought it would be and more. The pork belly benedict had enough heat from the jalapeño Hollandaise to wake up my palate, without numbing it and the pork was crispy, yet tender. The salted caramel pecan donut, to finish my meal was a nice, sweet way to end a great meal."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed this restaurant. They have the best chilaquiles I've ever eaten. The atmosphere was pleasant, and they had great wait service."}
{"text":"Been here a few times and food is great! The chilaquiles are definitely one of our favorites. The French toast had an awesome whipped cream, but the toast itself was a little more soggy than I'm used to. Our waiter was awesome.  Large parking lot and the restaurant is always packed. I checked in for the Yelp reservation wait-list at 12:17pm and it told us to check in with the host by 12:47, and we were there by the time. When we got there the hostess told me about another 30-45 mins, but I showed her our check-in time on Yelp, so she said 15 more mins. We weren't seated until 1:25pm, which is why I dropped a star. They should have more accurate timings bc the waiting area is cramped and people are getting there on time."}
{"text":"Decided to try this place for breakfast. I'm a huge fan of the trend of breakfast lunch spots that close focus just on those two meals. This spot was good, don't get me wrong, but didn't leave me in awe.  First and foremost the staff and cleanliness of the restaurant was on par. The outside patio seating is very large and seats almost as many as inside. Perfect for a fall day with family.  The interior was interesting. Decor made it feel like it was homey. Long seating on both sides of the restaurant. First thing you notice as soon as you walk in is the fact they have their coffee pots near the host stand. Very interesting location.  We set down and our server introduced himself right away. What are the couple cups of coffee. Coffee is very good. Didn't catch the roaster. It was busy around 11 in the morning and progressed to get busier. The menu is a little overwhelming. About six pages or so. A page for each specialty such as starter/appetizers.  We decided to start off with the empanadas. They're priced at seven dollars and come in a portion of three. Great for vegetarians. We were slightly disappointed though. Not a traditional empanada. It's made with a corn masa like a tamale but it didn't seem fully cooked or maybe it's because it's a different style but it felt doughy in a way. We gave these 2/5  We literally got her appetizer one minute before entrées came out. That was slightly annoying. We noticed that our waiter took the order of three other tables right after he took ours and all the orders went in at one time.  I ordered the chorizo omelette. Again I was a little disappointed. Everything seemed very high-quality. If you're a traditionalist in the sense of a traditional Mexican breakfast, the taste palette is a little different. Not sure if they use a different brand of chorizo or what it is but the flavor was a little off. The omelette was a little lacking in ingredients. I like a \"fatter\" omelette and this one was a little flat. Gave this a 3/5.  My friend Heather popular peaches and cream pancakes. She asked for the peaches and cream on the side. The beaches don't seem to be canned. They came out in a skillet nicely browned in golden. The whip cream is very fresh. Pancakes were also golden brown and fluffy and cooked to perfection. Gave these a solid 5/5.  One thing that we found odd was that the table next to us asked for extra whip cream. A server came out with a plastic container of whipped cream that was obviously used in the kitchen and proceeded to spoon whip cream onto the plates of two customers next to us straight out of the container.I work in the food industry and if the owner or manager of the restaurant I was and saw that they would have a meltdown.  They did get pretty busy. It seemed like they were down to two servers and their female manager. Took a while for us to get any refills on the water or the coffee.  Overall good place. You can definitely see the Mexican and Tex-Mex influences. But this is far from traditional Mexican breakfast style food. Like I said overall good. Maybe a little short staffed and that's what led to the a little less than perfect service but still a decent place."}
{"text":"Super cute place to have breakfast. The table setting inside could be kind of described as a cafeteria. Some tables & seats are combined but that doesn't bother me. There are also seats outside.   I ordered breakfast tacos. It came with 3 tacos that had potatoes, scrambled eggs, pico and avocado. It came with a Salsa that was very good. Unfortunately the tacos weren't really anything special. Besides the salsa it really lacked flavor but maybe I should have went on a different direction with my food selection because my friend got the meatless Benedict and she loved it.   We also got the crab avocado dip. That thing is cheeeeeeeesy! It was pretty good. Artichokes would be a perfect fit in that dish if they ever want to change it up. Because the dip is good but if they make that into a Avocado spinach artichoke crab dip...  now that would be a hit!    The staff was great. The cook even came out and checked on everyone in the restaurant one by one. I think his name was Oscar but I could be really wrong. Our waiter was attentive and helpful.   Next time I gotta try the monkey bread I hear it's amazing"}
{"text":"Weird.. it's like I'm back in LA again for brunch, except with more reasonable prices!! Went around noon and only waited 10 minutes, despite it being pretty packed. Cute ambiance, and great service. Multiple people checked in on us multiple times.   Portions are a perfect size, they make their own potatoes that they seem to add to all the main entrees. Tried the traditional eggs benedict, Pork Belly Green Chille which comes on nachos, and the Chorizo Omelette. All were good. The traditional eggs benedict was... traditional.   Drinks also good! I personally recommend the Sangria, which comes with fresh fruits. The mimosas actually come with fruit concentrate, unlike most places that use syrup.  Would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Great food and service. I got the taquitos. They were the perfect portion, and a short stack of pancakes. Yum yum.  Side note: careful with the maple syrup cork, it went flying when i opened it."}
{"text":"Great food, somewhat slow when it comes to their service. But the food ALWAYS makes up for it. Their avocado toast is amazing. We also had their breakfast tacos, which were delicious as well."}
{"text":"I came here in march for my b day and had brunch. Food was amazing and atmosphere was great!! Manager was super nice and hospitable which made us feel comfortable and welcomed.   I ordered the Pork Belly Benedict and it was delicious!!! Definitely coming here again and trying everything else including their Bloody Mary.  5 STARS!!"}
{"text":"One of the best breakfast places in town. In addition to the usual menu items from a breakfast/lunch joint, they feature creative dishes like short rib hash, smoked salmon with caviar on blini."}
{"text":"Visited a few occasions over a period of time and still the same outcome -- Underwhelming in service, flavor and definitely not planning a return visit. Weekends are meant to be enjoyed, continuing my support for the neighborhood CraftKitchen down the road for a far superior experience."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place! The wait time was quite long but that's what I expected on a Saturday afternoon. Our server was pretty busy so she wasn't coming to our table often to check in so we were stuck having to share water with each other while waiting. The service was also pretty slow... our appetizer came out at the same time as our entrees. Overall, the food was realllly good!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!  We came for lunch and everything was so delicious and of course we had to order crab deep"}
{"text":"Went for breakfast with the family.  Mom was a bit hesitant when we walked in and saw that the place is pretty small, and there is some communal seating (a large single rectangular table along the right side).  But we were hungry so she relented.  We sat in the middle of the large table with people on either side of us, which was a little annoying.  Hopefully you won't have loud or irritating table mates if you go.  Or request a separate table but you may have to wait a while.   As for the food...Delicious!!  Eclectic menu but nothing too odd.  Mom had salmon Benedict which she loved.  Excellent smoked salmon.  I had chorizo omelette which was delicious. Dad had a ham crepe and sis had breakfast tacos.  Everybody loved their food.  Fresh tasting ingredients, perfectly cooked.  Go for the 5 star food.  Just knocked 1 star off for the seating.  But a great little place for Henderson."}
{"text":"Had late breakfast early lunch at this fabulous eatery.  Food was excellent, service great.  They had a guitarist from Australia who added just the right touch.  Enjoyable restaurant to socialize and met new people.  Prices are moderate and the dishes are well worth their weight in gold.  Seating is a little snug, but then you get to chit chat with others, which makes for a really fun time.  The Mimosa's are good as well.  I want to thank  the staff at the front for assisting me with the container of rice for my Iphone.  Left it in there overnight as suggested.....Taaa Daaaa.  We are back in business.   Will definitely return."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!  The food is absolutely delicious.  Fresh and homemade. Diverse and delicious menu.  The staff is friendly. Go during the week or be prepared to wait on the weekend!"}
{"text":"My daughter has been raving about this location since her last visit to Vegas. So while we were in town it was a must for us to try. My child was not wrong and she knew exactly what I would order. The Egyptian was perfect! Toast, bacon, avocado, poached eggs, mixed greens and nuts.  Wonderful service kind friendly and fast. Can't wait till our next visit!"}
{"text":"Super cute restaurant.  The pastries are fresh and they bake only so many a day; which is a good thing (they don't recycle) and a bad thing (I missed out on that yummy monkey bread twice).    I highly recommend the quail egg and caviar bilinis!  They were absolutely fantastic, but were not filling... Make sure you order a sausage or something.    The chicken-fried steak with the potatoes and egg cooked any way?  Flavorful, but the steak was a little tough and gristly.   Coffee = 5 stars. I love the coffee cups and the dinnerware!   Service is nice.  Kitchen was a little slow both times, but it's nice you can see the cooks and the chef busting their asses.  Seating could be a little more organized...   It's a little crammed; I can listen to my neighbors' conversation rather than my fiancé's.  But overall, delicious."}
{"text":"THEY SUCK !!!  I cannot write a review about their food since I didn't get to \"enjoy\" it... Today, on Mother's day, I chose to come to this restaurant for brunch, knowing that I will have to wait a little. We arrived at 11:30AM and were told that the wait is about 45 minutes. fine.  45 minutes turned to over 2 hours !!!!! and no table in the horizon. I have to say that half of the restaurant was empty, and the manager (who couldn't care less..) explained to me that the kitchen is overwhelmed with orders.  I was trying to make reservations the day before but they \" take reservations for party of 8 people or more\" even though, when I was there I was told that a table of 4 was reserved. Bottom line, we left, frustrated and angry. A business that does not respect my time and lie to my face will not see me or anyone I know ever again. Very poor on customer service."}
{"text":"Don't go on the weekend. The crowds are crazy and the wait is excruciating. Once you are seated be prepared for prompt friendly service and tasty food.  Fresh ingredients prepared in an interesting way.  Not a bad option on the menu."}
{"text":"The food, the location, the ambiance was perfect. I tried the monte cristo which had a homemade jelly on top. The saltiness from the ham and cheese combined with the sweetness of the strawberry jelly was a great combination. I also indulged on the Mexican hot chocolate with the roasted marshmallows. I had a hint of spice to it which reminded me of the authentic hot chocolate my grandmother would make. Everything on the menu sounded great. I can't wait to come back and try other items."}
{"text":"White chocolate french toast !WOW this was the best french toast I've ever had in my life! . I couldn't stop eating it. . This is a nice spot to lunch and brunch. They have mimosas which is nice . And a great staff with great customer service. Only bad thing I found is that the tables are kinda high when sitting on the sofa side ."}
{"text":"Wow! Within two weeks I had people telling me about the kitchen table. It was delicious, and the food   was prepared on point.  I was surprised when Chef Pedro came out to my table and asked \"how was your food?\".  The food was great, the service was great and I'll definitely be back.  I'm excited for their 2nd location to be opening by Avenue Church.  I'm ready to share this place with my Avenue family.  May God bless you as you open your second location Pedro. Bendiciones"}
{"text":"Good food combinations, pastries, and coffee  and the server was great. The chef was really nice. The hostessing method needs a loooot of work! They have been open long enough that it should be well worked out by now. She told us 30 min when it wound up be a little over an hour, definitely almost left. They said they weren't seating all of outside because they had one server. A lot of people wound up walking out because it seemed inefficient and were then being told wait was hour and 20. I'm glad they are busy, but absolutely they need to communicate better. The hostess called our name finally and from the front door said \"go all the way to the back the one set up for three\"... What? A hostess should walk you to the table not tell you the directions to get to it. Pretty unprofessional, even for a casual atmosphere. As we aimlessly look at each table to see which one open is set for three, we finally found our way  Their menu doesn't list each item that was on my dish either. Not listing sour cream/crema? yuck. I know now to ask for what it really has on it. A more specified menu and communication please. I'd like to come back. I'll probably give it another shot on a less busy day"}
{"text":"Horrible service. Hardly any customers there and they sat us right next to another family and then forgot about us."}
{"text":"Overrated and horrible. I really wish the chefs would actually taste the food that they put out because it was absolutely horrible. We couldn't even finish the bacon...who doesn't finish bacon? I find it funny that people actually give this place five stars. You have been warned!"}
{"text":"As a self-proclaimed \"foodie\" I am a YUGE fan of breakfast! I have my favorites all over Vegas but the Kitchen Table is my number one choice.   The flavor...unreal and always packed into every bite. They roast a pig every two days so do NOT make the mistake of ordering a dish without pork in the dish. The Kitchen Table has the BESTEST Chilaquiles that I have ever put in ma face!!!! The pork Benedict is what I had last time and let me say...off...the...charts!!! Super glad we found this place and excited for them to open a store in the southwest part of town."}
{"text":"True enough, this small tightly confined restaurant serves an extensive variety of foods both for breakfast and lunch.  I was shocked and dismayed, however, upon realizing that the restaurant serves foie gras (seared foie).  To produce \"foie gras\" (the French term means \"fatty liver\"), workers ram pipes down the throats of male ducks twice each day, pumping up to 2.2 pounds of grain and fat into their stomachs, or geese three times a day, up to 4 pounds daily, in a process known as \"gavage.\"  This process is cruel and inhumane. Typically, the ducks or geese subjected to this type of torture are confined their entire lives in tight pens that do not allow enough room to even turn around.  When you consume foie, you are supporting animal cruelty - all creatures being considered as \"animals\" for this purpose.  When a restaurant serves foie, it is promoting animal cruelty.   Therefore, when you patronize a restaurant that promotes animal cruelty, you yourself are supporting animal cruelty.  The person(s) who owns this restaurant should be ashamed. They should immediately cease and desist from serving any food which represents the byproduct of animal cruelty.  If you are somewhat claustrophobic, you may have a difficult time maneuvering at this restaurant. The restaurant environment itself is tightly confined, consisting of two or three large couches with benches, forcing people who do not know each other to sit adjacent to one another. Makes for some very uncomfortable situations. And coffee is an astonishing $3 per cup, totally outrageous.   For ethical and moral purposes, I will not patronize this restaurant."}
{"text":"The food is great, only if they had enough silverware, bottomless mimosas awesome as well as long as they don't run out of champagne flutes.  Outdoor seating is almost perfect among torn and ripped umbrellas. Generally a good spot, but ran down with really bad management. Too bad, don't think it will survive with this kind of attitude for a lot longer."}
{"text":"First time there the atmosphere feels like home.  The food was amazing; the chef came out and spoke to us like we were old friends. Wonderful place I would recommend Kitchen Table with 5 stars. Thanks for making us feel like Family."}
{"text":"Food is wonderful the Monte Cristo was perfect!  The social bucket a great deal (just remember to add the juice to your cup first and pour the champagne SLOW).  I will be back here as many times as possible While I am here to try the rest of the menu!!!!  The Benedict's look amazing and a lot of people ordered them so they must be good!!!  Definitely a must go to!!"}
{"text":"First time Here and I have to say the food was delicious! When we first got here I was worried about the service but in the end it was great. Our waitress was great and very sweet. I had the breakfast burrito it was super yummy! I didn't like the side of greens but The marble rye was AMAZING!  Everyone must try the marble rye. Sadly the fritata (spelling) was way over priced for what it was."}
{"text":"In a word, awesome. A hidden gem of a breakfast joint with the most decadent Monte Christo you've ever had. Good service, good drinks, and reasonable pricing. Love it!"}
{"text":"If you need me on a Saturday, just go here and find me scarfing down their insanely awesome food. Well, it's were I wish I could be every Saturday. The staff is both attentive & super fun. They are always busy (at least when I've been there) but it never hinders the experience- the wait is shorter than expected, drink & food come out fast & the servers are never running around like they are in the weeds. BONUS: their 90s playlist makes me smile non-stop!!"}
{"text":"Came here for Mother's Day. Based on the food and service once we were seated this place gets five stars. It was amazing, truly! Free refills on the mimosas, bonus! I had the French toast with foie gras and OMG was it tasty! Their bourbon maple syrup is delicious!! My mom had the croque madame and said it was great!  Now for the bad. We knew it would be busy on Mother's Day and they don't take reservations. We showed up 30 minutes after they opened and it was packed with a crowd inside and out. We were told the wait would be 30-50 minutes. At 30 minutes I checked to see how much longer it would be and was told it would only be another 10 or 15 minutes. 20 minutes later I checked again with the hostess, at which point she lost her sh*t. She actually told me \"It's just me. I don't have time to seat people because I have to stand here (at the hostess stand).\" You see, at no point in an hour long period did she (or any servers) ever come outside to get anyone waiting and seat them. And there had been empty tables since the moment we arrived. Clearly she didn't understand her position. Anyway, I asked for the manager and ended up talking to who I believe was the owner and I calmly explained the situation. Immediately, the hostess had some help from 3 other people plus the owner and people were getting taken care of. Once we were seated, everything was flawless. And to top it off, the owner gave us a complimentary plate of empanadas to enjoy as an apology for the wait. Very respectful and appreciated.  I will be back here again, but might bring snacks for the wait. :)"}
{"text":"I had French toast with bacon and eggs. Everything is on separate plates which was different. My over medium cooked eggs ran off the plate due to being on a coffee coaster sized plate.  That how small the two egg serving was (must not use grade AA size eggs).  My over-cooked French toast had no butter so I had to ask for some.  Bacon was was ok for taste but was hard and chewy.  The coffee was weak even though they give you allot as it is served in a 12 oz cup. I then tried a cappuccino to see if it was better and all I tasted was the foam so it must not have had an espresso in it or the cup was too big n they put too much milk. They may have to double up on the espressos if they are going to serve cappuccinos in the 12 oz cups. Overall there a other breakfast/brunch restaurants that are way better in the local area, so I will probably not ever go back to this one."}
{"text":"We had a party of 12 for brunch on Sunday, we made a reservation ahead of time. They were very accommodating, we didn't have to wait long to be sat. The food was really spectacular, the monkey bread is to die for, a great choice to order as soon as you are sat and deciding what to get for your main meal. I had the short rib Benedict aka shorty. Egg was perfectly cooked, hollandaise was on point and the beef was super tender. Everyone in our party loved the food. They also have a great choice of Mamosa's. The only issue we had was the air-conditioner wasn't really working that day, so as you can imagine it was hottt in the restaurant. We will definitely go again, this maybe my new brunch spot in Henderson."}
{"text":"This place is great, social seating and amazing food that isn't at all typical of what you'd end up eating elsewhere for breakfast or brunch. The staff is always on top of everything and my food has always come out hot and it's obvious that it hasn't been sitting around. The place can get very busy and because it's social seating (very close together) it can sometimes be difficult to hold a conversation but that's OK most of the time.   The monkey bread is a staple and their iced coffee is very good."}
{"text":"My favorite brunch spot in town!! I love their unique menu and flavorful food. The breakfast tacos and eggs Benedict are to die for!"}
{"text":"My friend wanted to meet here for breakfast and it was my first time coming here. Definitely won't be my last! Love the decor and feel when you walk in. The menu was unique and have a variety of food selections. I ordered the meatless eggs Benedict and they were scrumptious. I will definitely be coming back again!"}
{"text":"Not wanting to eat in Las Vegas as we were checking out, we thought we'd venture out a bit on our way back to Flagstaff.  So I Yelped. The Kitchen Table looked good. Somewhat difficult to find we were pleasantly suprised on how quaint and nice the place seemed. I first noticed the beautiful tables that I understand were constructed buy some of the staff. The place was so inviting. Staff was friendly and genuine. We ordered. The table next to us got their food which made me instantly regret my choice. The server and table noticed my dismay and assured me I would me happy with my selection. They were absolutely right. The food was absolutely delicious. The whole experience was fantastic. It's only breakfast, I know. But it was the perfect ending to our time in NV. Next time we go to Vegas I will make it a point to eat there again. I have but 2 suggestions. Pillows because we sat in the corner. Couldn't lean back. Maybe upgrade the coffee. I suggest Kona. But I drink it black so take that with a grain of salt. Salt... That reminds me. They have Himalayan salt in their shakers. How cool is that? Ok enough. Go eat at the Kitchen Table. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"My love and I rarely have the opportunity to spend a morning together during the week...so we tried to make the best of it ...and since we were on this side of town ...and knowing of the great Yelp reviews...the solution after yoga was clear: Kitchen Table.  The restaurant itself is a little hidden from the parking lot, but there is a clear sign indicating that they are open for business.  As you approach, you can see a large seating area on the outside...looks like a pet friendly patio, but it was too cold on this autumn morning to even have this area open. Inside, you can sit at a communal table or 2 top tables...I am a 5'4\" on a good day and the table was way too high for me. As such, I literally had to sit on a booster seat.  The table was nicely made with woodblock, creating a whimsical and natural feeling, though it also ends up with an uneven surface, causing me to keep moving my glass in order to make sure it won't fall. Some ceiling panels were missing, revealing portions of the ceiling open to our sight...I found it very uncared for. I am sure it is a temporary situation, but too bad it was there for me to see.  We had The Shorty, a short rib benedict. This dish was a good portion and rich in flavor. We also had the Chorizo Crepe, an item well-balanced in flavor with a refreshing sauce. Finally, I partook in a Red Sangria, which had an ample amount of fresh fruits.  I chose the Shorty Benedict because of the mouthwatering pictures on Yelp...very yummy, but as is often the case with short ribs, there was a big chuck of fat I could do without.  Service was very good and it seemed like everyone around us already had dined at Kitchen Table many times before...friendly hugs and well wishes were in the air...I can tell this place is loved and appreciated by the community."}
{"text":"I have no complaints about Kitchen Table.  Everything on the menu sounds soon good. I ordered chilaquila it was bomb perfect amount of spice, the pulled pork was tender and delicious. I really want to try the donut breakfast sandwich next time.   Be prepared for a crowd."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! There were so many choices on the menu that I want to visit repeat times to try everything! We got there late in the day and they were out of pastries so we ordered the gluten free sweet bread. The strawberry jam that came with it was fantastic! I wish they bottled it and sold it because I would buy it! The bread was surprisingly great too. I had the croque madame. Perfection. I hear their coffee is great but didn't try that. Instead went with mimosas. Only downfall is they don't have a liquor license so they only serve beer and wine (no bloody Mary's). Other than that it's a cute and great choice for brunch!"}
{"text":"The breakfast gods are pleased.   The hype around this place is definitely warranted, the food is amazing, the service is on point and the energy is intoxicating. The Kitchen Table warrants another trip to try a few more things off the menu.   Coming in on a Sunday isn't the best idea with the wait being about thirty minutes, but you can grab a mimosa, coffee or beer to sip on while hanging in the \"back\" patio area around the fire pit, I went with an iced Americano. The space here is cozy with the seating being pretty tight; your brunch buddies are literally an arm's length away.   The menu is veritable food porn at it's best, Pastrami Hash, Monkey Bread, Croque Madame, Foie and Cake, and a Hot Chocolate Muffin with Charred Marshmallow.  This is just the tip of the food iceberg, seriously this menu is stacked with greatness, and the greatness I chose was The Duck Confit omelet, a glazed doughnut, and a side of jalapeno bacon.   The Duck Confit is kind of a mind bender; eggs, tender duck, and a house made mac and cheese. So there's cheese in this, but not in the traditional sense, just the creamy salty cheese sauce from the mac & cheese. The duck was beyond tender and cheese complemented everything perfect. This was an amalgam made in heaven, mac and cheese, egg and duck. Nummers!  The side dishes were great as well. The Glazed Doughnut was insanely light, fluffy and disintegrated like cotton candy in your mouth with each bite, not heavy at all. The jalapeno bacon was tasty as well, I mean it's bacon, but I could have used just a touch more spice with these little strips of greasy happiness.   The menu has so many options, you may need some snacking advice from your server, but don't be afraid to ask because they are very knowable with the menu and can help you zero-in on your brunch option.   It's great to see more and more spots like this opening up in Henderson. Feels good man."}
{"text":"We were in town visiting from Houston, TX (home of the best brunch spots in Texas!) I really loved this place! Great patio vibe, amazing food with a very unique menu. They even let you bring your own champagne and have these delicious juices that you can uses as mixers. YUM!! I have never (believe it or not) had avocado toast anywhere but at home. I opted for the avocado toast here just because I heard it was AAA+. They were not lyin'! Buttered toast topped with avocado, all kinds of other stuff & poached eggs...omg to die for! The service was great too! All smiling faces. We will definitely be back next time we visit!"}
{"text":"Benedict Heaven! I finally gave this spot a try last week after having it bookmarked for some time and I'm so sad that I haven't tried them sooner! (Posted some pictures a few days ago). My favorite breakfast food is the benedict by far and this place has 5 different options including traditional, country fried steak, pork belly, short rib, and a meatless one! They also offer a bunch of egg dishes likes omelettes, fritatas, and hashes as well as french toasts, pancakes, crepes, chilaquiles, sandwiches and even salads. Basically what you want, they've got.   What caught my eye first was the hot chocolate with these massive toasted marshmellows on top for only $4! So guilty after drinking this but so worth it. They also have specialty coffee drinks as well which I'll probably try next time.   Country Fried Steak Benedict $13: served on house made biscuits with chipotle gravy, greens, and house potatoes on the side. This was amazing! Every component had great flavor. The chicken fried steak was one of the best I've had in Vegas, the chipotle gravy wasn't too spicy and was really creamy and the biscuits were so soft and buttery! I could eat this again and again. And usually when a dish comes with breakfast potatoes I only eat a little bit of them but I finished all of these!   Pork Belly Benedict $15: chipotle bbq sauce, jalapeno hollandaise on an english muffin. This is what Mr. Kitty ordered but of course I had to steal a bite. Definitely more of a spicy kick with the jalapeno hollandaise and the pork belly was crispy on the outside with a soft creamy texture on the inside. Another that we would order again as well.   Overall, service was great, and everyone was smiling and really friendly. The place is very quaint so I would definitely recommend coming early so you get a spot without waiting. Can't wait to come again and maybe try the Smores Crepe, or Croque Madame! :)"}
{"text":"Excellent options, great staff, wholesome food!  Only concern was the narrow pathways between tables, but once seated, as long as no one bumps into you, it is not even a concern.  Food is a little on the pricier side and not very filling, but quality is very worth it.  If you are looking for a large portion of food then do not go here.  Flavors of the mimosas is great as well."}
{"text":"Honestly, this place did not look up to my standards. Reading through the comments, I was very excited about the positive remark the chef and it's food has. Although, this did not happen. First of all, they had no A/C so it was very hard to enjoy the meal. The drinks were no help either as the water was room temperature. I had the blue collar with scrambled eggs, house potatoes, toast, and sausage. The eggs, potatoes, and sausage were very dry. I feel like the potatoes were not seasoned enough either and it gave a weird taste. It seemed like it was supposed to be spicy but it didn't come off as strong as intended. I feel like the toast was the most delicious thing on my plate. My mom had the shorty and said she wasn't very pleased. Overall, this is not the ideal place to choose to eat."}
{"text":"Wahh, thought I wrote a review already. I came her before we sent off my sister to get her hair and make up done for prom. We sat outside and were lucky to enjoy the beautiful weather before it got hot.   She had the chicken and waffles - order something similar with gravy, crab cake, omelet. I might not be on point with what we ordered but I remember we really enjoyed our meal. And, the monkey bread!!!! Get it, I was on a diet but still had a small bite. Worth it!"}
{"text":"Get there early because of the long wait and the pastries sell out.  But, there's a good reason for that.  The food is amazing!"}
{"text":"The food is excellent, but the overall operation is lacking some basic common sense. The food tastes like you are someplace near a farm, just fantastic, but they ran out of coffee cups. Yes, they did not have enough coffee cups for the table next to us to have coffee. Simple, easy and expected. They had a wait with open tables, because they weren't staffed up early enough, servers were coming in the front door while people were waiting for a table.  My advice is to try everything, it's all so good and maybe grab a coffee on your way there."}
{"text":"I love this brunch spot they serve quality food the pricing is moderate and they have patio seating as well only down side is the wait is usually 45min to an Hour but it's worth it"}
{"text":"Very pleased with this place. I just wish their location was more spacious so that more people can enjoy their delicious food."}
{"text":"Amazing!!!!! You have to try the Jersey Joe if you stop in for lunch! And the owners are so nice and hospitable! You can tell how passionate they are about their work!"}
{"text":"Ok, so we are visiting from Seattle and our flight got in super early. Found this place through yelp and was not disappointed. Landon was our server and he went above and beyond for us. I ordered the chilaquiles and my mother, the empanadas. I hate eggs more than anything and my dish came with eggs so I asked him for no eggs with my food. Unfortunately, they hid them under the tortilla chips and I didn't see them until I was half way through.  Landon was incredible and offered to remake them and not charge me. I ended up just picking them off but the gesture is what matters. This is what customer service is all about! Thank you Landon for making our experience incredible!"}
{"text":"Found this gem on the Yelp app and headed over to get off the strip. Had a 20 minute wait to get seated but it was worth every bite !!!  Service was prompt and food was superb. I had the Chile Colorado which is served with black beans and meat sauce.  Prices are very digestible too, which made the experience all the better.  The location is small but quaint and hospitable and is a not-to-missed spot if you are a true foody."}
{"text":"My new favorite stop for weekend brunch!! The food is fresh and the flavor profiles are perfectly paired. I can't wait to go back for lunch to try those delicious creations! We will definitely be back! Service was impeccable, to boot."}
{"text":"Ugh. I loved this place. It was perfect. And part of it are still perfect. The food is absolutely the best you can ask for, and the location is perfect for me. This was \"my official breakfast spot\", but it's been slipping and now I don't know if I will go back.   I am a \"go with the flow\" kind of person. Super chill and relaxed. So it takes a lot to get me going, and I have never written a review like this, but the state of the place compels me to write this in hopes that the owners read this and try to make changes.   My main complaint is the service.  I don't know if you were trying to save money by only having two servers working on a busy Saturday and Sunday morning? You have like seven bussers running around doing things, but only two official servers. There are open tables both inside and outside, but they leave so many people outside waiting for seats because they don't have the ability to serve them.   Now let's talk about the speed of the service.  When I sit down I shouldn't have to wait seven minutes for someone to come and do the initial greeting at the table.  I know this sounds kind of petty, but it has become a normal thing there.  Our group of four put in  an order for lattes, and this time I decided to actually time it.  After 20 minutes I decided to say something to the waiter. He got frustrated with me and said there's no way it's been 20 minutes. (I honestly timed it) Three minutes later he brought out two of our coffees, and of course, becoming the norm, mine was cold (and I do mean cold). I started another timer after the first two coffees made it, and it was another seven minutes until the other two showed up, hot I might add.   Last time we came, we got our coffees after our food arrived. What's the deal?!?!  Look, you were the jam to my toast, the milk to my cereal, the bees knees, buts it's all slipping away.   I'm not writing this so that people don't try this restaurant. Please go here and try it.  It has the most amazing food.  I just don't get it with the servers.   Please hire more servers, and speed up the damn coffee.   Thank you.    May 2017 update  Things have been better here the last few times I have been here. It's good to start to see the service starting to catch up to the food.   June 2018 update  Well the service has been consistently really good. The food is still awesome as always. I see good things in the future for this place."}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite places to dine. I could eat the crab cake everyday. The biscuits are tasty. I always enjoy their flavorful and imaginative lattes, my favorite is the creme brûlée latte. The crepes are great, the pancakes are fluffy. The crab queso appetizer is perfect. The staff is always nice, even when they are in the weeds. The chef does no wrong here."}
{"text":"First time last week, a 25 minute wait but was worth it. We were able to get coffee (very tasty) from them while waiting, definitely a plus. Breakfast- chorizo omelet - awesome. Foie Gras pancakes -yummy. Service - great  Second time around. We came earlier. Frittata was already out at 815am? 45 minutes in to opening? How is that possible? No bueno, very disappointed. Do you only make one pan and then done for the day? Btw... blueberry muffin was excellent"}
{"text":"Very limited heart healthy selections. Only one egg white plate. Would be nice to have more omlet egg white options with choice of salad instead of potatoes. Salsa extremely hot- need more sauce options to spruce up egg whites. See Squeeze IN menu and condiments for example.  Otherwise the breakfast combinations are very creative- just wish they have more creative healthy breakfast options. Like the ambiance and killer coffee cups."}
{"text":"If you are one of the few people like me hiding under a rock and have not tried this place, you have to go. Food was great and loved the friendly staff. The chef served our food (well actually he served us the food for the table next to us, LOL! But they were right on it for making it right and it was actually kind of funny) and shook our hand on the way out. The menu has a farm to table feel with my favorite Mexican/American flavors. Don't leave without trying some of the fresh pastries. Considering brunch is my favorite meal of the day, looking forward to trying something new every time I go. This trip we had the \"Shorty\" (short rib benny), tacos huevos, lemon/blackberry muffin & cinnamon twist. I literally can't think of a way to improve on any of the dishes."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite local places to eat. The vibe and decor are great, and the patio is a perfect spot to enjoy an outdoor meal. The staff are super friendly and welcoming. I've enjoyed all the food I've tried, but my favorite item by far is the meatless benedict with fried green tomatoes. SO GOOD!!"}
{"text":"Ordered avocado toast with a side of smoked salmon...absolutely amazing! Even the greens on the plate were tasty. My fiancé had chili Colorado and the pork belly is to die for! You really can tell the chef puts his special touches in everything. Service is on point too, everyone works very well together! Get there early for any pastries, they go fast."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this restaurant! Easily the best breakfast in Henderson. It gets very crowded, but the top shelf ingredients speak volumes. They even have foie gras and the juices are always very fresh. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"The ambience of this restaurant is fantastic. I'll give it that much. We were seated outside on the patio. Great music, great vibe.  I had high expectations for this place based on all the reviews. I ordered the traditional eggs Benny and my friend ordered the veggie frittata. We placed our order and our food came out 5 minutes later. I also asked to add spinach to my Benny and they put a field green salad drenched in balsamic under the poached egg instead. And my dish was swimming in hollandaise and it saturated the cold potatoes. As stated, the potatoes were cold and the ham on my Benny was at fridge temperature. My friend's frittata was raw in the middle, oozing raw egg. I got a new Benny and it came out in a couple minutes, so it was nuked. The chef was cool though, he comped it. My friend also ordered a side of avocado and it took 15 minutes to get it after our food was served. They brought it out on a piping hot skillet and seared the avocado. Also, the service was terrible. Our waiter pretty much forgot about us and I was drinking water from my personal water bottle I carry in my bag since no one came to check on us for over 30 minutes. Then it took an additional 30 minutes to get our check. Such a disappointment! My friend and I will never eat here again. The only reason I'm giving it 2 stars instead of 1 is because my Benny was comped and I liked the ambience."}
{"text":"Friendly, staff is on point and owner/chef personally comes to each table to make sure you are happy! The crepes are phenomenal! Crabcakes are the best I have ever had! Coffee is delicious! Specialty mimosas for those who do. Freshly squeezed orange juice and the freshly baked monkey bread was crazy addicting! My mew to go place for breakfast, lunch and everything in between. The wait was about 15 minutes, but ever so worth the wait!"}
{"text":"What a selection of food.  Too many new places will allow a once over of the menu to limit your selection to one or two items, with the rest being classic staples or boring options; not here.  Everything looked amazing, and selection was difficult.  I selected the sausage platter as an app with the pork belly bene as my main course. The sausage was cooked to perfection. The dish was put over the top by the pairing of a jaleoeno syrup.   The bene was perfect. The eggs were poached with precision and the bernaise was well balanced. The patatoes were also delicious.   I will be back."}
{"text":"Received great service the food was delicious I would highly recommend checking this place out. They have a huge selection of yummy drinks, Food selections and pastries. I will definitely be coming back here."}
{"text":"Rafael is the best! The food was on point... we ordered the Pork Belly Bene and the Hambuger. Very delicious!"}
{"text":"Beware Dogs are not welcome on patio unless it is a service animal. What a shame. We will bring our service to other establishments that allow them."}
{"text":"Long wait, but worth it.  For a restaurant that has only been in business a few months, this place was crazy busy for their Sunday brunch (okay, it was Valentine's but I still think that it would have been busy nonethless.)   When we went to put our names on the list, the wonderful smells that were in the restaurant made us stay no matter how long we would have to wait.    The food was delicious (Monte Cristo, crepes, egg shooters, and french toast) and I wish I was local so I could try about 10 other things on the menu.  They use great ingredients and plated things nicely.  It was very well prepared and tasted delicious.  Very reasonably priced also!"}
{"text":"I came for the reviews, leaving 2 stars for the staff. But the food did not do it for me. Our waitress who I did not get her name was really sweet.   I got the Chilaquiles, flavor was lacking, the combination of the pork did not mix well. Chips were beyond soggy and not enough sour cream or cheese. Only thing I did enjoy was the spicy kick it had. Order a side of sausage, asked for it well done as I love a nice char to it, but came out normal. Coffee was good and hot but other than that, I did not care for this place. I do not see myself driving 35 minutes to come back here again."}
{"text":"Upon arriving, we were given a wait time of 20 minutes. While waiting in the front by the barista bar, it was very uncomfortable. The Temperature was extremely hot. Several people who were waiting to be seated were all complaining about the how hot it was, and they were visibly sweating.   45 minutes later, I asked an update on our wait time since it was 25 minutes longer than the hostess stated I the beginning. She says Ed about another 25-30 minutes! Are you kidding me?! I was watching employees playing on the phones while there were tables that needed to be cleaned, and people waiting to be seated.   Needless to say, we left along with several other people. I've been here a few times and the service keeps getting worse.  The food has always been delicious, however the service will keep me from ever recommending this place or coming back."}
{"text":"Yummy breakfast/brunch location. I've been before but recently hosted a bridal luncheon here in their private room. It's s bit of a fish bowl- it's separated by a large glass window the length of the room.   Everyone was able to find a dish they liked. Our party had Some late comers/early departures which they seemed annoyed by, but overall it was a good place for our event."}
{"text":"A friend of mind recommended to come eat here. We were there early and this place was already filling up. The atmosphere for this place was nice.  Great place for breakfast! However, inside is a bit crowded. I really think once it get warmer, it would be nice to eat outside. Service staff was friendly. Getting your drinks and food took some time. The food was delicious. The Shorty was a five star. Everything my friends had was great. The only reason I gave this place a four star was I wished the dishes that came out was warmer. I like a hot breakfast and service for coffee needed to be quicker. Definitely, will go back and try something new."}
{"text":"What a great find, we went for breakfast. Must try the monkey bread to start the Orange Juice is fresh squeezed and in point. The eggs Benedict were made perfectly. Also enjoy the pork chiliqules."}
{"text":"Great place to stop if you are heading out to hoover dam... Breakfast tacos were good, but the short rib Bennie was excellent.  Worth the quick detour from the highway.  Great coffee by the way.  I was tempted to ask the girl next to me for a bite of her Monte cristo... It looked great."}
{"text":"..you see people come here and order what is basically ham & eggs..  ..now that's an absolute travesty.. for Chef Chavez has the talent to create some of the most creative and delectable offerings in the entire valley... all those awards are hard earned and well deserved.. (Best All Vegas - not just Henderson).. ..pick something you'd never think you would try.. so far I'm about half way through the entire extensive menu.. and just marvel after each plate.. every time..  ..can walk to this place from home.. how fortunate is that !!"}
{"text":"Amazing food. Wish we lived closer, so we could eat here more frequently. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"There are so many places trying to do brunch now that you try so many and often leave underwhelmed ...this is not one of those places. The best brunch I have had in an extremely long time. If you have an appetite, try the guava cream cheese muffin at the front. I haven't stopped thinking about it since."}
{"text":"So Good! We had the sausage sampler, traditional bene and pork belly green chili chilaquiles. The staff was friendly and inviting. It was a good surprise that our wait ended up being like 5 minutes rather than the anticipated 15-20 minutes! The traditional Benedict was a great choice - the eggs were so perfectly instagrammable. The sausage platter looks so adorable and is super filling. The best part was that all the food we ordered was less than $50! Happy happy customers!"}
{"text":"Wonderful little hidden gem. The menu was very big compared to the size of the place. It was very well decorated and had a comfortable atmosphere. The food was amazing. I had the chicken fried steak and the chopotle gravy was truly amazing. My daughter had potatoe soup and homemade biscuits. Once again amazing and my mom said it was one of the best monte cristos she ever had. We will be back!! As another reviewer mentioned, you can tell the difference between a cook and a chef! The Kitchen Table has an amazing chef!!!"}
{"text":"I WOKE UP TO EAT HERE!  **2016 Yelp 100 LV Challenge #7**  Be WARNED there is even a WAIT on a MONDAY!! That tells you a LOT about a place. We were estimated about 30 min. & that was exactly what it was. We were seated at the LONG community table where multiple different parties could sit & get to know each other while eating some good food.   The space of the place is BOUTIQUE size. The decor is HOMEY status &windows to look out everywhere. They even have a HUGE patio area outside w/ cabanas & an area where they grill up all of their DERICIOUS meats! The KITCHEN is wide OPEN.... so you can SMELL & SEE EVERYTHING that is being created.   Our server was patient & informative. It took us some time to come to a verdict of what we wanted to eat. I of course wanted EVERYTHING!! Our table was VISITED by the CHEF/ OWNER ANTONIO which was HONESTLY a nice touch to the whole vibe of the place. He made his rounds to EVERY freaken table to check up on everyone... (uhhh who does that!?!?) A HARD working one OBVIOUSLY.  CHILAQUILES $13.00 - oaxacan cheese, anchor sauce, smoked pork, scrambled egg, black beans, & a sunny side up egg. This reminds me of a breakfast NACHO...  (maybe that's what it is... I just dunno breakfast food) so much flavor & a bite of EVERYTHING in each bite & the runny yolk to give it creaminess.  CREAM OF POTATO SOUP $3.50 - I LOVE cream of potato soups! This is another one on my top list. One thing I wasn't sure if it was on PURPOSE but the potatoes seemed a bit hard... but I typically like soft potatoes. I also got a CUP size... it was served in a HUGE mug ahahahha   CHICKEN CHOPPED SALAD $12.00 - hubby ordered this... he wasnlooking for HEALTHY & healthy is what he received! Cabbage, kale, craisan, squash, Bacon, cheddar & oaxacan cheese, corn, cucumber, roasted garlic vinaigrette.  NUTELLA CREPE $10.00 - carmalized banana, toasted almonds, whip cream, nutella, & marshmallow sauce! I added strawberries to it which made it even better. I will have to say though I dunno if I would want to pay $10 for it again... but it was GOOD.   COUNTRY FRIED STEAK 14.00 - initially ordered the crepe as my dish but in my head that is dessert... so I needed a REAL entree. BEST DECISION EVAAA. House breaded steak w/ chipotle gravy served w/ hour potatoes (frealem AWESOME) & 2 eggs.   I gotta come back to try more.... O_O x3"}
{"text":"Best smoked salmon Benedict I've ever had. Cute atmosphere, friendly service and every person in my group really enjoyed their food. One of the best brunches in Henderson!"}
{"text":"We have been coming to the Kitchen Table for a while now but never completed the review.  This is probably our most favorite local go to place for fresh farm to table dining experience. Lets start with the hostess \"Lillian\" what an awesome person to be greeted by.  We were greeted with a smile and a small conversation about the opening of their new restaurant at the \"Gramercy, Kitchen Table Squared\" opening 12/2017. Can't wait to now experience the new dinner vibe and menu.  We have our go to favorite \"pork belly chili verde\" on a regular basis. My husband has had the hamburger, French toast, pastrami hash and so on.   The outside ambiance is amazing with shared tables and the inside is like eating at home. There is a longer wait time on the weekends, but make use of the skip the line option on yelp.   Food:  Ambiance:  Service:"}
{"text":"I have to say I came here specifically for the smoked salmon bilinis and they were fresh out!! I came all the way here based off of reputation and the pictures and the reviews for this dish and they were fresh out .... heartbroken. I asked the waiter if he could recommend something that was comparable and he gave me a very nonchalant shrug. He basically said he has only tried a few dishes there so he couldn't do a comparison: I can't even remember what I got at this point , because I was sorely disappointed with the service and the letdown of not having their dish available.   I will try this place again to give a fair assessment but I'm not in a rush"}
{"text":"Summary:  Good food.  Good drinks.  Sub par service.   Came in for Sunday brunch.  Waited 45 mins for a patio table..  they forgot and tried to seat us inside despite 4 open tables on patio.  Bought 2 bottles of champagne & food.  Had to ask for clean glasses, refills, and all basic services we tip well for.  They could have put forth some effort.  Fix the service and I'll try again."}
{"text":"Love the food and service at the Henderson location !!!! Amazing manager whatever you are paying her DOUBLE IT !!!!"}
{"text":"Every time I pass by, I see a lot of people outside. I've been wanting to try this place out. I finally went in yesterday. I was not disappointed. The customer service was on point. The food was great. It wasn't pricey. I LOVED the empanadas!  I will definitely return."}
{"text":"Really great brunch spot with Good Vibes and long lines. Just a tip the Yelp check-in time is not accurate as when we arrived on time according to Yelp we still had according to the host 40 minutes but it actually only took 17 minutes to get seated.  Started off with the sausage sampler which was amazing with the little cups of syrup my favorite of the selection was the Texas hot link.  Was in a Benedict mood so we ordered the short rib Benny as well as the pork belly Benedict. Both were delectable and the eggs were poached to perfection.   To drink I had a Mexican hot chocolate which I wish the marshmallows were toasted a bit more. I really like it whenever they're almost black! Also the regular coffee was pretty legit to.  My only complaint was that the water glasses smell like rotten eggs and fish. Not the water just the glass itself because I ordered sparkling water and when I smelled the glass with the sparkling water in it it smelled pretty bad."}
{"text":"OMG!!! I loved this place! I am so sad I live in California because I do not have a place like this!  The wait was a little long, but totally worth it. I got a Blackberry Mimosa as we waited and it really hit the spot. It was very good and not too sweet. Once seated the waitress was very helpful and made some recommendations since I mentioned that I had never been there before.  I ordered the Egyptian and my cousin ordered the Mac Kitchen (I think that's what it was called). I don't know what I liked better!! Mine was fresh, healthy, and so tasty! Her was on the heavier side and packed with flavor! We decided to share both plates because we both wanted to try everything we could.  I also got the cappuccino with the marshmallows on top and it was MAGICAL! I want another one right now! it was a good large size and the the marshmallows added the perfect amount of sugar so I didn't even need to add sugar to my coffee like usual.    HIGHLY RECOMMEND!! Come to LOS ANGELES PLEASE!!!"}
{"text":"Awesome place! I'm visiting from the east coast and was happy to get off of the Vegas strip for breakfast. The staff is super friendly and the food is fresh and delicious. It is family style dining for part of it- a long banquet table with a mixed crowd but we didn't mind. My \"meatless Benedict, chicken tortilla soup, and coffee were all great! I will come here again in the future and highly recommend it to anyone looking for delicious food!"}
{"text":"I'd like to start out with something positive.. The staff was super friendly, aside from that I was not impressed whatsoever. My mom wanted to take me because she went with her friends and they had a great experience, so naturally I was expecting that too. It didn't take long to get seating despite the huge crowd that was good, yet once seated and once ordered it took almost 30mins to get the food. Ok not so so bad. Yet while sitting there waiting I observed the kitchen staff and must tell you they went against so many health standards in my book I was getting disgusted watching. They were pulling food from the window then putting it back in the window over and over, the expediter was pinching sea salt from a bowl and sprinkling it on every single plate that went out with his hands (uncovered) then grabbing other garnish with bare hands over and over again topping off everyone's order, at one point he actually picked up a piece of food to replace it back on the plate so it \"looked\" more presentable. He had to keep going back on the line to help because they were so backed up, so the next person (waitress, hostess whoever) would come up to expedite and the same thing, grabbing the salt, sprouts and other garnishes and topping everyone's food with bare hands after who knows what they were doing prior.. I was absolutely disgusted and they should know better. After all that my food sucked, whatever spice they thought was cool to put in their hollandaise did not work (don't do it, doesn't work) then my poached eggs were so undercooked they were almost raw.. Too many menu items, not a big enough kitchen to accommodate that many items, kitchen staff didn't have it together and the constant touching with bare hands by anyone who walked up to help was unacceptable. Vegas is a tough town you better get it together or you will just be another distant memory like so many others."}
{"text":"The food was decent but the overall experience wasn't as good as expected.  We arrived around 1:30pm and were told it was going to be 5 minutes.  We ended up waiting closer to 15-20 minutes.    Once we were seated the server took our order which was a mimosa, a bellini, monkey bread, jalapeño bacon, the traditional eggs Benedict, the pulled pork Benny, and a side of toast with foie gras.  They sadly don't have a bottomless option for mimosas which I always enjoy at a brunch.    Our drinks took a while to come out and it wasn't until after our whole meal came out we were informed that they had been out of monkey bread since 10am.  Wouldn't that have been nice to know when ordering?    While the food was good, my eggs in the eggs Benedict were almost cooked all the way.  They weren't runny as most benedicts are.  I really enjoyed the flavor of the jalapeño bacon but wish it had 4 pieces instead of 3.  My friend wasn't expecting the foie gras to come in the consistency it did.  We are used to having it puréed almost and this was more of something you had to cut, not spread, if that makes sense.  They do have an outdoor patio area where they were cooking a pig and it smelled great.  You can eat out there as well.  Once nice touch was that the chef took the time to come out and see how everything was.   It's always nice to have new restaurants open in the area and I'm glad I tried it however I don't think I would be back based on our experience."}
{"text":"Had the traditional eggs benedict which was one of the best I've ever had. It has a light vinegar taste in the hollandaise sauce which really works. The sundried tomatoes on it was delicious and unique. The breakfast potatoes were very good to. Husband had chicken fried steak that he didn't like because the chipotle sauce was too spicy/hot. I tasted it and thought it was excellent but you need to like the sauce (not the restaurants fault). Would have given 5 stars but we never got a refill on our drinks or a check by the waiter til we were all done and asking for the check"}
{"text":"Found Kitchen Table on Yelp searching for 'farm to table' restaurant options. Came here and waited awhile to sit, which was well worth it! Had the huevos tacos for lunch and it was so good. Will definitely be back when I'm in town again. Great food and atmosphere, definitely recommend it as a more healthy and tasteful option."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good.  Pork could've had more Smokey taste to it.  Had the tostada and wasn't to crazy about them.  French toast was good.  Had iced coffee and the coffee was really good if you like good coffee.  Service was outstanding.  Everyone was super friendly, had a great vibe, was busy with a short wait.  Overall good experience and definitely will be back for seconds."}
{"text":"I wanted to go back and try more delicious food here, despite the poor service experience, unfortunately I left with an empty stomach. I went last Thursday at 12:30, me and my wife had an hour and fifteen minutes to spare, after how long it took last time, I figured that'd be enough time. When we walked up, we saw several parties of people waiting out front, I thought oh crap! Went inside and the hostess said only a 15 min wait, they were getting more tables ready. I noticed there were a dozen open tables inside and on the patio, so I took her word for it. Well, after 40 mins of waiting, and still several empty tables, we had enough. There were 3 other parties that left as well. What made me really angry, and actually a few other that were waiting as well, was when two hipster dudes walked in, and the chef greeted them and immediately sat them! Honestly I would rather go to Eat in downtown Vegas, they know how to make great breakfast/brunch and know how important it is for a resto to turn over tables."}
{"text":"Had a crab cake here with family. Sat outside and enjoyed their patio. My family enjoyed homemade blackberry mimosas and burgers with special preparations and a pork eggs benedict. Everyone enjoyed their meals and we liked the service. Definitely worth a return trip."}
{"text":"My favorite brunch spot! The pork belly Benedict is the *best thing I've ever put in my mouth*...so delicious. You also can't leave without trying the monkey bread-just trust me."}
{"text":"My wife and I went there for the first time ever today. It was AMAZING!!! I had the chorizo omelette.... very rarely do I ever get anything I don't have to add or change anything about it.... this breakfast was perfect the way it came out. It needs nothing added to it!!! NOTHING!!! Everyone was very very friendly and nice!! The head chef came and talked to us and we told him it was our first time and we loved it and will be back for sure! We'd tell everyone about it and take all of our family there from out of town! He said you gotta try the monkey bread.... He brought us a order out to try.... It was AMAZING and he didn't charge us! This place is a MUST try for sure!! Can't wait to go back and try more!! Picture is the amazing monkey bread!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place! My only complaint is the wait ... on a weekend morning / afternoon, you WILL have to wait a bit as it is not a large place. There is a small indoor dining area, and a super cute patio that has heaters for cooler weather and umbrellas for when it is warmer. On the day we came (a Sunday morning) there was a gal performing songs live with a keyboard. Their mimosa menu was quite extensive but I didn't have any the time I went - I'll have to come back again and try one next time! We ordered the taquitos and monkey bread to start off with, which were both excellent. Everyone at our table seemed to really enjoy their main dishes. I got the avocado toast which was very filling and delicious. It was a little spicy for my taste so next time I would ask them to keep the spice away. I also think this place is very reasonable with pricing and you get good portions. When I order avocado toast at other places, it's more than $20 and is only one piece of bread (i.e.: Yard Bird at the Venetian). Here, it was only $12 and the portion size was twice as much! I think I would like to come back mid-week when hopefully the wait isn't so long. The food is really good and the service was nice and speedy. But just hard to want to come back on a weekend knowing that you'll have to wait quite a bit to get a table (I think we waited 45+ minutes for ours). A nice addition to the Henderson / Green Valley dining scene for sure! I'll definitely be coming back!"}
{"text":"This is a \"must do brunch spot\"! Just had a wonderful brunch with my husband. We started with the guava mimosas- they were perfect!   I had the Meatless Eggs Benedict- perfectly poached egg and the fried green tomato was a yummy touch.  My husband got the French Toast and gave it 10/10! I tasted a bite and it was delicious!!   Service was fast and friendly!  I would highly recommend this restaurant!"}
{"text":"You pay for what you don't get. I had high hopes for this place. The mimosa(In a plastic cup) and beer were warm, the tortillas were cold and the pork had at least a third of fat I had to pick out. On top of that the service was SLOW. We waited 25 min for a table even though I saw at least one that was clean and set. As we ate the table next to us was ready and set though others were waiting even until after we left."}
{"text":"My friend was really happy to take me to this new place. I thought the place was super cute. We had to wait about 30 minutes for a table, the staff was polite and we finally got a table. HOWEVER, when I saw the menu, for my sadness, disappointment and complete disgust this place serves Foie Grass!!! I just couldn't believe a cute place would be so cruel. I wanted to leave the place, write the menu, talk to the manager... but because of my friend i stayed - yes, I am disappointed with myself too. I ordered the veggie eggs benefit (or something like that) it was delicious! I just can't understand why they would serve Foie grass when they can make delicious veggie dishes.  I will never go back there! Unless they change their menu. This place makes me wanna cry."}
{"text":"Food was good.  Service sucked.   Online check in  didn't work.  I had checked in and I got the text confirmation I get there and the girl said  oh I don't have it . And I showed her the text I received and she's said it didn't matter people are ahead of me. So we still wanted to try the place out waiting 45 mins .  Our server was ok we ordered monkey bread to start off . We waited and saw the manager go to the table next to us and let them know they were out and offered other   options . After that it still took our sever 15 mins to say they didn't have any.  The manager did not once come up to ask if we were ok or anything . She went up to the table next to us probably 20xs to ask if they were ok and if they needed anything. It's like she was there own personal server and nobody else's . She was making sure they were ok the entire time . The food was good but would never go back with the poor service ."}
{"text":"This is by far the best breakfast/brunch restaurant in Henderson. I had the \"pork huevos rancheros\" my eggs were a little under cooked when I asked them to be over hard, but still very good, my wife had the \"chorizo omelet\" that was under seasoned. Our server Maria was extremely helpful, she went above and beyond to please us. Kitchen table would be 5 stars if they can fix there reservation policy, it's very upsetting to see people walk in first w/o waiting like most of us I had 3 different parties of 2 walk in before us. I was told that they call ahead to be seated which I didn't understand how that works, after the second couple was sat I asked what the deal was? I was informed that my name was pushed back for some weird reason. Putting that aside I will certainly be returning with my friends and family."}
{"text":"My friends and I are starting to make this our weekly breakfast spot, Melanie (Not sure if the spelling is correct) is awesome and a very very attentive server AND MANAGER.  This place is delicious and thank you again Melanie sorry if I butchered your name!!!"}
{"text":"Oh man my first time here I loved it. Now I bring everyone I have a layover with in Vegas. Great breakfast and brunch food closes at 3:00pm but when we got there a little before 3:00 they stayed open even people kept coming afterwards they still stayed open. The employees are great to talk to friendly and inviting. I d go more often but since I live in Hawaii, I make it a point to eat here on my layovers or vacation."}
{"text":"Awesome food selection and vibe. Little bit of a wait which is to be expected on a Sunday. Friendly wait staff and awesome mimosa selection. Easily top 5 brunch spots in town. Only advice, sit outside. Get really hot inside due to the size and close proximity to the kitchen."}
{"text":"The difference between a cook and a chef is clear here. They took 3-4 ingredients that I thought I didn't like and turned it into a meal that I absolutely loved. Then there was the added touch of the chef himself bringing the meal out to us.   The burger (Social Burger) was excellent and the pork belly in the Pork Belly Bene was sweet and tender but not overcooked to the point that it was mushy.   The only negative was that it was so busy that our drinks never got refilled and no one checked on us at all. However, the food was so good that I can't possibly go with less than 5 stars."}
{"text":"We went last Sunday when it was raining outside, so the outside area was closed. There was about a 35 min wait. While we waited, we ordered mimosas at the bar area which were amazing. They have several flavors. The customer service was great even while waiting for our table. We ended up ordering the shorty and veggie benedicts with the original french toast. Superb! We'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Amazing atmosphere, knowledgeable and friendly staff, deliciously executed and beautifully plated dishes. Definitely recommend"}
{"text":"Don't bother making a reservations it's useless. Had reservations for 1:30 and end up seating at 2pm. Did not feel welcomed by the host. Arrive at 1:34pm. Two other groups of people who walked in bypassed us and had seats immediately. Not sure why that happened. But otherwise food was pretty good. Host not so good. The other staff were pleasant!"}
{"text":"This review is for 4.5 stars.   Truly fantastic brunch dishes. The menu is large and offers all the goods whether you're craving a nice wake-me-up egg dish or a bigger lunch option. We had the pastrami hash and chorizo omelette the pastrami hash was a great dish with great tasting meat and a concoction of peppers and onions and potatoes diced in the skillet. Add some hot sauce and I'm in heaven. The chorizo omelet is quite large and deceptively cheesy. The entire meal comes with toast and potatoes so it's for the hungry for sure. My only issue would be the mimosas aren't cheap at $8 each but they do offer a nice variety. They also offer champagne or beer bucket deals if you want to chill and drink but it will cost you as much as the strip. The food at Kitchen Table is affordable and some of the best brunch options around - we paid $25 for both meals combined. Be sure to sit outside if possible to experience the relaxing patio. There will most likely be a wait though so come prepared to sit around before indulging in great food."}
{"text":"Man this place must be good because it was busy! I was in a rush so I was able to order to go. The staff are really nice and the food I got was just delicious. I ordered the All American with garlic chicken sausage and they put it in a wrap for me. It was really good, I will have to come back and eat in one day, I can't wait!"}
{"text":"I've heard so many great compliments about the food here, and it's just down the street so we went there for breakfast this morning. It's kind of hidden, right on the corner of Valle Verde and Horizon Ridge, but when you walk in you'll be greeted by a very friendly host. The atmosphere is very boho, and the smell is lovely with whiffs of coffee and homemade yummy food! The menu is very eclectic from duck omelettes, fresh fruit, to pancakes and one-eyed monsters! Go you'll not be disappointed"}
{"text":"So happy this place opened up. It is fine dining meets breakfast/brunch at a reasonable price where you don't have to drive to the strip!  I have had a couple of the benedicts, chorizo omelette and a burger. All were first class!  By far this is the best spot for breakfast in Henderson"}
{"text":"Food was delicious - fried green tomatoes WERE tasty but needed a sauce to go with them."}
{"text":"Nothing but amazing! Wow, they really do not mess around here and I absolutely loved the gluten free options. I had the GF french toast and it was heavenly. like OMG. And I hate that i just said omg but they deserved it, also they have real syrup and they take the time to cook their eggs slow so they taste so creamy/custardy and delicious. I only wish they had one in orange county :/ keep doing what you are doing! oh and the staff and atmosphere was excellent."}
{"text":"Great neighborhood restaurant located across the street from McDonald Ranch in Henderson. A casual place serving great breakfast and brunch. Come early as this place fills up quickly. Service has always been good, even on busy days. When the restaurant is full the food can take a while to come out of the kitchen. Don't miss the pastries they have to go."}
{"text":"This place rocks! If I lived anywhere near Henderson, this would be my go-to breakfast/lunch place! D-Licious! The chipotle pulled pork with jalapeño hollandaise was out of this world! Not for the light-hearted! This has KICK! Yummy! And the Monkey Bread IS exactly what everyone said it is! Fabulous! The dough couldn't be more perfect! Come and visit!!"}
{"text":"So worth every calorie and every minute I've ever had to wait.  Pork belly benny all the way!"}
{"text":"It's delightful!  Such a diverse and colorful menu.  Service was great.  Very personal and hands on.  We really enjoyed it and will definitely go back"}
{"text":"I arrived here at about 9:30am on a Saturday, and there was a good amount of people and a 30-45 minute wait. I've been wanting to try this place for a while so I decided to wait.  The wait was 36 minutes.    While I waited, there's a counter where they're selling pastries, coffee, and other brunch beverages.  I got the blueberry lemon muffin and a latte.  The latte I thought was a pricey $4.50.  A lil disappointed on the order because it took almost 10 minutes just to get my latte.  I also told them not so hot and to add 2 packets of raw sugar, but that didn't happen.    Luckily the weather was nice and there was plenty of seating outside.  This is the area you sit before being seated inside.  I took the time to enjoy my coffee, muffin, and to browse through the menu while I waited.    36 minutes after I put my name down I was seated.  The interior looked cute.  Not too hipsterish.  I was seated in the back at a table that had a plush couch looking seat.  It was super comfy.  I really dig the interior.  Their ACT ceiling has an interesting look to it.    I started with some bacon shooters.  This is pretty much a deviled egg with mayo, jalapeno, and bacon pieces.  Not much of a fan on this because of the mayo overload.  Still good, but not my favorite during this brunch session.    Chilaquiles came with tortilla strips, pork, black beans on the bottom, cheese, sauce, and an over easy fried egg on top.  It looked so good that the table next to me asked what it was.  Not only did it look good, but it was good!    I had the smoked salmon with quail egg, caviar, and a small blini pancake.  This was my favorite!  Not your traditional breakfast food for sure.  The smoked salmon had the perfect flavor to it, which did not involve loads of saltiness flavor.  The quail eggs were friend over easy.  Caviar gave a simple salt flavor to the dish.    I think I'd like to try their Foie menu next time.    This was a unique dining experience, and I'll be sure to come back soon!"}
{"text":"Delicious and everything was perfect! The muffins and bundt cakes were very tasty and the eggs were cooked to perfection!"}
{"text":"I ate here again last week.  Very good and not a long wait during the week.   My son felt the waiter was a bit inattentive to him, never really made eye contact but he got everything he ordered.  He loved the food also.  They have been in business for nearly a year and are doing well.   Only complaint we had, the water is not very tasty, I think they use tap water and the water in Henderson does not taste very good.  I will eat here next time I am in town.   We ate both breakfast food and lunch food."}
{"text":"Pretty upset after eating here today. We love the food and customer service usually. But this time while sitting outside the umbrella that was blocking the sun where I was sitting was moved to another table to leave me with a spotty shade from a palm tree. The table it was moved to now has 3 umbrellas. I am extremely fair skinned and burn in the matter of 10 minutes at this time of day in high UV rays that we have. It had the perfect amount of shade when we were seated otherwise we would've requested another table. Super inconsiderate of the individual to do this. And I'm wondering why the other table needs 3 umbrellas when there is only 5 people to a huge table? They are only using half of the large table."}
{"text":"Very poor service. Hostess was disrespectful when asked how much longer before we get to be seated and then proceeded to seat everyone who came after us. We loved the food at Kitchen Table but I am not going back and do not recommend it."}
{"text":"Great and unique food. The servers are all friendly and the atmosphere is fun. We'll definitely be coming back for breakfast."}
{"text":"Love this place! I usually try something new everytime and I have yet to be disappointed or unhappy. The fries are always a staple though! Smaller portions with nicer ingredients makes this a great lunch meet up location!"}
{"text":"Good. Very good. But I already rated Served with 5 stars and Yelp doesn't have half stars so I'm forced to give KT only 4. If I could, they deserve a 4.5 for the food and maybe even 4.75 because of the outdoor seating."}
{"text":"Never going back to this place. Service is so poor. Check in person promised us 45 min. wait. We waited for 45 min but ended up leaving the place after we waited because the check in person wanted us to wait 45 min more.  Should have told us, it was an hour and a half wait.  Also, waiting area had no seating enough for customers to wait. No shade in the waiting area in this hot, sun city."}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere and the option of sitting inside or outside. Anyone who lives in Vegas knows that Vegas has really weird weather around May!! We were lucky that it was a nice day to sit outside. Had a great server! The food came out fast. My husband ordered the pork belly Bebe and I got the white chocolate French toast, that was over sweet! But if you like sweet then you'll love it! If you're around the henderson area and want breakfast I recommend you try the kitchen table!!"}
{"text":"Minus one star because they close so early. Should stay open until at least six so we can stop by after work. Breakfast and sandwiches are also great for dinner."}
{"text":"This place has a bomb brunch.  It's alittle pricey but so with it.  We got the monticristo frittata and the eggmac kitchen.  They were all delicious but the fav was eggmac.  Will def come back"}
{"text":"This is definitely the new \"hot and fresh\" spot. It's a must try if your looking for both traditional as well as adventurous local breakfast spot. They have a great selection of daily pastries as well. Plus they have artisanal syrups, my kids fell in love with Noble tonic 2, vanilla and camomile infused maple syrup, yum. The staff is wonderful and well and Chef Nunez came by, really making it feel like home. We will defiantly be back, and with the large family table in the middle of the restaurant, we can bring everyone with us!!"}
{"text":"I've been here twice and will keep coming back, bringing more friends and family with me. My number one top favorite breakfast spot. Not only are the baked goods on point but I haven't had a Benedict I haven't liked yet. The service is fantastic and they have the best coffee too! Go here! You can thank me later."}
{"text":"It was a mediocre experience for our first time there. It started off by us not liking the fact we couldn't add ourselves to the seating list unless 10 min away. Once we arrived we waited 1 hour to be seated at a wobbly table with a dirty window sill. By a host that wasn't to pleasant upon walking in. Maybe because they were very busy but there was no warm welcome.    I myself ordered the ice tea and Po Boy Crab sandwich which stated came with chips. A \"salad\" with no dressing is not chips.  Paid $15 for lovely looking avacado. Nothing special about my plate. I even had to ask for sweetener half way through my sandwich.   The second plate was the chilequilles. Wich was okay but nothing special either. Overall the experience was nothing worthy of coming back. Overpriced food for 1 hour wait. The Mimosa in a cup and avacado is what we paid $40 for. And they asked on the receipt for 25% tip!! Wow they should be cleaner and more pleasant for asking that much on the receipt."}
{"text":"Great ambience for a brunch. Extensive menu. We saw a lot of yummy dishes and want to go back to try more! Our first visit we tried country Benny and strawberry shortcake French toast. Country Benny were tasty and we would order them again. French toast had a good plate presentation but was a little too dense for us."}
{"text":"Been here about a half dozen times and never disappoints always lively delicious coffee and juices amazing breakfast, try to get something different each time, even their pastries are amazing this is the type of place that you just wish  was a little less expensive so you would go more but you understand you get what you pay for and the quality and the detail of what they're providing is top-notch if you want to impress someone for breakfast take them here"}
{"text":"My new favorite breakfast place! I really love the ambience here - kinda shabby chic farmhouse style and something you'd find in SF or L.A. The food is amazing. My son had eggs in a basket, which had buttered toast, eggs, potatoes and bacon. I had the bacon and egg bagel - that bagel was toasted to perfection and the jalapeño bacon had a really good kick to it. Service was great and our waiter was very attentive - when he saw that my son hadn't finished the whole meal (because there were veggies between the eggs and toast) he felt bad and asked if he could get us anything else. I really wanted to try their monkey bread but our stomachs had no room for it. Definitely next time!"}
{"text":"Too small, good food...tremendous service.  I will come back again and again to wait too long because the place is too small but I want to support a place that has awesomely great service!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best brunch spots in Henderson and maybe all of Vegas. Friendly service great food reasonable prices. Will definitely be back"}
{"text":"Wow I cannot say enough good things about kitchen table! Perfect for breakfast/brunch/lunch their huge menu will pretty much fill any particular craving you may have! I love their hot chocolate for some reason it just really hits the spot every time! It comes topped with large roasted marshmallows drizzled chocolate which is to die for! The egg shooters also a favorite of mine along slide with the monkey bread to start. The Mac n cheese omelette is vey unique and delicious. I really like the duck philly for lunch it has a very unique twist on a classic sandwich. Everything at kitchen table is aesthetically pleasing no matter what you order and the taste follows suit! Must try in the Henderson area!"}
{"text":"Wow...remember how Dick Dastardly's  dog Muttley floated thru the air extatically after he got a goodie? Well, that's how I felt after trying the Jalepeno bacon here...and EVERYTHING was just as good.  Service was great, and the chef, Pedro, came out and asked how we like the meal.  We were here for brunch and had everything from the chorizo omlette to crab po' boy. It was all equally fantastic. Try it. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Very good breakfast spot. Cute decor and good customer service. Decent prices. Will be coming back  to try the lunch. Everything is nice and fresh."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch last week and I wanted to like this place. I really did.  And to some extent, I did--I got the salmon with caviar and it tasted great. I loved the cute little presentation and how it didn't overwhelmingly taste like caviar. I also tried the french toast and I loved the hints of orange. Not sure if the flavor came from the toast itself or the syrup, but it was unique for a basic french toast order. Wish we could have tried the monkey bread, since they were out at the time we ordered (it was around 11:30). If I have plans to come here again (or maybe order ahead of time), I still want to try it.  Unfortunately, I was disappointed in the wait time and the lack of service during that extended period. Usually, I'm not very picky with waiting; I know things can get busy and hectic and I don't want to bother with complaining since the staff is already pressured to get all the orders in and served. However, I would have appreciated it if someone at least checked in during the almost half-hour we were waiting for the two dishes mentioned above. We didn't even get our glasses of water refilled (or offered to be refilled) during this time. Based on the food alone, I can say that it was *barely* worth the time we had to wait.  I'll consider coming back when it isn't busy, and hopefully I'll have a better time then."}
{"text":"I'm visiting from LA and wanted to have some mimosas with my sister for her birthday. It's Christmas Eve and the restaurant was filled but we got seated right away.   I found this place on yelp.  There are about 6-7 mimosa flavors you can choose from !! I've never been to a restaurant that offers this !....  We got guava and mango.  I ordered the ham and cheese crepe, presentation wise it looked dull BUT the flavor came strong. I haven't had a crepe like this.  My sister ordered the chilaquiles, presentation was awesome with the sunny side up egg on top perfectly cooked. The flavor was even better !!   If you like spicy, it does have a kick. Enjoyable. Not to smack in your face spicy.    Along with my crepe I got pork sausage. It was okay, sweet not as savory as other sausages.  Server was dope, pretty and helpful with menu item help !  Thank You Mitch Table   Server was awesome"}
{"text":"Meet up with a friend while visiting Vegas and they suggested this place.    The wait wasn't that bad on this particular day and the menu looked pretty good.    The food overall was good.  I ordered the chilaquiles as I'm a huge fan. And although the were good, they weren't the best as they were missing something.  That something is onions.  I feel that the onions would balance the stronger chili taste.  I told this to my boyfriend and friend who also tasted it and agreed.    The hot chocolate was really tasty and the roasted marshmallows on top made it look extra special.    The portions are big, so if you're hungry you're not going to leave disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is clearly run by serious chefs.  The food is a much more creative version of breakfast & lunch diner food, made to order with quality ingredients.  One mark of a superior breakfast/brunch place is eggs benedict done correctly, with eggs cooked through but yolk runny when it gets to your table.  This place does them right.  My one caveat is that the service is ssslllooowww and they were out of a couple of key menu items (e.g. orange juice) when we went.  Otherwise this is worth a trip from the Vegas Strip for breakfast that is very good and will not empty your wallet."}
{"text":"Wow! This eatery just opened in December and its got a line out the door.  The menu gives a unique flavor to the traditional brunch items.  Chef Javier and his partner have created something very special right here in Henderson.  I had the Pork Belly Benedict with jalapeno and BBQ Hollandaise. The combination of flavors was awesome.  Coffee served in over sized mugs. Very fast and friendly service with live music on the weekends gives it a very festive feel. They even have an outdoor patio and gazebo dinning for larger groups.  My only problem was choosing from a very full offering of menu selections.  I will simply have to return many times to taste each dish.  Oh did I mention the fresh baked on premises muffins and breads.... -)  Definitely under priced for the value. A real winner!"}
{"text":"Excellent choice for breakfast/ brunch. Variety flavor mimosas and the micheladas are made from scratch. Service was great. Check out the communal table; interesting experience with individuals you don't know. The chef, Pedro came to greet my friend and I. He explained the French and Mexican fusion to what is now called KITCHEN TABLE. Pedro was kind enough to send  empanadas made of squash. DELICIOUS!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"The food was amazingly good!! I loved the ceuchy French toast! I was skeptical about it because I usually don't try new food but it was AMAZING! A must have! I also ordered a bowl of fruit that was SO fresh and sweet. The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because they didn't acknowledge us when we walked in then they took forever when asked for small things like a straw or salt and pepper. But once they came to the table, they were always very friendly!"}
{"text":"Best burger, best benedicts, Best everything! This is THE hottest brunch spot in town. Amazing food, ambiance and off strip prices!"}
{"text":"Wow, this place definitely did not disappoint! The menu choices are unique (while still offering all American breakfast choice) and super affordable. Quality of the ingredients was spectacular! Service was great, cannot complain! We had the tacos huevos, green Chile pork and fruit crepe. Everything was sooo delicious! We were all eating off each others plates and just enjoying the flavorful, unique (but not too out there!) breakfast!! For us, hash house a gogo was trying to accomplish  what this place has done. Unique, fresh take on breakfast ingredients while still providing tasty as hell food. Not too trendy and hipster, just real and again;l, unique. Yummmm!!"}
{"text":"I was expecting wonderful food. I was disappointed. I called and asked what their specialty was. They told me it was their Benedicts, so I ordered traditional Benedict added Foi gras which tasted burnt and bitter, I sent it back, they replaced it with another that was cooked pink, but it still was a bitter burnt taste. I ate it, but not happy. I think I was tasting burnt sugar, I guessed that they may have cooked in balsamic vinegar, which may have enough residual sugar to burn. My wife had crepe with fresh fruit, the fruit was under ripe, the crepe didn't impress. Great staff, unskilled cook, attractive place. May try again because of their intriguing menu."}
{"text":"This is my go to brunch spot since moving to Vegas/Henderson two years ago. The food is always fresh and the flavors incredible. The menu has a little of everything and you can't go wrong. Whether its one of the delicious benedicts, gooey monkey bread or the smoothest latte you've ever had, you won't be disappointed. I also am a huge fan of the yelp waitlist! So helpful and so neccessary since everyone loves this spot."}
{"text":"Look: Reminds me of the little restaurant shops I would go to in San Diego and LA. Very cute and chic decoration. Friendly staff and has an open kitchen.  Food: DELICIOUS! Everything is made fresh and the have an open bbq place outside where you can smell the fresh meat being made! There is also a desserts table display and you can select which pastry you want!  Overall: I want to bring all my friends from out of town to this place! I love it and will be definitely coming back soon!"}
{"text":"First time trying it out today and it was amazing. The location is tucked away around the corner in the parking lot for those of you that haven't been there before. Got the empanadas and was a huge fan. It was full of flavor and cheesy goodness. Boyfriend got an egg ham combo with potatoes and he was a fan as well. The staff was friendly and we will be returning!"}
{"text":"This is my second time coming here and I'm deeply in love. My boyfriend and I have tried the taquitos and the empanadas for appetizer and they are delicious. They remind me of my culture food and taste just like the ones my mom makes, maybe even better. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone. They're speciality drinks are amazing. The staff is super friendly, they might take extra time to give your check but it's all well worth it."}
{"text":"Awesome brunch spot with WAY better prices than you'll find on the strip. All the food was amazing, literally all of it. We got the breakfast taquitos (add poached eggs to make it a meal for one, or share between 3-4), pork belly eggs thing- spicy but in just the right way, and the pancakes. All was awesome, great service, definitely will be back. Also took some pastries/baked goods for the road... Because why not."}
{"text":"The brunch menu is amazing service excellent but to be honest Lili the bartender is wonderful. Very polite explained is everything b4 we set on our table . She is totally management material . Our server was great very good experience will totally come back just to have the salmon Benedict"}
{"text":"Great food , love the atmosphere , if you live in the Henderson or  Green Valley area you should definitely try this place for breakfast or brunch , nice sized rich portions of food , service was also good and on top of our needs , would definitely go back , nice outdoor patio as well for those nice Vegas mornings"}
{"text":"This place was great!! Shout out to the owners for doing whatever it takes to get people seated quickly. We sat outside in a Heated cabana, it was perfect. Food was awesome, priced very fairly for the great quality. We will definitely be back! Highly recommended for an amazing breakfast/brunch."}
{"text":"Absolute favorite breakfast place in Henderson! The breakfast taquitos are one of my favorites. There's usually a bit of a wait, but it's worth it every time."}
{"text":"First time here, came back for two visits in a row.  Walked into the door with warm greets and seated us immediately.  The waiter and waitress on both days were friendly and gave us excellent service.  The chef came by and greeted us. And surprised us with courtesy monkey bread fresh from the oven.  Great fresh food, great service, great spot to go to for yummy food."}
{"text":"The owner introduced himself and I thought that was very nice.  We sat close to where the food is prepped so we were able to see all the dishes go out.   The Presentation on all their dishes is beautiful.  We had their deviled egg shooters with jalapeños, mayo and bacon.  They were good.  My other half had the chicken fried steak with chorizo, house potatoes eggs and hollandaise.  Normally chicken fried steak is tough but this was tender and tasty.  I had a pastrami hash with house potatoes and two basted eggs on top.  It was absolutely fantastic and had many flavor profiles.  I may go back to eat here today.    They do have somewhat lackluster service which I wish they would fix.  I also don't understand why they always make you wait 20 mins while there are plenty of 2tops available to be sat which is annoying"}
{"text":"Finally we got to try KT for lunch today.  This social eatery place is small, but lucky for us, we got a table for 2 right away.  My hubby ordered a coffee and a duck philly.  I ordered a Mexican Hot Chocolate and Chicken Fried Steak plate.  We also started with a chocolate crossaint.    The duck philly was ok... I had to try hard to taste the duck, though hubby said he could taste the duck.  I think the ooey gooey cheese overpowered the duck a bit for me.  It was accompanied with a side of the most flavorful potatoes I have eaten.    My chicken fried steak was smothered with a chipotle gravy but still maintained its crispiness.  I chose well scrambled eggs to pair with this steak, and it was also accompanied by the delicious potatoes.  If I had eaten protein earlier, I would have ordered so many more pastries item.  Everything on the pastry counter looked so yummy.  Hubby and I have plans to stop by again on Saturday for breakfast.  He has his mind on the French toast foie gras, and me...well, all the pastries I am able to consume!   I have to wait until my baby is born before I try the croque madame, since the previous reviews raved of this item.  For next time, I will try the monte cristo.  Chef Nunez was the expediter and also found time to greet us and everyone else in the dining area.  We do love the décor and vibe of this eatery, and am glad that it is in our neighborhood."}
{"text":"Found this gem while visiting family. Hubby enjoyed a  Monte Christo sandwich and I had the breakfast taquitos  both were very good! The waitress was on her game...quick coffee and water refills and came with assortment of condiments! We will make this a stop next time we are in town!"}
{"text":"This is probably one of the best brunch place I have encountered in Henderson/spring valley. The food was quite delicious. I was satisfied with my traditional eggs Benedict. I really enjoyed the potatoes on the side. I also ordered the side of fruits, which were sweet and delicious. My boyfriend and I ordered peach and mango mimosas. They were good but pricey. Eight dollars per drink. The service was great. They were very friendly, but when we were ready to leave. It took them awhile for them to get the check. Overall, I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place is super busy because the food is awesome.. Wow Im real happy with quality of food.. Yummy"}
{"text":"The shortie was by far one of the best breakfasts I have ever had in my entire life!! And the guava mimosa was delicious as well!! Can't wait to come back! :-)"}
{"text":"Been here a couple times for weekend brunch. I've had the Country Benedict and the Meatless Benedict...and both were good. If you're in the area its worth a visit."}
{"text":"Food is very good. The at home feeling is spot on. You really feel like you're at home at her kitchen table. The update food is unique and worth the wait."}
{"text":"Great comfort food. Felt like being at a friends house, but not just any friend, a friend that cooks amazing food, a friend that combines the most unique ingredients, a friend that loves cooking just to see the smile on your face. Griffin, our server, was very welcoming, as a friend would be if he invited you over. GO HERE!!!"}
{"text":"Thank you all the Yelpers for leaving useful reviews on this place because I would've never found this place without Yelp since it's not advertised on Review Journal and kind of hidden next to Shabu Shabu Paradise. Solid five star!! Came here for Sunday lunch. Had to wait about 20 min. I usually don't like to wait but it was worth the wait.  Chopped salad... Ordered this dressing on the side. Very flavorful and tasty even without the garlic vinaigrette dressing.   Crab avocado dip... Delicious!! They put a lot of big chunks of crab meat in it. Nice and creamy taste comes with chips. Must try if you are not watching calories.    Frittata... I asked the waitress what's healthy and she recommended this. It was egg white and lots of veggies. Loved it! Maybe they forgot to put salt?? But it was good since I'm trying to be on low salt low sugar diet when I can. Plus you can always add salt yourself anyways.  Note: I think it's cute to use tin laundry basket as a trash can in the ladies room but the used paper towels and trash was piling up like a mountain (on the floor, too) and I saw some disgusting stuff in there... I thought using the cute tin basket as a trash can for place like this (busy and packed) was not a good idea."}
{"text":"Bravo!!!! Plated beautiful. They go the extra mile with the little details. Flavor was spectacular!! Serving size is just right. Atmosphere was cool and pleasant staff too. I would recommend to all my friends and family."}
{"text":"Very good breakfast and brunch spot. The staff was very welcoming and nice.   We came here for brunch 30mins before closing and they still sat us and didn't rush us. The food came out quickly and we courteously left at their closing time.   I ordered the egg tacos which are pretty simple but taste amazing. The salsa that they top the tacos off with had really good flavor.   Tip: They have pickled onion that goes really well on the tacos :)"}
{"text":"This place hits the spot!  Great food, amazing service and could not complain at all.  It has the perfect outside seating for either a day date or even some 'girl time.' Regardless it's a must see and eat!"}
{"text":"My husband and I really enjoyed this place. They have a great location, great exterior and interior. Staff is friendly and helpful, and the menu is fun and unique. We came here on a Sunday, was slightly busy but nothing we couldn't handle. I had the Mexican hot chocolate which I love. Disclaimer: the Mexican hot chocolate takes a while to get but worth it. It's not powdered stuff either it's the real deal.  My husband got the chilaquiles, those were really good and the only other chilaquiles I like are my mothers so give them a try. They were super different from my mothers but they had a fun twist and great flavor. I got the pork belly Benedict's, those were fun to eat. They had a jalapeño hollandaise sauce, perfectly poached egg and flavorful pork belly. Do yourself a favor and order those. We will definitely be coming back to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Happened to drive by and see this place the other day and decided to try it out--so glad we did! Everything on the menu sounded so good it was hard to choose. I had the Croque Madame and my husband had the breakfast burrito. Both were full of flavor--absolutely delicious! We also had monkey bread as a starter and it was also really delish; all this pastries and muffins are made fresh daily. Service was good good. Head chef came around and talked to each table; he mentioned that normally there is a wait for a table daily at this time (10:30) but today there wasn't bc of the 3 day holiday. Good too know for next time...and there will definitely be a next time!"}
{"text":"Best Breakfast EVER!! Short Rib Benny to die for!!! Coffee cake amazing & start with Greek yogurt!! Yum!! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Found this place here on Yelp. The wait was approximately 45 minutes, but great news! Mimosas while you wait! For $20, you get a bottle of champagne and 2 mixers, our choices were mango and blackberry, to start. When we got to our table the service was impeccable. The mimosas made me forget our servers name, but she was a very friendly brunette who took great care of us. We ordered the crab and avocado dip, the pork huevos rancheros, and a crab salad sandwich. We shared all. We also tried the prickly pear mixer for our second bottle of champagne. EVERYTHING was very fresh and flavorful. This will be a new staple when we visit Henderson."}
{"text":"Having only tried a couple dishes here and a Lemon Poppy Muffin, I hesitated to give this place a review right away. Kitchen Table, however, left a good impression on me with their excellent creativity, variety, and great flavors. This is a place worth coming back to, without a doubt. We had the Egyptian, best described as a salad with toast with poached eggs and avocado and bacon. It was really enjoyable and the dressing was excellent. We also had bacon and egg shooters which were not necessarily great but still enjoyable. The lemon poppy muffin was not overly sweet and had excellent texture.  I'm definitely going to have to come back here again to try some of their sandwiches and other breakfast selections, though it is definitely out of the way (and hidden out of the way) and the construction in the parking lot created a lot of dust outside."}
{"text":"I have attempted to dine here a few times in the past but the wait is usually longer than I have time for. This weekend I had no other plans so I braved the waiting and came to Kitchen Table. Located in the very corner of the strip mall it exists in you just need to follow the signs or the crowd to find the entrance. Seating is available both inside and out so even with a long wait time given, it didn't seem long at all. With so many items to choose from, the first time here can be a difficult one. I want with a benedict with braised pork and was accompanied with a hash on the side. The pork was perfectly cooked both tender and flavorful with a perfectly poached egg and hollandaise on an English muffin. The other item I had was the artichoke crap dip. This dish was very creamy with large chunks of crab, it was almost like a fondue, served with tortilla chips.  I sampled some of my wife's pancakes as well. They were light and fluffy, what put them over the top was the bourbon barrel matured maple syrup. Can't wait to come back and try more of the menu items. It may take several trips to get through most of the menu but it will be worth it!"}
{"text":"I really loved this. Three of us tried their \"Egyptian\", traditional Eggs Benedict, and avocado on toast - all very flavorable / delicious!"}
{"text":"The food was very good. The staff was the best and the manager was so accommodating. We are new to the area and did not know how hot it could get so quickly. With a newborn, we thought to eat outside. We did not last long and they let us move inside without making it seem inconvenient, even though, as an ex-food server, it bumped the servers around.  Thank you for everyone making us feel welcomed"}
{"text":"I've been hearing about this joint.  My boy told me it is prolly better than Craft Table and he was right.  The menu is way handcrafted-everything was delicious.  Outdoor seating is great with cool music.  Crowd and servers very cool.  Not like Williamsberg megahipster douchey.  More like a fun mux of people.  I bought my nephew a $50 gift certificate so he could score triple brownie points with the GF."}
{"text":"Excellent food and wonderful service.! Small place, so be prepared for a little wait."}
{"text":"Catching up on my Vegas reviews and definitely need to leave a review for this place out in Henderson.  Been here a bunch of times now and have never been disappointed.  All of the things I've ordered (and have sampled off of friends' plates) have been solid.  Some of my favorites have been the Pork belly benedict and also the white chocolate french toast.  I also really liked their chicken fried steak that had a really nice spicy country gravy...but I could probably say most of the things have been my favorites.  One thing that's not really listed anywhere is that they have a vanilla / chamomile maple syrup along with their bourbon barrel maple syrup.  We always ask for both.  Another thing very worth mentioning are their pastries.  The monkey bread is a stand-out as well as their assortment of muffins.  We've always gotten an assortment of baked goods to go along with mimosas...the perfect way to start off a Sunday brunch. ;)  Some things to think about... They have outdoor seating that's really nice but in the summer months can be very hot. It's a popular place so unless you go fairly early, expect a wait for a table. Baked goods run out quickly.  Worth the drive if you're staying in Vegas."}
{"text":"If you want front wait service attitude at the beginning to spoil your dining experience, come to this place. Also the fact that we drove several miles to this place to come for the pork belly bene and told 20 minutes later that they had none is a MAJOR fail.  That should be explained as the wait service explains the menu upon sitting.   Two words,  HIGHLY OVERATED."}
{"text":"This place was amazing, the chef brought our food to our table that was pretty awesome.   I ordered the peaches and cream pancakes they where great.   I also order the Mexican hot chocolate... it was good  a little too much Cayenne pepper thou.....also the restaurant was chilly"}
{"text":"Innovative menu and fantastic food -- I've been here a handful of times and have never been disappointed with my meal. Having said that, the service leaves much to be desired. The seating process is disorganized and more than once after being seated we are left waiting .... waiting ... waiting to be acknowledged for the initial drink order. It's often happened where another table that was seated after us was approached before us. Servers seem either inexperienced or like they don't care about providing their customers a good dining experience. We've tried giving Kitchen Table the benefit of the doubt as we love the food and WANT to love this place ... however, after our last experience where a famous DJ and his entourage were served their food before we even had our drinks (we were seated at least 20 min before them) .... we gave up on them. Hopefully they read this and can do some staff development because their food really is very good....."}
{"text":"Went this morning after the gym .... Had the Huevos Tacos and an ice coffee. Both extremely delicious and flavorful !  Our waiters were super cool too.  Can't wait to go back and try more things!"}
{"text":"Kitchen table was great! The staff was all super friendly and very helpful. It was a little busy and we had to wait around 20 min, but more than worth it for the coffee and delicious brunch! Highly recommend to anyone visiting or local! I'll be back!!"}
{"text":"This is a really good place. Five minute wait. We opted to sit outside, nice and shaded. Service was prompt with waiters coming by keeping our water glasses full and checking in on us. The food was very reasonable, and really good. Menu had some very different array of things, I had the taco huevos and my friend had the avocado toast. Both were great. I would definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"I went to eat here for brunch and I will definitely makes this place one of my go to places for brunch while in Vegas. I had the taquitos and pancakes. The taquitos were super delicious but they were spicy so if you do not like spicy I would stay clear. The pancakes were amazing! The texture and flavor was great. They give you maple syrup and I need to find out where to order it because it made the already great pancakes even more amazing.   For drinks: they have a little coffee shop inside and we ordered some drinks while we waited waited for our table. I got a hot chocolate and it was topped with marshmallows. I also ordered a blueberry mimosa which was good but nothing about it made me go for seconds.   The only reason I am giving this place a 4 stars instead of 5 is because the glasses where they served us water smelled like eggs. I can't stand when dishware has that egg smell and it was so strong I just couldn't handle it. You could smell the strong egg smell the second they put the glasses down. It's a bummer but it won't stop me from going back."}
{"text":"we were recommended by one of my friends. they told us to wait 30 min and we did. we were sat down and no one acknowledged us at any given time for another 20 min. until the busser asked us what we would like to drink. and the drinks were not even on the table when the waitress showed up!!! yup... never going there again. it doesn't matter if the food is good, sence of urgency was not there at all."}
{"text":"This is my absolute favorite brunch spot in Vegas. I brunch a lot and have been all over but this is the only place I've come back to over and over and over again. I bring all my visitors here. The service is great, the girls that work here are sooooo nice and attentive (and gorgeous). Yes there will be a wait on the weekend, but it's a small place with a ton of loyal customers. A wait for a table does not equal bad service or deserve 1 star..... that's just crazy. Call ahead.....A wait is a good thing!!!! Short rib is incredible, everything is incredible. Try adding salted caramel to your French toast!!! A friend asked if it was possible after seeing it used on the drink menu and they were happy to accommodate. Delicious."}
{"text":"Great spot, we love sitting outside, but service has been extremely slow the last 2 times We've been there. The cream brûlée latte is to die for."}
{"text":"I give this place 2 stars because of its service. One of the waiters was extremely rude and had poor taste in words. He offered us a rocket mimosa ( champagne with a rocket popsicle ) which we were excited to try. After bringing us the drinks (which did not have a rocket popsicle it was a twist version of a big stick) some customers notice the drinks and wanted to order some. He brings the other customers mimosas and theirs had an actual rocket Popsicle which is no big deal, until he tells the customers that the reason why our Popsicles were different was because ours were leftover and melting in the counter so they were trying to get rid of them, and not to worry theirs were fresh and frozen. I tried not to make it a big deal as I was with my family and was not gonna through a fit in front of them. I was just waiting to see if he was going to apologize because he clearly saw that I had listen to his conversation, but he didn't and he didn't even remove the drinks from the bill. Let me just add that we were Hispanic and the other customers were Caucasian. So how can I not get offended."}
{"text":"I am posting this post for my 80 year old plus parents... They don't yelp... However, they were so excited with the yummy breakfast that they had here today, it was worth me logging on and posting for them.    At their table they had french toast, crepes and an omelette.  All, which were very tasty, and lovely presentation!    They enjoyed their meal on the patio, and they will be back! And, I will try it out when I come back to visit them in March.  Wish we would have gone last week when I was there.   Welcome to the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"We went on a Monday morning and had no problems getting a table.   The food was wonderful, we  had the Monkey bread which I thought was perfect.  My wife had the Tacos, the were good but slightly spicier than she would prefer. I had the short-rib poached eggs, they are excellent.  Are server Adrienne was flawless, her timing was spot on.  The experiment was a delight, we will return!"}
{"text":"Excellent. I tired the granola French toast with GF bread, side of bacon and snickerdoodle latte. Food was delicious and made from scratch (you can taste the difference)   The service was spot on. Leighann The GM was present and hands on managing the staff well even during a busy week day morning.   Only note, a changing table would be nice."}
{"text":"Quick service, friendly staff, and good food. We got seated in the corner at the large/shared table- with others at the table (including a baby stroller) and a smaller table up against us, we were pretty much trapped in. The servers were nice and treated us to some monkey balls. It was pretty crowded on a weekday morning. I don't know if I'll be back during the busy Thurs-Sun brunch rush."}
{"text":"Had lunch there today. Chicken tortilla soup is outstanding and my wife had turkey BLT sandwich which she said was best ever. Got some pastries on the way out which were terrific! This is a great place with varied and interesting menu. Outstanding food!"}
{"text":"The breakfast was amazing!  Great atmosphere,  very chic decor and the daily muffins were delectable!  I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"I came to kitchen table with a friend who loves the place. Im not sure when ill return because its not on my side of town but yes, i would return. I like the decor and i like that theres outside seating available. Although it was windy so we sat inside. There was no wait time when we arrived which was great because we were so hungry. I ordered the chilaquiles and they were so good. However i had to add sour cream because they were too spicy for my taste that i stared to not enjoy it. Maybe next time ill ask if they can make it with no spice. My friend got a burger. I also got a black coffee which of course gets refilled but they already serve it in a oversized mug which is great."}
{"text":"Success sometimes breeds carelessness and I'm hoping it's not the case at my favorite brunch & breakfast spot in Henderson. A simple order of crepes and eggs for two people was served out of sync, waiting until my crepes went cold before the eggs arrived for my dining companion. I asked politely if they would turn down the music as I was about to engage in a serious business conversation - it was ignored. I'm an avid music fan and just a touch (6dB) lower would make the house music so much less intrusive. It's not for the entertainment of the staff, or is it? One more try for recovery or I'm done..."}
{"text":"I googled to see who had the best fried chicken in Henderson and this restaurant came up. However, after we were seated and looked at the menu we couldn't find fried chicken. I called the busboy over who was closeand asked if they still had the fried chicken even though it wasnt on the menu.  He told me just a moment and a minute later a gentleman came and sat down by us. He explained he was very sorry they don't have fried chicken never have. Turns out he was the owner and he gave me a suggestion for trying the chicken fried steak. He said it's made with filet mignon.   We thanked him and said we would find something to eat on the menu even though what we are hungry for was really fried chicken we stayed.  I'm really glad we did!  I always check out the restroom first before I order to see how clean it is and his was spotless.  Second there were so many things to choose from the menu it would be impossible for somebody not to find something that they would like. I did order the chicken fried steak and it was delicious.  The place closes at 3 PM so be prepared. It's mostly a breakfast place although I did see sandwiches on the menu and a cheeseburger.The waitress was so genuinely nice.The place was very busy and it is out-of-the-way little joint  but obviously they have a lot of loyal customers. They have a patio area if you want to sit outside or you can sit inside very comfortable seats. It's on the corner of Valley Verde and Horizon Ridge in Henderson! Considering what they offer on the menu and the quality of the food I can't believe such reasonable prices!  If you're looking for a quaint small little restaurant with awesome food great prices great customer service check them out.  Very happy to a found this awesome little place! I do not know anyone working there, I did not receive anything for free while we were enjoying our lunch nor have I been compensated to leave them a good review!"}
{"text":"Wow... i mean just WOW! Great to know this Gem is right in our backyard here in Henderson. My GF and i had Mimosas, i had the Eggs Benedict BEST Eggs Bene of my Life! and She had the Breakfast Burrito which she rated at 8/10. The wait was 15 min to be seated but well worth it, the food came quick, and the server (Mike) was on point with recommendations and drinks...ALSO his Dodger knowledge ;)  Will be back again!"}
{"text":"The only reason I don't give it a five star reciew is because of the wait time :( I know Sunday brunch is crazy but they should also offer more options for smaller parties or you will be waiting minimum 20min. Other than that, the food is amazing and I would highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Terrible service and no refills for ice coffee? Really? Get a clue people. Change your vibe and maybe you will get more business."}
{"text":"Where to start, WOW!  Kitchen table is definitely a spot that we will return too.  Though they appeared busy and hectic when we arrived on a Sunday morning, we were seated promptly and Landon began serving us.  I have to say that the staff is very friendly and attentive - and Landon did a fantastic job and his service was excellent.    The food was excellent as well.  My girlfriend got the tacos and I ordered the avocado toast.  Both had an abundance of flavor and the portions were absolutely perfect.  Normally, we like to half our portions and share a bit of each other's entrees, but neither of us wanted to give up a bite, that is how good it was.  I would and will recommend this spot to my friends and family, and we will be returning soon.  It is arguably our new favorite brunch spot."}
{"text":"New to Henderson. Great find. Great Brunch and what a terrific form of entertainment with ddendyl Hoyt. What a voice! Would come to a bar to listen and drink all night to hear her and just listen.   The food was as good... lol"}
{"text":"Had brunch with my daughter today. As always this place \"ROCKED IT\". So delicious and unusual pairings. The staff is always friendly and gracious.  If we could we'd eat here often!"}
{"text":"My favorite place. I am addicted to The Kitchen Table Ania and I go 3 times a week minimum. Music is awesome, service is amazing, and the food is out of this world. Don't miss this place. But please don't tell to many people. Because the wait isn't to bad right now."}
{"text":"Fabulous absolutely fabulous. Great family environment. Fresh baked goods made daily. We needed a restaurant like this in our community. Staff is friendly."}
{"text":"This is the way it should be done. Homemade everything. Great coffee, bread, unique dishes. The right portions. Great wait staf. And what...? A chef that comes out of the kitchen to serve you and ask hiw things are. Bravo. Love the mexican and spicy influences. I almost don't want to do a review in fear that I won't be able to get a seat in tge near future."}
{"text":"The Good- I was extremely excited to try this place, word on the street was that This is the New \"go to\" brunch hotspot. Nice decor, interesting menu options. The jalapeno Bacon was delicious  The Bad- Coming from NY and being a cook myself, I think my expectation was set way to high. My husband had the oatmeal French toast...it was ok. I had the Pork Belly Benedict because it had been highly recommend, but needless to say I was highly disappointed!  Pork Belly is such a delicate cut of meat and should be handled as such....this restaurant completely butchered it, it was overcooked and doused in BBQ sauce, Pork Belly has such an amazing flavor, why would you French it in BBQ sauce?!...it should have been fried or seared or even candied but not bathed in generic flavored BBQ sauce, it honestly tasted like pulled pork, if I wanted pulled pork I would have gone elsewhere. The coffee was not great either smh  The Ugly- this is the kind if restaurant that has all the bells and whistles but not worth the effort. The problem begins with the menu, it is approximately 6 pages Long and stapled uneffortlessly at the top, It was soo extensive that I felt as though I were a teacher grading papers, I kid you not! When you have too many options on the menu ppl loose interest and become indecisive when it comes time to order. Also having too many options on a menu depreciates the quality of each dish, hense why my plate was less than average.  Overall I will not be returning"}
{"text":"Coming from a major foodie, this is definitely one of my favorite breakfast places. It's a nice corner location with a cute patio for outside seating. Inside is a bit small which can cause it to fill up quickly, but it's worth the wait. Inside to the left they also have a little counter where you can get coffee and baked goods. I always get great service here, everyone's extremely friendly, the food comes out quickly and not to mention it's amazing. They have many options on the menu but two of my favorite things are the Monkey bread and the chilaquiles! So yummy. Below are pictures of a fruit crepe, chilaquiles, and an eggs Benedict."}
{"text":"I cannot express my love for this place. The very first time my friend took me there, I came back the very next day. That's how much I loved it. Considering that brunch is my favorite meal of the day, I was very sad when I moved to Vegas and had to abandon my regular brunch spots....until I came across this beauty!  Any spot that has mimosas has my heart, but when they offer as many flavors as Kitchen Table does, UGH! Real purees are used to mix the different flavors. I've tried that peach and the BlackBerry and both are equally as amazing. I do have to say at $8 for the amount that you get, is a little pricey.   The first time I can to dine, my friend had not finished her plate cause she was full. The manager (?) came to the table to let us know that he had to took the dish off the bill because he didn't believe it was up to standards. That kind of service and care what instantly had me hooked. She genuinely loved it and was full but he still took it off! If that doesn't show care, I don't know what does.   The food is fresh and absolutely delicious! Definitely going to be coming back at least once a week. Thank you for filling my brunch void!"}
{"text":"Great food by an awesome chief-Javier. Lots of great flavors and wonderful heat. Summer was great hosting our table. She made the experience more enjoyable and helped us with great suggestions on food."}
{"text":"Best local spot in town hands down! Obviously ran by a chef and not an accountant, you can tell they care about quality in their food. Love the crab po boy! Please try this restaurant:)"}
{"text":"This place is SO overrated! Came here around noon for some brunch with my boyfriend. He got the country Benedict and I got the duck philly. He said his was kinda blah. My sandwich fell apart as soon as I picked it up. I cut it in half to make it easier to pick up, but everything was still falling out of it as I was trying to eat it. It was the greasiest sandwich I have ever eaten. Like the oil was literally dripping out of it. Asked the girl that dropped out food off for some sauce to dip my chips in, which I never got. All this combined with the fact that the service was suuuuper slow means I'm never coming back. Definitely not what I was expecting."}
{"text":"I love DelMar And San Diego for the atmosphere and fine eateries! Henderson now has their very own hip, chic fine breakfast establishment in \"The Kitchen Table\".  The service is solid and the staff are fun and friendly. One of the best brunches in a long time. If you liked Republic Kitchen, you will love this place!"}
{"text":"Mood and decor of the space was great and service was awesome. Food was good but I felt the meats in two dishes were under seasoned and not memorable. I felt dishes looked pretty but flavor development felt average. Pancakes were great though! Also got a drip coffee and it was so so. I would recommend their all American breakfast."}
{"text":"Came in on a Saturday with a group of 13 females to celebrate GALentines day. I can't comment on the wait time because I arrived when we were just getting seated. The decor I thought was homey and rustic.  Our waitress was friendly and did not have an attitude about serving such a large group, which is a frequent experience of mine unfortunately. Before we ordered they gave us some cookies as a \"starter.\" 6 cookies to be exact actually...for a group of 13? I guess I can't complain since it's free but we had to basically pick at them so we all could get some.   I ended up ordering the pork huevos rancheros benedict. Smoked pork, charros with guajillo sauce, salsa tomatillo, corn masa and bernaise sounded like it would be an explosion of bold flavors. The presentation of my dish was actually very beautiful. A friend compared it to a painting. However, the intense flavors I was expecting were not there. The sauces were bland so it didn't add to my dish except make my corn masa soggy. Adding the chipotle hot sauce made it taste much better. Other friends had the same comment on their dishes, \"it was alright.\" One friend's poached egg was actually overcooked as well. No yolk porn.   Despite the hype, the food fell short for me and it's definitely not something I would wait in line for...especially since they don't take reservations."}
{"text":"I love this place! Everyone is absolutely amazing - from the hostess, to the servers and the fabulous chef, Antonio! All of them came out to make sure that all of us were enjoying our food. We definitely enjoyed our food - 100%! The food is delicious and the portions are perfect! If you haven't been to the Kitchen Table, I strongly encourage you to go. You can sit inside or outside. But, on a beautiful day, you will definitely want to sit outside. Perfect for a date, with your family or to celebrate a special occasion. This is definitely my go-to place for breakfast or brunch!"}
{"text":"I came here with friends for brunch and the total experience was unfortunately bad. The restaurant definitely needs to work on customer service. The waitress hardly came over and it was really slow. She failed to fix the problem with my food and it was never fixed during my time here. I asked for a side of sautéed spinach for my Benny and they brought salad.  I kindly explained I just want the spinach for my Benny, well.... they then brought me the salad but grilled. I just set it aside and ate my cold food. I've came here before but now, I will not waste my money. I was not pleased with the customer service here, you can tell the two girls who had us do not care about there jobs,  or us. I am a server on the strip and would be embarrassed to receive this feedback."}
{"text":"Very homey vibe that makes you feel like you really are at someone's kitchen table. Quite busy on the weekends and the monkey bread runs out fast for good reason.  It's not often that a whole stack of pancakes is good enough to go down without syrup on its own, but these are SO good. Chef's got the perfect recipe poppin for real. Not to mention the jalapeño cured bacon. Match made in heaven!  I'll always be back to try more stuff. Everything that comes out looks like a Food Network special. Shoutout to the owner Javier for being so personable and caring about minor details."}
{"text":"Came here after seeing all the good reviews and mouth watering photos on yelp. So glad I tried it. I found my new favorite brunch spot on my side of town.   Cute restaurant with both indoor and outdoor seating as well as a coffee bar where you can pick up coffee and pastries to go. We were greeted by the chef and chose to sit outside.   Everything on the menu looked so good. We asked our server Joseph what we should try and told him we wanted breakfast so he made some suggestions.   We wanted monkey bread to start but we were too late and they were sold out so we ordered the muffin of the day which was a triple berry muffin. It was very good and moist.   For our entrees we ordered the breakfast bowl with pork belly and the country benedict. Both had really good flavor and were good sized portions.   We will definitely be back to try other items from the menu. Everything sounded so good."}
{"text":"Smiles from the second you walk in. Start off by saying very cute brunch place to go with the girls.   From mimosa to Mexican hot chocolate tastes amazing.  Appetizer so mouth watering. big pieces of avocado and crab(forgot the name)  Main dishes were soooo good. Had a little accident with my food (their fault) but the chef insisted on making me a new one right now. They took it off my bill. Super nice. And he comes and checks everything is okay.  Servers are on top of their job. Refilling and making sure if anything else is needed.  A little on the healthy?  Could work on the hash browns.  Deff worth the 30 min drive and will come back:)"}
{"text":"Well been twice now and unable to actually try any food. Waits are horrific and they do not take reservations. Get with it people..."}
{"text":"New favorite breakfast spot for sure, had an amazing atmosphere and all of the staff are friendly and accommodating. Found out there's a location closer to home for us so will definitely check it out. The pork belly eggs Benedict and monkey bread are to die for. Thank you kitchen table!"}
{"text":"We put our name on the waiting list via the Yelp app so when we got there the 40-minute wait was only 12 minutes for us!  Highly recommend putting your name on the waitlist prior to arrival. We had a party of six and it was a gorgeous day so we sat outside. We arrived at 11:20 a.m. on a Sunday morning. We heard to order the monkey bread but when we place the order for monkey bread it was already gone for the day. Seemed a little early for their best item to already be out for the day. For appetizers we ordered the empanadas, breakfast taquitos and crab queso. The appetizers were very good.  For breakfast I ordered the chorizo omelette. There was very little chorizo in my omelette and almost no flavor. The potatoes that came with it were way too greasy for me to even eat. I'm still giving the place three stars because I really enjoyed the appetizers however I would never ordered the chorizo omelette again and I'm a big fan of chorizo and omelets."}
{"text":"I've had this place bookmarked for a while so I was excited to finally try it. This place really knows how to elevate breakfast dishes.   Atmosphere: the service was very friendly. The server always checked to see if we needed anything else, but not so much that it was annoying. When we were ready to pay we thought you had to go up cause we saw the table next to us do that, but the server made it a point to tell us we don't have to. He said that they don't want anyone to feel rushed to leave, which was nice. I always find it annoying when servers bring the check 5 min after we get our food.  Food: we got biscuits to start because we were starving. I liked them with the jam and honey. I would def recommend, especially since they're only $3. My boyfriend and I shared the monte Cristo and country Benedict. The country Benedict was so good and definitely different from other ones you've had. It looked so good that the table next to us had to ask what we got. The chipotle gravy on top was a really nice topping. My boyfriend loved the monte cristo. He felt like the bread was similar to a donut and it had a good balance of savory and sweet. Definitely will be back to try some other dishes here!"}
{"text":"Everything about this place is perfect. Both chefs along with the staff are extremely friendly and hospitable. Lox and bagels come with humus which is an awesome twist. Mexican hot chocolate is amazing. Definitely will be returning to try more of the menu. I recommend this place to anyone and everyone"}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in town. All of the benedicts are great and the mimosas are bomb af. The country Benedict is my favorite. The sausage sampler is really good too. There's a wait for a reason, so get a peach mimosa and wait for your table."}
{"text":"Excellent food and the staff was very friendly...was going to have the traditional egg's Benedict, but the waiter talked me into their pork belly Benedict because they smoke all their own meats...it was awesome... The sauce on the pork was sweet, spicy and delicious... The eggs were cooked perfectly and the sweet spicy version of Hollandaise was amazing... Cute bistro style restaurant with outdoor seating...definitely worth a try for anyone in the valley... and the prices were fair for the level of freshness and quality of the food...go try this place if u get a chance"}
{"text":"Ever since Bread and Butter closed, we've been looking for a great breakfast place with unique food and awesome pastries. We found it!!! We love Kitchen Table! I think we've sampled all of the pastries. Love the lemon coffee cake. The breakfast dishes are yummy. So glad you're in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"Can't wait to go back there.  I love gourmet food.  Really fois gras for breakfast love love it.... Chef did the touch up every dishes before sending out while we were there eating breakfast.  We ordered 2 dishes person.  Everything was so good!! We shall return and become regular here.. ;)"}
{"text":"I had a amazing experience the first time I tried here which I gave a 5-Star review in the past. The service was quick, consistent and accommodating, the manager at the time welcomed us with open arms, staff was very sweet, and the food was amazing.  Fast forward to now and time has changed. This time the service was not consistent at all for the following reasons:  -My friend Booked a table a day in advance for 6 guest, showed up to a unprofessional host or waitress in the front that said she don't have our reservation and to quickly blame a new hostess that's new. Unprofessional to blame your own co worker for that mistake, and to throw her under the bus  infront of your own customers. No accountability whatsoever.  You represent the restaurant so act like it with professionalism. Come Up with a better answer than what you gave us.  -Because they didn't save our reservation, we had to wait outside in 110 degree weather. I had to go in to ask for water because I was dehydrated from the heat.   -Staff don't seemed warm or inviting when you first enter.   -AC seemed like it wasn't working at all. It was very warm/hot and it was 110degrees outside. Don't know how it is appropriate to keep a restaurant open if the Air Conditioner is not working. Can't really give a amazing experience in a hot restaurant. Why even stay open?   -The front of house staff seemed pretty irritated, not very apologetic with the issues going on,  and also flustered. Only one of the waitress was really nice, probably realize what was going on and took care and comped our drinks as a nice gesture to make up for the chaos, and our frustrations. That was very sweet of her.   -It took 10 minutes to finally get some water served, and another 10 minutes fo the waitress to come back to take our order. That's a total time of 20 minutes waiting just to order.   -When ordered a Iced Drink, they placed the order, but comes back to disappoint us that they have no ice. How is that possible to have NO ICE? How can you serve any drinks with no iCE.  -Table setting was incomplete. We had to ask for forks. They seemed irritated. Also when asking for extra plates, they mention they ran out. We pointed out that there's plates sitting there that she could give us. Then she proceeded to give us plates. How can you say you ran out of plates?   Food arriving to our table was the only thing that saved the experience along with the nice waitress that comped our drinks. Food was great. But I honestly didn't think I didn't get what I paid for. They need to retrain their front of house staff, or get a brand new one. I work and also manage  in the service industry and certain behaviors, communication, attitudes, and the level of service would be unacceptable in my eyes."}
{"text":"So I really wanted to like Kitchen Table more than I did. The menu online is different from the menu at the restaurant and what you get is different from the menu at the restaurant but that wasn't a big deal. The service was probably the worst part. We were 1 of 2 tables and our food took 30 minutes and came out cold. The fresh mimosas were good but $8 each and we finished those before our food came and was never asked if we wanted another. I would give it 2 stars for service and 4 stars for food (if it was warm) for a total of 3 stars. It's worth a try but I wouldn't go back. Could have been an off day which I would assume based on how much everyone raves about it."}
{"text":"Came here for brunch. I ordered the chicken tortialla soup as a small app before my food came. Had to wait almost 20 minutes for it (not sure if it was made in house or if they were just being slow) the wait was annoying but the soup was AMAZING so it was worth it. I also ordered the frittata. I did not like it. It was very very bland. I should have looked at the photos via Yelp before ordering. My friend ordered the veggie sandwich which was very good. It's a great vibe in there as well. I would def come back but order something else off the menu.,"}
{"text":"My boyfriend, dog Charley and I have been customers of this establishment for a little over a year. We come here maybe 3 or 4 times a month. Today, when we came in early to avoid the rush and for the FIRST time in the year we've been coming here they informed us that they ONLY allow service dogs. This is beyond ridiculous being that we have sat in the patio with our dog Charley countless times. The service in this establishment has gone down hill for a while now but we always overlooked it until now. Don't bother eating here."}
{"text":"The food is amazing! Tried the country Benedict, the pork belly Benedict, crab cake, Mexican hot chocolate, and a side order of foie gras. The chicken fried steak on the country Benedict was a bit chewy, but the rest of the flavors are amazing. Really enjoyed the pork belly Benedict. Jalapeño sauce really kicked it up a notch and the pork belly was perfectly cooked. The crab cake was delicious, but not the best I have ever had. Foie gras, how can you go wrong. I could eat that for breakfast, lunch, and dinner! Mexican hot chocolate was a sight to see. Beautiful to the eye, but was over saturated with chili pepper flakes. The flakes killed the experience for me. First time I ate here I had a female server who provide great friendly service with a smile. However, the second time I ate here I had a male server that was very off putting and killed the entire experience for me. We asked for sugar for the coffee and his reply was, \"do you want me to get it now or do you want me to take your order?\" Never did get the sugar and finally had to ask the hostess who was seating people to bring us sugar. Then the server kept giving us dirty looks. Thinking that maybe it was just our table, I looked around and noticed other tables pissed off with the same server. Having driven across town and filled with excitement, I felt very let down and will probably never go out of my way for this place ever again!"}
{"text":"Their food is actually great. Very inconsistent service and most importantly expect to wait 20-30 minutes longer than they tell you or it's says. They are on nowait app, however, they don't stay true to it and have said they don't really look at it... (so why are you on it?) It really doesn't seem like anyone is managing this restaurant aside from the front desk host. It would be such a great place if it was properly run. It's sad management doesn't put more time into organizing their staff here. We arrived today 10 minutes prior to our nowait time told us, 10:49. We were seated at 11:25. Oh and yes, you can wait in their lobby and get a Kombucha for $12.99. Yes, a simple Kombucha that Whole Foods sells for $3.50. And we all know Whole Foods is already expensive."}
{"text":"If you can get past the guards and are able to interpret the menu, the quality of the food is outstanding and worth the visit. Just make sure you sit outside, get there 30-45 minutes early, and don't mind being ignored.  I don't appreciate restaurants that don't take reservations. We called the The Kitchen Table about a week before our visit to reserve a table. They don't take reservations, but suggest calling ahead 30 minutes to put your name on a list. We did so for brunch on a Friday, and were told to call back. We called back 10 minutes later and did the same thing, only this time we were allowed to put our names on a list. When we arrived to the restaurant about 20 minutes later, we went to the front counter and said we were here and that our name was on the list. The girl looked at us, said \"okay,\" then walked away. At this point we have had 4 interactions with the staff (3 phone calls, 1 in-person) and one of the workers was helpful. I waited patiently until another staff member approached the counter. I introduced myself again because so far nobody has acknowledged or greeted us. This person said I need to wait until another person could help me out. Finally, the correct person arrived, she was friendly and she sat us a few minutes later. All that to get a table at the restaurant!   We sat outside, as the inside was very noisy and played horrible music (as noted in other reviews). Service was fast but cold, and the food was good and hot  The menu is slightly confusing as they offer \"eggs, buttered toast, house potatoes, bacon or sausage\" and \"2 eggs, toast, house potatoes, bacon or sausage.\" What's the difference? Apparently $2. Also, the menu offers very few substitutions or dietary restricted options, which is disappointing for the quality of the food they serve and crowd they are catering towards."}
{"text":"I expected more. Frankly, our breakfast was only OK. The interior space seems awkwardly set up and made the start of the experience a bit of a cluster. (Not much room for the tables and they were seating singles and couples at a long table against the wall that was difficult to get in and out of.) The coffee was good! We ordered a Monte Cristo and a bagel breakfast sandwich. Both were simply OK. Prices were high on top of everything. Waitstaff was quite friendly so props for that."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time and have to say that we are absolutely in love with it. Fresh clean healthy and delicious food is what you'll find here, with friendly staff and fast service. Will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"The one thing I love about going out of town is that I get to visit places that friends have suggested. This place was highly recommended by an old friend who now lives in Henderson.   I'm giving them 5 stars despite the wait (20 mins) which was understandable because it was a Sunday and people were hungover.   Got there around 11:30 with friends and waited roughly 15 mins for a table.  The decor inside is very homey and welcoming. We looked over the menu while waiting outside so we already knew what to order as soon as we sat down.   We started off with the avocado toast as an appetizer and we decided to treat ourselves with a pitcher of guava margarita. I went to silent mode after the first bite. I knew right then that I made the right decision getting the pork belly benedict.   Our orders: burger, pork belly benedict, pork belly chilaquiles and regular benedict. My benedict was out of this world bananas good. The chilaquiles was good too, but mine was cooked more as bbq. The burger was bomb, but I would suggest for there to be more meat.   Despite those little setbacks, I'm giving them 5 stars because the food is fantastic. I'm fairly certain everything else on the menu is equally delicious.   Do yourself a favor and stop by here on your way out of Vegas. You won't regret it."}

{"text":"Five of us gathered at Kitchen Table for brunch recently.  We tried a number of dishes that Chef Nunez selected from the menu and it was obvious from the beginning that we were in for a treat.  Two of us were there a little earlier than the rest of the group and we had some sweets.  Soon the others had joined us and the parade of dishes began.  Each one so very creative and tasty.  We were served:  White chocolate French toast PB&J pancakes Parmesan broccoli tort with smoked salmon Strawberry shortcake French toast Egg Mac Kitchen Avocado toast with poached eggs Pork belly Bene White chocolate French toast Foie Mac Muffin  We thought we'd have the sweets first and then the savories but it turned out that many of the savories were sweet and oh so good!  There wasn't one dish that fell short.  Everything was on point and some of them seem like they come from a mind that says, \"What would happen if I put this on that and then served it in an English muffin with a side of greens.\"  I was really taken by the avocado toast with the poached eggs.  What a different dish!  The two mac muffins were very good and definitely savories while the white chocolate French toast and strawberry shortcake French toast were delicious and perfect for the sweet tooth.  I can't end without mentioning the PB&J pancakes.  They were buttermilk pancakes with house peanut butter and house made jam.   Service was excellent.  Clean plates and silverware were brought for each dish (which the 5 of us shared lest one think I'm truly a pig).  Coffee was continually refilled.  Speaking of which, they have outstanding, rich flavored coffee.  I can't recommend highly enough Kitchen Table for breakfast, brunch, or lunch.  Now I know why my friends have been buzzing about this place.  It is good!"}
{"text":"I was not impressed by this restaurant. I made a reservation to bring my family from out of town. When we got there the hostess seemed a bit lost and we ended up waiting at least 20 min. Everyone around us was also upset. While waiting outside we heard multiple staff setting up tables in the patio complain about being there and how much they hated their job. This was definitely not the vibe you want when treating guests to a \"nice\" brunch. We finally got a table outside and it was pretty underwhelming. The seats were ripped, we got a bunch of disgusting, dirty paper menus, and the wait was ridiculous to even get our drinks. The food we ordered was overpriced and under seasoned. I was embarrassed because I went off of the yelp reviews but honestly, I think I've been more impressed with ihop. If you're going to charge on the higher end of the spectrum for the area at least have presentable menus and staff that have enough sense to talk crap about their job when they're out of the restaurant. I think these reviews are most likely the result of some type of incentive and I would strongly suggest spending your money somewhere else."}
{"text":"My rating is 3.5 but I am generous in rounding up. It's a \"mom and pop\" place and I understand that your rating has great impact on people's livelihood. I stopped by this place on purpose while headed in that direction from az bc of the great reviews (it's currently headed on a slow spiral down as of the day of this writing). Arrived early Father's Day and there was a line starting at 7 in the morning. Good sign since they open at 7:30. Greeted at opening from one of the owners, nice. Inside is small. But that's ok. Patio space is nice. And bigger than indoor space. Here is what was ordered and breakdown on food.   Chorizo omelet: disgusting but we chalk it up to maybe we did not like the chorizo ??  Pb j pancakes: tasty but where is the on and barely any jelly  Burger: my son says it was good but nothing he want to purposely return for. Nice that they were able to serve him a burger 7:30 in the morn  Pork belly Benedict: pork belly tasted good but there was so much inedible fat. Gross hollandaise , 2 pieces of mesclun lettuce (confusing) , poached egg was however perfect, best part was the English muffin bottom. Over all icky  Hot chocolate was just ok  Crumb cake was better than average and if you're there I would order one  Bathrooms were sad. Toilet paper roll holder broken. Garbage can was a wicker fabric lined basket thing and the liner was dis colored.   I was so disappointed that I waited for this place to open. I would not return even if I lived in this area. I am honestly confused by the reviews unless maybe they were better before. We ordered a variety of items and it wasn't just one that sucked.   I also want to say that our waitress was very nice and attentive. And the one owner was obviously very nice too. But the food and bathroom was a no no."}
{"text":"The place is very busy and looks very popular. We met the manager Arely who was super friendly and welcoming. We tried the pork belly Benedict and the strawberry short cake french toast and it was amazing. To start we also tried the monkey bread which is apparently a popular item here that runs out quickly if you don't come early enough. It was delicious as well. Servings were of a very generous size and we could not finish our plates.  I was very happy to hear that they will be opening a new location in south west at the Grammercy.  Definitely one of the best breakfast places in town."}
{"text":"Hands down the best breakfast/brunch spot in town! Javier's creativity and palate lend themselves to amazingly delicious food not seen this side of the strip in the 20 plus years I've lived here.  Mimosas are a must prepared with home made fresh fruit purées. Guava is my favorite!"}
{"text":"Last Sunday was my first time visiting this spot. All the food on the menu sounded so delicious, that it was difficult to make a decision. To drink i ordered the Lavender Kombucha Tonic, which was super refreshing and delightful. (A little pricy but it was worth the $12) I ended up ordering the fruit crepes. It was very light and the fruit compote was just right. My friend ended up ordering the strawberry French toast and O M G was it delicious!! The strawberry syrup that they drizzle on top was so fresh. You can instantly tell it was fresh fruit and just made. Definitely recommend this place for brunch! But be aware this place gets packed so be ready to wait. I went around 12 on a Saturday and waited for about an hour. Totally Worth the wait!!"}
{"text":"The food is great, taste is great, presentation is great; both unique & \"on the daily\" options available on the menu.  I had the tostada & I'm glad I did! It was deelish!  The downside of this hipster, bacon/smoke smelling Kitchen is the service needs a lot of work/improvement. Mind you, this is a new place, so I won't hold it against them, yet. The owner/chef visited each table & he was working too (they were slammed with business).  I will return because the food was that good. My fiancée had the tacos huevos, & our good friend had eggs benedict. We all LOVED our food & the restaurant set up."}
{"text":"Everything was amazing!! Chef Pedro came out to meet us as it was our first time here. Sitting outside in the courtyard for brunch was glorious. The food was so delicious. My mom had French toast with Tahitian vanilla bean and Egyptian chamomile blossom syrup. The best syrup she has ever had and she's from Vermont! The pastrami hash my husband had was delectable. I had the huevos tacos and thoroughly enjoyed them. My dad had the shorty Benedict and he says it was excellent. All the presentations were beautiful. We will definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"Super cute place. Servers are so nice and helpful. We came with a party of 10 and everyone's food looked and tasted wonderful except for my monte cristo. The bottom bread was hard and not edible. There was something missing and I'm not quite sure what it was. But it wasn't a classic dish. I would still come back but not order that."}
{"text":"I like this place, and I feel like it offers something Vegas has been missing. Even my visiting parents, while we sat on the patio, said, \"It feels like Scottsdale!\" ...by which they meant the cutesy local restaurants, bars, and shops with nice outdoor space....not the overly tan women with fake boobs and rompers...but we saw those too. The ambiance is really great as the shopping center is at the base of McDonald Highlands, which is nice and green and leafy and tropical. The patio is big and well-secluded from the road and huge parking lot, but still open enough to give you views of those trees. We had no problem getting in with a group of 5, but then we were there on a Thursday at lunch time. Cool menu including empanadas, crepes, pastries, and traditional American breakfast items. My favorite was the egg in the hole (or something like that) which was a piece of toast with the center cut out and an egg cooked over easy inside. Yum! Plus, the beer and mimosa menu is pretty good. Prices are a little higher, as you'd expect, and the service was a little slower than I'd hope, but it could have been an off day. I won't go every day, but I'll definitely be back to Kitchen Table."}
{"text":"I love this place so much!!! The service was perfect. The food amazing. The price very reasonable. Amazing mimosas for brunch and omg the monkey bread seriously to die for! I'm a huge brunch and so far this has been my favorite place! I could eat here everyday. If you love brunch this is a MUST"}
{"text":"Very interesting menu. I have never had this kind of breakfast before. I ordered the Egyptian dish. It was clean, healthy. Great choice for health-conscious folks with many \"whole food\" breakfast style."}
{"text":"I went there for the first time this weekend. Service was great! The food was really good too. I wish I had tried some of the brunch drinks. They looked really good."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to give a huge shout out to this place! By far my favorite breakfast place in Vegas/Hendo!!! Every time I have visitors this is a must visit! Sometimes the wait can be long on the weekends but soooo worth the wait!!! Order the Monkey Bread to start, the croque madam is the best I've ever had! I'm from Seattle and I can't find many places here that don't feel like a chain...but this place takes me home!    There is a fun little outdoor patio or an intimate indoor area! Plenty of parking in back!   Well done."}
{"text":"What time is it?  It's rhyme time!!!  Yes, it's that time for my monthly rhyme, If you haven't eaten here, it's almost a crime.   Dining at Kitchen Table is a memorable one, Good food with friends is always fun.   I'll start with the service since it's as good as it can be, If you're into a great meal, then listen to me.  No reservations! So, get here early, We didn't wait long because we had Shirley.   Yes, she's the Duchess here and I can see why, The food is amazing. I'm not gonna lie.  We met some friends here for my birthday brunch, The coffee was strong and packed a punch.  The pancakes are to die for.  Fluffy! Tasty! Simply the best, Yes, they're that good.  Forget the rest!!  Their Chicken Fried is awesome and better than most. It's served with 2 eggs, potatoes, and toast.    Now let's talk about portions, they definitely don't skimp, I went Feast Mode because I'm not a wimp.  Here's a tip, based on what I've read, Come here early and get their Monkey Bread.    5 Stars for their Chicken Fried, the service, and their stack, Believe me when I say it.  I will be back.   2016 Yelp Review #18"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place!  I love it!   I met the owner at the bank and he invited me to come sometime.  Well I did and I continually keep coming back.   The food is amazing, a definite home cooked meal feeling with all kinds of variety to satisfy every palette.   My favorite is the empanadas but everything is great!  The service is incredible.   They remember us every time we come in and always say hello.   If you're looking for something off the beaten path of the Las Vegas strip and truly want to  want to enjoy local food in Henderson......then come here!   You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food at Kitchen Table made my experience.   Thursday afternoon at approximately 11am was a bit packed more than i would have anticipated, so plan ahead if you expect to sit immediately. One of the first negatives that i noticed upon approach to the front door to get my name on the list was the very loud music that was playing from a speaker on the patio. And the type of music didnt really \"fit\" the food and atmosphere that was on display here either. I even made a comment to the hostess about not wanting to sit near the very loud music, and she said oh thats just the speaker right there. I was hoping she would catch on and maybe turn it down a bit, but of course it didnt happen. A 20 minute wait found me sitting outside on the steps getting a view of how there was not a lot of thought put into the decor, layout and presentation of the patio. There are enclosed canopies that if i were sitting in would feel kind of weird and stuffy. The long vinyl wrapped high back benches (cheap looking) that look as if they are styled to block the view in and out of the patio area from the passer bys. And the worst part was the hordes of empty food service cardboard boxes that were throw all around the patio, and even into parts of the surrounding landscaping. Does management know this is being done? I cant imagine that anybody can think that this is appealing to the consumer.  Simple suggestions...  If you are going to have music in a restaurant, fit the music and the level to that of the food and experience. I was sitting inside (speaker outside) and i had to speak above normal to be heard.  I think a more inviting patio for both the diners and the passer bys is an open one where people can see whats going on around and not closed in by walls. Passer bys can also see the welcoming patio and venture in to maybe even want to sit and eat themselves. Simple open tables and umbrellas for shade would be ideal under the palm trees you have back there.  And you must get a grasp on those cardboard boxes. There was at least 2 dozen boxes thrown around your patio, and actually made me want to leave, coupled with the music.  But... even with the above, i will still be back. What? Yes! I had the benedict, and it was the best that i have had. The hollandaise was simply delicious and balanced with the most perfect made eggs. If some improvements can be made on the atmosphere, this could be a regular spot no doubt. But till then i will not be rushing back for more."}
{"text":"I've been here twice, and twice I've been disappointed. With all the reviews and the line out the door I figured the place has to be amazing! Unfortunately, it is not. I do like the design and vibe of the restaurant and their coffee and pastries(monkey bread, biscuits, cookies) are GREAT! However, their food just isn't good. I've had their Chilaquiles, the smoked salmon benedict, the chicken fried steak, egg mac kitchen and pancakes & bacon. Everything was just off. The smoked salmon was too fishy, the chicken fried steak's chipotle sausage gravy, although adventurous, the flavors just didn't mend well with the rest of the meal. I've also been to Served which is in the same complex. Served is just good GOOD food even without comparing it to Kitchen Table. If you're deciding between Kitchen Table and Served- choose Served, you will not be disappointed. After 2 times, I will not be returning to Kitchen Table."}
{"text":"Absolutely recommend this restaurant. Service was on point, food was delicious.  Great selections if you love high end but you don't have to pay the price..  enjoy"}
{"text":"Let me start by saying my husband and I have been twice in one week.    Overall Feel: This is a wonderful sit down around the family table and have a comforting meal.  The decor speaks to this environment.    Food:  YES! YES!  Artistic brilliance, and great tasting food. Need I say more. We have the Chili Colorado and Vegetarian Bendict. Stop the presses, the chef has created wonderful plated presentations, and the taste is over the top.  Service: We walked and were greeted right away.   The interaction with our server and other staff was spot on.  Thank you for pleasant experience.  This is our new stop!  Best breakfast and Brunch location.  Creative, great tasting and just a wonderful overall experience."}
{"text":"OMG!!!   Can you say YUMMERS????  Went there today and was blown away how GOOD the food was!!!  Hidden gem!!!  This won't be my only trip to this awesome eatery!   Small room and loud but wasn't your mom's kitchen table when it was full of happy people eating???  And, yes, the chef comes out to be sure you are satisfied!!  Just WOW!!!  HIGHLY recommend you try it!  What did I have?  Pork belly bene!!!  SO GOOD!!!  And the potatoes?  Outta this world!  I ate them all!!   They toasted the English muffin and it tasted home made it was so delightful!!   Did I mention the food is REALLY good???  And the service???  Better than the food, if you can wrap your head around THAT!  My niece was also extremely happy with my choice!  YAY me!!  Try it!!"}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place because of the good reviews but being a pescatarian I was limited. I only tried the chilaquiles and I was disappointed. I know this it wouldn't taste authentic but I had to return the plate I couldn't eat it. The server was extremely nice and offered me to try something else, I had the egg tacos and they were decent. I don't think it was worth the price at all I could've made better at home Lol. But I'm not sure if I will come here again, too far from home and nothing stood out. My friend also didn't enjoy her meal she says it was average food. The place looks old the chairs are really worn down I think this place could use an improvement overall."}
{"text":"This is the fourth time I have eaten here.  We were a  party of 9 and we had a great time.  The food was amazing and the service was great.  I highly recommend the Kitchen table."}
{"text":"Great addition to the neighborhood.  If you're use not been I yet, go while the menu is still so huge and they're figuring out what dishes stay or go.  Lots to love.  We think the empanadas on starters menu are great. Egg shooters aren't a win, nor is tostada.  Frittata is dynamite, all of the benedicts rock, the croque Madame is divine.  Had a few desserts that are so good, they'll make your toes curl so come in, sit down, relax.  Have a giant great cuppa and say hello to your neighbors."}
{"text":"We went here on a Saturday morning. It gets really busy so try to come early. The customer service was great! Our server was super chill and cool. There were so much to choose from at the menu. The selections are unique and some had a Latin fusion to the entrees. We started off with the empanadas which was amazing. You can tell the breading was different and the sauce with the cherry tomatoes was a perfect combination together. Both chefs were even there  to serve us our food. Also the chilaquiles was delicious! Coffee was okay.. Nothing special. It was more of a drip.  But overall great experience. Wish it wasn't so far tho!! But it's worth a trip to come back again."}
{"text":"finally got to try this place! the waiter was friendly and attentive, the bussers were quick to clean up tables, the owner asks guests how their food is, very friendly overall. unique menu items, some interesting combinations of food that seem to be freshly cooked. I had their pastrami sandwich which was just the right size and surprisingly refreshing with cucumbers instead of pickles! will return to try more menu items. this place is usually busy and there is typically a wait, however when I came the wait about 10 minutes for a seat because I arrived in between the breakfast rolling into lunch rush."}
{"text":"Found this gem on Yelp!  Outstanding service and the food was phenomenal!  The Porkbelly Benedict was perfection. The best bbq porkbelly ever with perfectly cooked poached eggs, toasted and buttered English Muffins and Wow. Perfection. I gladly give this place 5 Stars"}
{"text":"Wow, they're growing like weeds. But in a good way.  Kitchen Table is the latest breakfast and lunch restaurant launched by folks with high-end restaurant experience. In this case, Chefs Antonio Nunez (Circo, Le Cirque, etc.) and Javier Chavez (Mercadito and Whist, presumably alongside Antonio) are bringing their \"social eatery\" concept to life in a quiet Henderson plaza otherwise notable for neighboring restaurant Shabu Shabu Paradise.  The menu has a seemingly endless array of from-scratch food and baked goods. They've actually trimmed it a bit based on customer feedback and orders, but it was still not easy to select dishes.  Chocolate croissant ($3): a mostly excellent start. Crispy golden brown exterior, fluffy interior, and... wait, why is the chocolate filling offset on one side and not straight down the middle? You can completely whiff on the delicious sweetness if you divide it length-wise, and it was inconvenient to eat because width-wise cuts were still too long to be an easy bite.  Empanadas ($6, 3 pc): filled with cheese and veggies, topped with a salsa and crema, and served on a bet of greens and black beans, these are likely among the better appetizers. It's yummy, and the heat wakes up your palate. The empanadas themselves are miniature, but it's a complete dish.  Tostadas ($6, 2 pc): this fell flat. The ample portion of suckling pork was appreciated, as was the fresh slaw, but there weren't any flavor pops as in the empanadas. Give me any sort of spice or sweetness and that instantly improves. Also, I'm not sure whether the texture decayed in the few minutes' delay, but the tortilla did not have much crunch. Even the crunch wouldn't have saved this dish.  Crispy French Toast ($11): maybe my fault partially for listening to the server's recommendation, but this was also quite a letdown. I expected a lot more crispy texture, but the toast was pretty soggy in the middle. Even the granola was somehow soft. The flavors were not in the sweet zone that I would have liked, but I could have excused that if it'd lived up to its name.  Croque Madame ($11): thank goodness for this. Definitely needed a salty ham sandwich to liven up my morning, and although the gruyere wasn't melted, it was also delicious. Loved the generous helping of bechamel and the sunny-side up egg with runny yolk too, and the salad with sundried tomatoes provided a welcome fresh and light contrasting element.  Shorty Bene ($15): I've noticed a pattern of short rib tasting like it's lacking salt, and it held true today. But this wasn't bland by any means, and it was super tender. With a perfectly poached egg, a bearnaise and red wine reduction sauce, and a salty crispy hash that makes up for any seasoning voids, this is rightfully one of the most popular dishes here.  Although I opted to stop and box up leftovers at this point, I noticed that more friends had filed in for breakfast. When I joined them for conversation, they insisted that I join them for food, and who am I to resist more of the menu that was starting to impress me?  Smoked Salmon and Caviar ($14, 3 pc): an appetizer-worthy dish that's hidden near the back of the menu. Delicious lox and caviar with quail eggs, dill oil, micro green, and crema atop blinis. It's pricey even as far as this menu goes, but it's worth a try.  Foie Gras French Toast ($21): the must-try french toast dish that I'd hoped to find earlier. Sweet but not soggy amaretto batter toast, seared yet tender foie that's the tastiest pure foie I've tried so far, caramelized pears, and candied nuts may well be the best bite in the entire menu.  Monte Cristo ($9): this egg-less cousin of the Croque Madame has a nice crunchy exterior and is drizzled with a lovely sour-sweet strawberry jam (more jam available upon request), but there isn't as much ham. And as gooey as the Muenster was, it's not as assertive in flavor as the Gruyere. Admittedly, I was very full by this point, but I'd be hard-pressed to choose this instead of the Croque Madame.  Chopped Salad ($7): a lettuce mix with cucumbers, corn, cheeses, other goodies, and vinaigrette. Fresh, tasty, and relatively light. Probably best if presented/eaten at the start rather than the end of the meal.  Service was fair, not quite as inattentive as the other new brunch spot. Granted Chef Antonio himself was working the room today, greeting and engaging with customers, bringing out and explaining dishes, and otherwise pitching in. The kitchen seemed to be slow and took 10-15 minutes each time to send out food.  A few more nitpicks: really crowded space, with a narrow aisle in the dining area. for employees and patrons alike. Also, I think that the pop/pop covers music was a little high in volume. I could've done without the communal long table that's probably meant to encourage conversation, but it wasn't uncomfortable.  I'm not sure yet whether it's the best new brunch restaurant in Henderson, but I'll surely return soon to Kitchen Table to try more food."}
{"text":"Excellent little restaurant! The food is good and the portions big. Prices are not cheap but it is worth it. There are a lot of unique dishes to try.  The pork belly is excellent. The sausage appetizer is also good."}
{"text":"This place is hard to find, tucked away in a corner of an unremarkable little commercial development.   Find it.  You will not regret spending the time to locate the Kitchen Table.  Love this place.  The menu is different and amazing with a strong Hispanic influence.   This is not your regular \"egg and potato\" hash house.  The menu has been thoughtfully prepared, the food is fresh and full of flavor and the presentation is pretty enough to take a picture of it.  The Kitchen Table is a small restaurant and seating is \"intimate\" (meaning close to each other).  The menu is remarkable.  Fresh baked pastries are delicious.  The uniquely prepared and presented food items are fresh, not run-of-the-mill, unique combinations that are not to be missed.   Service is attentive and friendly.  The only \"dings\" I can tell you about is that seating is tight and the coffee isn't as good as it could be - its not awful by any means, but the coffee doesn't live up to the amazing food, hence 4 stars instead of 5.  There are pastries, delicious plated breakfasts unlike anything you will find elsewhere.  My favorites include a marvelous  pork green chile  with house potato, pork green chile, two poached eggs, cilantro onions with lime and corn tortilla chips .    Only on Sat and Sun can one experience the flavorful chili colorado braised pork, mexican chilies, charred tortillas, lime cilantro onions, pickled radish, pickled jalapenos, served in a small pan. The blend of flavors are so tasty and the servings are deceivingly large.        Benedicts are among my favorites and  while they are all delicious I can heartily recommend the Pork Belly Bene smoked pork belly, jalapeno hollandaise, english muffin, and house potatoes  or the Country Bene  which is a country fried steak, poached eggs, chipotle gravy, biscuits, arugula and house potatoes seasoned with a perfect spiced gravy.    Very different than the ingredients sound - the Chef has created a wonderful food experience.  A variety of mimosas are available on the weekend - orange, blackberry, prickly pear ,guava  ,  peach,  pineapple,  and cranberry in addition to champagne and a variety of beers.   I've had the pear and blackberry, cold, delicious and refreshing with brunch.   Chefs Antonio and Javier have done a great job with creating a menu with flavor nuances that one wishes to experience repeatedly.   We commend the Kitchen Table to you for  breakfast, lunch or brunch without reservation.  http://www.kitchentablelv.com/"}
{"text":"Can't recall the last restaurant I gave 5 stars-  For a small restaurant, it packs BIG flavors. Loved the variety of Mimosas from Blueberry, Prickly Pear to Guava (they have more Flavors). The star of the show is their Pork- they smoke it themselves in their outside Smoker. I tried their Pork Chile Verde... Let's just say \"We will be back in a couple weeks.\""}
{"text":"Went here based on reviews.  Not disappointed and we will return, but...  Pros:  Very nice ambiance - windows that offer natural lighting indoors, outdoor seating available, attention to detail (ceiling, tables, cloth napkins, attractive dishware, etc.).  Big menu with both sweet and savory options.  Emphasis is on pork.  Friendly server and busser.  Cons:  Lots of people were waiting for tables even when there were many sitting clean and empty.  Server was very friendly and attentive during the middle of our experience - from ordering through getting our food and a coffee refill - but we were a bit neglected when we first arrived and again while waiting for our check (which we finally had to get up and ask for).  Other details:   1. The menu has a lot on it, but if you want meat, you'd better like pork.  Bacon, ham, pulled pork, pork sausage, etc.  Granted, we were told it's their specialty (and it was good, just not what we normally eat).  Why is there no alternative meat?  I think there were a couple vegetarian dishes, but those options were pretty limited and I don't think I'd recommend this restaurant to my vegetarian friends.  Even my potato soup had bacon in it.  It seems weird that they don't offer a chicken or veggie sausage options, at least.    2. The hostess had a really hard time getting people seated.  We arrived during what we thought must have been the tail end of an early rush (just before 8:00).  A few people were waiting up front but we could see enough open tables for everyone, so I was confident that we would be seated shortly.  It wasn't too long, but it also wasn't like the hostess seated a party then came right back and seated the next one.  She seemed to hesitate and wander around looking uncertain about what she was supposed to do next.  When she took us back, she was going \"Um...\" and looking left and right and hesitating at each empty table we passed.  She finally selected the farthest one for us and I didn't think about her again until we were leaving.  As we ate, I made a note to myself that we should come after 8:00 next time because it seemed a lot less busy.  (There were as many as five empty tables around us at any given time and each seemed to sit empty for a pretty long time.)  However, strike that thought!... when we left I saw a large number of people inside and outside the front door waiting for tables.  Maybe there weren't enough other staff and they would have just been behind on taking care of customer after they were seated rather than before, but whatever the reason, it looked like a big missed opportunity for the restaurant to handle a lot more customers.  Finally, I saw the review that noted that it was difficult to get seating for more than two.  I observed quite a few tables of four and six.  Again, that's a matter of the restaurant planning properly.  Most of the tables seem to be for two, but were pushed together to seat more.  At least it appeared that they have that figured out now.  3. Value:  Prices are quite fair considering there is attention to detail in both the food and the ambiance.  I think you could spend a lot if you order sides, but I had a combo of empanadas and potato soup that together amounted to $13.50, which is about the same as a lot of the other entrees and, I think, reasonable.  And the empanadas alone would have been plenty (I took more than half of that dish home as leftovers.)  If service/seating issues were resolved, based on the rest of our experience, I would give 5 stars."}
{"text":"Excellent food. Outstanding service. Our server Maria was awesome. The manager, Melanie, is fantastic and on top of everything. And the food?? Freaking awesome. We will so be back!!!"}
{"text":"I don't often rave about a restaurant, especially a breakfast place but this place was phenomenal. I took the servers recommendation for the short rib poached egg breakfast and it was a 10 out of 10. The chef visited our table which was a nice touch. I hope he stays \"hungry\" and stays consistent. We will be back!   2nd time going today. Don't go on Sunday. They are ready to handle that level of business. We waited 50 minute, when we're quoted 30. After being sat at our table, we waited another 15 minutes before I had to ask three times for a waiter. I ordered the same thing as the first time. We got our food after an hour and 40 minutes of being there. It was not as good as the first time. Got there at breakfast, ate at lunch time. Won't be back until they get some more experience"}
{"text":"The best breakfast place I've ever eaten at in Las Vegas! We had empanadas, monkey bread and the fritada and it was all delicious!!"}
{"text":"My only complaint about Kitchen Table is that the wait times are extremely long, especially during weekend brunch times. I only dine here on weekdays and try and do so before 9am. The restaurant itself is small too. The last time we ate here, we ended up seated six inches from the people at the table next to us. I felt like I was in the woman's lap who was seated next to me.   That said, everything I have eaten here has been delicious. I've had the breakfast burrito and the French toast. They also have specialty items, like monkey bread. There have been a couple of times now when they have been out of something I've asked for. (On my most recent visit, cranberry juice.) Try the espresso or other coffee items though. I've never been disappointed in that regard."}
{"text":"Great food and always good service! The variety of breakfast options keeps me coming back! I've tried many dishes and all are awesome."}
{"text":"Another win for small business in Henderson. The Kitchen Table is located on the corner of Horizon Ridge and Valle Verde, right across from McDonald Ranch.  A small location perhaps, but packed full of delicious dishes. The menu is extensive and offers all traditional breakfast-brunch-lunch items, but many have a depth much more than just traditional. Pancakes, crepes, French toast, omelettes, egg dishes, chiliquiles, sandwiches, salads, a variety of baked goods, but each has choice ingredients and obvious thought has gone into each recipe.  The interior is lined with wooden tables, either wooden chairs or velvety booth seats. It's a natural feel and slightly sophisticated, yet homey and casual.  Antonio, one of the owners and chefs, introduced himself and sat us, was very friendly and made everyone in there I noticed feel attended to and important. He walked the restaurant a couple times to check on patrons. Our waitress was equally friendly and attentive.  The food was awesome!! I ordered the tacos heuvos (potatoes, eggs, chilies, avocado, ancho salsa) which was fantastic! Best breakfast tacos I've ever had. My hubby had the Blue Collar egg plate (eggs, potatoes, toast, homemade jelly) which he said was amazing. I ordered a foamy cappuccino, also quite good, as they source out their beans from a speciality coffee roaster. We also sampled a in house made glazed donut, light and airy, with yeasty overtones paired well with the sugary glaze, everything is top notch.  The bill for 2 plates, a large cappuccino and donut was $31.00.  We'll definitely be returning and I have a few plates in mind for my next visit!!"}
{"text":"Great brunch! We loved everything about this restaurant, the food was delicious & there was so many flavors for your mimosas. There's not a lot of brunch places in Henderson but this is definitely my favorite one"}
{"text":"Best brunch place in the city! Please hurry up and open your Gramercy location!!! We're tired of driving the 35 minutes (even though it's worth it!!)"}
{"text":"So we continue to come here for the food but service of the front is still lacking. We arrived at 7:45 and there were only 4 tables inside. We asked to sit outside but were told it'd be a 20 minute wait until another server came in. We like it outside because there's more room. We live in Las Vegas in the service industry, how hard is it to ask the current server to pick up one table outside? Just seems like common sense to me."}
{"text":"First let me start out by saying the food was amazing. I had the pork belly bene my husband had the monte cristo we started off with the crab dip. We came around 12ish had about a 25/30 minute wait. We had our hearts set on the monkey bread and when we went to order the waitress said they were sold out! She stated we needed to arrive early to get that. Umm if you're only open till 3:30 and it's a hot item you should know to have that in stock. So started out rocky. We sat outside and enjoyed the music one thing that was gross was they keep the trash cans on the outside porch there was flies non stop if you could put them out of sight and not around where people are eating that would be great. We ordered coffees after our meal. My husband went to order his after I did and was informed they ran out of milk so he couldn't have a speciality drink. I think this place will only learn from this and get better I hope! We will def give it another chance and hope they fixed these issues. Overall the food was Delish I would check it out!"}
{"text":"This is a must -eat whenever we're in Vegas.  The chef is awesome & always a pleasure to talk to.  The food is outstanding and has great sazon.  The pork green chile is my fav!"}
{"text":"Yes this Kitchen Table has great breakfast Brunch only a 20 minuets wait.  If you have a group of 4 or more get there early.  Try the Tacquitos  Coffee is good service is excellent always with a wonderful smile a pleasant disposition"}
{"text":"So excited to have this place in my neighborhood! Great food, great peeps, great vibe!  Yum!"}
{"text":"First off I would recommend check-in and making a reservation before coming in because this place gets packed. Food was amazing I would recommend any of the Benedict. Atmosphere was great and service was great. Definitely a place to go to if you want breakfast/brunch"}
{"text":"Best place ever !  Every time we've come here , it does not disappoint. Excellent food and great service ."}
{"text":"Came in for Sunday brunch. This place was packed! Our party of 3 waited an hour to be seated.  I'm used to waiting at other establishments, and it was a beautiful day out, so no biggie. It gave us a chance to decide what we were having anyway. Unfortunately, we came in too late in the brunch service, so all the pastries were sold out, including the D'Nuts and Biscuits. Ah well, maybe next time.   I had the Bagels and Lox, Jalapeño Bacon, a guava mimosa for Mr. Lefty, and a peach mimosa for Mr. Righty.  Bagels and Lox were good. $15, but it comes with a lot of smoked salmon, and a mixed greens salad. I wasn't too impressed with the bagel, though. It was a bit soggy, so I ditched it halfway through and just made a salad out of some extra greens and the lox.  Jalapeño Bacon was great!  They had a nice little kick to em.   Mimosas hit the spot too, a little on the strong side, which was A OK with me hehe.   I had a bite of my friend's pork belly benedict, and holy! That pork was sooooo good! The fat just melted in my mouth, and it was a perfect blend of spicy and sweet. I'm definitely ordering it myself next time (when I come earlier in the day for the pastries)."}
{"text":"My friend and I came to this place for the first time and the service amazing! the vibe amazing! just everything went perfect and beyond  Plus the food was amazing  Totally will come back again  Thanks guys for everything"}
{"text":"Breakfast/brunch seems like a hard meal to screw up but it happens often and the Kitchen Table is NOT guilty of that! In fact, they did EVERYTHING right!   On a Saturday afternoon, 15-20 minute wait for 2 people: not bad at all. #1 WIN  beautiful, farm-house style open kitchen greets you when you walk in. Fresh flowers everywhere. Visible chefs. #2 WIN   Pleasant waiter with prompt service style and attentiveness. #3 WIN  Now, FOOD...   coffee is GREAT. Breakfast taquitos starter: nice crunchy tortilla, not greasy, yummy filling, nice slaw, excellent sauce, perfect portion for 2. WIN #4  Chorizo omelette: not too spicy, eggs fluffy, chorizo texture appealing. Breakfast potatoes on side were nicely seasoned, NOT salty, and had a good balance of peppers and onions. WIN #5  The all-star in this meal was the ham and cheese crepe with a poached egg. This is by far, the BEST crepe I have ever eaten. It surpassed those eaten across the U.S., in France, in Germany, and in Amsterdam. The texture and thickness of the crepe was spot on, it had a mildly sweet flavor and soft delicate feel to the tooth. The ham balanced nicely with the Gruyere cheese and was julienned throughout the whole crepe, instead of piled in the center. Mornay sauce on top added a \"Je ne sais quoi\" I added a poached egg to the side of this and it was a great touch! Again, perfectly cooked. WIN #6  The chef delivered our food, appetizer and main, which was a wonderful sight and comforting. WIN #7  The whole atmosphere of the place was a reflection of him and the staff: pleasant and inviting. If we weren't so full, I could have sat there and just kept eating.   The Kitchen Table knows what it's doing and it isn't doing anything wrong! Will be back as soon as possible!!"}
{"text":"This place is small, so expect a wait, especially if your coming in with a group. Love the decor, it reminds you of a cute little farm house. Food is amazing! We had the sausage sampler and the accompanying sauces where awesome. Coffee was delicious, although nothing special. Food is most definitely hearty and  savory. Come with an appetite. also took home some donuts home.... It was okay. Could be better if I had it at the restaurant instead of taking it home."}
{"text":"Like the atmosphere but the wait it always long. Food is ok and a little different which is good. Go on a cool day when you can sit on their patio."}
{"text":"I stopped in after being referred by a fellow chef in the industry. Drove all the way from Summerlin for the trip. Although it was very busy, the food was definitely made with care. Happy to have a local chefs making food that they believe in. We need more shops like this in Vegas. Warning: may have a long wait at the door for breakfast/brunch time"}
{"text":"I use to love this place. But this is the 3rd time in a row my food takes forever to come out and when it does it's cold! I am so done with this place"}
{"text":"Great spot. Got there when it opened and it seemed like we just beat the rush. Friendly service right off the bat. Started with the Mexican hot chocolate with charred marshmallows. It had a little kick to it, but very delicious. Ordered the money bread - good but not all that as reviews seem to make it. Pork belly bene was delicious and would recommend. There are so many things on the menu I want to try that I'd be willing to make this my go to breakfast place for a while. Give this place a try if you haven't yet."}
{"text":"First time here ,, we've passed by this place so much and finally decided to try it ! Boy oh boy will we be back!! I had the chorizo omelette, the flavor in that omelet was amazing ! The breakfast potatoes we could not get enough of ! Next time we are ordering more ! Love this place now definitely will be back !"}
{"text":"On Saturday afternoon at approximately 1pm, my family and I entered this establishment for our first time. We researched the online menu and knew what we were going to order prior to entering . They told us the wait would be approximately 15 minutes to be seated. We then chose to walk over to the To-Go counter . We asked to see what the doughnut of the day was, since it was advertised online. Both employees, a male and a red headed female were by the pastries when we asked. They both looked at us as if they had no idea what the doughnut of the day even was. They then stated there was no doughnut. We then asked what flavor the green macaroons were and they had no idea. They then looked at the sticky notes and told us the green macaroons were of a butter cream flavor . After being seated, we asked for the waffles, but then were told they don't make waffles anymore.                                              My advice is as follows:                                                   The online menu should correlate with the paper menu at the establishment. Second, all employees should know what the pastry specials are. Especially the doughnut of the day. The two employees we asked shouldn't act too surprised if a customer asks a simple question. We felt as if we were bothering them. When we asked the waitress which pastry specials they had, she said they didn't have specials, they had \"just whatever\". The food we ordered (tacos, avocado toast, and Egyptian dish )were amazing! The jelly was much too sweet for the sweet bread. We give this place a 1 out of 5 due to its customer service. The food is 4.35 out of 5."}
{"text":"First of all you walk in and it is crowded, a good sign, but they have a coffee bar and a counter with fresh baked good uncovered with people standing all around reaching over, spiting, losing hair and exfoliating all around it......gross!  Don't order baked goods!  I soooo wanted this place to be good.  I ordered the ham and cheese crepes with Mornay Sauce, they were good, very rich though, could have used a few berries or something for acid, but good and I do like rich.    My husband however made the mistake of ordering the Monte Cristo.  My husband had a cold so he couldn't taste the food that well, I kept asking him how it was and he was saying ok....men!  Anyway he gave me a piece to taste and it was saturated with rancid oil or something that tasted so rank I had to spit it out.  I think they must have reheated someone's order or something I don't know.  The waiter was very nice and took it off the bill, but ewe!  I wish the manager or owner would have come over to say something though.    I loved the diversity of the menu, perhaps it is too diverse if a simple Monte Cristo can't be navigated."}
{"text":"Kitchen Table made me feel like a true Yelper today. Tucked away in a random, hidden corner of a strip mall with not much visibility means it relies highly on strong Yelp reviews and word of mouth. The 25 minute wait they gave me also meant the food needed to blow me away. And it did.  Communal tables, Pinterest worthy decorations, clipboard menu, hipster mugs and a full pig being roasted in the back right before your eyes. The customers almost seemed fake and placed by the restaurant, I've never seen anyone in Henderson dressed this cute! Atmosphere, check.  Breakfast/brunch food that are all Instagram worthy, check.   We ordered the traditional benedict and the Shorty benedict. The pork was too good to pass up on, order the Shorty over the tradiitonal.  The pastrami hash had thick slices of pastrami that made me want to munch on pieces plain. It went perfectly with the potatoes and eggs. The toast that it came with was PERFECT. I consider myself a bread connoisseur and the bread was as soft and delicious as plain toast can get. Don't bother asking for butter or jam- ya won't need it.   Come too late on a weekend and they'll be out of monkey break, coffee cake and biscuits. Kitchen Table was packed. I guess it just means I'll have to come back to try their pastries."}
{"text":"Had a closed audience diner here. They held an amazing 4 course meal for our medical group meeting. The crab cake followed by a corn soup was great. I chose salmon for the main. This was a definite return for more restaurant. The staff was amazing nice ppl."}
{"text":"Great breakfast and amazing service!! Loved the menu!! There is something for everyone."}
{"text":"Kitchen table is the best breakfast/lunch spot to go. The staff (Rapheal) is the best. I highly recommend this place. I always order the breakfast taco with pork belly. It literally melts in your mouth. The bloody beer is the best drink to start out with. We love kitchen table!!!"}
{"text":"I cannot say enough about this restaurant. The food is delicious. The staff is super friendly and amazing. The breakfast taquitos and eggs in a basket are my favorite. The Traditional Eggs Benedict is super yummy too. I highly recommend going to Kitchen Table."}
{"text":"We heard about Kitchen Table from a friend and my sister, mom and I decided to try it out.  The interior of the restaurant is open and friendly.  It has a great feel.  The food was wonderful!  We all ordered lunch and agreed we want to go back for Breakfast because the menu options looked amazing - and there are a ton of breakfast options.  I've seen some comments about the service being slow, but we had great service.  The chef/owner came over to check on us and he was very charming and we could tell this restaurant is his life.  I love this place and can't wait to go back the next time I'm in Las Vegas!"}
{"text":"Croque Madame is wonderful. This place is a hidden gem. The salads are mixed greens with a BACON VINAIGRETTE. I wish they would sell me a bottle."}
{"text":"I'm a frequent breakfast customer and former restaurant manager. In the past few months my experience has been better than ever with the service and energy with all the food servers, hosts, cooks and assistants. The quality of the breakfast menu items are consistently great.  The manager (Melanie) is very professional and keeps the business running smoothly even during busy times. Keep up the good work."}
{"text":"Stopped in there today with two friends, I didn't feel like I was in Las Vegas, extra special care by servers, menu resembled something near the beach in California, yummy pancakes and bacon, great menu.    Incredible care from the owner."}
{"text":"Wow! So lucky we came across this place for breakfast. Really great atmosphere, excellent service, and the food was amazing! Highly recommend coming here with family and friends...plus they have mimosas and beer to go with your coffee"}
{"text":"Awesome discovery while visiting my brother in Vegas! New eatery, very involved owners/chefs that check in with all patrons. Empanadas starter was delicious and perfectly sized as an app. Inventive combos (fried green tomato and avocado in eggs Benedict, pulled pork chilaquiles, tomato bacon jalapeño shooters). Nice atmosphere that's hip without being pretentious."}
{"text":"With so many great reviews is hard to add to what has already been said.    I loathe eggs with a passion, but found the traditional eggs Benedict and veggy Benedict to be perfectly delightful.   No one talks about the chicken sandwich. This dish is amazing.  One of the best sandwiches I've ever consumed.  The side of 'tatoe chips is kind of a letdown, but whatever. This sandwich is KILLER.   I'm not sure you could go wrong with anything on the menu.  It all seems delicious and fresh.  I hope this location keeps up the good work!"}
{"text":"I have tried many things on this menu and I really love their food and delicious coffee and mimosas, but for some reason, something that they cook the food with or in does not sit well in my stomach and I do not know why. I have no food allergies and I still recommend coming here"}
{"text":"Popular brunch spot on Horizon Ridge in Henderson.  I used the wait list feature on the Yelp App to reserve our table on the drive over. When we got there we checked in thinking it would be a short wait but we were told an additional 20-30 minutes. Right after I checked in I got an email saying I was taken off the waitlist. We waited and waited watching people who arrived after us being seated. After 30 minutes we asked if we were close to being seated. The hostess informed me she emailed me 25 minutes earlier to say our table was ready. For one I did not get any email saying our table was ready. Secondly we were sitting 5 feet from the hostess stand and she had been regularly calling out names of parties the entire time. Why couldn't she call out my name considering I was sitting right there?  We were finally seated and met by our waitress. We told her about the waitlist situation and expressed that now we were in a crunch to get to our appointment on time because of the hostess's mistake. She quickly took our order and our food arrived in under 5 minutes. We were very pleased with her service and for taking the time to listen and care about our situation.  I had the pork belly eggs Benedict and the monkey bread. Both were delicious.  We will be back but hopefully the restaurant fixes the hostess situation."}
{"text":"This was a great option for brunch on a Sunday morning with my family. Love that the restaurant is small and accommodating but was still roomy enough for them to fit a high chair for our infant car seat (a super plus!). The wait was not too bad on a Sunday (25 mins-ish) they got us in quickly and had a server over within minutes to take our drink order. The service was quick and she was very sweet.   For drinks I wish I could have tasted one of those delicious mimosas I was drooling over on the menu (they have so many cool options). I ordered the creme brulee latte which was TO DIE FOR, the torched sugar on the top is a great touch and my husband's honeycomb cappuccino was awesome and tasted like honeycomb cereal!   The plates came quickly. I ordered the pork belly green chilli which was very tender and tasty (I think it's a great touch to get mexican food that doesn't taste like the only spice they used was cumin). My husband ordered the strawberry shortcake French toast which is drool worthy, I would go back just for that plate. The Empanadas were a nice appetizer, however they do taste a little doughy (or I guess in this case masudas). Loved mostly everything that I tasted on our plates and it was a pleasant foodie experience no doubt.  Would definitely come back and recommend this place! A great brunch option in the Henderson area!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best breakfast/lunch spots I have ever been to. Chef Antonio's passion really shines through in all of his dishes and the welcoming atmosphere of his restaurant. Everything here uses the freshest ingredients and is created with a true love for great food.  Staff is very friendly and the ambience is very warm and comfortable (the music is awesome as well).  If you get a chance, definitely make plans to stop by and have a bite to eat and a drink or two for an excellent dining experience."}
{"text":"Three words:  Pork Belly Benedict!  I've been here a few times to know that this dish will definitely hit the spot if you're looking for something savory.     I've also had the avocado toast and chiliquiles which were both alright.  I guess my tastebuds crave more savory dishes than these two so lesson learned...stick to what you like!"}
{"text":"I've heard so many good things from my roommates and friends about Kitchen Table and how drool-worthy the monkey bread was supposed to be. The only thing that kept me away from here was the wait. On the weekend, this place is the hip place to be in terms of brunch/breakfast, and I can see why. The interior and outdoor seating is charming while the fresh pastries are bringing you in with their flaky exteriors & warm, fluffy interiors.  I came during Memorial Day Weekend, and the wait wasn't as awful as I thought. It was about 45 minutes which is still pretty long, but hey, it was MDW so I can't complain all too much.  We got some coffee, OJ, and monkey bread to start. Afterwards, I got the country benedict. All in all, everything was pretty good. I'm not sure why I got the country fried steak benedict when I don't really like country fried steak in the first place. I guess I was feeling incredibly zesty that day. It's just not my favorite kind of breakfast food, but nonetheless, Kitchen Table made a solid, hearty benedict over a housemade biscuit. It was pretty good for what it was. The only thing I didn't like was that the poached egg for the benedict wasn't quite runny. The yolk was soft but almost like a creamy, thick yolk that has just past being soft boiled. It wasn't bad, but at the same time, it shows how the egg wasn't cooked well. At this point, I'm just being picky because things were overall pretty good.  The fabled monkey didn't quite meet my expectations. There wasn't much of the cinnamon/butter syrupy goodness, so I was kind of eating a biscuit with a light drizzle of sauce. I think people may have hyped it up too much for me, and when I actually had it, it wasn't as transcendent and decadent that everyone said it would be.  All in all, this is a great place that the neighborhood really enjoys. Is it my favorite? Not necessarily, but it's still on the list of places when people from out of town ask me where to get a decent brunch."}
{"text":"This was our second time to Kitchen table because the service was great and food was amazing, however this time? Service was great but we had an issue with our order and wait time. Let me start by saying communication between server and cook is key. If the server writes down a substitution, or modification to an order especially after the customer asks if it's possible to be done... and the server says yes.. it is so important to make sure the cook understands. I hope the management can go over this with the team of server's and cooks to make it aware that communication is key. We had already waited 40 minutes for our food which I don't mind.. especially when it's great food, and thinking the reason may have been due to a dishes modification, but to wait 40 minutes and plate wrong to wait another 15 minutes was too much. Especially since they rushed the new plate out and the potatoes were completely under cooked and still raw."}
{"text":"Quaint indoor outdoor breakfast/ lunch restaurant.  It's the 'In' place for breakfast in the back of Green Valley.  The pancakes are incredible!"}
{"text":"If you are a foodie this is the place for you! The food abd service was like fine dining! The menu options were unique and all sounded appetizing. I ordered the 'chicken fried' chicken fried steak with Chipotle sausage gravy, house potatoes and over medium eggs. My boyfriend order off the menu, banana fosters  french toast. We also ordered a vanilla iced coffee and prickly pear mimosa. We sat outside in one of the cabanas, they played great 80' & 90's music. When the food came out it look delicious and tasted AMAZING! This place us 27miles from our house but everything was so good that we will definitely be going back! Another great experience was that both the chefs/owners were at the restaurant greeting/seating people, chit chatted with guests, and came to different tables making sure everyone liked their food and satisfied. Our server Nicole was very friendly too, she knew the history of the chefs and gave great detailed information of different menu items."}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday morning, and this place was seriously the real deal! From excellent service to crazy good food, I was very impressed. Our waiter gave awesome suggestions, and we were more than satisfied. I had the chilaquiles (to die for!) and my girlfriend had their traditional benedict, and we ordered a side of the biscuits and house jam. Everything was delicious, and a treat like no other. Can't wait to go back! Thank you Kitchen Table!"}
{"text":"Now that I've been to Kitchen Table a few times I know that I need to upgrade them to a five star. My husband and I love this spot. We'd probably come here more often if they weren't so busy! I'm glad that a local spot is popular enough to generate a consistent wait on the weekends though. I would advise not arriving hangry since the wait can be around 45 minutes mid-morning and lunch time. There is a to go counter for pastry and coffee if you need food immediately.   Each time we visit I see improvements to the service. Our first visit wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great. During my other three visits we've had great service.   At this point I've been able to sample many different drinks, pastries, and breakfast entrees. Wow! Everything I've had has been amazing. The monkey bread is to die for and enough for two to three people to split. The Chicken Fried Benedict is also crazy good. The chipotle gravy, flaky biscuits, fried goodness, and egg yolk are an explosion of flavor.   Kitchen Table is definitely an asset to the area. I'm lucky to have this spot so close to home for decadent weekend brunches!"}
{"text":"Extremely friendly staff, food was excellent! Everything tasted like it was made with love! Small dinning area but makes it feel cozy. Chef even came out to make sure everyone was enjoying their meal. Will be returning!"}
{"text":"First of all....I've been here before loved the duck omelette...and because of the service I received today...I will not be back again...granted it is over a weekend and I realize the waits are usually longer...but to stand by waiting...party after party  being seated but us was rediculous, we ordered lattes knowing it was gonna be a while...the hostess claimed they were trying to get two tables together for a party of four...so how did the two tables of four who arrived after us get seated...absolutely rediculous. Too bad, food was good...but their are too many places to eat and get good food without the crappy service!"}
{"text":"This is my favorite breakfast/brunch place in all of Las Vegas area. I am a true regular and I was surprised to not have reviewed it yet. Food quality is amazing, location and outside patio is perfect, staff is super friendly and very accommodative to kids. Kitchen Table is a true example how a restaurant should work. I cannot comment on any specific dish because every single item I have gotten there has been absolutely amazing."}
{"text":"I have been driving past this place awhile without realizing what a gem this place is. Finally after speaking with a coworker I decided to try it out! This place was absolutely fabulous! From the decor, to the social atmosphere, this place is a hit for all the right reasons.      I heard coming here to make sure to get on the waitlist prior to arrival. For that to work, you must call an hour before you intend to be there to be on the list. Once we arrived it took less than 10 minutes to have our booth ready for us. Our servers name was Brooke, she was quick about getting our orders and helped with getting a cup with a lid so my son (four year old) wouldn't spill. She recommended the pork belly bene, so I ordered, while my best friend ordered the shorty which consisted of braised pork ribs, and my son had the ham and gruyere cheese crepe.      The food came out about 15-20 minutes which was a surprise because the place was packed. The food  was artfully plated and we dove right in Everything was perfectly seasoned and not once did I think about adding salt and pepper. Every component on each dish had a flavor of its own and it truly reminded me of classical French cuisine with a twist. This place is amazing! I highly recommend it for anyone and everyone.      Also a special thanks to the Manager Melanie, she checked on us and was great to talk to! She was very knowledge about the restaurant and created a friendly, fun environment! Thank you so much! We will be back!"}
{"text":"The best brunch and breakfast place in Las Vegas! There aren't many gourmet breakfast places in vegas, sure we have babystacks cafe & rise n shine but those are hardly contenders. Those kind of places serve powdered eggs and microwaved pancakes so it's hard to find a place where they actually serve clean, fresh and delicious food. However, kitchen table is phenomenal and makes you forget about the places you were once forced to eat at. I come here often and have never had a bad meal. The strawberry french toast is to die for. I've never had a better snickerdoodle latte anywhere else or in general & the staff is friendly. The chef personally serves your food to the table which is sweet and so professional!"}
{"text":"The food at this place is amazing! I've had the empanadas and the taquitos from the appetizer menu and they were delicious, perfect for sharing. The empanadas are vegetarian too. I've tried the chicken fried steak which has a great gravy. The chilaquiles were done different than what I'm used to but were perfect with the pork and the crab po boy was to die for, kinda think you need two because it's that good. The staff here is always super nice and I've never waited too long to sit. Love the outside seating."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places to go to when in the Vegas area.  This one happens to be in the Green Valley area but if you're in town it's worth the drive to try.  They have expanded the menu since they first opened.  I like to get their bagel with egg, cheese, and sausage.  It normally comes with bacon but I ask for the sub because I'm a sucker for homemade sausage.  This dish also comes with a side of potatoes.  For a nice vegetarian option, their \"meatless\" is a nice choice.  It's like an eggs Benedict but with fried green tomatoes instead of ham.   Service is nice and friendly.  I also bought a blueberry muffin to take home and really enjoyed it the following morning.  Not too sweet with plenty of blueberries.   A very good off the strip bfast option."}
{"text":"Came here with high hopes from the Yelp reviews but was disappointed by a number of off putting events. We arrived before another couple and to our shock the owner told the hostess to seat them first since he knew them personally. That soured my experience from the beginning because it was very blatant. They were seated one table away from us and another older couple was seated next to us. They were regulars too and it was very obvious they knew the owner since he stayed by their table to rant about everything. He talked about a one star Yelp review that complained about the service and how it kept him up all night...how he talked to the waitress about it and on and on he went. So here he is airing his dirty laundry to regular customers about his/her bad customer service issues when he just seated his own friends before us and he clearly knew we came in before them. He also comped his friends tab which is his choice but seriously no one needs to hear about these issues, not even your regulars because other people can hear you too! The menus were hard to read with tiny fonts printed on brown paper that were clearly very worn. There were items on the menu no longer being served.  I had the pork rib Benedict and it tasted good but the potatoes were very soggy and bland. The short stack of pancakes were flat and not the least bit fluffy. What's the point of having really good maple syrup when your pancakes taste that bad!?! Other people have complained about the same thing. Why doesn't he fix these items ?!? I know why. He's too busy gallivanting around the restaurant."}
{"text":"Awesome food!!! Had the Meatless Eggs Benedict, it was Fantastic!! Happy staff. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Had lunch on Valentine's Day with my daughter, service was great from beginning to the end. The food was tasty and the quality was excellent. The chicken sandwich was cooked to perfection with an amazing olive spread on top. The chopped salad had just the right amount of dressing and mixings that made a great combination. Also had the crab cakes topped with some guacamole, tasted very fresh. I want to come back and try more things. Only downfall was tables were very close together no intimate conversation unless you want the next table to hear."}
{"text":"Came here for my birthday brunch with my best friend. Got seated within 10 minutes, and the outdoor patio area was beautiful! There were umbrellas and a good amount of tables. They also had great music playing! The atmosphere overall was 10/10. The menu was HUGE! I believe it was 4-5 pages, with everything from Mexican inspired dishes to French inspired food. They also had 10+ varieties of mimosas and even a selection of Kombucha that sounded delicious. I had a peach mimosa (a Bellini) which was delicious! I had the fruit crepes and my friend had the Croque Monsieur. Both were delicious and plated beautifully! I can't remember a time both of us left our plates completely empty-I wiped up every last bit of sauce with my crepe! When the waiter came to ask how the food was, he took a look at our plates & laughed because we finished our food in record time.  The bill came out to less than $30, which was super affordable and worth every penny. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Outstanding breakfast spot!! Usually a short wait but can call on the way to put your name on the list.  Food is absolutely scrumptious, service polite and swift.  Pleasant atmosphere and comfortable seating.. Was our 1st time visiting this place but will definitely be back!!!Extremely pleased!!"}
{"text":"First I must say the service was excellent. The staff made all kinds of accommodations for my wife and I to sit outside. The food is made to order, I had chicken fried steak which is one of the best I've ever had in Las Vegas.The country chipotle gravy was to die for. My wife had the fried green tomato eggs Benedict. The Mamosa's let me begin by saying I had a prickly pear Mamosa, and a Guava Mamosa you need to try this. And the crème de la crème, the monkey bread was off the chain. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"The food is amazing!  If you like Chilequiles, I highly recommend getting that with egg on top. The only problem with this place (which is a GREAT problem to have) is that it's really hard to get into.  The first time we went we ended up leaving because it was a 90 minute wait."}
{"text":"So good! I went here with my fiancé and we couldn't decide what to get, everything looked amazing! We ended up getting the sausage platter to start and he got eggs Benedict and I got peaches and cream pancakes. Everything was very very good. I can't wait to go back sometime soon."}
{"text":"By far the best breakfast spot in green valley ranch that delivers consistently good food and service . An original innovative menu that really gets the details right. The crab Po Boy and eggs Benedict are delicious. What's more remarkable is how they are able to deliver reasonable service times in a kitchen that is far too small for the demand-- in particular on a Sunday for brunch. Outdoor seating is an enjoyable bonus when weather permits."}
{"text":"Food was pretty good, a little over priced for the amount given & I wish the servers would've checked on us a little more than just once every 15 min. I would still come back, food was tasty & flavorful. I gave 3 stars because of the service."}
{"text":"I went for brunch, very cute and cozy place. I think it seats about 20/30 people. I was greeted with a smile and friendly personalities. We were sat right away, I think it was around 11am.  Our waitress was very easy to talk to, attentive without being too over bearing, and well educated on the menu. I had the prickly pear mimosa, I was supposed that it was dark red in color, it was just the right amount of sweet and sour. I really liked it.  My friend had a guava mimosa, he said the same. For my meal I chose the egg tacos; eggs, guacamole, tomatoes, veggies on tortilla. Very satisfying. All the flavors were complimenting. I definitely wanted to try the different things on the menu. I'll be back to try them all."}
{"text":"Nothing but a bad experience. We came during brunch 2 weeks ago and had to wait around for a server to come by to take our order. The food came out to us in an okay time but the food was just that, okay. Not worth the price at all. Awkward blend of flavours in both dishes we ordered and we didn't go for the cheap plates either. We finished our food and not once did our server come by during that time to check on us. Instead we watched him talk to the staff (girls) in the kitchen. We were done with our food for 20 minutes and still no one to be seen...except for the manager who was very attentive to the table next to us for some reason. We tried flagging hostesses and servers down and we're met with nothing. Finally I had to hand a busser my credit card so I could gtfo. The server finally came with my card and check and never even apologized. Nothing about this place made me want to come back. Very disappointed."}
{"text":"bro. schmack. if you're reading this just go. now. Yelp is telling me this review is too short so I'm gonna add text here but the point is that you need to go to the restaurant. Their crepes and French toast are amazing"}
{"text":"One visit, wonderful menu. I am, however, stunned at closed over New Year. They are good enough that it is disappointing."}
{"text":"My husband and I hit this place first up right off the airplane when we first arrived in Vegas. Amazing!!  Get there early though.  Their monkey bread is delicious, but they run out fast due to high demand!  The most delicious thing we ate was the porkbelly Benedict. Yum yum yum!  We tried to go back before we left and all their baked goods were sold out and the line was an hours wait! . We should have gotten up earlier!  It would have been so worth it!  You will absolutely love every bite!:)"}
{"text":"I doubt I'll ever go back there.  They open at 7:30 a.m. and I was there about 8 a.m.  It was busy but not packed.  I ordered eggs Benedict and my food arrived almost cold, egg whites runny, potatoes so over boiled that they could easily have passed for mashed.  The folks next to me had cold food and an incorrect order as well plus they had actually come in for pancakes but were told the batter still wasn't ready 1/2 hour after opening.   Servers were very nice--no complaints there. On a Saturday morning be aware--there were children and babies at almost every table inside and some were running around and playing around the tables on the patio too.  It's apparently very family oriented on Saturday mornings. Not a relaxed place to eat nor worth the price in my opinion."}
{"text":"I probably would not have seen this place if I was not looking for it. It is located in a strip mall on the side of one of the buildings. I don't think it matters though. There always seems to be a wait.  I'll get right to it. The service was excellent. Our server Nicole asked us if it was our first time there and then gave us the story of where the chefs came from and how they came up with the menu. She was very friendly. The chef even delivered our lox and bagels to the table.  The food was outstanding!! The Lox and Bagel with a fried egg was delicious. The meatless eggs Benedict with fried green tomatoes and the eggs Benedict with short ribs where also amazing. The house potatoes where also very good. They were a bit spicy, just the way I like them.  I definitely recommend that you pay Kitchen Table a visit. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"I always enjoy Brunch here. However, today waiter was ehhh and they were out of chicken sausage and guava for the mimosas."}
{"text":"Great food, Great atmosphere and the prices are very good for the amount of food you get. Every time I've went I've loved everything I got, not only that but every thing my friends and family have gotten were amazing too. The hostesses were friendly and the servers were very helpful. It does get pretty packed so be patient when you just do a walk in, it's worth it!"}
{"text":"AS usual The Kitchen Tables delivers flavor filled delicious food.  The service is outstanding, atmosphere spectacular, overall AWESOME!  Must go if you have not tried it.  Will NOT be disappointed!"}
{"text":"As a newly 21 Vegas local, the thing I was looking forward to the most was brunch and this place exceeded my expectations! Our server Brooke was fantastic and attentive, and took great care of us. The manager Melanie came over to check on us and we had a great, genuine conversation with her. She sat down and we exchanged stories and laughs, which was a breath of fresh air from the constant \"get them in get them out\" food service mentality.  How could I forget to review the food! I ordered a peach mimosa which was fabulous, their coffee was so smooth and sweet already it didn't need any additives, and the country fried eggs Benedict was out of this world. Almost everything was made in house, including the biscuits and gravy which were the best I've ever had. At one point I literally said \"I wish my mouth was bigger so I could eat more. If I could give this place 100 stars I would. Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Great quality. Enjoyed the atmosphere. Will come back. A little pricey for breakfast, so be prepared, but worth the quality."}
{"text":"We decided to try this place based on the reviews we had seen.  We arrived and we were seated immediately.  There is seating outside but it was just too hot.  We reviewed the menu and we ordered the monkey bread as an appetizer.  We were a bit underwhelmed by this dish because it was served at best lukewarm  The monkey bread tasted fine but it would have been better if it had been served warmer.  My wife ordered pancakes with a side of bacon but not the jalapeno bacon.  I ordered the pork green chili with poached eggs.  My wife also ordered a mimosa and I ordered a cappuccino.  The meal itself was really good and we ate our fill.  My only suggestion here is to be sure the monkey bread is served warm."}
{"text":"Best Chicken Wings in town! The chicken strip are ginormous,  they have a ton of different flavors and sauces. All in all they have a great selection. Thet food wasn't too greasy which is perfect and their ranch dressing is on point. Noommm!"}
{"text":"Absolutely stunning killer everything: service, food and famous Chef's Nunez and Chavez serving up French Toast Foie Gras among other amazing brunch treats. Get here early before the monkey bread runs out, so killer!!  And don't forget about blackberry mimosas, yummy!!  If you're cool you'll dine here, but keep it on the down low, locals only :-)"}
{"text":"Just so people know that if you use the \"join waitlist\" on here to hold your place in line it doesn't work. I placed my name on the waitlist at 9:37am. They said our place in line would be ready at 10:13am. We waited until 10:00am and walked up to the host station to let them know we have arrived for our 10:13 hold. She stated it would be another 45 minutes from 10:00am to be seated. I said we use the Yelp \"join waitlist\" and it said our table would be ready at 10:13am. She said that's not how it works that you have to check in when you arrive and you will then be added to the list. Told her this makes no sense since waitlist is supposed to put our name on the list when we join so we are already in line, not to get here, check in, then be placed on the list. We would have waited almost an hour and a half to be seated when we could have walked in at 9:37, put our name on the waitlist with the host and probably would have been seated sooner.   Not sure if this location or if it was just the hosts that didn't understand how waitlist on Yelp works but I will not be using it again here!"}
{"text":"Awesome food and great staff even got to meet the owner it's a great place to have Sunday brunch"}
{"text":"This place is amazing.   I don't even know where to start. The service, the food, and ambience are wonderful.   We went to kitchen table on a recommendation from a friend for my sisters birthday. They accommodated a table for our party of 9 (7 adults and 2 kids).  Our server, Jean, was so nice and patient with us.  She made us feel welcome and waited for our whole group to arrive. All the food was delicious and it was a generous amount of food. We had a variety of muffins, a couple of mimosas, and different types of benedicts.   I would definitely come back. Can't wait to try some of their appetizers and maybe some caviar next time!!"}
{"text":"Great breakfast!  I just had the egg basket and it was not only delicious but it had a great presentation.  The waiter was friendly and informative.  This place is known to be VERY BUSY....expect a wait if you're going during peak business hours... I went on a Monday morning and it was wide open."}
{"text":"Really really good and different take on the normal breakfast which is what was so refreshing. Great ambiance with a little something Spanish flare on the protein dishes but also amazingly fluffy pancakes."}
{"text":"Delicious food chicken tortilla soup was amazing once again and I also had the turkey BLT on sourdough bread everything was just superb fast service super friendly will definitely be back again maybe next week!"}
{"text":"This place is wonderful. You walk in and see an array of freshly made pastries. Apparently, they make fresh pastries every night.   The atmosphere is really cute. It's casual and farm style. There is also a really nice patio set up. We will definitely be coming back to enjoy the patio seating!   Their entire menu looks delicious. We had mimosas, the country Benedict, the egg basket, and monkey bread. Every single thing tasted delicious."}
{"text":"This place is hidden in Green Valley but not too hard to find.  It's gave me a woodsy feel cause of all the oak tables and decor.  The wait was less than 5 minutes and the staff was very polite and attentive.  As I was seated along side wall on the couch I noticed how close the tables were so I was so scared I would knock someone's drink as I squeeze my way in between tables to sit on the couch.  So if you have a big purse or jacket, beware! The menu is reasonably priced for brunch and they have a great selection.  We decided in the prickly pear mimosa, house coffee and some monkey bread to start.  All very delicious! Our main course was the pork belly benedict and the avocado toast. Everything came out quick and it tastes good. I say good not great cause my pork belly had some very tough parts, not what I expected since it is \"belly\" but I would say half my Benedict was tough meat.  Made me chew quite a bit which was disappointing. Other than that the servers always refilled our water without us asking and checked on us regularly."}
{"text":"Amazing service, great food, owner is very very nice and genuine. Had the lox and bagel and my boyfriend had the country fried steak they were both amazing. So glad we choose to eat there. We had a table of 12 and they were more then willing to set it up. The way the run the kitchen is amazing it's pretty much an open style kitchen. Very clean environment and really good service."}
{"text":"Loved this place! This was such a cute brunch spot :) service was great and they were willing to create a special menu item for me from my own creation! They happily created these bananas foster chocolate chip pancakes for me and they were so yummy! Overall, very pleased:) would definitely come again for a savory option!  The reason for 4 stars??  The inside atmosphere seemed a little stuffy, but I enjoyed sitting outside.  I wish they had more pancake options..very few, that's why I created my own."}
{"text":"This brunch offers fresh farm/ ocean to table foods. The poke was super fresh and fresh fruits and vegetables were abundant! For brunch, they offer a bottomless mimosa option and some al carte options as well. Service was friendly, coffee was superb and the atmosphere was perfect!"}
{"text":"Food was wonderful. Sadly, everything said in past reviews about staff is true; poor attitudes & extremely slow."}
{"text":"Though the weather has grown more comfortable since our last visit we again chose to sit inside because of the wind.  My wife chose the peaches and cream pancakes that were fit for a king and large enough to feed his entire court.  Large bottles of two types of Noble syrup accompanied the order.  I chose the croque madame - challah bread, gruyere cheese, bechamel sauce, a thick slice of ham topped with a runny egg and a side salad of baby greens that featured highly addictive roasted, pickled tomatoes.  How good was my croque madame?  So good that I nearly croaked before I could lap up each and every morsel."}
{"text":"A friend recommended this place and it does not disappoint! We had the cinnamon twist, egg shoot"}
{"text":"Really welcoming and hip rustic atmosphere. Great to have an upscale casual brunch spot that isn't on The Strip. Service is extremely helpful and professional. The place gets busy really quick and there is somewhat limited seating, so the family dining table is nice to utilize the space and you can meet some new people too. Menu is creative, but it's backbone is American fare. Their benedicts come highly recommended and I decided to go with the Country Style Benedict with potato hash. It has a Southwestern spice to it, but it was really good. The biscuits underneath the eggs were fluffy and soaked up the sauce well. Our waiter was very polite and easy going. Checked to see how were doing and was very prompt with refilling our drinks. The crab and avocado cheese dip was also a highlight at Kitchen Table. I personally could have used more chips on the side, but not too big of a deal. The dip was super creamy and cheesy. Chunks of crab and half sliced avocado rounded out the flavors. The Monte Cristo was not too greasy and the Parisian ham was a nice thick cut. It was also drizzled with a fresh puree strawberry sauce which worked well all together. They also sell baked goods like muffins on to left side when you walk in. Overall, good service, great food, and cool atmosphere. Will be back to try more brunch yum yums."}
{"text":"Beautiful spot with a great outdoor dining option. When you walk in, you're immediately greeted with a large counter covered with pastries. Then, you get a look into the open kitchen with Chefs Antonio and Javier working right in front of you.  I've had several of their pastries and my favorite was definitely the Monkey Bread ($5). Sticky, gooey cinnamon balls compressed together in the form of a muffin. They're tender and perfectly sweet.  Mexican Hot Chocolate w/ Charred Marshmallows ($4): Uhh, YUM! Really good, slighly thick hot chocolate with a little kick of spice and roasted marshmallows. Also, very pretty.  Tostada ($8): Suckling pig, black beans, cilantro slaw, salsa, and quail egg. Delicious combination of toppings with a crispy tostada and flavorful salsa. It was also refreshing with the slaw.  Steel Cut Oatmeal ($8): Brown sugar, dates, and toasted walnuts. My friend absolutely loved the oatmeal citing it the best oatmeal she's ever had! And she was right - it's so yummy!  Duck and Cheese Omelette ($13): Housemade mac and cheese and duck confit. The creaminess from the mac and cheese is amazing with the fluffy eggs and duck. This is far from being a simple omelette, yet not overly complicated.  Pork Belly Benedict ($15): Chipotle BBQ, poached eggs, and jalapeño hollandaise on English muffin. The pork belly is great, though I could've done without the BBQ. Solid benedict overall.  Warning: It is quite spicy! The accompanying potatoes were delish.  Chorizo Crêpe ($12): Roasted poblano, chorizo, green chile, Oaxacan cheese, and crema. WOW! I adore savory crepes and this one really blew me away. There was so much depth of flavor and everything just really came together. Really amazing.  Foie French Toast ($21): Amaretto batter, seared foie, caramelized pears, and candied nuts. There's really nothing to dislike about this dish. A delicious french toast (Hello, amaretto!) with a creamy seared foie. I LOVE FOIE.  Smoked Salmon and Caviar ($14): Caviar, smoked salmon, sunny side-up quail eggs, blini, crema, dill oil, and micro greens. More of my favorite foods (smoked salmon and caviar) and I loved the combination of everything on the blinis. Great little bites.  Bottom line: The food is delicious. The menu is vast. There are touches of creativity everywhere. They're killing the breakfast and lunch scene!"}
{"text":"Great food and huge portions. Very pretty interior that makes for a wonderful breakfast"}
{"text":"Had a wonderful breakfast everything was very unique with unique flavors. Love the eggs benedict and the pork dishes are all wonderful."}
{"text":"I took a group there since I heard how good it was. Well, it is really hidden with very little signage. We waited an hour for a table (on a Tuesday morning). They would not take reservations. We wanted to eat outside because that area was empty because it was a little windy but they refused to serve us outside. I asked twice. The noise was terrible with kids screaming, etc. Some of my group left because it took so long and some texted and said they would not show up because they had been looking and just gave up and went home.   Finally we were seated and had an excellent young man for a waiter. The food was good and not the traditional breakfast food. Everything is cooked to order. That is only why I gave it 2 stars."}
{"text":"My family and I stopped in for brunch and the food was like a religious experience. We shared what we ordered, including: waffles, ham and cheese crepe, and the Blue Collar breakfast (eggs, bacon, potatoes, toast). Everything was truly phenomenal right down to the toast. I'll need to hit the gym to make up for what I've done, but it was worth it.   The wait today for 3 was 20 minutes, so not bad at all. It's not a very large space. I can imagine this will be one of those places where you simply have to wait quite a while to get in as it becomes more known, so best to budget time for it."}
{"text":"Don't go in the summer.  Restaurant was 85 degrees, they ran out of ice too. Very difficult to enjoy the food as I sat there sweating.   Food is truly amazing but the restaurant needs to be upgraded for comfort."}
{"text":"Really nice place. Loved the ambiance. Outdoor seating area is well done. Great service and menu. A lot of mimosa choices. The egg white and veggie frittata was outstanding."}
{"text":"Definitely worth the wait!  Give this place a break people!  It's a neighborhood restaurant, doesn't have 200 seats like franchise places.  The service was phenomenal and the food was outstanding.  The mimosas were were so fresh!  Looking forward to trying other menu items."}
{"text":"This place is delicious! The staff is friendly and very helpful in helping explain the menu! The coffee cups are super cool but maybe a little too big so your coffee cools down too quickly but that doesn't affect how yummy the food is! The traditional French toast was so good and the bourbon maple syrup for it is the bomb!! We had the pork belly green chili with poached eggs and chips and it was very tasty... This is a great breakfast place away from the strip. I highly recommend this. Also another perk ....it's clean and the decor is nice as well"}
{"text":"On 9:30 am on Sunday morning I walked into Kitchen Table for brunch. I was told there was a 20 minute wait which was fine because I was able to have a bomb bloody beer with bacon and tamarind. SO DELICIOUS. We asked for first available, but when we were seated inside, we decided that outside looked so peaceful and would rather be seated on the patio. Monique was super pleasant about giving us a seat outside even though we didn't initially ask. The food was excellent (empanadas and egg Mac kitchen)! Great place for brunch."}
{"text":"This place is AHHH MAZIN! It's well worth the wait! The service was excellent and the food outta sight!! Also affordable!!"}
{"text":"This place was amazing!!!! It is small and cozy but the service and food was amazingly great!   We arrived party of 2. Greeted by a nice lady who checked us in. On the weekends, be ready to wait 30-1hr. It's packed and people are waiting in the entrance lobby. It was windy cold today so no one was sitting outside. In the waiting area there's a coffee shop!!!!!! It was worth waiting when you can get coffee. So I got a macchiato. It was good.  We were seated and the menu was pretty diverse. I'm like caviar? Lol I'll get the chilaquiles. The chilaquiles were delicious, way better than lindo Michoacán. This are my favorite and not willing to try anything else since how amazing they are. We also tried the breakfast taquitos which were spicy and amazing. The buttermilk pancakes are best in class. The best pancakes I ever had. We had a guava mimosa and a black berry mimosa.   Overall, Amazing brunch! My favorite brunch spot in town. It's worth the drive and the waiting sacrifice."}
{"text":"A friend of mine kept raving about this place, so I decided it was time for me to check it out. I brought my food road dog with me, my mom. We enjoy checking out new places in the valley. especially if they're in Henderson! Score! Seems like all the good places are outside this growing town, but bit by bit we're getting more specialty eateries, like Kitchen Table.  When you walk in, the inside is very small, but cute and country like. There is not really a lot of seating inside, but they do have some outside. The tables are big enough to hold your drink and food, not like you need to shuffle things around to make room.  Now, onto the food.  I order the vegetarian hash, roasted seasonal squash, peppers, potatoes,garlic confit, fresh herbs and 2 eggs, but I don't get eggs. Still tastes so fresh and delicious. For some reason I love eating the garlic cloves and find myself saving some for last. Toast is also served with it, which adds to the deliciousness. One morning, I felt a little adventurous and ordered the Mexican hot chocolate.  The lady said it has a \"little kick.\" I'm not sure what was \"little\" about that kick because my mouth was on fire.  I usually have a high tolerance for spice, but this completely caught me off guard.  Definitely a wake-me-up! It comes with marshmallows, but I didn't get them.  Although it kicked my butt, it was still good.   Staff here are always friendly and check up on you to see how you're doing.  My mom and I really enjoy coming here to eat.  I may eat the same thing every time, but the vegetarian hash is just too good to switch from haha! The prices here are not too bad either. Between my mom's coffee, her meal and mine, its a little over $20.  Not too bad!"}
{"text":"I was here a couple of weeks ago with my mother who was visiting from New Mexico and our experience was excellent to say the least! Food was great and the bottle of champagne deal is a steal! Our server seemed overwhelmed and had a hard time keeping up with her tables but Chef Pedro* came out to check on our table and made sure we had everything we needed. He definitely understands what the food and beverage industry is all about, he elevated our brunch experience to a 5 ! Will definitely go back to Kitchen Table"}
{"text":"Great food. Pretty unhealthy though. Coffee is good. Ambience is fantastic. Owner cruises around saying saying hi to everyone. That's fun. 90's music playlist normally rocking.   Way understaffed. You have to wave the servers down, repeatedly get orders wrong, meals can come out 20 mins apart. And to wait over an hour for food has happened to me several times. Sometimes the owner comps that check when there is a screw up, sometimes not. But seriously, you need at least a 1.5 hour window here."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Questionable management. I was just so confused by this ice queen they have as a manager. Not sure what she had against me and my family but we had a small mishap at the POS system with our international card and ended up paying through other means. However, the young manager whose a short woman decided to disrespect my husband and then disrespect me with condescending remarks in front of the staff and other patrons. Honestly I have plans to eat there again, but it'll just be to give the tip to whom deserves it. Not sure why the manager was begging me three times to leave a tip, maybe it was for her. But after the way she treated me and my family my only tip for her is \"more bees with honey\""}
{"text":"Fresh deliciousness every time! Great service.. but it gets busy fast! Pork belly benny is awesome!"}
{"text":"Place is always amazing. Food is reasonably priced and delicious. Service is great but the wait can get long on weekends and holiday. Check in on yelp and save yourself some time."}
{"text":"I loved this place, and wished I could pack it up and bring it back home to Texas with me.   Started with an orange mimosa which was delicious and not made with the cheapest champagne available. Ended up with French toast with flavored syrups to choose from (I highly recommend the bourbon and vanilla) and bacon still sizzling in a cast iron skillet.   We definitely ordered more than we needed because the portions were so big, but we boxed them up and took them with us and they were gone by the end of the day.  Service was wonderful - our waiter made great recommendations and answered all of our questions attentively. Even the kids.   There are pastries to buy at the bakery at the front of the store as well. We skipped them but had many regrets later.   I wouldn't hesitate to go here again, take my friends, or recommend it to anyone. Just a great breakfast/brunch spot."}
{"text":"Food was delicious, ambiance relaxing and the staff was incredible! Definitely recommend checking it out, we had avocado toast and eggs in a basket! Both were delicious. Great patio space and energy if you're looking to have brunch!"}
{"text":"The Kitchen Table is 100% my favorite breakfast spot in town! Tasty cocktails and coffee and they have so many delicious breakfast items to choose from on their menu.  If the weather is good it is definitely worth sitting outside. Had the Egyptian - it was bomb! Excellent food and service. I recommend checking it out!"}
{"text":"Their food was fantastic! Excellent flavors to every dish and a great staff. The tortilla soup was very good with whole slices of avocado, I will be back for anothet bowl."}
{"text":"We love coming here on the weekends for a beautiful patio breakfast experience! The food is so good and the mimosas are DELISH. However, i can't give it 5 stars because a couple of the hosts are less than friendly and the service is never incredible."}
{"text":"The food was great! Portion sizes were very filling. I could not give it five stars because our waitress I felt like she kept forgetting about us and we had another waitress step in and help us."}
{"text":"This place never disappoints.  From the veggie hash, to French toast to the huevos tacos, everything is always fresh and consistent.    The service is top notch, and the place is clean.  Weekends usually have a 30+ minute wait (but totally worth it) but weekdays aren't bad.   Craft kitchen was our go to breakfast place until kitchen table opened.  They won't us over."}
{"text":"I made the reservations to hold our spot in line. There were 3 parties ahead of us once we arrived and it took over 20 minutes to be seated. I can understand this though because they closed off the outdoor seating because some dark clouds rolled in. I was disappointed by the fact that the first 3 flavors of mimosas my friend and I tried to order they were out of. Also, the Bloody Mary the server said was only served at their other location so I was bummed with that. I ordered the smoked salmon with caviar and it was delicious. I have no complaints for the food. My friend ordered the smoked salmon Benedict and she loved it as well."}
{"text":"This place is a MUST visit when in the area!  Recommended by a friend.  Foie Gras French toast?  Yes please!  Next time in town, this will be a for sure visit!  The menu looks really simple, and presentation of the dishes appeared that care was taken in preparation.  Taste was incredible, and quality of the ingredients were certainly there.  I'm a huge fan!"}
{"text":"This restaurant was recommended to me & it was so good that I went 3 days in a row for breakfast & brought a friend on 2 of those days! Everything was delicious!"}
{"text":"If you have more than two people than don't bother going you won't get seated! And anyone that shows up after you with two or less will get seated before you. I won't go back service was terrible. I didn't even get to try the food and this was the second time I've been there and left. Won't bother for a third. Tried to get my comment removed I'll just repost it!!  Edited 5/11/16 gave it another chance! First off the hostess rolled her eyes at me when she found out there were 4 of us and had to set up a table. My apologies for having a family!! So the table she set up for me and my family was kind of a joke. Imagine myself at one end of the table and then my wife and two boys on the side in an L configuration! Wasn't happy but I let it roll. Hostess then decided to take out drink order. I opted for just the water, my wife did the same and we ordered my boys two Apple juices. She came back two time to confirm what we were drinking. Really!! Half the drink order was on the table!   Our waiter was cool and the food was actually pretty good. A little expensive but good! I got the taco's huevos, my wife got pork chili verde, and we got the boys some sausage and a cinnamon bun and a muffin. My wife's was the best and the sausage was super good. The cinnamon bun was a little undercooked I think some might like hat I don't and the muffin while my wife liked it the kids and I didn't. I got a hint of dishwater rag in it. I originally gave this joint 1 star, I have since changed it to 3 only for the good food that we had and our waiter who took care of us! But the hostess gave terrible customer service and was super rude and obviously doesn't know what she's doing. Still wouldn't recommend because of her!!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Country egg Benedict and short rib Benedict were A+ amazing.  They don't take reservations as is customary with most brunch places so expect a line during peak hours.  Two chefs here...one is Mexican inspired and the other does the French side. Both sides are delicious! Chilaqiles are supposed to be the most popular dish on the menu but we went with the French side because we were in the mood for Benedict.  Our Benedict came out ($13-15) and it was super delicious. Easily one of the best Benedicts I've ever had.   Country Benedict came with this huge chicken fried steak with jalapeño gravy on top of biscuits.  Short rib Benedict had this arugula type veggie with English muffins and the softest short rib meat with an awesome Benedict sauce.  Believe me everything was delicious and we ate it all so fast. One Benedict order is huge and could probably feed 1.5-2 people.  I could not reccomend this place more...ambiance was so nice and the smell of the whole roasting pig in the outdoor smoker really fires up your appetite.   Great concept and I'll be coming back!"}
{"text":"The Good:  Coffee above average and the bread is delicious.  I only ordered breakfast twice here once for pancakes and the other standard eggs bacon and toast.  The Bad:  Service way too slow.  The waitress looked stressed out and even confused at times.  My potatoes were cold and my eggs were not cooked properly.    The price was $24 for just myself.  Coffee, OJ, and 2 eggs and 3 slices of bacon.  Really?  Would recommend IHOP before going here."}
{"text":"Was taken here by a friend today. What a great place. The help was great. They couldn't have been more friendlier and helpful.   Had the eggs in a basket which was awesome. The seasoning was perfect, the eggs were cooked to perfection. A great dish.   My friend had the peaches and creme pancakes which were also great.   Coffee is $3 for a large mug. It was perfect temperature with a full robust and fresh taste.   Met Javier the owner on the way out. After meeting him you could see why the help was friendly and great. Highly recommended a trip here and look forward to returning myself."}
{"text":"The monkey bread is a delicious way to start your breakfast or brunch off right. It's a small cast iron skillet of warm yeast rolls covered in a cinnamon glaze. Moist and bready.   I ordered the vegetarian hash as my \"main\" breakfast based on our server's recommendation and I'm glad I listened. The hash was roasted veggies including corn, peppers, onions, zucchini, and potatoes. There was a ton of flavor because of all the spices used. The hash was topped with two perfectly pouched eggs.   Deliciously, flavorful comfort food!"}
{"text":"Great spot for breakfast or lunch. It's busy because it's good and you have to be willing to wait for a table. It's also pricey but it's scratch food and delicious. Kinda crowded and noisy inside as well. But would go back for sure."}
{"text":"This place was so good delicious the food was amazing the people are so nice and the chef greets everybody thank you it was amazing"}
{"text":"Listen, I really want to like this place. The food is good (when I get to finally have what I want), the coffee is good, and the location is great. But I have found myself disappointed time and time again. First, and probably the biggest issue, they run out of biscuits every time I go there. Biscuits. At a brunch spot. At 11am and 1pm I get told the same garbage and I can't enjoy biscuits and gravy and multiple other dishes on the menu. The menu is a mile long, it's no wonder they can't prep enough for a full service. Second, the man who I presume is a manager seasons the food right before the dishes go out. He does this without gloves which is fine if that's all he's doing. But unfortunately he opens the patio door, carries small children, and touches customers and chairs and then continues to salt my meal. Lastly, the service is spotty. My boyfriend and I were practically yelled over our entire meal as our server was trying to resolve another customers complaints. Also, it is so packed in there that if you are the unlucky patron to sit by the patio door you are constantly being run into and disturbed because the table is in a terrible spot. Another thing, the music was so loud today I had to yell across my table to have a conversation. Like I said this place has great potential but has some big kinks to work out. Today I just left after my coffee to enjoy brunch at a more consistent spot."}
{"text":"Pricy. No omelettes. Would not seat us outside due to \"not enough servers\" when there were a total of 5 occupied tables inside. Once was enough."}
{"text":"Called to make a reservation at this restaurant put on hold for 10 minutes only for them to come back and say we don't take reservations for the day of the day you want to eat. Never have I ever heard of such a weird rule won't be going there again."}
{"text":"Yummy! I have been wanting to try this place for a while and finally made it out this past Friday. We went around 10am and there was a 5 minute wait-not bad. But if you wanted to sit outside it was more like 20 minute wait. I'm guessing in the summer that wait time will be reversed.   We decided to get the deviled eggs as a starter. They ended up being not like deviled eggs. The eggs were hard boiled and the mayo was on top instead of all mixed together. It was interesting. Tasty, but not my favorite.   I liked the decor inside. We went for breakfast and I decided to get the pork belly Benedict. They smoke their pork right on site outside which I thought was really cool. I liked this take on a benedict. It was really tasty and the jalapeño hollandaise made it the right amount of spicy. I'd suggest this to anyone that likes eggs benedict and wants to be more adventurous.   I would come here again and try some if their more dessert offerings because that looked good too!"}
{"text":"Referred by a friend and was very impressed. Love the swanky feel of the space. Some might think it is too cramped but I really liked being close to other tables like I was with neighborhood friends. The food was wonderful and the presentation was very unique. Very reasonably priced and very friendly and nice staff. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"My friend is a local to Vegas, and had dined at Kitchen Table, previously. She mentioned it as a delicious breakfast option, for us to hit, before heading back to Orange County. I pulled the restaurant up on Yelp, and the decision to visit, was easily made, based on what I read and saw (via photos).  Kitchen Table, is tucked away, in the corner of a shopping center. They have indoor and outside seating. Restrooms are on site, of course. Upon entering, they'll likely be a short wait. The counter near the hostess stand, had assorted pastries, rolls, and other bakery-style goodies, to purchase. The decor was warm and inviting and the interior tables are wooden slats, with chairs and comfortable bench-style seats.  The menu is presented on a Staples clipboard. Kinda cheesy/funny, but ok. My boyfriend selected the Bacon and Egg Shooters, for us to indulge in, for an appetizer. It was good, but a tad too much mayonnaise, for me. It was also slippery underneath, so some of mine spilled, before I could transfer it to my small plate.  I chose the Pork Belly Bene, since eggs benedict is a go-to dish for me, and pork belly isn't an enemy either! It was presented well and tasted delicious. It had a slight, spicy kick to it, but was manageable. The english muffins were thin (thankfully) and seasoned wonderfully.  My boyfriend chose the Chorizo Omelette. It was so fulling and the chorizo they used, was kinda sweet, versus spicy. Again, we liked it (yes, I had a bite)!  My dear friend, ordered the Ham & Cheese Crepe. Great choice for those who want a lighter option (filling, carb wise). The sauce was terrific.  We'll return here easily, and also feel confident about recommending, to others."}
{"text":"This is by far my favorite brunch spot. Super far for me but worth the drive. I've taken so many people here just to have an excuse to come. Lol.  It's quaint, pretty small. Love the decor. Pretty homey and food is always perfect! You smell that pork outside a lot too or the fresh baked goods!   My favorite dish will always be the belly bene!! Pork belly Benedict all friggin day! I can eat those everyday! A hint of spice but a punch in flavor! Also, grab a monkey bread!"}
{"text":"I've been here a few times. First 2-3 times were real good. The food came out delicious. However.. the last time I went there with a close friend of mine.. I wanted to show this place off.  Unfortunately the experience was a bit of an embarrassment for me. The dishes that we ordered were both overcooked.. the meat was burnt and I had to ask the waitress to take both of our plates back.   They replace our dishes with something else.. but it was sort of an embarrassing experience for me. Don't think she will trust me when I tell her to come join me at another good food place."}
{"text":"Sunday brunch was great, they a guy playing live music which it made it special too!. If you are like me, low carb diet, not much to choose from...but that is my problem.  The blackberrie mimosa is yum!!!!!!"}
{"text":"Ordered country fried steak benedict & monkey bread. Benedict was awesome other than the biscuit, was a bit soggy I like my biscuits a little on toasted side. Monkey bread is . Too bad this place is too far from my house or I would be binging here every morning."}
{"text":"Great restaurant. I went on a rainy day. I believe they may have outside seating, but not that day. The inside of the restaurant is kinda small in size. The tables are a bit tight. The atmosphere there was happy and fun. Great brunch place! I wish I had a mimosa that day! Our food was packed with flavor! Maybe a little too much?! But we still enjoyed it. The chefs come out and talk to everyone. This is the place to go to just have fun and eat great food. But don't mind the table next door because you're close enough to hear their conversations."}
{"text":"I willl start by saying my review is based solely on the customer service. I have eaten here twice and was happy with my meals, the first time I had a salad which was ok and the second time I had the pork belly eggs Benedict. The pork belly was a little overwhelming but I suppose that is what it's supposed to do. Overall a good plate, perhaps just not for me as it was my first meal of the day and was too heavy. My one star review was given because this past Monday around 11 am I called to place a phone order and was told that they don't take orders over the phone and that I must walk into the restaurant to place my to go order. I thought that was a bit strange but I live 1 block away and decided to go in anyways. As I arrived I was not greeted by anyone but was directed to the bakery section by the host to place my to go order. Once again I had to greet the bakery host as she stared at me with a blank face. I told her that I wanted to place a to go order and that I needed to see the menu. She informed me that they do not offer take out. At this point I'm extremely frustrated and annoyed that once again my requests cannot be made. I explained to her that the hostess who answered my call said they will only take \"to go orders\" if present in the restaurant. She did not offer any type of apology she just explained why they do not offer it. Apparently they have received complaints about their food being soggy with take out orders. I  completely understand that as all of their plates are very very saucy, almost overwhelmingly saucy which is why I've always requested all sauces to be placed on the side. I was hoping that she would accommodate me as I was misinformed by their staff and was only requesting scrambled eggs and plain pancakes- absolutely no way for there to be sogginess. Once again no apology she just replied, \"I can't do that.\" I am not an unreasonable person, I am well aware that people make mistakes. Trust me when I say an apology and a thank you would have gone a long way. She made me feel bad and let me leave upset and disappointed. She clearly has no respect for where she works and made the establishment look very bad. Living a block away this should be my go to breakfast/lunch restaurant as they have a nice patio area but after this mistreatment I will not be back. Such a shame, all of this could have been avoided with better customer service and perhaps a crack of a smile.   To the owner- we can see and appreciate that you have spent a lot of time on the menu and decor, there is no reason why you should lose what would be a loyal customer because your staff offers no customer service skills what so ever. Time to clean up shop."}
{"text":"Watch out now!  New hot spot on the block!  Prepare for a long wait, since the interior is pretty small and with limited hours, this place is always going to be packed.   I'm sure the unique menu is what draws everyone in.  It certainly was what sold me.  Duck confit AND mac n cheese?  Yes yes please!  Caviar on blinis?  Oh you fancy.  Doughnut sandwich?  Donut ask me again!  Inside looks like a flood of community quaintness - oak tables, open aired, modern, earthy.  We opted to sit out back in the patio after our server set up heating lamps for us.  Best seat evahhh!  We were the only ones out there.. all mine!  Just how I like it!  Loved the patio space.  Loved all the teeny-bopper pop song covers by dudes pumping out of their stereos.  Guy version of Miley Cyrus's \"Party in the USA\"?!  How can anyone say no to that flaming awesomeness?  Even though we were the only ones out on the patio, that didn't mean service suffered.  Our server checked on us several times and even had a chat with my \"celebrity\" friend about his artwork.  We ordered: * Country Benedict (added Foie Gras) *   You can add foie gras to anything for $12 so my friend opted to do so.. but $12 for a tiny sliver on only ONE out of the two benedicts?  \"What the foie?!\" indeed.. seems a little jippy to me.  Might as well not get it at all and support PETA.  If you know how they produce foie gras, you would feel as guilty as I did after I took a bite.  Besides the guilt, the benedicts itself had a nice combination of textures - crunchy fried steak, flaky biscuit, creamy sauce, and richness from that perfectly poached egg.  * Pork Belly Benedict *   Way better flavor than the Country Benedict, but lacks the different textures.  Delicious, but after the first benedict, my palette needed a cleansing from all the bold sauces and mundane, mushy texture.  The side house potatoes did not help.  I wish I'd swapped out half of my potatoes for a salad instead.  Two plates of benedicts is enough to fill us up and some.  Considering how heavy the meal was, the portion size was pretty generous.  I had a nice brunchy experience and their menu is definitely intriguing.  Can't wait to try more..  But no foie this time of course.  Ducks are cute!  Support animal rights!"}
{"text":"I Love this place! The menu is creative.. I have been here many times and always bring my friends so I have had a chance to try alot of the menu. I'm always amazed at how much I love every new dish I try. The Owner Javier is always there with a warm smile, making you feel comfortable, asking how everything is n making every guest feel special. I always recommend The Kitchen Table to Everyone. It's always a Mouthgasm!"}
{"text":"My friend raved about this place and brought me in for Lunch.  Ordered the country Benedict. The meat was tough and inedible.  They didn't have any of the pastries except for banana muffin...which I chocked on.  May go back, but will try something different."}
{"text":"What a cute spot to grab brunch.  We arrived around 12 and the wait was said to be 45 minutes.  Luckily only 10 had passed and we were able to be seated.  We were seated at the end if a long table next to another family.    Service was great.  Raphael was very nice at helping give us some recommendations.  We ordered the Social Bucket which came with a bottle of sparkling wine and juice.  We also had the Monkey Bread, Chilaquiles, and the Pork Belly Benedict.  Pretty plating and delicious.  Will definitely order the monkey bread and pork belly benedict again.  The chilaquiles was somewhat spicy, great flavor just know it has a kick!   Can't wait to brunch here again and try some new dishes.    The menu had lots if pastries and specialty coffees.  Wouldn't mind grabbing a pastry and coffee in the morning with some good company too ."}
{"text":"Let me say, I might give this restaurant another chance but here is my experience.   Keep in mind that I paid over, $40 for breakfast. The table where we sat had cocktail napkins.  I tried to flag down the waitress because 2 tables over had cloth napkins, the chef interviend and got the napkins saying his order of napkins had not arrived. WHY NOT GO TO A GROCERY STORE AND BUY 5 PACKS OF NAPKINS.  The waitress served ice tea AND water and 1 straw. The English muffin was stone cold and when I asked for butter I was told that their clientele didn't use butter. My eggs in a basket had salad on top with bacon strips over that and hot peppered potatoes on both sides, very nuovo but all was cold.  The menu words were so small it was hard to read. The bathroom fixture was falling off the wall.  In conclusion, the attention to detail is lost here.  You are paying for better attention to details."}
{"text":"A diamond in the rough. Very hard to find, but 200% worth it. Love all the Benedict options. Great local hole in the wall."}
{"text":"Not enough vegetarian options. Wayyyy too much pork. I expected more of a forward-thinking menu from a new, cute little place! I got the meatless benedict and it really wasn't seasoned that well. But! The monkey bread was really good and it gave me a sugar rush haha."}
{"text":"I sat outside in the shade with quite a lovely little breeze. The environment is perfect for a brunch date with myself. To start, I had just one peach and creme pancake. The homemade whipped creme is to die for with a little drizzle of the Tahitian vanilla bean & Egyptian chamomile blossom matured maple syrup. THIS WILL NOT DISAPPOINT.  It was a challenge not to eat the whole thing before I dove into the Chilaquiles, which were good. They might have been even better but I'm afraid I slightly spoiled my meal with the decadent pancake . Overall, I have no regrets and want to come back for the breakfast tostada or taquitos and maybe try this foie French toast....  UPDATE: I came back for more. This time I brought my brother and his wife (always better to bring more people for sharing and trying more options). We had the avocado toast, salmon caviar, taquitos, kale salad, and chorizo omelette (not pictured). The toast was BOMB and it comes with a side salad that has a bacon dressing.  The taquitos were pretty good but you should ask for a little more of the green sauce. Kale salad was a perfect compliment with the fig, and the salmon we had for a starter was a good way to get your pallet going. It sounds like the chorizo omelette was okay (I didn't try it and the egg looked a little flat). To be honest, my first visit to Kitchen Table was better. I'm still giving it 5 stars because I enjoy the outside seating."}
{"text":"Hendersons hidden secret! Just had my birthday brunch. So happy!!! I couldnt ask for a better birthday. The service was awesome. The service was good. Food was tasty. I fe lt like I was being catered to. I feel happy and thankful. This was the start to my incredible day and i have had the best day so far. A big thanks to the manager and our waitress for taking every step to ensure it was worth it. We will see you again for sure÷!!"}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere. Wait staff very friendly. Wide selection of food. Our breakfast was very good. Will return. Best part you can check in on yelp and don't have to wait."}
{"text":"For appetizer, we started with the bacon and egg shooter. Those were tastey but average. They were composed of a hard boiled egg, with some mayo, pickled jalapeño and bacon bits. Like I said, it was tastey, but left me wishing there was something else to it.  After we went to the avocado toast and the pork belly benny. I was told the toast was good (I didn't get to try it) but the pork belly benny was amazing. It had a nice kick and left me licking the plate at the end. I am already thinking about going back tomorrow to get another one.  The mimosas are great. They use Wycliffe which is a horrible excuse for champagne (it costs like $1.50 per bottle to the restaurant) but the mixers made it delicious. Try the blackberry mimosa. I wanted to just set up an IV of it directly into my blood stream. The mixed berry was good too, but the blackberry was much better.  Service was very good. We were created with a warm smile when we arrived and were seated quickly-- it may have helped that we used the yelp check in for wait list. Service was non intrusive and added to the experience.  Try sitting outside. During the right time of year, it is beautiful. There's plenty of umbrellas and covers which make it so you'll be nice and comfortable.   I can't wait to go back!!"}
{"text":"Wow this place is amazing ! Everybody is so nice & the food is very tasteful. Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"Loooove this place! Fav menu item is the short rib benny but have had several other items and all delicious. There is usually a wait but they always give an accurate wait time. Service is fast and super nice. Mimosas and all the juice are so good as well as any latte on their menu.   This is my fav breakfast place in Henderson"}
{"text":"This place is so cute we went in for brunch and the food was great the service was great and the coffee was awesome too  . I didn't even need syrup for the white chocolate french toast and the manager was really sweet and welcoming . We'll definitely be back . Cannot recommend this place enough !!"}
{"text":"Horrible service ! Which makes me sad because I love the food here ! Me and my husband went this morning around 11am and were given a 20 minute wait . Due to the heat they were seating people inside only however the inside was just as hot as the outside ! After waiting  45 minutes we noticed people were just walking in getting seated before us after we were waiting way past our estimated wait time ! On top of it staff was just diddling around , chatting with each other and looking at their phones after we and several other people were waiting passed the beyond given time frame . My husband went to ask what the deal was and they gave us another 30 minute more wait time !!!!!!! ARE YOU KIDDING ???!! Bad service ! Get better staffing !!!! Never going back !"}
{"text":"Overall a great solid brunch place.  Even though there's nothing too unique about the food, and even there was a 45 min waiting list this place is a 4 stars brunch spot.   1. Food- I got the avocado toast which was tasty and the toast reminded me of a good Challah bread, with 3 egg small omelette, green salad and a side of chicken breads. Overall extremely yummy dish! 2. Service- besides of the waiting list outside the service was quick and professional.  3. Price- I must say that it was a nice surprise! Extremely affordable and yet high quality of product!  The one thing I would say is that the portions weren't that big. Honestly for someone like myself with a big appetite I would probably want and extra side dish."}
{"text":"Deliciousness!!! Great service, cool atmosphere, beautiful patio seating and many great choices on the menu! Will definitely be back!!!"}
{"text":"I almost hate to review this place because it is so good and is getting so popular--but it deserves the credit.  The food is different and delicious!  The servers are friendly and know a lot about the food.  If you want something unique, try it (but it also serves regular breakfast fare)  Everything I have ordered tastes like it could be served in the fanciest French restaurant rather than a neighborhood place.  My only comment would be get a bigger restaurant, you are going to need it.  Luckily there is a large outdoor area so on a nice day, the size of the place can double.  Awesome food and service!"}
{"text":"The pork belly hash blew me away! All of the other dishes my friends and I ordered were excellent as well including the pastrami hash and the pancakes. I love that the mimosas come with real fruit smoothie mix to mix yourself"}
{"text":"Once again this was not a disappointment. We discovered the chicken fried steak a month ago and this time we both ordered it. The food is always wonderful.  The only drawback is occasional the service is slow, but we are usually there quite early.  We will return again and again."}
{"text":"The food is creative and extremely enjoyable. The atmosphere intensified the quality of the restaurant as a whole. I would definitely recommend this place. The owner even came out and took a photo with me!"}
{"text":"Could not be more happy with my visit here. I live maybe a half mile away and I will come back even just for the coffee (salted Carmel latte was delicious.) the staff including the chef? Were very kind, friendly and funny, checking on all the tables and even seating people. I had the duck and cheese omelette which is duck confit with housemade mac and cheese it has to be one of my favorite dishes in town. Even the sides and jelly were perfect. The qual egg tostada with cilantro is something I would get every time. My boyfriend got the pastrami sandwich which had the best meat, sauerkraut and housemade pickles. The guava mimosa was fantastic as well!"}
{"text":"I've been here several times and something has really changed.  We were seated next to the kitchen and the girl that would pull the food out of the window and dress the plate had long curly hair that she kept moving it out of her way.  She had gloves on but she would touch her Hair with the gloves.  She also would deliver the food to the tables outside wearing her gloves and would touch the door handle etc and then would return with the same gloves on and continue dressing the plates.  I think they need to check their filter on their dishwasher because their plates have An odor as though it needs to be cleaned.    My chilaquilas were served cold.  The beans and pulled pork were cold I'm certain that they had not been heated up properly before serving.  The pork appeared to be more like boiled not their normal from their bbq.  Maybe their under new management and someone needs to tighten things up."}
{"text":"You need to hire a new hostess who knows how to run a dining room. Walked in this morning at 10am and was quoted a 15 minute wait. No problem, we waited outside. 30 minutes passed by and when I went back to ask how much longer, she told me about 45 minutes. Wait, what?? Her exact quote was \"I apologize but I didn't realize we had reservations in front of you and it's not like I can make people get out of their seats\". That's not what I was asking her to do. But she had the WORST attitude. Good restaurants start with good service the second you walk through the door and unfortunately these business owners need to realize that and do some more training with the blonde."}
{"text":"Seriously my favorite place to go for brunch !!! The food is amazing and never disappoints and the service is always exceptional !"}
{"text":"My experience here today was awesome!  Breakfast should be flavorful and the chef at Kitchen Table has accomplished this!  No salt and pepper shakers needed for the food here.  Spiced and seasoned to make your mouth melt.  Good job!!"}
{"text":"Wow! So glad I read the reviews and stopped in for breakfast. Service is great, only had to wait 15 minutes but it was well worth it. My fiancé had the chile Colorado and he loved it. I believe they smoked it the night before. I had the foie gras mc muffin and it was delicious but very rich. We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Fabulous place to meet for lunch! Unique balance of ambiance...if there's such a thing a upscale casual, this is it. As a Henderson resident, I'm thrilled to have this friendly-chic addition to the neighborhood.   I ordered the salmon bagel...delightful pickled beet and perfectly cooked Sunnyside up egg crown this classic brunch dish. My girlfriend, Andeen, orders the tacitos every time...and a pastrami sandwich to go for Hubby...every time! Hard to try new things when you find a homerun.   Our server, Isle, was friendly, funny and so gracious. I'm looking forward to coming back later in the day to check out the craft beer selection on their fabulous patio. I'll definitely be back."}
{"text":"Giving 5-stars for fantastic service, food, cleanliness, timeliness and menu options.   First ones in at 7:30am (opening time) and the place smelled wonderful of breakfast goodness. Maria was our server and she was so sweet and delightful. The place was decorated cutesy chic. My bestie got a snicker doodle latte, in which she chugged because it was so good. We had the frittata & benedict... Both super fresh & delicious. Average plate of breakfast cost $10-$14. They have Foie breakfast options, too if you want a little more upscale of a breakfast at $19-$21 a plate. I don't eat meat so the meatless dishes were perfect for me.   Definitely an awesome breakfast joint with great random tunes playing in the background. Check them out. (:"}
{"text":"The food was amazing and the service was great the girls were very helpful with their recommendations"}
{"text":"First time here and had an ok experience. I ordered the Strawberry Short Cake French Toast which was amazing! I enjoyed every bite. My wife ordered the All American Breakfast (no meat). She was not too happy with her eggs, she asked for scrambled eggs and a scrambled omelet came out. Her potatoes were a little undercooked. We got seated in less than 10 minutes because we chose to sit outside(it was a Sunday). Took the waiter more than 15 minutes to even get to us. Once we ordered, our food took a while to come out almost 40 minutes:/ Food plus service goes hand in hand with me it's all about the experience. Would have loved to rate this place higher."}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! Best local spot I have been to in a long time! The food is top notch quality and the service is great. Everyone is super friendly. There is a  little bit of a wait but well worth it!! A MUST!!!"}
{"text":"Wonderful little breakfast spot. This was our first visit that was recommended by a good friend. The food was great and the menu was a nice change from your classic breakfast choices. Would go here again and again."}
{"text":"Very impressed with this quaint little place. Love the seating outside and the presentation of food is almost as fantastic as the quality of food. I loved the veggie sandwich and had a wonderful coffee along with it. I will certainly be back for more. One of my favorite gems in Green Valley Ranch, Henderson."}
{"text":"\"You up\" say a cheery, bright eyed and bushy tailed voice on the other end of the line.  \"Stupid question.  I'm talking right.  What time is it?\" I say groggily.  \"Daytime.  Come on, meet us in the lobby.  You drive.  Breakfast BBQ time!\"  continues the voice.  15 miles, 20 minutes later, greeted by the smell of fresh baked muffins, fried donuts, and roasting pork, Kitchen Table.  This is brunch done right.  Wasting no time, the smoked pork Benedict is excellent.  Creamy soft poached eggs that spill their yolky goodness over juicy, slow smoked pork belly.  The Jalapeño hollandaise providing a welcome heat, and acidity and finishing in a clean, fresh chili flavor.  Hawaii yeeps, think the best kalua pig bennies you've ever had.  Chiliqueles, a tasty hot mess.  Basically black beans, scrambled eggs, hand pulled smoky pork belly, a tangy Oaxaca cheese, drizzled in a creamy ancho sauce and topped with a sunny side up egg.  Get messy, mix it all up.  Flavors just work.  The basics are definitely done well.  Simple, made from scratch buttermilk pancakes with a good chew and mild sweetness.   Well made French toast.  Crisp and buttery on the outside, slightly creamy on the inside.  The muffins, controlled sweetness and tasting as they should (the banana walnut muffin FTW).  The only weakness, dishes using foie.  Totally unnecessary.  The Foie French toast is a pale imitation to that served at the venerable Sage Restaurant.  Foie and apple skillet cake with its wonderful caramelized apples and maple gastrique ruined by the fatty, oily, richness of the foie.  Very friendly off Strip service.  Fair, local pricing.  A great addition to the Hendertucky food scene."}
{"text":"Look no further than your Kitchen Table for mouth-watering and delicious food!!!  I must admit, looking at the menu was overwhelming with the diversity of brunch entrees, but I could tell a lot of creativity was put into it.One thing is for sure, it leaves me with something to look forward to next time, that's always a plus!     They also have separate to-go entrees which is good when I'm on the run.   I walked in right after noon time, it was packed luckily its just me so I didn't have to wait.   I ordered these items:  Empanadas consists of squash, corn, roasted chilies, asadero cheese and salsa verde.  I don't even care that these were vegetarian, these were so good, the filling was cooked just right.   Pork Belly Bene  Smoked Pork Belly, Jalapeno Hollandaise, English muffin, and potatoes. All I can say is Wow!  The pork belly is super rich, fork-tender and flavorful, and has the most wonderful caramelized crispy bits. Add the egg and Jalapeno Hollandaise sauce puts it way over the top. Must Try!  Overall, my experience was fine and I felt the prices were justified for what I ate."}
{"text":"Finally had a chance to eat here and all I can say is WOW!! From the moment we walked in it was a great experience. We were a party of 6 plus 2 babies and had a cabana outside which was perfect because of the babies. Mike our server was fantastic. He was attentive, knowledgeable of the menu and a pleasure to talk to. The owner Antonio, the same, very personable and even helped his staff serve the food which I was very impressed with. The food is off the chart. We had many different entrees and a few muffins and everything was delicious. The coffee and mimosas were also fantastic. Thanks to all involved in taking care of us and we will definitely be back"}
{"text":"100 degrees inside?????? I'm sick! I did my best   What's happening to my favorite lil Brunch Place? The hostess told us the patio was closed... At least there is a breeze outside! Then she sat two women with a dog... \"A service dog\" I was told,I'm a big fan of this restaurant and I tell people to come here all the timenext time I'll bring the dog! Or my service cat!"}
{"text":"This place is absolutely killing it right now! Over the last year, everyone I know starting talking about the place - not your typical brunch spot, more foodie style! Monkey bread, Mimosas, Benedicts, Jalapeño bacon and so on...  Two things to note: 1. If you want Monkey Bread, you need to get here before 10:30-11:00 or else it's sold out.  2. Call ahead or put your name on the list through the yelp app, there's always at least a 20-30 minute wait (not a huge place)   Come here and try the Short Rib Benedict with a peach Mimosa - you won't regret it!"}
{"text":"I tried Kitchen Table for the first time a few days ago. The food was amazing and the style of the place was really cool. We ordered baked goods as as well as menu items and as I stated earlier the food was amazing. The only problem I had is with the cleanliness of the place. There was a lot of crumbs and chunks of food under our table as well as a piece of broken glass. It appeared that the purchase of a broom might solve the problem. I'm not usually one to complain about a few crumbs here and there, but this was bad. My son had to use the bathroom and that's when the cleanliness issue really became a problem for me. The toilet seat was so loose I could pull it off and either they just got bombed by a customer of the toilet had not been cleaned for a while. I had to hold my son in the air to go because there is no way his little butt was getting anywhere near that toilet. There was trash all over the floor as well. It just seemed that they had never cleaned up after service. Hopefully this issue gets addressed because the food is great, but if the front of house is dirty what does the kitchen look like."}
{"text":"This place was fantastic!!!  A friend introduced me to The Kitchen Table and the food and service were amazing!!  I ended up brining another friend there for breakfast and again it was excellent!!  I plan to make it there regularly.    Tip: you have to try their fresh baked pastries!!"}
{"text":"My friends and I enjoyed this restaurant so much! The food was so good and fresh! We enjoyed every it of it! Plus to top it off, the service was so good! Our waiter, Rafael, was also very friendly and helpful! He made our experience even more amazing! I would definitely come back!!"}
{"text":"This review is overdue last Friday was my third time visit and believe me the Kitchen Table does not dissapoint. I have never had a bad meal or service they are very popular and busy so sometimes you will wait a bit for the check or a refill but they bust their butts to get the food out and it is amazing, delicious and worth the wait wether it's savory or sweet it's all good all the time. The manager came around to check on us and we were told they are opening another location on the west side very soon. Good to hear as they are truly a special and very unique place for exceptional food and service."}
{"text":"Went to try the place for the first time,ordered Caviar with blins and smoked salmon,my husband was not sure about that first..Must say,exceeded my expectations!The balance was perfect!Will order it again!"}
{"text":"Good food, but they think far too highly of themselves. Their pretentiousness makes the experience unbearable. It's quite clear that if you don't know the owner you have to wait forever, but if you do you get right in. Go to Craft Kitchen instead."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday morning after the gym for the first time. There country benedict was awsome. I was not expecting the amount of flavor in the dish, more specifically the chipotle gravy. I'm not a chef or foodie connoisseur but I love good flavorful food and the gravy made all the difference.  I would recomend to anyone."}
{"text":"Very relaxing place for brunch or breakfast. The layout is open with some tables and seats pushed together. There is an outdoor seating area that is well shaded and landscaped.  That being said there are some places that when you walk-in you know your going to have a great meal. The place is busy but never messy or cramped. The baked goods are prominently displayed and fiil the place with beautiful aromas.  I have had the Benedict, the pork belly Benedict, and the Foie and Apple skillet cake. All were well executed and sumptuous. The pork belly was fresh, tender and made in-house. The Foie and Apple skillet cake was decadent, sweet and meaty all at the same time.  Be cognizant of the fact this is a very popular spot and visiting during peak times will involve a wait. The prices are higher than most breakfast places and the saying you get what you pay for really applies here"}
{"text":"YUMMY!!! Food was so delicious. Husband ordered the Chicken Fried Steak Benedict- Omg. So good. I got the croque madame (sp?) it was great. Service was exceptional. Loved every minute! We will be back."}
{"text":"Well fellow Yelper you have no failed me not one bit with this spot! Okay well I'm lying I didn't have a clue this spot existed. It's hidden in the corner next to a spot called Shabu Shabu. A good friend of mine wanted to catch up Monday morning over some brunch and I let her pick the spot. I wish I knew about this place before I moved clear across town. It's definitely worth the drive!  The service was great!! Our cups were never empty and we never had to try to catch their attention for anything we needed. I did want to try their strawberry shortcake French toast but the waitress stated that and a couple other things are oh offered on the weekends. Which gave me another excuse to return lol. Oh and they have different, variety of pastries available as \"starters\" aka appetizers!  As I've mentioned before I love that concept.   They definitely had one of the best brunches I've had in a while. Oh and if you're wondering what I munched on, I got the country Benedict and it was to die for. It was so good I digged in before taking a photo op! Maybe next time no guarantees!"}
{"text":"The Monte Cristo is my all-time favorite sandwich; I will order it if it's on the menu.  Do not order it here!  Like another Yelper said, it's all dough with a tiny slice of ham in the middle.  I would estimate that it only covers 50% of the bread, if that.  It was also super greasy like the entire sandwich was dipped in batter and deep-fried.  My daughter ordered the Eggs Benedict and my husband the oatmeal.  Neither of them raved about their food.  I was very disppointed given all the good reviews on Yelp."}
{"text":"Had a brunch here for my mothers birthday, we sat outside. The food was incredible I ate some French food that I would not normally have eaten and was very pleased to have done it. I definitely will go back."}
{"text":"This place is amazing. We found it on yelp and tried it. I would you recommend you call ahead as it's a busy place. The staff was overwhelmed but did a phenomenal job keeping guests up to date on seating and happy. We had the traditional French toast , chorizo omelette and the country which was a chicken fried steak with a pouched egg on a biscuit. It all was perfect and amazing. A must try for sure."}
{"text":"Great food, friendly staff. But the pool cabanas on the patio and dirty dishes from that cart need to go. As well as the menu printed out on computer paper. But I'll be back!"}
{"text":"I have no idea what the food is like but the service when I was there was terrible. I arrived there at 8:30 to meet a group of people who were already in the restaurant. I sat there for ages with my menu in my hand waiting for the server to come and take my order. When he finally did come back it was to bring their food (which I didn't realise they had already ordered because all the menus were still on the table). I waited until everyone had their meal and tried to order a small appetizer. I was told that the kitchen had closed at 9:00. I don't understand a server who ignores a person who is literally holding the menu the whole time and doesn't tell them the kitchen is closing. I was in the restaurant for a full 40 minutes before I even got a drink. I am sure the food is fine, but the service on Sunday May 20th was terrible."}
{"text":"Amazing brunch spot! I wanted to try something new so I ordered the Croque Madam (Challah, gruyere, bechamel, thick ham over arugula greens, tomato, topped with a sunny side up egg). It was fabulous!!! Will go back"}
{"text":"Hello and welcome to Kitchen Table. Greeted instantly and seated right away. This is a social dining experience so there are a few tables that seat many people and seemed like it may be cramped. We were seated at our own table against the back window, As you enter the store you notice a giant butcher block that is the center piece of the restaurant and has a big logo on it. Our table was unique, made from 2x4 planks and not planed down, So if a board is warped you will notice it in your table. I actually wanted to find issue with this but found it authentic. The hostess took our drink order and we had to wait a bit for our waitress Ilse to bring them. We arrived at or near the same time as the other guests around us so the delay is forgivable. The guests near us were all trying this spot for the first time as well. The menu comes on a clip board and you can flip through it to find your meal. I might add they do make their own pastries and there is a counter at the front to order from.  We ordered french toast and the meal that every good breakfast spot is judged, Chicken Fried Steak. French Toast was actually french bread not Texas toast or a random flat bread. The Syrup was amazing also. (see Photos), Chicken Fried Steak with Chipotle Sausage Gravy, I was reluctant not to see traditional gravy, but this place is far from traditional. The Steak was thick and delicious, Gravy had sausage flavor with a small Chipotle bite. There is not salt and pepper on the table, my eggcame peppered for meI found this very impressive, Big fan of this meal. We spoke with guests around us and all enjoyed the meals they had as well. There was this Mexican Hot Chocolate that one guest had that I need to try. It had toasted marshmallows on top. I will take back the social aspect being negative since Josie pointed out that I am one of the most social people she knows. Drinks were always filled and waitress was very aware and kept checking in.,  I saw a grill outside and asked what is was used for. It seems every couple days they smoke a pig and pork belly, so every pork product on menu is from their own smoked pig or pork belly. I did not know this before ordering now I will try the Pork next time we eat here. Goodbye and thank you for dining at Kitchen Table. On the way out Chef Antonio shook our hand and thanked us for coming. He and another chef there were very personable. As we left the wait was greater than when we entered so get here early, We will be going again and I believe we found a new favorite breakfast spot. Take the time and effort to try this great place. You won't regret it."}
{"text":"Our patio table was definitely worth the wait. Ridiculously delicious food and our server was amazing. The music was perhaps the best part of all though."}
{"text":"Ill start by saying that I very rarely give 5 star reviews, but i think this place deserves it. Been twice in the last week or so and both times are servers were excellent, we even got a couple pastries on the house. Try the monkey bread! Orange juice was also super fresh. My favorite dish was the croque madame - very flavorful bechamel sauce with ham and challah bread, all around great dish. Excellent for brunch. Only hiccup is wait time might be a bit if you go during peak times, especially on weekends for brunch. Will definitely be going here on a regular basis, plus prices were very reasonable."}
{"text":"Meh.  We arrived at 2:15pm. The place was full, but winding down for the day since they close at 3:30pm. We waited about ten minutes for a table and another ten minutes to order. Our coffees took about five minutes to come out. Our food took 40 minutes! The people who sat down next to us twenty minutes after we ordered got their food right after we did. That's a bit ridiculous for that late in the day on a Saturday for French toast and an omelette. The French toast is just cake dipped in egg, fried and topped with whipped cream and strawberries. I honestly didn't care for it and the whipped cream was almost completely melted by the time I got it. My husband's chorizo omelette was good, but the portion of potatoes on the side was tiny and burnt. Like it was the leftovers from the back of the griddle. I loved the decor and ambiance, but that's not enough to get me to go back for another $42 breakfast/lunch."}
{"text":"I absolutely enjoyed this enchanting breakfast gem. Everything from the Décor, service, and unique dishes made it special. There's a comfortable, and warm atmosphere to it, which is what I always imagine a breakfast, or lunch experience should feel like. The Kitchen table sincerely delivers happiness on a plate, and a feeling of home. I loved it."}
{"text":"Best egg tacos EVER! Love the food as well as the presentation, atmosphere & great staff. The chef himself even is on the main floor helping guests get seated as well as serving water while we figure out what to order.  I love that you can see another chef making sure that the food that leaves the kitchen has its beautiful fine touches.  Just be sure to wait a while because they are so good that they are always busy!"}
{"text":"I would easily eat here again over any of the breakfast places on the Strip. We sat outside on a sunny, crisp, fall morning. The Breakfast Tacos and crusted French toast were delicious. The juice options for the mimosas were fresh and amazing. Our favorites were mango and guava. The service, food, and drink were all high quality. I wish I was back there right now... Thank you for a great experience, Javier!"}
{"text":"Super happy to find this local spot in Vegas!  The takeaways:  -Amazing staff - shout out to Melanie the manager for treating us so a slice of pie while we waited for our table!  -Delicious Food - we got the country Benedict and pork belly Benedict with foie grais...ridiculous.   -Best cup of coffee I've had in Vegas.   If you're looking for a foodie breakfast spot, this is it!"}
{"text":"Wife and I arrived for breakfast on Saturday at about 8:30am.....dining room nearly full. Good to see robust patronage at this new start up - word has clearly gotten out. Given this is my third visit this month I'm getting to explore the extensive menu a bit more. Coffee cake was moist and delicious and not overly sweet. Biscuits are tender perhaps overly so and they tended to crumble when house made jam was spread on them. May need a bit better incorporation of the wet & dry ingredients in the batter - always a challenge to get the right consistency without over working and making a tough texture.  Eggs in a basket was delicious and filling. My wife could only eat about a third of her buttermilk pancakes ...very tasty but too large a portion. Lastly, I reconsidered my prior review on the house coffee as being excellent. I will drive from Anthem to eat the food but won't go outta my way to stop in for coffee. For a neighborhood gathering spot that primarily focuses on breakfast and brunch they need to offer great coffee to build a loyal following - it should be better. Don't know if it the beans or the brewing method - but Craft Kitchen a couple miles away has their coffee service nailed.  KT is well on its way to being a go to spot - but needs to focus its menu a bit so that execution is more consistent."}
{"text":"The BEST EVER...IN MY LIFE EGGS BENEDICT!!! Béarnaise sauce was buttery, and eggs were cooked perfectly.   Several different toppings to choose from.  Our favorite was short ribs.  Great friendly staff, incredible chef who visits table side to inquire about your meal.  This will always be remembered as one of my  top 5 breakfasts. EVER"}
{"text":"This place rocks, everything I ordered was beautifully created to the eye and delicious. I recommend this place no doubt.  You need to try this place and order the empanadas :)"}
{"text":"Food was amazing but what really made this an exceptional experience was the customer service provided by the manager and chef. The manager came over to the table multiple times to make sure we had everything we needed and when a side was forgotten she noticed it before we did. Her attentiveness really made us feel valued as customers. The chef came out and went to every table to see how the meal was. He was friendly and genuinely cares about the quality of product he is making. It is that extra effort that makes and excellent restaurant."}
{"text":"How have I not reviewed Kitchen Table yet? I am an unapologetic breakfast enthusiast. Not a snob. I like some perfectly-done eggs at a good diner as much as a fancy brunch. Kitchen Table is the place I would recommend first for people who visit from out of town.  First things first - there will be a wait. That tends to happen at places that are popular and make good food. Know this going in. They have indoor and outdoor seating, which helps with wait time, but you'll need to be patient unless you're an early riser. It's worth it.  The coffee is really good, and I feel like that's often an neglected part of reviews for breakfast places. Their baked goods are worth trying out, even if you just share biscuits and jam with someone, or try the Monkey Bread. They have mimosas with various juices and I think they do specials on buckets of beer. But the stars are the entrees. I've made it my mission to work through the menu, and I'm happy to report I've made good progress. My favorites so far: Duck and cheese omelette: If I need to explain why this is a good idea, we can't be friends. Country Benedict: many places do this dish, but KT's version is outstanding. And it has good kick, so be prepared. I believe it comes with some greens on the side, and I like the dressing they use. But the chicken fried steak and chipotle gravy combo on this keeps me coming back - at least on those mornings when I know I can take it slow the rest of the day.  Meatless Benedict: a bit lighter than the other options, but still packed with flavor. My wife gets the Croque Madam just about every time we go here. She is always tempted by something else, and ends up ordering this, because it is so good. Just look over the menu - you'll probably find at least three dishes that have you curious."}
{"text":"Other than the wait, the place is legit. It is a small cafe spot that has a variety of people. I love the view. Little tight, but I think it will become a bigger place soon!"}
{"text":"this place does an amazing job with pork. i had the pork belly green chille. it was so good, I could stop eating it. the chille as filled are also amazing! Mexican hot chocolate was on point. The Patio dining  is so nice on a warm day. Service can be slow but the foof is worth the wait."}
{"text":"Wonderful customer service! My daughter's first words were mama this looks like we are in California.  Food was fresh and people were divine !  Thank you!  Coming in with 4 kids and many food allergies it was a surprise everyone was so welcoming."}
{"text":"Tacos Huevos with a side of jalapeno bacon and a nice mimosa. That will do the trick! I think this might be my favorite breakfast restaurant in the area. Beats the heck out of the Peppermill or the Omelet House. Why? Because it's different and because they do different well.  So far I've had: The aforementioned Tacos Huevos and jalapeno bacon Pork Belly Chili Verde Crab Dip Biscuit with what I think was prickly pear jelly Monkey Bread Mimosa in prickly pear, mixed berry, and orange.  Outstanding. So flavorful! I'm coming back every time I go to Henderson. If you are going to Vegas, come here instead of the strip."}
{"text":"I have hated eggs until today. The eclectic menu will take some time to get through, but my server Hanna made an excellent recommendation of the Coque Madame. It was perfect. They should do away with condiments at this place. Flavors are full and embody the the definition of comfort food. Any modifications would be an insult to the Chefs. Tremendous value worth every penny. Treat your spouse or parents to this place. I don't know how I've missed this place. Great job Hannah!"}

Starting with a sprawling menu intended to gauge local tastes and since curtailing the offerings to focus on favorites while also allowing for creativity despite a small kitchen, it was once again with a great showing of hospitality that hosts, severs and chefs greeted diners within the jammed-packed space now generating 45 minute waits as patio season is about to begin, and although wait times may seem excessive to those used to chains the quality of craftsmanship and expediting remains remarkable even when compared to the best of what is offered nationwide - whether Portland, Los Angeles, Chicago, or even trendy Brooklyn.  Stating that the new menu is meant to make things seasonal while also giving diners the chance to experience novel ingredients in ways that they may have never conceived, it was with carte blanche deferred to the Kitchen that the morning's family-style experience was undertaken and kicking off with pastries the new menu sees a focus on American Classics, the Pumpkin Donut and Pear Fritter so lightly fried that they may as well have been baked while the Monkey Bread remains a city-wide standard bearer, the Social Pecan Roll tasting great, the current appearance admittedly a bit deceiving.  Impressed by the buttery Pecan Loaf plus Cookies with a crisp rim and soft center, but finding the Berry-based Muffins to have regressed to the dryness experienced early in the restaurant's existence, menu based items got underway with a pile of three buttermilk flapjacks shellacked in housemade peanut butter plus jam and with even those who tend to avoid \"sweet breakfasts\" already smiling another cup of coffee helped clear the palate before veering savory, the vegetal Broccoli Tort eating something like an egg-souffle or fluffy fritatta with saline cheesy notes underlying vibrant Sweet Pepper Coulis and gently smoked Salmon.  Presenting a few new spins on the breakfast sandwiches made famous by a clown and Golden Arches the kitchen next sent forth the Egg Mac Kitchen and with the crispy English Muffin already an upgrade on the original Chef Nunez raises the bar further through the addition of spicy Guacamole plus charred Corn to a nicely fried egg with a bit of levity added by tangy Crema.  Claiming that he was generally unaware of the Avocado Toast trend run amok in LA, a clear sign of a man spending too much time working and not enough traveling or dining out, Nunez's take on the modern classic slightly misses the Veg-Friendly point by adding Poached Eggs and Bacon Vinaigrette, but proving all the better for it and thus actually quite stunning it was perhaps more expected that the follow-up citrusy Strawberry Short Cake French Toast quickly nudged its way into the spotlight with soft layers of  Angel Food Cake happily sopping up cloudy Whipped Cream and lightly sweetened Strawberry Gastrique.  At this point just showing off, some at the table already starting to claim satiety while others more appropriately peered at the ope kitchen in anticipation of what was to come next, Antonio strayed slightly from the menu to present the Pork Belly Benne and with house-smoked pork mixing with beans, masa, and salsa the heat was raised just a touch through the addition of tangy Guajillo chili but still kept in check with creamy Bearnaise, the overall composition appropriately-deemed a table favorite.  Rounding out the meal with two more plates, the White Chocolate French Toast undoubtedly the sort of thing that spoke to  holiday often celebrated with sweetness, it was as a grand finale that Kitchen Table sent forth a second 'breakfast sandwich,' the Foie Mac Muffin not just featuring a roasted slice of liver but also seeing the bun itself soaked in the pan jus with a topping of tender Short Rib and Bearnaise offering up plenty of richness even before rupturing the soft-poached egg.  At this point seeing the endorsement of nearly every media outlet in town, a great thing for the restaurant but a growing concern for those looking to walk-in on a weekend, the only question remaining for Chefs Chavez and Nunez is how long the Buzz will last, a question each seem happy to confront with the sort of menu that never seems to for innovation and a commitment to quality that provides plenty of reasons to come back."}
{"text":"We heard cool  things and tried to eat there. Sunday at 11:30 am.  45 minuts wait.  They are fortunate they are so busy.  We couldn't wait today but will try it again another time.  The hostess was very polite and honest  about the wait."}
{"text":"One of my favorite breakfast/lunch places. Nice place to sit outside and friendly wait staff.  Creative  menu that offers traditional and more \"snazzy\" fare. A great place to check out!"}
{"text":"Wow this place was certainly worth waiting for, just what SE Henderson needed. They opened sunday and decided to go on the following Tuesday and was not surprised that these two chefs would serve great and very innovative food, everything is so fresh the coffee was great and the fact the owner chef manages the place by being out in the dining room is smart and important. the place filled up quick on a Tuesday morning I was impressed. I love the food and I was very comfortable there. The prices were very reasonable and there is something for everyone on the menu. Thank you for choosing Henderson. Chef Vic Parise Cec cce"}
{"text":"Beautiful settings and great food. I tried their duck omelette. It came with biscuit, homemade jam and potatoes on the side. It was as tasty at it gets.  I also find prices very reasonable and staff very Friendly."}
{"text":"I am all about supporting local businesses, so I was so excited to try the new spot in the neighborhood.  long story short, very disappointed.  we ordered a Cuban sandwich, chicken tortilla soup, chicken fried steak and a latte.   Cuban sandwich, meh.  Nothing to write home about.  Potatoes under cooked and bland. chicken tortilla soup, gross...it's thick and gooey  nothing but spices.   chicken fried steak, salty and tough.  eggs were under cooked and the whites were all gooey and runny like boogers.   the latte was good.    service was friendly, but very slow and disorganized.  our soup came out the same time as our meal, who does that without asking if they want it before meal or with?  we were asked how our food was bc didn't touch it, and we told them we didn't like it.  they apologized and gave us our bill and sent us on our way.  no manager, no executive chef, no one to discussion.     such high hopes.... very let down."}
{"text":"The pastries are so lovely. I had the pork belly jalapeño eggs Benedict . Heaven ! Eggs were perfect and the pork belly amazing ! Great iced coffee . A monkey bread to go ! We will be back !"}
{"text":"Kitchen table in my opinion will be the next brunch hot spot. There's so many excellent and creative food options! I had the sausage platter and the chiliquiles. The platter was so yummy, however the chiliquiles was heavy and the flavor a were okay.  I'd defiantly go back just to try something else and their ~5 page menu.        I personally think the menu is way to large for such a small restaurant. Tip: try to have have a few excellent dishes rather than a few okay ones."}
{"text":"What a welcomed addition to our neighborhood. I love breakfast, and I love socializing, and this place marries those two things like no other! Long tables are set up for conversation. Sit next to your friends, or even to neighbors you don't know, and just enjoy a unique and delicious breakfast.   The ambiance is great. I guess I'd call it sort of rustic chic. The tables were built and stained by the owners/chefs. There's a stunning vintage server in the front and the chairs are velvety and comfortable.   The coffee is out of this world. What do they put in it to make it so simply perfect?   On our first visit, Chef Antonio came over to introduce us to the concept and the restaurant. He was so welcoming and friendly! The service has been very good, albeit slow at times. But the servers are sweet and attentive.   The food is like no other. Try the nutella french toast. And that monkey bread? To die for! Skip dessert tonight and go have to Kitchen Table tomorrow morning! The pastries are baked fresh on premise. You can smell the bacon cooking out back from a mile away and it calls you closer. Don't worry - there are healthier options available and I should really start choosing them, LOL.   A few kinks to work out service-wise, but this place is going to be a hit around here. Welcome to the neighborhood and I can't wait to make you part of our weekend routine, Kitchen Table!"}
{"text":"What a refreshing breakfast/brunch place!  Delicious entrees and an array of mouth watering delicious blends of French/American/Mexican influences.  I have been here more than a handful of times and my favorite dish is the Chile Verde.   Owners seem very hands on and the place is popular as is noticeable in the wait for a table, which I will add has kept me away from going every weekend. But if you arrive early and have some patience the wait is worth it!"}
{"text":"I'm speechless. It's brunch with a bbq/spanish twist. Everything we got was a unique take on normal brunch dishes. I'll definitely be back to try more. My only regret was we came for lunch so all the baked good were gone :(  - Chicken Fried - Chicken fried steak in this spicy chipotle gravy that was to die for. Flavor to the max. - Eggs Benny Shorty - Eggs benedict with their braised short ribs they slow cook right outside. The sauce was bearnaise instead of the hollandaise. Delicious. - Pork Belly Nachos - Not as flavorful as the Chicken Fried or Eggs benny, but by far the most tender. A much more mild flavor with a green sauce salsa. - Hot Chocolate with charred marshmallows - Saw a lady next to us get this and we had to have it. They blow torch the marshmallows on top and it was the best cup of hot chocolate I've ever had."}
{"text":"I don't know what the hell is wrong with people... I don't think they know what quality food is if you're giving it a bad review based on seasoning and saying it's overly salted...there is no salt. Things are seasoned with herbs and spice rubs... I also don't know why people give a 1 star review because there happens to be an item on the menu which you don't like but didn't order...  That makes a lot of sense? Just don't order it...  And stick to reviewing what you actually physically consumed...   Now... Onto the actual review..   Service was chaotic... Too many servers getting lost on what tables are theirs... So it took too long to get our order taken and I waited for over 10 minutes for someone to come back to the table just so I could retell someone I wanted cold press coffee..  However, they're new and work flow will hopefully be tweaked.   Traditional eggs Benedict: The poached eggs were overcooked. The hollandaise sauce was to die for...  I wish there was more. Perfectly seasoned potatoes, and a pastry chef made the English muffin. The muffin was a little too glutinous for my liking but the quality was still excellent. The ham was tender and perfectly cooked. The meal was rich but delicious.  Egyptian: again, the eggs were overcooked. The dressing on the greens was perfect. Seasoning was great. The bread is delicious. I got it with strawberry jam which is a little runny but it's basically a compote. Natural and delicious.  Baked goods: monkey bread was good, I wish the pieces were smaller and the syrup was throughout all the pieces and not just in the top and bottom. Chocolate croissant was delicious.   Overall, this is fine dinning experience for breakfast and it's worth the price... I wish I had one in my neighborhood..  But unfortunately I don't but this business is going places. Good luck, chef Antonio."}
{"text":"I didn't like my breakfast, but my boyfriends looked pretty good. I would give it a second try. The regular drip coffee was not good, but the espressos looked good."}
{"text":"Could not wait to try the Kitchen Table and support small business. Went in on 12/23/15 around 1:00 and the wait was 15-20 minutes. Not a problem waiting for a table but noticed that there were several empty tables and no one seated outside. More people came in and the wait now was 30 minutes, I heard the person at the door say that they were backed up in the kitchen so that is reason for the wait. Finally seated and was greeted immediately, we placed our order and the coffee came which was lukewarm. Shortly later our meal came and looked and smelled fantastic. The Eggs Benedict was very tasty, but not very hot even the potatoes were cold. Very disappointed with the temperature if the food and drinks. Still debating if I will go back."}
{"text":"Kitchen Table is such a cute restaurant, really diggin the ambiance. Came here after dropping my mom off at work and was looking for a brunch spot on yelp and this came up. Our mission was to find a bloody mary spot but unfortunately they only sell beer and wine. Our waitress recommended their Bloody Beer and I ordered an iced mocha.  - Iced Coffee Mocha This was very delicious. I was shocked to see there was no mocha syrup inside my cup, normally you can see some chocolate but it was still bomb! Worth it.  - Bloody Beer Since they didn't have any BMs we decided to try their beer version. It was pretty good, I have to admit. I'm not a beer person so that says a lot. Beer makes me bloated so I didn't drink much of this. Worth trying if you like bloodys and beer.  I didn't want to eat anything too heavy since we were going to EDC that night. I only ordered two appetizers:  - Greek Yogurt Don't let the small cup fool you, there was actually a lot of yogurt in this. It was good too, came with fruit and granola. Nice little meal if you're trying to stay on the healthier side.  - Bacon & Egg Shooters I love deviled eggs, so I was stoked when I saw they had some. I don't know if my stomach shrunk but I couldn't finish this. I saved two eggs for later and glad I did, it was yummy having them for leftovers later that day.  Our waitress was very helpful and gave great recommendations. She checked on us frequently and was very friendly. We left happy regardless of not having what we originally wanted."}
{"text":"Totally worth the wait! I promise; we waited 40 minutes and I would wait that long again to eat here.  We had Landon as our server; he was awesome and let us go at our own pace even with tons of people waiting to eat here. He was very nice and made you feel very comfortable.  My boyfriend and I started with the Monkey Bread \"starter\" which was delicious. Good for two people, maybe up to four if you all just want a little bite of something sweet. Both of us got plates with Pork Belly (Pork Belly Benedict and Pork Belly Green Chilie) which was cooked to perfection. They have a smoker outside so it's very evident they put in a lot of time to make sure that Pork Belly is on point. Neither of us finished our plates because we didn't want to be uncomfortably full, but we totally would have because the food was that delicious.  I'm looking forward to returning to try other things on their menu that looked amazing as well!"}
{"text":"Ok food and service.  They must think they are something special.  Had to request salt or pepper.  The salt was served in a small monkey type dish that was not completely dry so the salt stuck to my fingers and was so course that you could not even use it.  The wait staff brought a pepper grinder and was going to wait for me to use it so she could take it back.  As you can see I have not said anything about the food.  Put salt and pepper on the table!  I am sure I am not the first to comment."}
{"text":"Excellent little secret that you might miss as you drive by. Incredible foods, and a bunch of very unique dishes. Portions are a little smaller than the typical \"Vegas size\" stuff your face portions... But you leave here feeling like you don't have to waddle out. Have already been a few times, and will continue to head back for great food and times."}
{"text":"Sharing positive dining experiences with friends and through Yelp, as well as becoming a regular at your neighborhood restaurants are of the utmost importance to these establishments! Supporting your local business's and spreading the word is how these places become successful and stay open!  With that being said,  I have been here more than a half dozen times, I have taken several friends and family members in, and I tell EVERYONE about all the delicious dishes, friendly atmosphere and vibe Kitchen Table offers. From the moment you walk in to the end of the experience, everything is spot on. Being acknowledged right away is key and they do a great job of that. Once you are sat, you are greeted by a friendly server (Brooke is my favorite) and a drink order is taken. Take your time reviewing the menu as there are tons of incredible items to choose from. My absolute favorites are the Pork Belly Green Chili and the Short Rib Benedict. Let's not forget the Prickly Pear Mimosas that I can't get enough of. The manager Arely and the owner Javier are wonderful too. They always make a point to come by the tables to make sure everything is great and that you are enjoying your experience!   I will continue to frequent Kitchen Table as often as possible and bring my friends and family in. You should do yourself a favor and check it out! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place out for Easter Brunch and it was a homerun! Love everything about this place, great vibe, staff is super hospitable, clean environment, and the menu... cant wait to try it all! Being Easter things where a bit chaotic but staff was still super friendly, I wish I knew the girls name that waited on us, she was super sweet. She even brought us some muffins because our order was taking a while. I had the pork belly benedict, which is my new favorite breakfast item! This is my new spot, and cannot wait to take some more friends and family members here... seems to be one of green valleys best kept secrets."}
{"text":"We decided to come here because of all the five star reviews. Being someone who is used to fine dining, and the very best on the strip, this was average. The food is just OK. It's a cute little restaurant and the service is good... I suppose it depends on the day you come. The prices are reasonable. It's great if you live in Henderson, especially at McDonald's ranch. This is a good place if you want good food. In my opinion, if you want fantastic food, this may be the place for you but it most certainly was not for me. This place cannot compete with the amazing places in Las Vegas that I have been to and the great chefs in Las Vegas. I will not likely be returning here because there are way better choices. This restaurant is just OK and this is why it got three stars."}
{"text":"I was super excited to try this place because I've heard good things and the food looks just as good. One disappointment was finding this place. It's literally in the corner of the two buildings in the lot. There's a sign on a wall (that needs a little more to make it stand out) We obviously missed it and ended up driving into the next lot. We then saw the main sign when we were on the street. Sooo for future reference: it's between a Shabu-Shabu restaurant and Brighton Family Medicine.   We walked in and it was surprisingly small and packed in there. We came at 9am, thinking it was going to be a bit more empty... Nope! People like eating early lol. Despite how busy it was, we were seated immediately. I wasn't too thrilled with our server, I don't even think he introduced himself. But he did check on us a couple times and made sure we had what we needed before disappearing.  It was packed in there and just as loud. I could barely hear myself or my sister talk. That's where the fifth star went -- disappeared with my unheard words.   The food is where the four stars came from, though! There was a lot to choose from, everything sounded delicious! I ended up with the country Benedict. Pretty much country friend steak just on a biscuit with a side of house potatoes. The house potatoes reminded me of Thanksgiving stuffing because of how it looks but it tastes better lol.   I'm coming back to try other things (monkey bread!!!) and maybe sit outside to be one with nature -- sucks it was super windy today and I would've died from allergies.   I definitely recommend trying this little hole-in-the-wall restaurant!"}
{"text":"Great food and service... although doesn't taken reservations I was able to call about 30 mins ahead of time to get on list which really came in handy as I was taking my grandma for a bday brunch and didn't want her waiting on a hot day... the hostess was very kind and efficient and found a great table for us... food was great! All dishes we got were delicious...Waitress was on point too... my only disappointment was that run out of some of there top items like the monkey bread we couldn't get... should fix this so not to disappoint guests, also wishes the Bloody Mary was a true Bloody Mary instead of beer... great job kitchen table!"}
{"text":"Duck Philly was very good. My wife had the burger and said it was the best she ever had. My dad got the tortilla soup which was good, a bit smokey and chipotle type flavor. Everything was great, service was good, food was yummy, place was clean. Will go back again for sure."}
{"text":"Just had brunch in this awesome place today with friends from out of town. There is a wait because it is that good! The homemade pastries are to die for....we all ordered different items and were ohhhhhinh & ahhhhhing over our food. The service was fabulous and this place has a super cute decor. You must go here!"}
{"text":"Have visited several times during popular brunch time and always experienced a 30+ minute wait. Took my wife to birthday breakfast this morning and was told to expect about a half hour wait. After 40 minutes my wife was told by the dark-haired hostess, \"We ran out of clean glasses and silverware.\" When wife (49 today) pointed to the full tray of silverware & complained about the wait, the hostess said, \"Well, what do you want me to do, girl? I am trying to help you.\" We returned to our spot on the bench directly outside the doors and waited another 20 minutes, watching other couples and small groups who arrived after us get seated. We went back in to ask about being seated and were told the hostess had called us twice with no response. This was obviously not true, as we were indeed right outside the door and heard every name called as we sat for that hour. Rudeness and untruths spoiled hopes for lovely birthday brunch."}
{"text":"We sat outside this morning for breakfast. Comfortable seating and shade. Glad we eat early! A lot of people waiting when we left. Service was great, I didn't catch his name but he was funny, friendly, and knew the food. I don't eat gluten and he was quick to suggest alternatives and the order was spot on. Food was portioned perfectly. I ate all of it without feeling hungry or overstuffed. And, the water tastes good! Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This place was amaze-balls. It's hidden behind a plaza near pooch n pals, so be on the lookout. There's inside and outside seating, place was casual and decor was nice.  We got the cinnamon roll, monte Cristo, the burger, and the short rib Benny. Everything was delicious. I took away one star for the cinnamon roll; it was not great, I will try monkey bread when I go back (because I WILL go back). My friend asked to have the monte Cristo covered in powder sugar and they accommodated no problem, but the strawberry jam that came with it was delicious! I ate it with a spoon because pouring it into my mouth was too barbaric.   The burger was the best we've ever had--jalepeno bacon whaaaaat?--SO GOOD. Short rib Benny was perfect, poached egg gooed all over my muffin and the potatoes were super flavorful. I can't wait to come back and try everything else on the menu."}
{"text":"Food is very high quality and a great boutique little brunch place. Atmosphere definitely is the antique American barn diner feel to it. Wonderful selection of different mimosas you can choose from! Peach, pineapple juice, you name it! Unfortunately is NOT vegan friendly."}
{"text":"This place had such great reviews so we were so disappointed when we obviously didn't get the same experience that others did. We waited for 50 minutes, even though we did the check in online. We were seated outside but was never given a choice of inside or outside but I guess it was busy inside so we didn't have a choice.  After we were seated we waiting over 20 minutes for the waitress to take our drink order but we put the food order in too since we had a lot of time to look at the menu. It took a good 15-20 minutes before we got our drink order and not once did the anyone check in on us. When the food finally came out my order which is the simple breakfast of toast, eggs, potatoes and bacon, came out with 3 of the 4 items wrong.   My order was regular bacon, wheat toast and scrambled eggs. The order that came out was white toast, jalapeños bacon and sunny side up eggs. Our normal waitress didn't bring it out and I knew it was someone else's order but we kept waiting and waiting and no one came. Again, not once did anyone come by to check on us. My husband finally went into to tell the waitress the issue and she came out to give me a plate of scrambled eggs, by that time I realized the bacon was oddly spicy and I don't eat spice. We had to wave her down again and she tried bringing me a whole new plate with the right stuff but we were already too put off by the lack of service, follow through and correct food order. We had to get up to ask for ketchup and by Type of water refill. It wasn't that busy outside and everyone else's waitress and food seemed ok except for ours. My husband said his food was good but due to the terrible service, we will never be coming back here again."}
{"text":"Visiting from Buffalo, NY. Stopped in on our way to see the Hoover Dam, everything was delicious, I had the peaches and cream cakes and my husband the American breakfast. The staff were spectacular and the atmosphere inviting , truly enjoyed our breakfast."}
{"text":"Yesterday was my first time at Kitchen Time, and I'm definitely returning!  First off, the name is simple yet welcoming because I think of all the times I've had great food and loud laughs with family and friends at the \"kitchen table.\" Secondly, I personally found the decor SUPER ADORBS! There are hanging antique light bulbs in the order to-go café area, an antique cupboard, beautiful 3D flower wall art, and the patio area looked cute from where I was sitting inside. It can get pretty cramped inside, especially when people are lingering in the walkways, but I don't mind it.  Now on to the food - my favorite part!  For my boyfriend and I, one section of the menu seemed a bit disorganized because we were pretty sure that the items were separated by category (such as French Toast) and should be read from left to right. There was a burger item under \"French Toast\" that had us thinking it was going to be served between french toast, which would've been unique, and my boyfriend said that the eggs benedict items went into the \"French Toast\" category as well. It didn't spoil our experience, just thought I'd mention it for future improvements.  Besides that, the food was THE BOMB. If I can remember the names correctly, my boyfriend ordered the \"Pork Belly Bene,\" I ordered the \"Salmon and Caviar\" and \"Strawberry Shortcake French Toast\" (only served on weekends told by our server), and \"Crab Dip\" as our appetizer. I only took photos of the appetizer and my dishes because my boyfriend couldn't wait to eat his! Everything was DELICIOUS. The \"Crab Dip\" was super cheesy, which made it really oily, but we didn't care. It came with a few slices of avocado, but it could've used more because I love avocado. The chunkiness gave it some texture, which was nice. There wasn't too much crab where it made it too fishy either, which was perfect because my boyfriend has a sensitive sense of smell. The \"Salmon and Caviar\" was beautiful. The smoked salmon, sunny side up quail egg, touch of caviar, and greens on top of a small pancake was just amazing. The French toast blew it out of the water for me! The bread was so moist and soft. Presentation - just gorgeous. The strawberry coulis was a tad tart for my taste, but overall I enjoyed it! My boyfriend's \"Pork Belly Bene\" was a bit too sweet for his taste. The description said chipotle and jalapeño, so he was expecting some heat. He still enjoyed it, but we recommend updating the description because it's a bit misleading. We definitely ordered a lot, so we brought home leftovers, which my sisters happily finished. Service was kind and friendly. Definitely bringing my sisters and mom here for a brunch date!"}
{"text":"I've came her a few times with family and friends and they all have been great experiences. Definitely brunch days are busier and the wait is long, but it's worth the wait. It's a hidden gem tucked in Henderson!  I've tried the Meatless, Vegetarian Hash, Monkey Bread & Mimosas. They were all amazing! I loved the meatless since you get a lot in one bite. The runny egg-porn is instagram worthy. Veggie hash has a lot of potatoes and balances well with the veggies and egg. Monkey bread was a little over welcoming, but shareable so you don't have to eat it all yourself. As for mimosas we've have different flavors that you mix the syrup in your bubbly which is fun, but kind of messy!  Overall, great place for dishes that have a hint of Mexican and American influences!"}
{"text":"What amazing food there is here.  You need to start off with a fantastic cup of coffee paired with their monkey bread!  Then you honestly can't go wrong.  The yogurt is fantastic and the oatmeal is good, but you need to come here for the specialties.  Our favorites are the Monte Cristo, Eggs in a Basket, any of the Benedicts, and my personal favorite, the Chilaquiles.  This food tastes like it was made with love for all to share.  The ambiance of the restaurant is a homely with a community table in the middle and group seating all around.  When the weather permits, there is also patio seating.  Be prepared to wait later in the morning you go."}
{"text":"Discovered this place on yelp. It's really isolated which makes it a hidden gem. We waited for about 20min but they actually offer free drinks while you wait. That was pretty dope.  Had smoked salmon Benedict and a po'boy . Tasted amazing! Definitely coming back and have been telling everybody about it !!"}
{"text":"Upon first arriving we opens the front door and was greeted by the aroma of freshly cooked bacon. That made me so hungry. We sat down and was quickly given waters and coffee that was ordered. The the waitress was very nice and attentive. They even split the hot chocolate between our kids. The food came out quick and hot. Everything tasted great. The breakfast taquitos might be a little spicy for some people. Chorizo omelette was very tasty. The sides I was not so excited about. The sourdough bread that came with my meal was brushed with melted butter so it just tasted like oil. I wish they had either toasted it after brushing it or given some butter for me to put on myself. The potatoes that came with my meal was not my favorite.   I must say that the service was awesome. We stayed there talking with family for a long time and we never felt rushed or pressured to leave. We enjoyed dinning there and look forward to another meal there."}
{"text":"I'm on not a breakfast girl but this is the best breakfast I ever ate in a long time. Worst the drive across town for this.  They made everything fresh. Everything come out so good.  This is a must try."}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast place in Henderson. Food is excellent! Great atmosphere! Lucky we have it in Henderson because we have too many chain restaurants. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because there is a wait and we found out the hard way that you can call in and hold a table ahead of time. Next time we go here we know to call ahead."}
{"text":"2nd time here and they always deliver! Great food, awesome greasy fare spiced up and dialed up, the duck Philly sandwich was amazing! Also not to be missed: the Jalepeno Egg Shooters. Keep up the great work guys!"}
{"text":"We have been to Kitchen Table a couple of times... The food is awesome... I would highly recommend!!! My complaint... They don't take ToGo orders over the phone... So I have been sitting here for awhile... & if they don't get someone new for the front of the house... It will die!!!... They have tables open...& they aren't seating them...people are waiting & getting very frustrated!!!! My ToGo order is taking forever!!!... So I am able to just sit here and watch!!! I hope they make a change!!!... I would hate to see this fabulous little restaurant go away!!!"}
{"text":"Great service from the beginning.   The menu choices are AMAZING, so many choices are ones that aren't on everyday menus.  Had to make a choice out of 4 items I was interested in.   So Nutella Smores French Toast and Jalepeno Bacon won out!"}
{"text":"My husband \"Frank G.\" kind of hit it on the nose. Top five burgers I've ever had, large in size and sooo buttery. My husband had the duck philly and although I hate duck, this was pretty good--he compared it to \"sisig\", it didn't have the duck taste. I thought the honeycomb latte was good although it did not have any honeycomb taste.   We came on a windy day so it was packed inside and we sat in a \"communal\" area, which I think is great for a bar but not for a breakfast lunch place. We sat next to a couple of women who were very talkative and I could not have my own conversation without yelling. I know there is some outdoor seating, which would be awesome for spring and fall.  I really enjoyed the food. Although, I would only say there if I had my own table."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Beautiful and clean environment. Very urban and rustic. Loooove the energy and vibe the staff give off. Definitely 5 stars and beyond. See ya soon!"}
{"text":"The pancakes here are amazing. I had what they call the golden ticket and it was good. These pancakes are huge and 2-3 people can definitely share an order of them together. Just keep that in mind when ordering. I also ordered apple juice that tasted watered down. Other than that the staff was great and helpful. There is also street parking available and I didn't have any trouble finding a spot. The wait for this restaurant can sometimes be long so I recommend joining the waitlist if you're in the area and want to go ."}
{"text":"What a nice visit.   The coffee is great and loved that I got a fresh cup when I refilled.   Menu is diverse and innovative.   Lots of vegetarian options for my hubby.   He had an omelette and I,  even though I am a carnivore, had the meatless benedict.  Everything fresh and tasty.  One of the owners,  Antonio,  was constantly walking the room to see how everyone was responding to the new place.   We will definitely be regulars!"}
{"text":"AMAZING! There was quite a bit of a wait but I can totally see why! The food is great and the service was awesome too. We got here right at brunch and there was live music. He took requests and did a great job. Food was fresh, coffee was good and timing was great too. Definitely will come back!"}
{"text":"First time here, and it's already one of my favorite places.  The atmosphere is amazing, the service is Wonderful, and the food ... oh my the food!  You can tell they take pride in their dishes because it is DELICIOUS, Absolutely delightful! I will be coming back here."}
{"text":"I went at a good time when it was not busy not busy in the morning. Service was good and the food was good. I like the menu cause it has a little bit of different things.. not just eggs and bacon. I definitely want to try a lot if other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Another yummy breakfast/lunch/brunch spot in town. Yummy, diverse menu with gluten free options. Wine and champagne available plus coffee bar. Maybe not the best place to take kids but you can. The place is small and not very fast on service so be prepared to wait and have to talk loud to your dining companions."}
{"text":"Kitchen Table is amazing! I am so thankful that such a great neighborhood restaurant has opened - Great breakfast, brunch or lunch...but also a great place to drop in & grab a muffin and a latte to go. The patio is great & we enjoyed all of the food."}
{"text":"This place was awwwwwesome. My gf is a local and we stopped here Easter weekend to escape the in-laws lol. I wish i got to come back another morning bc it was sucha cool menu and everything we ate was bomb.  I had the country benedict and i was so happy. We also had taquitos to start and they didnt disappoint one bit"}
{"text":"Wow. With all the excitement and excellent reviews about this place, I wasn't sure what to expect. When we came it was Saturday and there was a bit of a wait but nothing too crazy. Staff was very friendly and competent.   Their menu is unique, with some Mexican fusion options, flavored mimisas and a variety of homemade bakery goods. I ended up getting biscuits and gravy with scrambled eggs which wasn't even on the menu on the weekend but they made it  for me anyway!  Love this chef here! He is super nice and came out to talk to most of the dining room while we were eating.   Our food was nothing short of amazing.  The biscuits tasted homemade, as well as the chipotle gravy. I got it with scrambled eggs and man was I delicious.  I ate the whole plate in about five minutes. I also had a blackberry mimosa to drink which was light and refreshing. My boyfriend had the duck omelette which  was huge, i tried it and the duck was so tender, the cheese gooey, the potatoes seasoned and fresh -clearly another excellent choice here.  Kitchen table is a game changer because it combines an open atmosphere  layout with delicious unique food, 80s music cranking and friendly fast service. I don't give out 5 stars  easily,  but this place blew me away on more ways then one. Keep it  up kitchen table and we will be back with everyone we know!"}
{"text":"Every time I eat here the food is always amazing! You can also tell that customer service is important to them. The most recent time my boyfriend and I ate here, there wasn't a wait and we were seated right away. A couple minutes after being seated, Rafael had noticed we had been sitting a while without our server stopping by, so he went out of his way to help us and get our drinks until our server was able to assist us. I would definitely recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"Extremely average. This is more of a social club drinking place than a breakfast joint."}
{"text":"The freshest food in green valley,no one has a better brunch! Everything on the menu is exceptional,especially all those fresh pastries!!"}
{"text":"The food menu and descriptions are scrumptious but the food..... Not so much. The doughnut was hard be stale for me. Wish it was better!"}
{"text":"Best food I've had so far in my trip to Las Vegas . I recommend the chilaquiles with homemade salsa. Delicious coffee"}
{"text":"Great menu and patio (except there's no music), but the service was AWFUL!  Food is good."}
{"text":"The food and service are amazing. Everything is fresh and homemade. Will definitely be back a lot."}
{"text":"The food was top notch not to mention such friendly and attentive staff. My first time visiting this great restaurant but will definitely come back again. Everything we ordered were really, really good. Nice ambience and atmosphere."}
{"text":"I came here for brunch today and here are my thoughts. I really thought the decor was really cute and homey. They have a patio area which was pretty nice with live music. On average it seems that they have at least about a 30 minute wait on the weekends but you are able to be waitlisted if you are within 10 miles of the restaurant through yelp which is pretty awesome. They do have a decent sized menu and they offer beer and mimosas. My friend tried the blackberry mimosa which tasted ok and then I had the snickerdoodle latte which was actually really good. I had the fruit crepe which was ok and a side of potatoes which were pretty good. My friend had the Egyptian which he said was ok. I feel like the price is a little steep but I would definitely check it out at least once because the vibe is pretty cool."}
{"text":"Where do I begin with this place! Kitchen Table has been on a raider for quite some time now; everyone was raving about it. Now, it's not a restaurant in my neighborhood so I mentally had to prepare myself for the 'road trip'. And needless to say more, it was well worth it!  I got there around 1PM and was not anticipating a wait; 30 mins. They had a nice patio with enough seating for the ones waiting to indulge on some deliciousness. I started getting antsy & made my way inside. To the left is a cute little walk up 'cafe' I would call it. It's for the on the good quick grabs. Loved his concept! I ordered a guava mimosa to enjoy while I waited. Fresh baked goods were also displayed on the counter. My only concern for this is that it was open. Customers are constantly walking up and hovering over these goods. The least we would want is germs and debris falling on them. My only recommendation is to cover them with those cute bulbous glass covers.   Now the food! Mind you I have been very excited to try this place out so I was constantly looking at pictures on Yelp and IG. Everything looked amazing! We were the 2nd table from the kitchen and joked that it was the worse table; I changed my mind on my order about 3x. Everything that was coming out was perfectly displayed and approved from one of the head Chefs. Our starter was the bacon and egg shooter; something like a deviled egg. It's was perfect. So much flavor in one bite! My entree consisted of the Pork Belly Bene. My mouth was bursting with flavor in ever bite! Now if you are not a fan of spicy, I suggest to steer away from this dish. The pork was so tender! The hollandaise was probably the best I have had yet & and I love my bennies. You could taste every ingredient and nothing was over powerful. I also was able to sneak in a bite of the Social Burger; amazing! The meat was perfect cooked and didn't skimp you out on the patty. Every bite stayed in tacked allowing the bread to never flatten.   Being in the hospitality industry I am more aware to customer service than one should be. This place nailed it. Everything was perfect from me first walking in to leaving. The presence of the chefs was always a nice touch. It's something you don't see that often in a neighborhood restaurant.   I'll be back next weekend! I already have the tacos on my mind."}
{"text":"Great place to have breakfast, i highly recommended it. The staff is very friendly and the place is clean and neat."}
{"text":"This is a lovely brunch place with extremely delicious food!!!! I'm not much of a traditional pancake and bacon type of person so their variety of savory Benedicts won me over. My group of 6 and I ordered the Pork Belly Benedict ($15), Meatless Benedict ($11) and Shorty Benedict ($15). We also ordered the Peach Mimosa ($8) and a sangria. I didn't see a bottomless mimosa option but I can see why they don't because no one would probably ever leave! The place it self is quite small but there is also an outside seating available. My party was seated inside and can't image how hot it would be to be outside..  I personally ordered the meatless Benedict and it was to die for-- It was my first time actually having a poached egg and it was perfect on top of the English muffin! A down about my dish was that I didn't get the house potatoes with it but the fruit sufficed.  Major Tip--- call ahead for a reservation or check in online and reserve your seats! We came in at 1030 AM on a Saturday without calling ahead and waited an hour. Though it was a long wait and extremely hot, the food made up for it!"}
{"text":"Just moved to the area and I must say I LOVE this place. We haven't been to many places in Henderson yet, but for now I don't even want to know anything else. This is one of the best places for brunch I have ever been to. I just found out the owner is also the chef which explains the attention to detail and amazing dishes that are being served. I cannot wait to go back and try more dishes. I had the ham and cheese crepe. Delicious!! My husband had the eggs with the pork belly - perfectly cooked, a lil spicy kick to it... amazing too. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"We recently went to the Kitchen Table for breakfast and had the chilaquiles and country benedict.  The chilaquiles as recommended by the waiter was great.  Also, the chipolte gravy on the country was very good.  The service was okay but our server seemed to change mid service and the chef stopped as some tables not all or ours.  I later recommended KT to a friend and upon her visit the hostess told her that three servers had not shown up to work yet so the wait was going to be longer than usual.  If the food stays consistent and the service/wait times improve than i can see an updated review of five stars in the future."}
{"text":"Wow! 5 stars all the way! The food quality is top notch and will exceed your expectations. The pictures on Yelp do not do it justice. They were very busy at 11am on a Sunday, but the wait was only 20 minutes. They have a bar at the entrance so you can enjoy a coffee our alcoholic drink while you wait!   The staff is very friendly and the service is excellent. We ordered the French toast with a side of fruit and the beef short rib benny. The French toast is large thick cuts of French bread and has a nice orange zest flavoring that melts in your mouth! The short rib benny is superb. A large portion of short rib and perfectly poached eggs topped with bernaise sauce! One of the best breakfasts we have experienced in Vegas. We will definitely be back and next time we will try one of there many mimosa flavors!"}
{"text":"Food was great but be prepared to wait --especially on the weekends. The French toast was amazing as was the meatless Benedict. Staff is also super friendly and accommodating."}
{"text":"Greatness.  Ate here twice for breakfast.  Awesome taste and flavors here.  Huge servings and great service.  Try the breakfast tacos!!"}
{"text":"I went to Kitchen Table for the first time last weekend. It was around 8 am and was very busy. The host greeted me right away and I waited for a table. I didn't have to wait very long. I noticed that all the staff was very busy, and very cheerful. I was seated within a few minutes and had a wonderful breakfast. I ordered eggs with fresh fruit and it was delicious. I noticed that each table was full and there was a line of people waiting to get in when I left. I would recommend this place to others and hope they expand their hours. Excellent food and great service! Try it, you'll like it."}
{"text":"Don't go here. It's too busy and I hate lines. Please stay home and let the true foodies enjoy this place. The atmosphere and service is great. Food is amazing, especially breakfast."}
{"text":"We are at our 3rd visit here for breakfast. My husband loves it! Unique menu and lots of spicy choices like jalapeño bacon.   I love their coffee and especially the vanilla cappuccino. I had the French toast last time. Didn't care for the flavor. They use a sweeter bread and an amaretto batter. So maybe others will enjoy it, just not for me.   Also they have a great assortment of pastries that they said they make fresh overnight.    Very nice decor and option to sit outside with dogs too I believe."}
{"text":"Servicescape  There was a large parking lot upon entering the shopping center where the Kitchen Table Restaurant is located. There were plenty of parking spots and the parking facility itself was clean. The restaurant is hidden behind a corner lot so it was a bit hard to find at first, but we found a large sign with an arrow leading us to the restaurant. There is outdoor seating waiting area as well as a patio dining area near the front. We walked inside and immediately saw the very modern and rustic décor and farm style dining tables. There is a small hostess stand to the right and we were seated immediately. There is also a small bakery counter to the left of the front doors and the aroma of fresh monkey bread and cinnamon rolls hits you instantly. I could not stop looking at all the nice wall and table décor. The ceiling was also tiled nicely, and the walls by the bathroom had a very modern paint design although, the restaurant itself is quite small. There were only about 8 tables with a larger family style farm table in the corner.  Food Evaluation  We ordered the Tacos Heuvos and the Granola Crusted French Toast. Presentation is everything and these plates did not disappoint. The presentation of the tacos with all the colorful notes from the eggs, avocado, potatoes, roasted red and green chilies, salsa, and white crème drizzle along with the smell of fresh corn tortillas and soft cooked scrambled eggs brought a smile to my face. First bite of the taco was warm with a crispy flakiness to the tortilla, the eggs were scrambled soft with pepper and salted well, the salsa was spicy but the cool and creaminess of the avocado made the taco balanced. The warm potatoes added a nice softness and the crème anglaise gave the taco a nice wetness. The french toast had a bakery smell to it with a hint of cinnamon. The french toast was cooked to a golden brown and the granola crusted edges looked crispy and warm. The french toast had whip cream on the top and the white whip cream was melting down the sides of the toast. There was also a creamy yellow drizzle of glaze that gave the presentation a nice touch. The french toast had a crispy yet moist texture and the middle was soft and spongy. The mixture of salt from the granola and the sweetness of the crème drizzle and whip cream gave the dish a good balance. The toast was warm and the cinnamon, salt, and crème gave the dish a great flavor when paired with the aroma of a mild bakery and sweet crème."}
{"text":"This was a great find.  The hot chocolate was decadent, and we enjoyed everything we ordered.  I highly recommend the short rib benny."}
{"text":"Really glad I finally got a Sunday off to check this place out! Food was awesome! Had the empanadas to start with which were very flavorful. Hard to choose if the prickly pear or guava mimosa was my favorite since they both ruled. My friend loved her strawberry shortcake French toast.(good call using challah bread, it was perfect) I enjoyed the smoked salmon Benedict. Hollandaise sauce was delicious! Server was sweet and attentive and the whole atmosphere was cozy. Only weird thing was that my friend was missing a page on her menu? Good call having the wait list option since they get busy! Now I can tell why it is so popular, great stuff!"}
{"text":"O!M!G! This place is outstanding! The drinks are amazing and fairly priced, the food is mouth watering, the atmosphere is adorable, and the staff is delightful! If you haven't eaten here you must give it a try. I gotta go I have a veggie sandwich waiting for me. This place is a yes from me."}
{"text":"I had this placed bookmarked from reading fellow Yelpers reviews for a couple of weeks. Since  I was having my car serviced out in Henderson on Saturday, I decided to give this place a try. We arrived at about 9:30am and we had a five minute wait from the time we walked in to sitting down. The hostess that greeted us was really friendly and made us feel welcome. I noticed there was outdoor seating but it was not offered. I suppose I should have asked..... Anyway we sat inside towards the back of the restaurant and it was a good location to watch the action and quiet enough to have conversation. They play some good music but at just the right volume.   The menu is full of some fun and different meals. It was a hard choice to pick just one but I ended up ordering Tacos Huevos and Mom had the Eggs in the Basket. She is not too adventurous when it comes to breakfast but her meal was still a good choice. She ordered coffee with her meal and the coffee cups are huge. For those coffee drinkers out there, you won't be disappointed as you can get your caffeine on with these cups! They also offer all kinds of flavored mimosas from your basic orange to guava. I enjoyed the peach which was more like a Bellini but great way to start the morning.   The food arrived and the presentation was nice. There were three tacos with potatoes, eggs, chili's, avocados and crema on top. The salsa on the side had a nice kick and complimented the mini tacos. Three tacos was the right amount to serve as one more would have been too much. The Eggs in the Basket came with wheat toast and the egg was right in the middle of the toast with two strips of bacon on top and a little slaw.   Our service was very good and the decor is a touch of modern and homey. When you first walk in there is a mini bakery with fresh muffins, monkey bread, and other assorted breads for sale. Everyone that works there seems to be very friendly and cool. I accidentally spilled my Moms coffee and it was cleaned up very quickly. Only one draw back, there is only one bathroom which when the place gets busy means you gotta wait so watch how many of those mimosas you drink (Ha! Ha!).   We left about 11:00, and there was a wait at this time with lots of people sitting outside enjoying the beautiful morning. This place is pretty easy to find, you just have to be careful not to pass it when you reach the light at Horizon Ridge Parkway. It is in a strip mall and on the corner.  I definitely plan to return again so I can have the chilaquiles next time!"}
{"text":"When traversing the Yelpiverse for a good breakfast spot, I found this - Kitchen Table. In a tiny corner of a strip mall the place is cute and pretty welcoming. We decided to go for some birthday brunch.  We dined al-fresco, which is always nice. I ordered the eggs in a basket, the avocado toast, and the berry crepe. The eggs in a basket was completely underwhelming. I was hoping that something amazing was to become of my egg-cooked-in-bread. Alas, it was not to be.   The avocado toast was good. But nothing spectacular. The bacon was crispy, the tomatoes were roasted perfectly, but the avocado smash just did not have the required amount of flavor to make me say \"WOW!\"  The berry crepe was good, although very sweet. Now, I expect a crepe to be sweet, but when I cannot eat the whole thing because it is just too much - some sugar should be removed.  The service was nice, and prompt. The seating was OK, and the outdoor area was well-kept. It just didn't make me say \"I HAVE to have breakfast here again.\""}
{"text":"It's like they thought \"how many people can we squish into this place at once\". There isn't even enough room for a server and guest to pass at the same time. The tables are too close together and too high for someone sitting against the wall. The food is super basic. I'm kinda annoyed Yelp recommended them while we're staying just off the strip"}
{"text":"Oh man is this place amazing!! I was recommended by a friend to check out Kitchen Table and it was the best food decision I ever made! I've been here countless times for brunch. They also serve lunch here. I've only tried their breakfast items so I can't speak for their lunch but if it's anything like their breakfast then it's amazing.  They are only open until 3 so this is a breakfast/lunch place only. It's pretty small so expect to wait, especially on the weekends. Trust me, it's worth it. You can always order a mimosa or coffee while you wait. It's the most unique restaurant I've been to in a long time. You know the service is great when you finish your water and literally within seconds the waitress magically appears out of nowhere to fill up your glass when the restaurant is packed.  Okay now to the food.. Oh.my.god. I apologize if I butcher the names... I've had the Egg Mac Kitchen which puts any breakfast sandwich to shame, the croque madame (my absolute favorite) and breakfast tacos (they're not called breakfast tacos but they were tacos). Literally everything I have had I love. I'm one of those people that likes to snoop on other tables and see what they ordered and everything on their plate is absolute perfection. I can't express enough how great this place is.  Let's not forget the mimosas! They have a ton of flavors that actually taste like the flavor! There are so many places that say Oh this is a blackberry mimosa, then it tastes like a glass of champagne and water. Not here! They actually taste like champagne and blackberry! They also have peach, Cranberry, pear, and a ton more.  You seriously need to try this place. I haven't brought one person here that didn't fall in love."}
{"text":"Wow. Just wow. We first started off with an orange cranberry coffee cake and the lemon cranberry coffee cake. Delicious. The lemon cranberry was delightfully gooey on the inside. Then we had a pineapple and guava mimosa. I preferred the guava over the pineapple. My boyfriend had the chilaquiles which was a blend between perfection and spicy. The pork was so tender. I had the tacos huevos which was beautifully presented and tasted just the same. We shared the jalapeño bacon, I have NEVER tasted bacon so good before. The people sitting next to us were friendly. We had conversations with everyone around us. True breakfast joint. My compliments to the chef, who comes out to the tables and ask what your opinion. I was blown away by the service and food.   Will most definitely return. I can't wait to try everything on the menu, which is also unique. Ask about the chef's story."}
{"text":"This relax rustic style neighborhood restaurant is a great find with quality food and amazing selections on the menu. We ordered the shorty that was fabulous, the meat was tender with good flavor. The pancake was also delish with maple sauce. White chocolate French toast was yummy. If you are in henderson area make sure to have breakfast or lunch at kitchen table"}
{"text":"Great breakfast and excellent service. Thought at times it can get noisy because it's a small space."}
{"text":"Ok, I've been here twice now and it's definitely a great spot.  However, my first visit was better than the 2nd. I just wasn't as impressed with my food the 2nd time around, although it was still good.  On my 1st trip, I had the Country Benedict and it was EVERYTHING!! I was having trouble deciding whether I wanted eggs bennie or CFS, and this was the perfect compromise because it's BOTH! It was so dang delicious and I still dream about it.  The 2nd visit, I couldn't decide between the pastrami hash or chilaquiles. I went with the hash and I just wasn't impressed. It was a strange dish.....and the pastrami was almost non-existent (although in the picture it looks like there's a lot - this is not true. They were these weird little strips and the dish was just strange). Now I wish I would've tried the chilaquiles instead. Oh well, maybe next time. My friend and I also shared the foie gras french toast, which was AMAZING!! It was really good, and although you might think $22 is a lot of a breakfast dish - FOIE! Pretty hard to beat, and the serving was pretty large.   The guava mimosa I had was really yummy, but I wasn't a fan of the blackberry version (although that was my friend's fave).  This eatery is small and cute and made to be a \"social\" dining experience, with a large communal table highlighting the dining room. The service is great and there is definitely something for everyone on the menu. I just wish they would serve bloody marys - or at least a good michelada (right now they only serve beer/wine).  I 100% will be back and I suggest you go check it out ASAP!! Note that they don't take reservations and it gets very busy - so take your patience and appetite and be prepared to wait!"}
{"text":"Food: We just wanted a basic breakfast, so we got the Blue Collar which is eggs, bacon or sausage and toast. Even though we ordered a boring breakfast and it appears they are very creative here, everything tasted super fresh and seasoned just right. OJ was freshly squeezed. They had freshly baked goods on the table when we walked in and I was so tempted to try them all but was too full. Will have to try the monkey bread next time.  Ambiance: Really like the vibe here, acoustic music, rustic tables/decor and upscale. Felt like I was eating in Napa.  Service: Excellent. Attentive, fast and friendly. Will be back!"}
{"text":"The is definitely a hidden Gem! Chef Javier was fantastic and the food was Devine! The service was outstanding. Can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"A pleasant surprise tucked away in the Henderson hills. The atmosphere is very country and the service was excellent. I wasn't expecting the food to be as chic as it was. Very original menus items and upscale offerings. An above average dinning experience. I highly recommend the country Benedict."}
{"text":"This is the 3rd time we've attempted to eat here. After a year we decided to try again. I will never come back. They seated a 7top who arrived 10 min after us with only 1 person there. 30 min later after leaving there were only  two members of the party seated. With a little one we were more than willing to wait our turn. 3 parties our size or 1 less were seated after us even though we were there beforehand.  We said we would eat outside and were not seated with plenty of open tables. If your hours are 730 to 330 you have 1 shift. Why not be able to fill capacity with such limited space? Poor management."}
{"text":"I have heard good things about this place. My family and I tried to come here months ago and the wait was outrageous. ...Came back to try it recently, the wait time is still the same (30-45 mins) but if you aren't that hungry and can wait patiently... the food is WORTH IT. Kitchen Table has the best breakfast food I have ever had. Unique atmosphere to Green Valley and everything we ate was awesome! They know what they are doing. P.S. Landon was great! He was super nice, had great recommendations, and was very knowledgeable. ...Enjoy!"}
{"text":"First time eating here on a very busy Wednesday afternoon. Food and atmosphere were great. Our waiter was nice, but seemed kind of scattered. Probably due to the volume of business that was going on. My father ordered a foie Gras and apple pancake creation that takes 25 minutes to bake. My complaint is that we should have been informed of that extra wait time at the time of ordering. My father probably would have gotten something different, had he known. The minor hiccups with the service are the only reason this place gets points off. I would definitely return because they have a lot of interesting items on the menu. Hopefully I can come back at a time when they are less busy."}
{"text":"*Military discount*   Went on Sunday 2-21-16 at 9:50 AM with my girl Jamie P.  This restaurant is located on Horizon Ridge and Valle Verde in Henderson.  The place was busy but we only had to wait about 30 minutes. The hostess puts your name on the list and then comes to find you when your table is ready.  I can only imagine they do that by writing down a small description of you.  It's a nice change from just hollering out names and I thought it was unique.  I wondered what my description said.  Probably \"hangry lady with floral pants\".    When I put our name on the wait list I told the hostess two adults and a high chair, please.  We were seated inside at a cramped table.  People were packed in there like sardines!!  Chef Antonio offered to take my stroller to the front for safe keeping since there was literally no room at the table, which I appreciated. No high chair was ever brought, nor did they bring utensils or water for my son.  This place seems to not be very kid-friendly.  Most places at least have crayons or something for the kiddos.    $30.28 got me a biscuit, PB&J pancakes, coffee, a mimosa, a tostada, and a side of fresh fruit for the boy.  I also sampled my friend's taquitos, croque madam, jalapeno bacon, and pecan roll. They were out of two things that we ordered and we had to make a last minute substitutions with the waitress breathing down our necks.   It took about an hour before any food came out of the kitchen.   $6.00 Pineapple mimosa was tasty...very natural, fruity, and fizzy.  This is my first mimosa so I have nothing to compare it to but it was very refreshing and I enjoyed it.    $3 biscuit with house made jam was delicious.  It was buttery, flaky, warm, and everything a good biscuit should be.  Their house made jam was exceptional and went very well with the biscuit.    $6.00 fresh berries and fruit consisted of a coffee cup full of cantaloupe, fresh pineapple, and one strawberry cut up on top.  It was my son's breakfast and after waiting an hour and 20 minutes for it he began to melt down. Turns out it was just sitting on the pass and out waitress forgot about it.  With no high chair it was like trying to tame a wild, rabid, wolverine.  He finally calmed down after his fruit arrived.   $8.00 Tostada was....alright.  The tortillas were nice and crispy and topped with black beans, pork, a refreshing cilantro slaw, and a quail egg.  A little too expensive for two tostadas, although they were much better than the $9 taquitos which were poorly rolled, broken, and had almost no filling.    The best part of the meal was the PB&J pancakes.  They didn't even need syrup.  I would have loved a bit more peanut butter and jelly but I found myself wishing I could eat these again tonight.     The whole time we were there I was sweating.  The thermostat on the wall said 80 degrees which is just too hot for me to be able to enjoy eating.  Also it took a little over two hours to eat here which is just too long IMO.  You can get a meal comparable to this elsewhere, cheaper, and faster.    We paid and I went to the front to get my stroller and they had it folded and shoved it up under an armoire by the hostess stand.  Thanks for putting my stroller on your dirty floor underneath the armoire.  I loved pulling the dust bunnies off it."}
{"text":"Kitchen Table is a standout breakfast spot. Not by any means is it your typical neighborhood cafe. It's deep into a part of Henderson I'm not too familiar, but totally worth the drive.   At 8 in the morning on a Saturday, we pulled up to find the indoor area packed.  With only few tables available, we were kindly greeted and seated inside right away (more space outside, but it was a bit chilly this morning).  That menu, damn, there is so much good stuff! I wanted to try so much but was only able to try a few today:  Monkey Bread ($5): warm cinnamon glazed bread balls - an appetizer that's more like a tasty doughnutty dessert  Sausage Sampler ($15): three thick sausages with sides of maple dipping sauces  Pork Belly Bene ($15): The pork had a nice crisp and the fresh greens was a nice touch too.  That jalapeño hollandaise was a tad hot for me.  Kitchen Table's menu has everything your breakfast tummy needs: pancakes, omelettes, french toast, benedicts, and really, so much more. What makes it great is that they take all those things and elevate it to a unique meal.   Things I want to try on my next visit: foie french toast, chilaquiles, fruit crepe..."}
{"text":"My wife, friend and I all came in Sunday morning. We were kindly greeted and seated  instantly. We were given our menus and asked for our drink order right off the bat also. I was happy to see that they serve beer and mimosas. I personally ordered a vanilla ice coffee though. It was amazing. I then ordered the Blue Collar. A standard breakfast. I absolutely loved it. Eggs cooked perfectly, love the house potatoes and quite a selection of sausage. I got the Texas Jalapeno Hot Link. Great breakfast. My friend got the pork belly green chili breakfast. Can't remember the name but he loved it. My wife ordered the eggs in a basket and she loved it as well. We had amazing service and it was a great social environment. The manager had even introduced herself to us. She was very nice.  I'd recommend this place to anyone. Great food, great drinks and great service."}
{"text":"I've been there once for breakfast, had the meat lovers dish, it was great!  I don't eat carbs so this was perfect for me. I'd like to go again soon."}
{"text":"First time at kitchen table and it was the cutest! Last minute brunch date successful  Gluten free sweet bread recommended. We will be sure to spread the word and of course be back ourselves!"}
{"text":"Let's start by saying I had no problem finding the place, and I'm from out of town. Green Valley ends at Horizon Ridge, and there it is on the corner... Easy peasy, Place is adorable! beautiful menu, presentation and loved the wood tables and cute plates, service was friendly and very welcoming... food was on point and well seasoned, coffee strong and refilled promptly plus they give you enough cream for many refills... hey it's the little things, Would I go back? Oh yeah that menu had some amazing things I'd like to try, and a bakery to boot, the patio is gorgeous maybe I'll eat there next time!!"}
{"text":"This place is one of my favorites. Cozy setting, welcoming staff, and a pleasant vibe all around. Love that they remember me and they always say hi even if they are slammed. Food quality is on point and some of the best foie breakfast dishes I've ever tried. This will be my spot for entertaining out of town guests as well.."}
{"text":"Great new place - eclectic menu made fresh as you wait - good wait staff and everyone is very friendly"}
{"text":"Good food but the atmosphere is an atrocity. It is super hott in here where it is intolerable. Will not go back cause its too hott!"}
{"text":"I waited to long to try Kitchen Table! Great Service, great food and great prices!!!!"}
{"text":"Fun, tasty, and fresh food, baked goods are awesome, nothing great to eat while on a diet here, but a great place to break one."}
{"text":"Excellent food and great ambience. Outdoor seating is nice in spring time!!!  Had the French toast and it was good. Great service and price is moderate."}
{"text":"Super yummy Mexican breakfast!!! Saturday morning they were busy, but didn't have to wait long. The service was really good. I had a peach mimosa and my husband had the bloody beer, we both thought they were good. I had chilaquiles and my husband had the chorizo omelet. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Delicious! Awesome food, great choices. Super fresh, no diner food here. Great service."}
{"text":"Just wanted to add.....THE PANCAKES ARE BRILLIANT! Light and moist, didn't even need butter. Best pancakes I've had in Vegas."}
{"text":"I'm a crab cake connoisseur. Not really I just love crab cakes. A lot of places are super sparing on the crab in the cakes. Not this place! The cakes themselves are a really good size and full of crab and super tasty. This place has a ton of deliciousness on the menu but that's one of my favs! The staffs always been great and super quick. Love this breakfast/brunch spot."}
{"text":"I look for excuses to come here. I love it so much! The food is incredible and there is a wide array of options for people with different diets (i.e. vegetarian). The drinks are also amazing, too! There are several hot drinks available that are delicious, and some creative mimosas! The staff is fast, efficient, and always provide above and beyond service. Thank you for always providing a great experience!"}
{"text":"Always the best food and great service!  Try something different every time you go.  So far the pork belly green chilie is my favorite."}
{"text":"So tried this spot with a couple of friends. Walked in and there is a wait to be seated. Luckily we had already checked in through yelp. The seating is very cramped but overall the look was super cute. Service was great. Food was great."}
{"text":"The good: The food. I had the foie mac muffin. Flavors were balanced. This was a well-executed dish. Service was good.  The bad: Long wait times, which means you may end up sitting in the 100+ degree heat for 35 minutes waiting to be seated."}
{"text":"Dem green chilaquiles tho, so good. Service was great, atmosphere is fun, 5/5 would stuff face again."}
{"text":"Amazing food! Went there for brunch! Friendly staff and it meant so much to my colleague that the chef came to our table personally! They definitely need to advertise as the place was not as packed as it should have been! Again, the food was AMAZING! I would only suggest to expand beverages: maybe some fresh squeezed juices! We definitely would have paid more for our bill! 5 stars !"}
{"text":"This place is a Henderson gem!  The duck and Mac n cheese omlet is to die for. Little restaurant but food and service is always welcoming."}
{"text":"We went last weekend. The mimosas are FANTASTIC - they use these great purées in all the best flavors. Also they have gluten free sweet bread which was great. I loved having GF options. Every dish we saw come to the tables around us looked delicious as well. Highly recommend!  Shout out to manager Melanie who is super sweet and awesome."}
{"text":"My family came here for Easter breakfast and we were expecting a super long wait due to the holidays but it wasn't bad at all. The hostess greeted us and was super friendly. The moment you walk in, there's an open bakery to grab some monkey bread or chocolate chips, you can sneak a peak in the small kitchen. The place was cute and felt like home.  Some of us got hot  and I got Mexican hot chocolate, super yummy it's more of a spicy cinnamon hot chocolate. Definitely got a kick. It's topped with torched marshmallows and chocolate syrup. Maybe because it was busy but our food took a little long to get but everything came out right and everyone like the food.  The bourbon syrup that came with my husband pancakes were also delish! We wanted to buy it but it was $12 for a small Bottle, were talking like travel sized listerine bottle here.. a little steep for my liking. But overall  Can't wait to go back.   Updated: When first time we ate here, I didn't really want to include the service because the food was really good. But when we went, refills took a long time and we ordered a side of hash browns, which they ended up giving for free because we were done eating and they finally came out. Next time we came, Sarah, the manager came by and made sure we were taken care of. Our food came out super fast and our server was so attentive and great! Seems like the place is more organized."}
{"text":"We had the pleasure of having brunch here this morning and it was great !! Our server, mike was very friendly and personable! He was also very on top of checking on us (our coffee and water cups were always filled). We had the pork belly eggs Benedict which was so flavorful with just the right amount of spice ! We also had the duck confit and cheese omelette which was also amazing ! Both dished came with potatoes that were seasoned to perfection! The star of the show was the foie gras French toast with came with pecans and caramelized pecans which all complimented each other! We will definitely be coming back !!"}
{"text":"Service was good. Food was good.   The Jalapeño bacon was a little too spicy for me..  First thing in the morning before the hustle and bustle it's a really neat spot to have breakfast."}
{"text":"Wonderful restaurant with a great brunch menu!  The kitchen accidentally made a mistake w our order. They handed it very professionally and apologized more than was necessary. Definitely will be back many more times in the future!"}
{"text":"Had brunch here and the food was amazing. It's a great place if you want unique brunch items and a really chill atmosphere. The croque madame and Monte Cristo were very satisfying. The wait staff were very attentive, despite it being really busy. I would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"I was here for breakfast, I decided to sit outside since the day was perfect. The menu i received was ripped paper stapled to each other lol So I decided to get the chilaquiles , The shredded pork was pretty much shredded fat. I didnt expect it since they show off their smoker, in the patio. I thought it would be better tasting, Other than that , the only thing i liked that i ordered was probably the over priced orange juice and my water. I think the omlet house is way tastier than this place. If you want a real breakfast dont bother to come here, but if you want to act rich and stuck up , you can come to this place. :) but your food will probably taste not so good. oh well , at least it was a nice area."}
{"text":"Absolutely wonderful! The wait was a little long (it is a holiday weekend!) but the chef checked in on us and the whole staff took very good care of us! The food was delicious!! The service amazing!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I got burnt out with all the overpriced, trendy restaurants in Vegas so we decided to venture out to nearby cities for other options.  Henderson area seemed to have several good restaurants, and the location seemed family friendly, so we decided to check out this place as our first option.  I was rather amazed with the food here.  Even compared to many of the breakfast places in OC and LA, I thought this place was better than most of them.  I always have a tough time eating out for breakfast because traditional breakfast items are extremely boring to me.  I didn't find too many boring items here.  Almost everything on the menu looked good, and this place did a great job making enough tweaks and twists on traditional items to make them interesting.  Even the maple syrup at this place isn't typical.  It uses Noble brand maple syrup, which is matured in charred oak barrel with a little bit of bourbon.  It has a rather distinct, robust taste compared to other maple syrups.  I had a tough time deciding what to order because I wanted to order at least 70% of the items on the menu.  I eventually narrowed it down and went with Monkey Bread, Peaches and Cream Pancakes, and Shorty Benedict.  The Monkey Bread seems to be the most popular item here because almost every table ordered one.  It's a simple bread glazed with salted caramel and cinnamon sugar.  It's served warm on a cast iron skillet.  At first bite it kind of reminded me of a cinnamon bun, but more dense and less sweet (due to lack of icing).  I didn't think it was mind-blowing or anything to have an orgasm over, but still very good.  I definitely would recommend this to all first time visitors.    Peaches and Cream Pancakes were simply delicious. My wife said it was the best pancakes she ever had.  I thought this was going to be too sweet and rich, but it was actually just right.  There was enough sweetness but certainly not overwhelming.  It was good even without any syrup, but I still poured a little bit on, just so I can experience what Noble brand syrup tastes like.    Shorty is a braised short rib Benedict, which comes with poached eggs, red wine reduction, and hollandaise on English muffin.  Eggs were poached perfectly and short rib was very tender.    This place also has a decent selection of beer, wine, mimosas, and few other alcoholic beverages.  I didn't see one on the menu but I saw some people drinking Bloody Mary, so there may be other alcoholic beverages not listed on the menu.  The restaurant is difficult to see from the parking lot because it's located diagonally on the corner.  Just look for Shabu Shabu Paradise, which is located next to this place.    This place is pretty popular around here.  We came little before 11 a.m. on a Monday and had to wait about half hour for our table. Luckily the food came out fairly quickly once we were seated.  Service was friendly and attentive."}
{"text":"Rafael waited on my friend and I, he was super friendly & inviting. We were totally newbies today so we asked him what he recommends. He lead us in the all the right directions!! Everything was so delicious & seasoned perfectly. We had the pork belly bene, chilaquiles with chicken, and egg tacos. I definitely recommend all three !!! The Chef Pedro came out to greet us to see how the food was, he was really nice. Chef Pedro did a great job with menu! Melanie came over to greet us as well. Melanie was so sweet and spoke to us a little bit about herself and how she started with Kitchen Table. Overall the experience was memorable."}
{"text":"I rolled in solo on a Sunday morning. I had bookmarked Kitchen Table about a month prior, so I thought it would be good to swing by since I could add myself to the waitlist right from the Yelp app! I had spent the morning at Seven Magic Mountains and and needed some grub.   The place was packed, minus the Patio. I imagine that once summer comes to a close, the patio will be magical, but there were some breve would dining in the 105 degree heat. I was not so brave and ended up at a table inside against the wall. There were all kinds of groups-ladies brunch group, families, couples-so it a great location for any occasion.   Maria was my server and brought coffee and water right away. The menu is full of juicy and delicious treats that I wanted to try but I kept it simple and had a side of bacon with the Meatless Benedict. It sounded amazing, but I felt it was missing a bit of flavor. Salt perhaps? But there was none on the table and I didn't want to ask for it because you never know if it's an intentional choice by the chef. It came with a side of fruit and although I wished it had a bit more of a WOW factor in regards the flavor of Benedict, the fried green tomatoes gave a nice texture with the English muffin and hollandaise. Avocado addition was nice, but almost unnecessary.  The ambiance, service, and full choice of menu items is enough to bring me back to try more things. I won't be diving into the Meatless Benedict again, but you better believe that I'm going try the Monkey Bread that the table next to me ordered."}
{"text":"starting a slow morning @this restaurant is a great idea. this place is always popular n busy so better go when u hav enough time. they serve traditional American breakfast. however the food r awesome. i reccomend their famous Mexican hot chocolate with charred marshmallows."}
{"text":"I almost don't want to write a review, because I don't want to wait longer than I already do for a table! We've been here twice so far and each time was amazing. We've tried the carrot and walnut muffin, the ham and cheese crepe, the chicken fried eggs Benedict, the normal Benedict and the monkey bread. I know here's more to add to the list but I've forgotten! Our kids love this place and Anthony couldn't be a better host or chef!  I would have more pictures but it's gone before I can get my phone :) I hope this place is around for the long haul, we've needed somewhere like this for a long long time"}
{"text":"I have been to this location a few times and the only reason why it's getting a two star review is because of the service. The food is absolutely amazing, especially for having such a small menu. My first experience here I didn't even get to try the food because I sat at my table for almost 20 minutes without even having a server come by. it was on a weekday in the late morning and not busy which was confusing. When I asked the front hostess if somebody could at least bring me water she said someone would be right by and no one ever came. I ended up walking out and leaving without ever having contact with any staff. I did go back another time with a group of friends, and the service was still mediocre. It's pretty disappointing because the menu is great but they need to work on their customer service."}
{"text":"When I'm in the mood for a good home cooked breakfast I head out to Kichen Table. The menu is very creative. I have been there several times and still have not tried everything . Staff is amazing! They don't skip a beat! My coffee is always fresh and hot. To start make sure you try there selection if muffins. If you ask me my favorite , would have to say chiliquiles.. ancho sauce, oaxacan cheese, smoked pork,scrambled eggs, black beans and 1 sunny side up egg....Don't forget your peach mimosa! This is across town from me,  but has quickly become my families favorite place to meet.Worth a visit people!"}
{"text":"Can I give a negative review? No stars!!! In fact, like a negative five stars!!!!  We were told a 45 min wait and after 2 hrs(our fault for waiting that long) and watching them seat their regulars or family members or friends as soon as they walked in, we finally couldn't take I anymore!!!!  Even when we told them they could take us off the list, that had the audacity to tell us that it would just be a few more minutes that they were getting our table ready when you could plainly see that there were NO empty tables!!!!  That was not the first time over the last two hours that they had  told us the same exact thing!!!  This was our fourth time there and obviously we have not been there often enough to become regulars. No worries, that will be the last time we go there or refer anybody there!!!!  That should make it easier on all the regulars, family and friends that obviously don't have to wait as long as the rest of us."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite brunch spots in Henderson / Green Valley. Everything I've tasted on their menu has been spectacular. They have plenty of options for your sweet (strawberry shortcake French toast, or peaches and cream pancake) or savory (croque madame or tacos huevos) cravings, and they offer gluten-free versions of many of their dishes. Their Mexican Hot Chocolate with torch-blown marshmallows is as beautiful as it is delicious (see attached photo), and their \"Social Bucket\" of champagne (one bottle, your choice of juice, and as many glasses as you can fill) is the perfect way to start off your meal with friends.   A warning: this place is ALWAYS busy on the weekends. However, you can join the waiting list through Yelp! so that you do not have to physically be at the restaurant in order to get in line. If you use this feature, though, you are still required to check in with the hostess once you arrive. My only complaint with this is that they often times give you a 20-ish minute window of time for when you will be seated, and you are seated towards the end of that window (if not a bit beyond it) more often than not. But that's what happens when you decide to dine at one of the best breakfast / brunch places in town (and it sure beats not getting on the waiting list at all, and having to wait for a full hour or more to be seated)!"}
{"text":"The food actually is unique and the atmosphere much better than the surrounding breakfast/brunch options. The thing is, the lack of organization and slow service makes it hard to enjoy the great things about this place. The wait can be over 30 minutes and the seating order is haphazard, so larger parties that come after you can end up being seated first. The dining area is also more crowded than comfortable, making it hard to find any privacy.  If the above doesn't matter much to you,  I'd recommend the empanada appetizers. The avocado toast had a wonderful flavor but the toast wasn't toasted - just avocado on bread. I'm hoping they can be a little more organized and really make this place shine."}
{"text":"This place was amazing!!! I'm sad that I can't remember our waitress's name but her service was fantastic! The food was DELICIOUS!!! My coworker who lives in Henderson recommended this place so four of us met up there for lunch and needless to say, I was certainly not disappointed. It's really cute, with a cool vibe and there are really long tables so you get to socialize with other parties if you want, which I think is such a cute idea. Their coffee was delicious and so is their iced coffee as well. I got their breakfast taquitos which were soooo good. Very good portion, especially for the price. Super high quality for the price too. The breakfast taquitos tasted delicious but also looked beautiful: just excellent presentation. They were only $9!! My friends empanadas were yummy too, lots of delicious melty cheese. Then I tried my other friends' items: French toast and traditional eggs Benedict. Both were excellent. The French toast had such a good flavor and the homemade syrup on the table was perfect on the French toast. Extremely fair prices, excellent quality and service, cute atmosphere. I will definitely be back to Henderson, if only just to eat at this place!!!"}
{"text":"This is a cute little place tucked in the corner of Henderson, and I love it! Hidden gem but definitely popular. The staff is very friendly and they make great drinks. We got mimosas and a michelada. For an appetizer we got the bacon and eggs which was sooooo yummy and worth it, and the main dishes we both got benedicts! He got the brisket I believe, and I got the salmon. Both were really good (egg was cooked perfectly) but I would go salmon any day. Both were served with potatoes and was a really filling breakfast for the two of us. If you're ever in the area, I'd say give it a try! Nothing beats local food spots!"}
{"text":"I was talking about this place for a while and received a gift card for my birthday so decided to stop in for breakfast. We were the first ones to arrive at 7:30 and had our choice of tables. I did notice they were extremely close together so when it gets busy that may be an issue for some.   Our server quickly brought over water and coffee which is always appreciated. We started with an order of monkey bread and after so many good reviews I ordered the pork belly benedict. My other half chose the breakfast burrito. The monkey bread was served warm with a melted cinnamon type sauce.   The main entrees came out a little while later. After about 3 bites of my bene my nose started to run. The jalapeño hollandaise was extremely hot and spicy, way too much for me for early in the morning. It was just too overpowering drowning out the eggs and pork belly. I had to scrape it all off to finish the rest of it. My other half said his breakfast burrito was dry inside and needed some sort of sauce. The potatoes on both however were good.   The check came and it was $42. I left the $50 gift card and we began to leave. This is where the problem started.   As we reached the door the waitress stopped us and said we couldn't use the balance for the tip. The gentleman at the register (The chef I presume?) said the gift card could only be used for food. Since we didn't have any cash we had to buy a pastry and then add the tip to that. Ridiculous. I have used gift cards from everywhere from Mimis and Carrabba's to Flemings and Roy's and have always used the balance for the tip. Gift cards are the same as cash so whats the problem?  I wanted to leave 2 stars as I have had much better, however our service was good as well as the pastries so I will leave 3. The issue with the gift card really turned me off to this place."}
{"text":"Best place for Sunday brunch with the family. Expect 30 minute to an hour wait. Staff is excellent, food is just as great! The wait is worth it! Bloody beers help the hangovers or just get you drunk again. Depends on your level of expertise."}
{"text":"Tried it for the first time.  Restaurant was nice and very clean.  Server was helpful.  We had brunch and both of us enjoyed our meal - food was delicious.  Only thing missing was a bloody mary!  It is crowed (because the food is delicious), but the wait at 9:30 on Sun morning was only about 15 minutes."}
{"text":"This place had great food. It was in a gorgeous location but was super small and crowded. My choices where wait 30mins outside to get seated inside which was ridiculously hot in there.. The hostesses was sweaty poor thing.. Or sit outside it the heat. We sat outside and our waitress was nice. She did forget our appetizer and my daughters drink but again food was great!"}
{"text":"Finally made my way to this little eatery, and it will be the first of many repeat visits.   The atmosphere is very welcoming and yes it feels like you're eating at your mom's kitchen table. The staff was absolutely delightful and service was quick and efficient.   My wife - who is incredibly picky - loved everything. We started with the monkey bread which was good but not great. Obviously microwaved with some caramel drizzle but it was tasty.   Next came the corn empanadas which were delicious. The filling in one was a little cool, but the taste was incredible.   Main courses included the donut sandwich and the breakfast burrito. Both were amazing.   Small complaint - the menus. Worn out, tattered and stained paper photocopies on a clipboard?  You can do better.   I'm very happy I finally tried this place. Wasn't perfect but it was very, very good. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"Huecos Tacos and Shorty eggs Benedict. Oh and we ordered a raspberry white chocolate muffin (so good!) we loved both meals, the salsa on my tacos was just spicy enough and flavorful. I gave four stars only bc it wasn't completely filling. I could have eaten a side with the tacos."}
{"text":"I came in for brunch recently and the place was packed. Very happy to see a business thrive in our community but the reason why I'm rating it a 2 is because I was a bit turned off.   Walked in and I smelt something a bit off in the outside waiting area. Came in & the hostess didn't acknowledge me... ok, she's busy. I stand in front of her for a moment but after awhile I decide to wait near the wall. People walk in after me and she gets their information before me. It's her job to know who's been waiting for help first. I go over to say something and another employee who clearly has had too many coffees just walks up and starts talking to her, interrupting me and cutting me off when I spoke. And it was to talk about another guests' sweater. Rude.   I walk in the outside waiting area after learning how the long the wait is to inform my party and they were standing next to full trash cans. No wonder it smelled outside. I know it's busy and everything but full, smelly trash cans outside are not attractive to your guests. Decided we are going to bail and just get coffees. I go back inside to order and I'm yet again waiting forever for someone to acknowledge me near the coffee machine. A lady finally takes my order and I get 2 coffees for over $8. That's a bit much but when in Rome I thought. Our barista did a good job on the drinks, we enjoyed them.  As I wait, I take in my surroundings and the place is just dirty in my opinion. There are multiple people dealing with money then going behind the bar making mimosas, the counter is sticky, the cookies and what's left of the pastries are all uncovered in a very busy area where people are talking over the food constantly, my shoes were making a noise as if it were sticking to the floor. In combination on that and how it smelt outside, I won't be making a return here."}
{"text":"I don't know but after reading the rave reviews, I am disappointed that i am even posting this..... After my bf and I waited about 30 minutes for a table. the hostess seats us at one that was halfway exposed to the sun. We did comment on it but she seemed to be a bit put off and said the curtain could be released but never did it. So after a while, as the sun moved, we became more uncomfortable and got another table. My bf specifically asked for his eggs prepared a certain way and he received exactly what he was trying to avoid. I had a fruit crepe and was less than impressed.  We were both disappointed and don't plan on going back."}
{"text":"With so many new brunch restaurants sprouting up around town, Kitchen Table has quickly risen to the top of the pack.   With an inventive menu that is constantly evolving I can't wait to go back often and enjoy everything the restaurant has to offer.   The restaurant gets extremely busy so I recommend coming early. We arrived around 7:30 on a Saturday morning and we had no wait at all, but it filled up almost immediately after we were seated.   We started with the monkey bread which was amazing. I ordered the duck Mac and cheese omelette. An extremely creative take on breakfast that left me excited for my next visit.  The service was excellent. Our server was attentive despite being very busy and the chef came out to check on all the tables as well."}
{"text":"When a new breakfast/brunch/lunch joint opened up literally across the street from my house, of course I had to try it. I had no idea what I was in for, and this has become my go-to place. It's almost embarrassing when I sing its praises to friends (because I want them all to know about it so we can go there together!) and they say, \"Yes, I know. You've told me about it...MANY times!\" I've been here so many times, and each time, I'm greeted by a friendly hostess. Chef Antonio has been by my table to say hi and check on us more than half of the time we've visited. Okay, but I know you really want to hear about the food...  The hardest thing about going to an amazing place is trying something new because you fell in love with whatever you had last time; however, I have been making it a point to try out the new things. The Croque Madame is amazing, and you can't go wrong with any of the Benedicts. My favorites are the Meatless (those fried green tomatoes, tho!) and the pork belly. The pastries are delicious as well, so we usually order one as an appetizer. If you're lucky enough to get there early before they sell out, try the Monkey Bread. Yum!!! The cinnamon twist is great as well.   Now, if you're there for brunch, you must get a mimosa. I would suggest the pineapple, which they muddle themselves from fresh pineapple. It's so good! Seriously, you can't go wrong with anything here, but do get here early or prepare to wait. The place is small and a social eatery, so the wait can be upwards of an hour during busy times."}
{"text":"Went once so far and ordered from the Mexican side of the house.  The food was excellent.  The hospitality was wonderful.  The house was packed.  This is definitely a place I would suggest to all my food people.  The chefs are personable.  Our table was a little off and the chef came out and adjusted it himself. You don't see this kind of service just anywhere.  I was blown away by this.  There is a definite passion for their food and you can taste it.  I am definitely going back."}
{"text":"Best Sunday brunch spot. Great libations and even better atmosphere. Food is very good. They even have foie"}
{"text":"I went there last week for breakfast and the shorty Benedict was delicious! The service was great and the chef even made his way around to see how everything was. The whole place was very friendly and welcoming. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"My incredible girlfriend decided to surprise me this morning by going to a new breakfast place. I'm not sure how she found it but this is Godsend. Yet again, I'm not a fan of many restaurants serving \"breakfast\" in Las Vegas but lately, I've been taken aback.   From the parking lot, this place seemed a bit hidden. I mean, not a lot of things were happening around there and it seems a bit off to place an eatery next to places without competition. Well, now that I think about it, that's pretty damn genius. Nonetheless, we found it hiding in the corner adjacent next to a large banner placed along the plaza's planters. How we missed it, I do not know.   I was afraid that they'd accommodate a large waiting list on a Saturday morning but to my surprise, I was wrong. Both the inside and patio had a high volume of guests but we were seated right away. By 9 AM, hardly anyone was seating in the dining area as most patrons decided to enjoy their meal outside. Well, it was a beautiful day.   Anyway, enough babbling! The food was delicious. And I feel like that was an understatement. The scrambled egg with duck and mac and cheese just took the words out of me. Whoever thought of it is a pure genius, and whoever cooked it was a culinary talent. The eggs were soft and fluffy but the flavor from the cheese along with the texture of the duck was out of this world. It's a must try.   I had the pleasure of trying the country steak egg Benedict which was not something I normally do. Still, it seemed like it was a popular entree so I went along with it. My issue with Benedict is the runny yolk that tends to turn me off. However, Kitchen Table really understood the robust flavors they needed to incorporate in the dish so that all ingredients worked well together. First, the Benedict was doused in house sauce which was creamy and delicious. Then you're almost tasting breaded steak is really not something I would consider but it worked. Bite it with the egg and you're in for a treat. It was truly a remarkable dish to say the least.   I was telling my girlfriend that I wish there was a cafe and a breakfast placed mashed together so you're enjoying delicious latte with your meal. Coincidence or not, this restaurant had everything I was asking for and more. They had a small selection of drinks like snickerdoodle latte, Oreo latte, Mexican Hot cocoa, etc.. Still, having the choice instead of a regular coffee was a great change. Okay, but really though, those beverages hits the soul as inventive as they may seem. God, I would do anything to take a Mexican hot cocoa any day of the week.  Also, the monkey bread was amazing. It comes placed in a warm skillet ready to be pulled apart to your heart's desire. Its not overbearingly sweet but enough to satisfy the sweet tooth. Sticky and gooey? Indeed.   I could go on and on about Kitchen Table from their fast, friendly service to the ambiance in the room. But I really want you all to try it so do whatever you need to do get there!"}
{"text":"Love love love it here! Not only is the food absolutely amazing, but the staff is great too! We always feel welcomed here, and I recommend this spot to anyone looking for a great breakfast/lunch place. The prices are great, the portions are big, and we never leave disappointed! Thank you Kitchen Table!"}
