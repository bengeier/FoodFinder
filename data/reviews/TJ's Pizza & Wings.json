{"text":"I love this place! :) I live very close by and I eat here almost everyday. Not a very healthy lifestyle choice but a very tasty one. The pizza's are amazing. I have taken them mostly by the slice and they are delightful. And I am a huge fan of the chicken wings! Also, the pasta and the subs are very delicious. I love the food here and I would definitely continue to eat here as much as I can. Also, the service and delivery is spot-on. The people serving are very polite and the portions are amazing for the value for money. A wonderful place to just hang out or order from :) 5 stars! :)"}
{"text":"Very bad and super expensive 
We bought an pizza for 25$ and couldn't hold it to eat it .
Tomato sauce all over everywhere.
It's just so hard to serve bad pizza.
Pizza is always easy .you must work hard to get very bad one."}
{"text":"I just ordered Large cheese pizza and wings. the pizza it pretty good but the wings are Awesome. Can't wait for the next time I eats those wings! fast delivery,"}
{"text":"Amazing staff, clean place, great food !! Tiramisu fantastic!!  No bad odor noticed at all!!"}
{"text":"I love their pizza and their dinners (chicken or shrimp).  My biggest beef with them is when they get busy on the weekends they just don't answer their phone. Or when they are 15 minutes away from closing, still plenty of time to answer the phone and make a pizza I can pick up, they just don't answer. They used to have a website designed by a ten year old, now they have nothing on-line. Get with the program, guys! I want to give you my money! *crickets*"}
{"text":"Called 8 pm on a Saturday, was told in an annoying voice they were not open.  Hours stated on the website indicate they should be open until 11pm."}
{"text":"Not a date place really less your past all the pretend, Pizza isnt always the prettiest but has always hit the spot for me.  Wings are good but not jumbo sized.  Maybe they are not gmo chickens.  Now why Ill go 5 stars versus 4 is mainly because I usually avoid pizza, since most bother me and yet this place I can usually eat without it bothering me much, if at all.  Try it 4 Yourself"}
{"text":"We moved to the area a few months back and decided to try this place... We can not stop going back!!! The pizza is amazing. My family and I will countinue to take our business here. The staff is always very friendly and again... The pizza is outstanding!"}
{"text":"Don't know how this place is still in business.  The dough is decent but the cheese and sauce is horrible.  The boneless wings are very horrible also.  The bone in wings are good.  Drinks are 1.70$ with .50 cent refills.  But the gas station 20 steps away has 44oz drinks for 81 cents.  You choose."}
{"text":"I've been in the area about a year, I've only had delivery.  Each and every time I order the food/quality gets better! Tonight I ordered a pizza for the first time, oh it was sooooo good! Delivery time is fast and the prices are inexpensive! I tell everyone I can about this place!! Good luck and keep up the good work!!!"}
{"text":"Damn nasty wings. Low quality meat, hard to chew, impossible to swallow.  I had to throw out the wings and find something else for dinner."}
{"text":"Pizza was ok.; flavor nor texture stands out. The Buffalo wings were good; crispy with adequate sauce. It was disappointing that the ranch sauce is not made in house, rather a commercial packaged stuff. Also they change an additional 50 cents if you use your charge or debit."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for 8 years and this will be my first review! Just have to say this is the BEST pizza in Arizona! Order the personal pizza. In fact, order 2. Layer them together for perfection. Repeat for years."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place but giving a bad review because thwy wouldn't deliver 1 block outside their delivery radius."}
{"text":"Ok seriously stop reading and just call and order something already!!

wings: excellent
greek chicken pita: best thing that ever existed

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"Amazing food and great customer service. Would recommend this to anyone that likes pizza, wings, or subs."}
{"text":"By far one of my favorite pizza places. I've been ordering from TJ's for years. They know their customers too. Great guys. 

The calzones are my favorite, but you can't go wrong with the pizza and wings either.

Also recently tried their breakfast. Pretty good cinnamon rolls."}
{"text":"You won't get a pizza that is on the cover of a magazine.  What you will get is pizza that actually taste good.  The employees are friendly and appreciative of your business.  The wings are almost as good as their pizza.  I drove 30 mins to pick it up and it was worth it.  Wish they had a location back home."}
{"text":"I ordered delivery based on positive yelp reviews and was wildly disappointed.  Worse than school cafeteria pizza.  Flaccid crust.  Nasty ketchup-esque sauce.  Just abysmal.  I assume the wings are amazing, because the pizza is among the worst I've ever had."}
{"text":"My husband and I have been ordering pizza and wings from TJ's for years now.  It is a bit of a whole in the wall but the pizza and wings are great.  My favorite thing to order, though, is the antipasto salad with the house dressing.  I LOVE the house dressing (which is the same dressing they put on their house wings).  It is a garlic, Italian type of dressing and it is fabulous.  The antipasto salad comes with tons of Italian meats and cheeses and I love it!  I am actually on my way to pick one up now!"}
{"text":"Love ordering delivery from Tjs! I have been ordering food from them since they opened. The food is always good and it never takes them long to deliver. The staff is always friendly and makes my friends and I feel like we're calling cheers, cause everyone remembers our names! So far I have had the Pizza, wings, calzones, and Burger Sub! No complaints here! Go Check them out if you haven't already!"}
{"text":"GREAT FOOD - best wings I've ever had! Owner and his staff are the nicest people I've ever encountered! Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"The people writing nasty reviews to this place are crazy. Everything is amazing here! & trust me, because I've pretty much have had everything on the menu haha! (Seriously I have tho) the customer service is great, too. Everyone is so friendly. I would highly recommend this place to anyone! :)"}
{"text":"Just gross - let me count the ways: 
Crust - underdeveloped and soggy and chewy
Sauce - way too sweet - sugary
Cheese - a thick greasy layer on top of the toppings

Six of my coworkers agreed that this was a pitiful attempt at pizza"}
{"text":"Everybody has memories of some pizza from way back when that was just perfect and that no other pizza that they've had since quite compares to. This pizza is actually that good."}
{"text":"Not impressed.... they had people complaining and staff seemed put out by the hassle. My wings were fine in flavor but the sauce was very buttery. The \"house\" sauce was just butter and Italian dressing, the hot were good... very NY style... I would order again but my expectations are way lower then the recommendations I heard."}
{"text":"Tried the wings and was not impressed.  A worker stated the Buffalo were hot but honestly they werent.  They were mild at best.  

I tried one of my friends house wings and was not impressed with that either.  It had a weird garlic parmessanish taste to it.  Honestly I would've rather went to a wing stop or hooters.  This place was not worth the money"}
{"text":"The pizza is always tasty! Tons of cheese and pepperonis!Wings are awesome! Some places over cook their wings, never had this issue here. The delivery is always within time promised!"}
{"text":"Tonight we held our own little Super Bowl party at the Mayo Hospital.  Not the best of places to celebrate the Super Bowl but we made the best of it.  The deliver driver  followed our directions to call when leaving the restaurant and that's almost unheard of in our history of ordering food to the Hospital.  The Driver very sympathetic about the delivery wait but we actually called in ahead and the timing was perfect for halftime show.  The food was very hot and fresh.  We ordered a pizza and wings and both were great.  The teriyaki wings were very large and so freshly made.  We will definitely order again!  Thank you all!"}
{"text":"Great NY style pizza place. Antipasto salad is great along with their pies. Not fancy and you probably won't impress a date unless she likes great pies.
They seem to do a lot of pickup business but also deliver.
Love good consistent quality family businesses and they have been around for a long time.You won't be disappointed here."}
{"text":"Always the best food and the employees are awesome!! Sell by slices and they are good size slices too! House sauce is great. The place is getting remodeled slowly and it looks like more changes will be coming too!"}
{"text":"I love this place so much we order it every Friday night.  I love the Pizza, the Steak Bomb and Italian Subs are the best.  This place is a must especially for the price."}
{"text":"I love TJ's and go there with my son every couple of weeks. They make the pizza the way we like it, attend to special requests w/out any issue, and always make us feel welcome. If you are looking for decor and atmosphere... not the place for you. It is mainly a pick-up and delivery style of NY pizza shop, however they do have some tables for those that do want to stay and eat there. That being said my son and I do sit down and eat there as they give us free reign of the remote control and we watch whatever we want while we eat our pizza. My wife loves the wings and my daughter eats the pizza and mozzarella sticks with a smile on her face. Overall TJ's is a great joint...reminds me of the NY pizza shops I frequented when I grew up in NY. Kenny and the crew are great people and will always treat you right. As long as we live in Scottsdale, we will be frequent customers of TJ's Pizza & Wings. Go TJ's!!!"}
{"text":"Nice lunch specials. I had a slice of cheese and 6 honey bbq wings for $6.50 and included a drink. It tasted good and was reasonable in price. I will be back again."}
{"text":"This is beyond my favorite pizza place! I live in Portland OR and every time I'm home in Scottsdale I get a large sausage pizza and medium wings! Amazing been coming here for over 10 years."}
{"text":"We like this place, and it's close by, so we typically take advantage of their lunch specials.  I'm a fan of their slice/6 wings/drink combo.  We've found that their individual slices are way tastier than their whole pizzas, though.  Not sure why, but the couple of times we've ordered an entire pizza we weren't that impressed.  So now, we just stick to a slice or two for lunch.

Slices are big, New York style slices.  Definitely nothing fancy about the place.  We were a bit scared to try this place for awhile, since it's next to a gas station and doesn't look too impressive from the outside.  Glad we did though.  Guys who work inside are pretty cool too."}
{"text":"Amazed!! Great customer service every time i come in , the guys that work here show that they want to be there not just for a paycheck , the food is really good I will definitely come more often and recommend everyone to go to TJ's !"}
{"text":"The owners of this place are great!  They are always here and they care about fast service and good food."}
{"text":"WOW just WOW this place is out of the world Amazing!!!!! Kenny the cute guy behind the counter was so great and knowledgeable about all the menu items. He talked me into the Steak Bomb and man oh man was it bomb. I got it without mushrooms but that is just me..Can't wait to go back and try the House wings i hear they are the best!!!!!"}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places I've found! I've lived in Scottsdale for about 5 years and haven't found a good pizza, until Tjs. I was born and raised in NY and I know pizza. All of their staff is really friendly and have great customer service. Especially the girl that works there! I definitely will be back and won't go to any other pizza joints."}
{"text":"Ok so this place makes a good pizza and the cheesesteaks are also good. They deliver fairly quickly, usually within 30 minutes. Our neighborhood go to."}
{"text":"The best thing TJs can do for their business and customers is to accept the fact that their owner should not be dealing with their customers; by phone, in person or any other way.

The owner clearly has defined a decent business model, or they wouldn't be in business. But TJs customers should be left smitten by the amazing flavor and consistency of their food, unaware of the owner's condescending and unprofessional demeanor.

I've been ordering from here for a while and love the consistent quality of their pizza and service. However, after several delicious NYC pizzas, I was disappointed when our pizza arrived cold and soggy this evening. Knowing this was not the norm for them, I called to let them know. 

While I was content talking to anyone, the owner insisted on taking the call. Which seemed like a good customer-service model ... until he spoke. He was unprofessional and unsettlingly condescending. 

I was shocked and intent on finding a new pizza place.

However, when a freshly made pizza arrived, the delivery guy, Jason, reminded me why I love TJs. He, and the management at TJs are consistently friendly; focused on quality and customer service. 

Despite the top-down, arrogant influence of the owner, the staff continues to make things right for the customers by providing excellent, friendly customer service, and delicious pizza (even if it took a second try this one time.)

The friendly management and delivery personnel should continue to be upfront-and -center. The owner should get our of their way and take a back seat; letting his staff do the great things he hired them to do."}
{"text":"Found this place by accident while I was staying at my cousins a few months ago. Since then I have ordered at least 5x. Being from Chicago (even though this is a New York place!) i love a good pie and this place has it! Customer service has always been great and the pizza is usually at the door within 30.

I always get a pizza, wings and their garlic cheese bread and have never changed my order. 

Also appreciate the fact that they donated gift cards to the school that my cousin teaches at. Always nice to have a small business that cares about the community they serve. You have my business!"}
{"text":"This is a great pizza and wing place! The interior isn't much to look at, but my kids loved all the coloring pages of pizzas hung on the walls. 

The Wings were amazing, possibly my new favorite place to get wings. We got traditional, personally boneless chicken wings are chicken nuggets. we got a large cheese and a couple slices of Pepperoni and Sausage, and an anti pasta salad. All the food was great. 

We will definitely be coming back"}
{"text":"This is easily one of the best local pizza places in Phoenix. Great staff, quick service, and quality food. Awesome menu with great prices. Coming from Boston its hard to find good pizza here in Phoenix, but knowing that you can go to a local-non chain pizza place with good food that is close by is perfect. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"Pizza is good.  Amazing Garlic Bread,  Little pricey.  Nice spot within walking distance from my pad.  Plan on going here again."}
{"text":"Maybe I was there on a bad day, but the wings were way over cooked and the slice of pizza was mediocre."}
{"text":"Im sorry. I hate writing a negative review. But, I really cannot see how this place gets 4 stars. One review i read before i visited this place said the word greasy many times in their review. Unfortunately i didnt heed the warning.
The pizza was beyond greasy.  The boneless chicken wings were out of a frozen bag and didn't taste that great. 
So, not knowing how bad the food would be yet, I noticed that there was no one dining in the place when i went in. So, i went to sit down and eat there. But, every table top had burnt black dough marks and grease from pizza or whatever eaten prior to my artrival. On top of that, they had Fox News BLARING in the dining room. Then i go home to open their bag of grease. 
I think im upset more bc i use Yelp a lot. And, this place is so far from 4 stars that it puts a ding in Yelp's credibility. From now on, I will put more credence in the individual reviews than the star rating that Yelp gives."}
{"text":"Awesome local pizza joint. Pizza is solid and the staff is really cool. 

Surprisingly, their wings are amazing. Love the house sauce. 

We order from there a couple of times a month."}
{"text":"After driving around doing errands in Scottsdale, I stopped in at TJ's Pizza and Wings for a quick lunch. I know I can't expect a great deal from a little place. It I was pleasantly surprised. Place is clean, the customer service is tops and food is delish! I ordered Lunch Special #5: Slice of Cheese pizza, a side salad with blue cheese dressing and a drink for $5.99 plus tax. This lunch hit the spot! Cheers***"}
{"text":"I guess the 4 employee's that work there thought my review was funny. I'm not surprised!!! The negative, rude, disrespectful behavior must be continuing and certainly indicates a lack of manners, education and  professionalism. When business owners laugh at their customers, do you know who really gets the last laugh?????????????"}
{"text":"I went to circle K to get gas and saw this place and thought I'd give this place a try.  Large pizza; half supreme and half Hawaiian ran for about $23 and some change,  tax included.  We were  very very hungry,  so it may have tasted better than it actually is. Whatever the case,  we were happy with how the pizza tasted and the consistency of the dough. Marinara sauce was yummy. Ton of toppings.  

I will try the wings next time."}
{"text":"Love their pizza excellent quality for the price and locally owned! A+. Great sandwiches too!"}
{"text":"I went there on a Friday night. The floors were greasy and dirty, not only in the kitchen but the dinning area as well. 
The customer service wasn't that great. The same guy making my food was taking my money?? 
The quality of the food was great. However, I ordered a Calzone with pepperoni and mushrooms. When I got home I discovered a Calzone with some other ingredients in it! They gave me someone else's food. 
It's not in my plans to go back any time soon, but who knows!"}
{"text":"A nice and thin pizza with a lot of taste.  The lunch special is a great price for 2 large pieces of pizza and a drink."}
{"text":"The wings are really good. We have ordered them twice now. We got the \"hot\" option and the sauce is flavorful and just spicy enough to make you sweat a little. They use the good size wings and drumsticks, not those little wing dings some places like to call wings. We have only ordered pizza there once. It was okay. Not the best, but certainly better than some of the other places we've tried around here."}
{"text":"Fantastic philly cheese steaks. Pizza is not great but does the trick. Wings are solid. 

This place is good but with some new local places like Isa's moving in close by they better step up their pizza game!

I will be back for the cheesesteaks for sure."}
{"text":"My wife and I have been by TJ's on two occasions for slices and found them to be very good and probably one of the best slices found in the Scottsdale/N Phoenix area. Not much to the place though, pretty small. Standard take out type place that does offer dine in option with no frills."}
{"text":"This place is awesome. There is something for everyone. A little small, good pizza. New York style pizza. Video game, tv.. Good place for singles, families, kids. Great prices. :) Be sure to check out the lunch specials."}
{"text":"This is a great local pizza joint that has friendly service and delivery. Don't be confused that its a great dine-in experience with extensive wine choices. If you live in the area and are craving good pizza and wings, they kick the crap out of the chain delivery options (papa Johns,  Dominos). The toppings are very fresh and generous, the wings are crispy not under fried!"}
{"text":"After driving past this so many times in the area and reading about it on the next door site I gave this place a try.  The crust was very good.  Crunchy but yet soft seemed very fresh.  Sauce had a ok flavor but I certainly could have used a bit extra.  I put sausage on as my topping.  Pizza did lack something.  Maybe a spice or oregano it seemed a little on the bland side.  
I don't think I would crave this pizza but would go back again at some point.

Still prefer spinatos as my number 1 and rosatis......."}
{"text":"I'm not quite sure if it's a good thing they know me by name here! I found them by chance one day when I was next door pumping gas. I decided to get takeout for dinner, and suddenly I smelled... delicious chicken! I looked over and saw the sign for  TJ's. Well, the chicken was yummy, and everything else I've ordered since. Their pizza  and calzones are wonderful, and they have awesome sandwiches and salads, too. So many choices on the menu, it's sometimes hard to decide. Oh, they also do free delivery. I'm lucky enough to live and work in their delivery area, so they hear from me a lot. Try this hidden gem, you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"The food here is disgusting. No offense to the owner but the wings are bland and the pizza tastes like cardboard. 
If you do eat from here just eat it while it's hot. Cold might change the consistency in the food and make it even worse."}
{"text":"This is my go-to place for delivery pizza.  Is it better than Pizzeria Bianco, Gratzie, or Grimaldis?   Probably not, hence my four (instead of five) star review.  But for a quality pizza delivered reliably to your door for less than $20, this place can't be beat.   I think their pizzas are far better than any of the chains, they're priced competitively, and it's always good to support the local guy. 

I've ordered dozens of pizzas from them, and they have yet to muck one up.  In fact, I think I'll order one for delivery right now...."}
{"text":"Great pizza, a bit thin for,my liking but the taste was very good.the pizza itself was very large and filling! Definitely coming back"}
{"text":"This place is pretty \"meh\". I tried the wings. Nothing special. I ordered the creamy garlic wings, and although the sauce tasted good, it was far from creamy. The consistency was closer to that of water. The inside of the place is a little naked and kind of dirty. The staff were nice enough, but it wasn't enough to make me want to return."}
{"text":"I usually stop in @ TJ's twice a month ( I have gigs out in that 'hood ). I'm a pushover for their special : 2 slices of cheese pizza & a drink....$5.00 !  Tonight they told me of a their new version of the Margarita Pizza....they made me up a couple of slices for my wife; picked 'em up on the way home after the gig. A most welcoming place !"}
{"text":"TJ's is located right down the street from me and they have been my go to place for quite some time. Their pizza is always cooked just right and their wings are very good. I mean you can choose from a few different sauces however I always go for the hot or suicide (and yes its spicy but I like spicy) Plus their large cheese pizza and 24 wings for $20.65 is not to shabby either. (additional toppings are $1.65 each) They also have an everyday lunch special til for for 2 slices of pizza and a medium drink for $4.25. Not to bad if I say so myself. 

So some people will like this place (Like me!) and others may not but until you try it for yourself you will never know."}
{"text":"Really good pizza great garlic bread"}
{"text":"I've been coming here since I was in middle school. Now in my late 20s shows I must like it. Tjs pizza to their wings this place is the best hands down. I now live out of state and every time I'm home visiting family I order from here. 

My favorites- sausage pizza, medium wings, Greek salad. It's all amazing and good prices."}
{"text":"Very good wings, really nice and friendly service.  The price is great.  I haven't tried the pizza or other menu items, but the wings were unique and nicely done.  As I said, the guy running the place is very friendly and helpful on deciding which wing flavor I would like.  I'll be back.

The building is older, but everything is clean and inviting-looking.  Seating is basic, nothing out of the ordinary."}
{"text":"I used to eat TJs Hawaiian pizza and Greek salad all the time a few years ago when I lived on this side of down, and now living back here I tried it and it was just as amazing as I had remembered! The pizza is perfect... not too much bread, toppings are just right, sauce is a little sweet and seriously, it is amazing. They even told me since I do not like a lot of bread, they could make me a thin crust if I requested it. How cool is that?! Thanks TJs! You rock!"}
{"text":"Went to TJ's tonight and got a couple large pizzas. Food was good, a lot better than your typical Dominos or Little Caesars. Guy was nice, took the order, got it right. Nothing really beyond that. We got some coffees from the gas station next door while we waited, that was nice. I might go here again simply because I like to shop local, but all in all I would have to say it was just okay. Maybe I'll give the wings a shot next time..."}
{"text":"We walked into a small pizza place that had some construction on the side and a wall with tons of pizza printouts that children colored on. I was a little taken aback on the theme or lack thereof but it wouldn't have mattered so much if the food was good. We ordered a pepperoni pizza, 12 pic wings with the honey sauce and mozzarella sticks. The order came to around $27. We ordered to go so we left to eat at home. The food was just ok - ok meaning I'm not sure if I will go out of my way to visit but it did the job and satisfied our hunger. We had leftover wings and pizza that we heated up the next day and the food doesn't taste good as leftovers."}
{"text":"This place is right around the corner from my girlfriends place so we go there fairly often.  Their pizza is pretty good, not really why we go there.  Their wings are awesome, the reason we keep going back.  For a neighborhood pizza joint not bad at all, but I probably wouldn't go out of my way for their food."}
{"text":"I really wish I could give this place a better review.  I will start off by saying that the service here was really good.  Our order was ready by the time I went to pick it up, nothing was messed up, and the employee I encountered was very nice. The restaurant was also clean.  Unfortunately, the food I tried just wasn't that great.  The pizza had no taste.  I know that might sound really weird, but it was like eating heated matter that had no flavor whatsoever.  Even the pepperonis lacked a taste.  I also tried the wings, which did fortunately have a flavor, but weren't phenomenal.  It's sad to say this, but the Fry's down the street has better pizza and wings and costs a lot less."}
{"text":"Pizza is awesome, Wings (house flavor) are awesome..  I live down the street from this place, and get stuff delivered all the time.

The bad review post is total BS.  This place is all good."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite place to order pizza and wings from in the area. My brother and I always order the daily special large pizza with 24 wings and add pepperoni. The pizza here is delicious, I am not going to lie it is a little greasy but come on people were eating pizza~! Wings are always scrumscious and crispy :)"}
{"text":"TJ's is about a 15 minute drive for our family but we find ourselves going there multiple times each month not only for the food but for the super friendly staff . I feel in love with this place when I was pregnant with my now 7 month old son. Their pizza is perfect. The sauce has a nice flavor, the cheese is always melty, and they put enough of your topping so that you get some in each bite. We prefer boneless wings and love the hot sauce. If you are brave they have a flavor called \"suicide\" (I think). I've only been able to eat one but my fiancé has eaten six. Just smelling it burns ya up! We try cannolis everywhere and we love TJ's!! Today we tried their cinnamon sticks and they are the best I have tried at any pizza place! Their salads are definitely above average too! Go check them out at lunch time they have awesome specials!!"}
{"text":"Whoops, forgot to review this place from a few weeks ago. The ambiance is minimal but the food is good. We came for the wings but started off with garlic bread and fries. We chose to get 24 wings: 12 suicide and 12 honey bbq. Having the carbs to pair with the spicy wings ended up being a good idea cuz those babies were hot! The spiciest level was homicide, and when we asked about it they were kind enough to give us a sample of the sauce they use for it. It was too hot that it lost its flavor. But the suicide wings had flavor and were hot. I'd probably just get the hot next time so I can enjoy them more. Good flavors and good people here."}
{"text":"Good NY style pizza!  Lunch specials is a good price, too."}
{"text":"I still love the food but I had a terrible experience with the \"owner\". I called in to place an order around 7:30 and about halfway through ordering she shouted \"Sorry we're actually closing up now it's been a slow night\" and just hang up! What the???? Have you ever stopped to think the reason you're slow is because you treat your customers like garbage! Seriously, I've been a loyal customer for over 10 years and in one fatal swoop you've almost lost me forever. Real nice!"}
{"text":"I have had the pizza at TJ's a few times in the last few years and always thought the pizza was tasty.

Had it again last night and, yep, still very tasty. Very cheesy, thin crust (not soggy!), foldable yummy slices.

Also had the garlic cheese bread. To die for.

And the biggest surprise... their Greek salad. My friend ordered it and I wasn't excited about trying it. Most pizza joints don't have very good salad. But this was amazing. Very fresh Romaine, tomatoes, cucumbers, lots of feta, and olives drenched in delicious tangy Greek dressing. Yum.

Owners are great. Very friendly family run place."}
{"text":"Let me just say first and foremost - the customer service is great. My husband and I walked into TJ's on a whim and left with some -incredible- wings, a gluten free pizza -amazing- for me, and a regular pepperoni for my husband. He loved it! We ordered delivery from them a few nights ago, and when we realized they had forgotten our drink [we had been in a... heated discussion when the delivery guy came by and we hadn't noticed], they came back with the drink. It was really kind of them, but we also live less than a mile from them, haha! Seriously though, this place is great. Give them a chance. It's so much better than all these chain restaurants. It also reminded me of home (NY) which gets major bonus points!"}
{"text":"This is the best NYC pizza you can get in phoenix that's for sure!  I actually just moved from Manhattan, and this place is better than some places I have been in NYC itself. And the wings are great as well!  It is not a place to take a date, but perfect place to dine out or have delivered! 5 starts for sure!!"}
{"text":"Wow. I just ate one of their cheese pizzas by the slice.. it was DELICIOUS. It melted in my mouth. The guy at the counter was so friendly and helpful. I will definitely be back. Thank you!"}
{"text":"First timer here! We ordered a pizza and wings special on Super Bowl Sunday, the biggest pizza ordering day of the year(and the wait wasn't even that long!). The pizza was great, I love the flavor of the crust and the wings were very good. Since we needed to drive across town for a party, I asked for the wing sauce on the side so the wings didn't get soggy on the way. When we got to our destination, the wings were still hot and crispy!  So awesome. I can't comment on the interior since i didn't go in but I will definitely be coming back here when I'm in the mood for some great pizza and wings!"}
{"text":"This place has gone down hill BIG TIME over the past few months. Must be new ownership or management. Stay away."}
{"text":"Bought two gyro sandwich before going to Mayo Clinic. It was horrible! The white sauce was no flavor. I watched the the guy in the back wipe his sweat off his forehead and his nose. Then picked up pizza dough without washing his hands. There was also a spray smell like it had bugs"}
{"text":"Who would think to get breakfast at a pizza joint? Recently planned on stopping in at Benedicts for breakfast but they were not open when we got there. We then noticed, in the same little plaza, a sign offering breakfast at TJ's. We figured it was right there so why not. Boy were we in for a surprise! There was only one staff member in the place which I am guessing must have been an owner. He was doing it all so we didn't have a lot of time to talk to him...maybe next time. He took our order and a short time later brought us a complimentary cinnamon roll. Ummmm! It was SO delicious! I had a hard time keeping myself from stealing the whole thing from my husband. The belgian waffle I ordered was also very tasty. All in all a very good and inexpensive breakfast with awesome service. You have got to try it to believe it. This guy can cook more than just pizza! I will definitely be going back. Maybe I'll even try the pizza...LOL! Sorry Benedicts."}
{"text":"Kimberly D could not be more right about the attitude of the person who takes phone orders. I'm not sure it's the owner but he sounds like the same rude, condescending prick every time I order. I've walked in to order as well and the service is usually awesome when I order in person. TJs food is always delicious whether picked up or delivered but I always second guess ordering from them if I plan to call it in for pickup or delivery. I'm aware customer service is a dying art but come on... No one deserves that kind of rude attitude. Keep driving away customers TJs. Don't be surprised if the calls stop coming in."}
{"text":"Went to this place with a coworker the other day, spur of the moment as they were one of the few places open on Labor Day in our area and we were both bored at work. 

We ordered a large pizza with a bunch of different toppings and split a order of 12 wings, half hot and half mild. The food took a little longer than I imagined to come out, but it's a small operation so I didn't care too much. 

When we got the food, everything was great. Reading some of the reviews here I wonder if that was a fluke or not, but our experience was great. The wings were fantastic, some of the best I have ever had. I didn't try the hot wings, only the mild, but my colleague assured me that they were good and picked them clean! 

The two of us gobbled down all but one slice of the pizza and we were not disappointed by the flavor or the crust, it was really good stuff. Definitely beats the chain garbage and the atmosphere is pretty cool. It's one of those nice hole-in-the-wall places that just has something about it. Maybe it's the unique L-shaped layout, or the arcade games at the back, but it's a nice little place. 

With regards to what I've seen of the service, I didn't experience any rudeness at all. The woman at the counter was very friendly and patient with us while we figured out what toppings we wanted and accommodated us by splitting the wing order between hot and mild with no issues.  

I'm looking forward to going back so my wife can try the food as well. Great place!"}
{"text":"Great wings n good pizza.  They said they delivered but unfortunately not at our location. Would eat from there again."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place. The staff is always super friendly and helpful. They go out of their way to go above and beyond. Their pizza is AMAZING, and I am addicted to their greek salads. I work at a Marriott hotel and anytime a guest wants pizza I send them here. I have even received good comment cards where I work, just for referring them to TJ's. 

All in all, this place is a WIN. Everyone that works there really loves and cares about their customers. I will always be back :) thanks guys!"}
{"text":"Delicious pizza. I love the pizza here. They have giant slices and the pizza is always hot. The delivery is not great. We ordered a pizza and they said 45 minutes. An hour and a half later we still didn't have any pizza. We live less than a half a mile so delivery shouldn't take that long. If the pizza wasn't so good I wouldn't order from here again."}
{"text":"Nothing revolutionary going on over at TJ's but the pizza has been better than decent both times I've tried it. Price is reasonable. The boneless wings, while still being edible, were practically swimming in sauce in the to-go container. I was a fan of the house sauce however. 

Both times I have ordered the pizza has been that perfect doughy goodness for picking up, folding in half, and stuffing in face. For the people complaining about paying 50 cents for refills, I would say get over it. It is a small non chain family run business that is a nice alternative to the pizza huts of the world. 

Takeaway: Non chain pizza for a good price that tastes great."}
{"text":"Was really hoping to like the food since moving to the area. Usually order Spinatos and took a risk here. Received pizza and it was not completely cooked. We threw it in the oven to finish cooking it. Then tasted the pizza and no flavor. Never had a pizza with no flavor. Sauce has no taste and pizza crust was flavorless. Very disappointed. I wish I would of ate my pizza in the freezer it would of taste better."}
{"text":"Great pizza one of the best. We love the veggie and the chicken flavors. We had tried their Gyros that was very tasty.  The staff is very friendly. A bit pricey but delicious."}
{"text":"Very good pizza and wings. Use them all the time. Delivery is very helpful. But they charge $.50 to use the debit card old-fashioned!"}
{"text":"This place has the best NY style pizza in the valley hands down. I am from NY and moved out here 6 years ago, then moved the  CA and then moved back. Still some great pizza and semi great wings."}
{"text":"Probably my favorite home delivery pizza. The staff is always nice and pizza delivery time is usually not too long of a wait. As for dinning in, it's nothing to write home about but the facility seem clean. My only wish is that they update their computer system. It's sometimes nice to call in to Pizza Hut or   Domino's and they already know your name and address because you've ordered before. I order at least 3 times a month from TJ's and every time I have to go through the steps of giving my address name and number. Not a deal breaker but it would add a nice touch."}
{"text":"Loved the plain cheese pizza!  It is a great value and the cheese is very  buttery!  Yum!  TJ's is going to be our new \"go to\" delivery spot for pizza!"}
{"text":"Small, unassuming place, located right next to a gas station, nothing fancy, no frills but some of the absolute best pizza you'll find in the Phoenix area.     Their garlic cheese bread is amazing and the pizza is always primo delicious.      This place is right off the 101 and 56th Street, they do deliver, offer friendly service and pretty good prices as well.   All in all its beats the pants off some of the more higher-priced and overly pretentious pizza joints in the area, give them a shot!"}
{"text":"Everything's was amazing me and my buddy's  got a Pizza, wings and some subs definitely will come again it's a good pizza place"}
{"text":"Quick, usually on time. Guy on the phone was normal and friendly when I came to pick up.

Food is pretty low quality. With that said, it's also pretty cheap. Chicken meat in the sub had a strange poppy and \"crunchy\" texture, pretty bad. Calzone was better but a little rich. You get what you pay for, so that's all okay. Cheese bread was pretty good for the price.

What's really wrong is the smell. This place has a horrid grease-trap odor that sets the tone every time I've eaten here. Grosses me out, worst I've smelled around here by far. Employees/restaurant was pretty filthy as well.

Also, charging me to use a debit card on a $25 order in 2016? Come on. Don't stick me with your cheapness. Only restaurant in the entire valley that I've had this done (or at least have been told about). 

Not the worst food, but due to the cleanliness and smell, we won't be back. It was pretty bad. Tried it a few times, but noting has improved."}
{"text":"Love this place! Everything they have is amazing!! Marinara sauce and homemade pita bread rocks!! Can't go a week without eating there!!"}
{"text":"Always great! #nypizzalover.  Consistently amazing local hidden place.  Best pizza around"}
{"text":"We have frequented TJ's for about 2 years and highly recommend them. Great food and reasonable prices.  We love \"TJ's Chicken Kabob\".  Ya gotta try it!"}
{"text":"Great flavors and ownership!  The staff is amazing and funny and their customer service is extraordinary.  They offer an excellent {menu} variety and the sauces, be it pizza, wing sauce or salad dressing, is out of this world!  We do take out all of the time and my family would order from TJ's everyday if I let them."}
{"text":"I drive by this place every week and it's been here forever, so it must be good, right? 

But NO, it was pretty awful. Only one person was in there eating, but the server / hostess must have fallen asleep in the back room. We stood at the counter for about 5-10 minutes before having to yell into the kitchen to get someone's attention. 

We both ordered the lunch special: two slices of thin crust pizza and a drink for a bargain price. When the pizza came, it was so soggy, I couldn't pick it up, so had to use a knife and fork to eat it. That's disappointing because one of my favorite ways to eat thin crust pizza is folding it down the center, you know, like a New Yorker, LOL. 

Given the tough economic times, with so many restaurants closing, I don't know how this place has lasted so long."}
{"text":"Barro's on Indian Bend is my usual family Friday night pizza & wings stop but was looking for something different tonight, but in the same price range. A google search for \"best pizza & wings in Scottsdale\" lead me to TJ's Pizza & Wings. I'm a NYC pizza fan and that's what the reviews praised here. 

My son and I got there and ordered with the intention of eating our 16\" large pizza and 24 wings (for $23.95) there but after sitting down and feeling how slippery the floor was, we decided to get it to go. The slippery (greasy?) floor freaked us out a little, plus there was a good college football game we were missing on a much bigger TV at home.

The guys at the counter were very friendly, wait time was minimal and we picked up drinks at Circle K next door. Another nice convenience was the Redbox machine right outside TJ's front door.

Pizza didn't look as good as I expected it to look after reading all the great reviews but my first bite removed that hint of doubt I had. Great thin crust, cheesy, foldable and a little greasy... Just the way I love it! The other reviews I read about the wings had me pretty anxious to try them out too.  I'm a deep fried crispy wing fanatic and that's exactly how they cooked them. Even after the 5 minute ride home, they were still crispy and drenched in hot sauce, like they should be. Each wing was meaty and decent sized, not like the miniatures I got at Buffalo Wild Wings last weekend (and I love that place).   I would have given TJ's 5 stars if the slices were bigger (large is 16\" and as big as they make) and the slippery floor in the dining area didn't freak us out so much! I will definitely be going back for take out. Another nice incentive is that you can save the cutout coupons on the pizza box for a free 16\" pizza for every 15 coupons. Thumbs up!"}
{"text":"This is our go to Friday night Pizza , we usually do delivery but an occasional pick up if they are slammed the pizza is always consistently  hot & fresh with the perfect crunch to the crust & lots of Cheese !!!! Avg time for delivery is about 45 min to 1 hr on Friday nights. The one really cool thing I love is the have a rewards program where if you save 15 box tops from the pizza you get a Lg cheese pizza Free :) who can beat that ? So if looking for a good New York style pizza these is a great place to try :)"}
{"text":"Great little neighborhood pizza joint! Pizza by the slice which are generous size slices with a nice \"not to thin\" and \"not to thick\" crust, just right. Wings were spot on, lots of zing with their sauce. Friendly staff, clean dining room and facility overall. Cant wait to go back again!"}
{"text":"Went in here for the first time this afternoon to pick up a pizza and wings. The service was excellent and the wings were incredible. The guy gave me a few dipping sauces to try since i got my wings plain, and the house sauce was fantastic. I will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Their food is AMAZING! We usually order takeout and it's ready in a very reasonable amount of time. The pizza, meatballs and calzones are my personal favorites plus they have great specials!"}
{"text":"The pizza is good, the wings are okay, the SERVICE IS THE WORST.  I witnessed the blonde Russian woman, who is the owner together with her husband, tell people \"dont ever come here again!   We dont need your business!\"  

Unbelievable that this company remains in business. No service business should allow anyone, not even the owners wife, speak to customers in this manner.  

The blonde woman will also charge you more than the other employees, including her husband/owner.  Make sure you know what the charge will be before picking up because the blonde woman will OVERCHARGE you and be rude to you!

From reading other posts/reviews below and on other sites, its clear that I am not the only one to witness BAD SERVICE from TJs pizza.  Apparently, many customers get bad service from this place, which explains why one reviewer - Susan on May 7, 2011, wrote: \"it was pretty aweful, only one person was there eating;\" and Turtle on June 7, 2012, wrote: \"don't know how this place is still in business.\"

So, if you want good pizza, and you dont mind being OVER CHARGED and having ANGRY BAD SERVICE, then this is the place for you."}
{"text":"Maybe the best pizza I have had in AZ and this is coming from a New Yorker. The place itself is not much to look at but you can get two big slices and a drink for $4.95."}
{"text":"Pizza is great! Definitely a high quality and the cheese is delicious!
Wings are amaaazing!!!
Pretty quick and price isn't too bad! Service is great"}
{"text":"I've been going to TJ's since it's  opening,  lets start with the owner Great guy great with customer service and the cleanest Toyota Camry ever especially for delivery vehicle,  lunch specials are awesome practically for like 6 bucks you can fill your belly. I love the bone in wings. There's literally never been a negative experience at this establishment and every single one of the employees are the most friendly and courteous . I strongly recommend and as a matter of fact I'm heading there now :)"}
{"text":"* Pizza is outstanding.
* Garlic Cheese Breadsticks are incredible.
* Wings are above average.
* Owner really takes care of his customers.
* Fast delivery, and NO DELIVERY CHARGE like most places.
* Only negative is they close very early some nights.

Overall, great place, excellent food, fair prices.  I'm hooked."}
{"text":"Great place to get take-out/delivery Wings.  Their wings are naked, not breaded, and come with either Blue Cheese or Ranch.  The standard Buffalo wings are great, but their House Special wings are what really stand out.  If your looking for something spicy, just stick with the Buffalo sauce.  However, we recommend the House wings for something different.  The sauce on the House wings taste like a combination of mild garlic butter and parmesan cheese.  it doesn't really stick to the wings, but tastes amazing when dipped or rolled.

The pies come on a thinner New York style dough.  It is not thin crust, but the dough doesn't have much rise, which makes it great for folding in half.  We've only had pepperoni and sausage (I really liked the sliced sausage, which looks just like pepperoni, but you can order the pulled version too), so we can't really accurately comment on all of the toppings.  Be warned, the pies are very greasy.  I enjoy a greasy pie now and then, so be warned if you don't like your pies cooked this way.

The main selling point for TJ's is their special.  You can get a large pizza and 24 wings for only $25.  Even at buck extra for toppings, the deal is a steal.  We like to order it for supper that night and then I warm it up for 2-3 lunches.

Overall, a great place for delivery or take-out when you are in the mood for a greasy pie or wings.  Despite the extremely friendly employees, I wouldn't really want to eat here.  I was tempted to eat here the first night, when the manager offered to let me go next door, buy beer and just drink a few at the table, but I wanted to binge watch some TV.  We'd like to give it about 4.5 stars and rounded up, because we really like to support small businesses that offer food that we love."}
{"text":"Dining room is small, but the food is so tasty. We had the crispy chicken salad, pizza by the slice, gyros, and garlic cheese breadsticks. Reasonable prices, great taste, friendly service and clean bathroom. Highly recommend"}
