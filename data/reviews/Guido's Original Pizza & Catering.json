{"text":"This is my FAVORITE PIZZA ON EARTH. Homemade sauce, daily fresh dough,

To be fair, I did work here for 5 years. But I never got sick of it. The chicken is great great great too. Pure delight."}
{"text":"I can only speak on the wings and fries cuz that's all I ever get when I go there but man those white boys can fry some chicken! The flavor is pressed into every single bite and the skin is always good and crispy. The fries are the exact same way. I always order a dozen wings and a side of Jojo's and then get a huge cup of BBQ sauce on the side for my dipping pleasure.  The parking is kind of tight and the place is a hole in the wall but those are usually the best places to find good food in a college town!"}
{"text":"I've had guidos ever since I was a kid I grew up eating their pizza, chicken and salad, we've catered with them ever since I can remember! I just moved back to town and was so excited to have Guidos again!! Unfortunately I was really disappointed... the pizza isn't as thick, there isn't as much cheese, the salads barely have anything in them, and the chicken barely has any chicken on it! We complained last time a lady with black hair and she was very rude. I'm not sure if owners have changed or what but I have not been impressed. Hopefully the owner will see this review and maybe change some things. I will be back to update this soon! We order every Wednesday! I hope it stays that way or we will have to find somewhere else."}
{"text":"It's definitely delicious pizza's sheet pizza under $20 And weighs a ton, I love the cheese. However it was a 2 hour wait on sheet pizza and when I picked up at said time it was cold, they could of called and told me when it was ready early and they charge $1 for credit cards but worth it"}
{"text":"I've had Guido's for the past few weeks. Some things I Iike, some, not so much. 

The chicken and jojos are definitely my favorite. The chicken, \"flame broiled\" or fried, is delicious. I'm told that the fried chicken tastes slightly different because it is simultaneously pressure cooked and fried, or something along those lines. The jojos are similar, I'm betting that they are fried along with the chicken because they taste pretty similar. Crispy on the outside, smooth and potatoey on the inside.

Now for the dislikes. I can't stand their pizza. It tastes more like lasagna than pizza. They also cut it into squares, even though the pizza is round. Not sure what is up with that. The only thing that saved the pizza from being thrown away was the crust. Moving on, the cole slaw. Not sure I'm really surprised, but it comes from a carton in the fridge, plain and simple. MMM - the Sysco special! Lastly, the actual store. I don't think this place has been cleaned in years. Apparently the Kent health dept didn't make it this far out on W. Main. Their parking lot sucks.

Lastly, a sort of neutral ground. The staff. These guys don't care. Not a single care in the world. Every time, they forget something from my order. I've also had a pizza take 40 minutes before, even though when I stopped in to pick it up it seemed like I was the only order as they didn't even ask my name, and I'm certain that they don't know who I am. Last time I checked, it doesn't take 40 minutes to cook a pizza. But, I'm patient and now that I know the typical protocol it doesn't bother me too much. 

TL;DR - If you're starving and need food fast - steer clear. If you want good pizza - go somewhere else. If you want some delicious and greasy fried chicken and jojos for a steal and you want to pay with a check - this is your place!"}
{"text":"Just got some their breaded wings. Perfect coating, so flavorful and still Hot & Crispy when we opened the box at home. Can't wait to try their pizzas."}
{"text":"I'm biased. I've tried EVERY pizza place in Kent. After more than 20 years, this one returns as the favorite. It's the one the daughters HAVE to have every visit! Why? Well, the comment about \"lasagne\" is true, but we ask for it with 'light sauce\" - great result! It's crust is like no other in town - crispy ... yet dough-y enough not to crackle in your hand. Love it. Specials nights can find a 1-topping pizza (8\") for $2.50 maybe less."}
{"text":"I loved their dinner box and the pizza was amazing. A really good place to get chicken and pizza from"}
{"text":"I think it's gotten better with the new changes. It's way cleaner in there than it used to be. I used them for a golf outing I put on. So much cheaper than anywhere else. Like, not even close. Their wings are huge and the prices are awesome. Pizza tastes like it always has.

The veggie lasagna is so good. I'm not a huge lasagna guy, but it's to die for.


The customer service seems better. They were super friendly when I called with a bunch of questions. Didn't act annoyed or like they were doing me a favor. Delivered to the golf course pavilion, no problems. 

It's a Kent staple."}
{"text":"Still ok...  but...  not the same.  It's like they kept the same recipes but cut back in everything..   less sauce, less cheese, less everything....  not the same.....  just so the owner knows....  I'd pay any price ya want...  keep it the same!!!   Don't try to cheat the customer...   we always know......."}
{"text":"Only place I'll order pizza or fried chicken from.  Just make sure you have it delivered (for a nominal fee, of course) or have a strong stomach if you're picking up. The food is excellent."}
{"text":"The pizza here was ok greasy typical pizza. The place looked so beat down I liked it. It was probably 2003 or so and I received a phone call from my Mama back home in Lakewood. She told me she heard on the news that a delivery man at Guido's was selling dope and delivering pizzas. The place automatically gained respect from me. The Jo Jo's are good too!"}
