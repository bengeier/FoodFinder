{"text":"Bought the tacos and wish I didn't. Tried the shrimp and the carne asada and will never go back. Cheap ingredients in tortillas that fell apart at first touch. Tacos were $4 a piece."}
{"text":"The carne asada had a great flavor. However, we ordered the bowl and you really don't get enough for the price. We also had the crab quesadilla special and it wasn't that great."}
{"text":"I would give this place zero stars if I could. They charge $8.50 for a bacon egg and cheese breakfast burrito, or $6.00 for just egg and cheese. They don't seem to understand pricing, as their food should be excellent and taste exceptional if you are going to rip people off. Their food is bland and tasteless, and that's being nice. McDonalds is a far better option.   I hope they go out of business so they may all go back to school and educate themselves in finance and economics and come to the understanding that charging $8.50 for basic ingredients should be considered a federal crime. This place sucks!"}
{"text":"Im all for supporting local vendors and trying new things, but I was highly disappointed w my meal. I got a veggie burrito w guac. It was big, but kinda bland. The tomatoes in the pico did not taste very fresh. The service was great, but the guac was an extra $2 and looked more like green cream than guacamole. If it would have been delicious, I wouldn't have cared, but $8 for the burrito plus extra for guac...i expected more flavor, more wow!The tortilla was good, but I ended up throwing the last half of the burrito away. It just wasn't good enough to keep eating. I guess I'm used to being spoiled by free guac w veggie burritos at chipotle. Next time I want to pay less and love my meal, I'll go there."}
{"text":"Not much flavor. I basically got everything on my carne asada burrito and it was bland. The meat was okay, but very sparse. Overpriced for the quality of the food."}
{"text":"We have food trucks that come to our building in Tempe every Thursday and I thought I would give them a try. They do the chipotle/subway style build in front of you. I got the Lamb barbecoa burrito. The food was fresh, the portion was big however it was bland, no flavor at all. I got Guac on my burrito and a coke for $16. I won't be going to this truck again."}
{"text":"Not worth price. I should have turned around when I got an attitude for simply asking how many tacos for $4. They must get this question a lot from their defensive response. I ended up ordering a carnesada and carnitas taco for $8. The tacos aren't street tacos but not much bigger. Only one corn tortilla so it ended up breaking up after one bite. I enjoyed the flavor of carnesada taco. But pork wasn't cooked all the way so I threw away. Previous reviewer referenced Chipotle on wheels but I didn't get to choose any toppings and at Chipotle you get 3 tacos for $6.50. $8 for one/two tacos...no bueno"}
{"text":"Purchased a carne asada bowl. Added guac and a soda. The flavor was good nothing to write home about though, and it was pretty pricey $17.50 for this, probably won't eat here again based on price vs food quality"}
{"text":"Overpriced and commerical. Tacos are $4 EACH, guac is $2 extra, bottled sodas are $2. That is nearly $20. A Chipotle knockoff. My colleagues and I felt ripped off and wished we had went to the next food truck over. Do yourself a favor, try other food trucks and you may have a better experience. Food was okay, nothing great."}
{"text":"I'm the Program Chair for the Az Museum of Natural History and we used  Wandering Donkey to cater one of our largest yearly events. They did an extraordinary job. The food was amazing, for the time in the history of this event we had NO negative feedback from customers or staff on the food choices. The service was wonderful. Thank you Lance and Beth for a great experience."}
{"text":"Don't understand the bad reviews on here. They had so many choices of meat and allowed me to sample the lamb and the steak. Both were very flavorful it decided to go with the lamb barbacoa because that's not something you eat everyday. There was a choice of rice, beans, and grilled veggies. I went with grilled veggies because of my diet and was also very flavorful. Lots of choices to put on to top as you go down the line. I went with corn, cheese, sour cream, pico, green salsa (between 3 different), jalape√±os, guacamole, and cabbage. I thought it was amazing! Chipotle on crack! Would def come again!"}
{"text":"I would say it's Chipotle on wheels, but I don't want to compare this AMAZING food truck to a restaurant that's associated with risks of food safety.  Wandering Donkey catered a wedding I attended last weekend & I was thoroughly impressed!  They handled the rush of the crowd with ease, the selections were amazing and SO tasty!  I chose the steak bowl with rice, black beans, and all the savory toppings.  Such a fun alternative to a traditional caterer!"}
{"text":"The food truck scene downtown is pretty competitive, and there is a different truck outside my office a couple times per week. I typically try whatever fare is available that day, but the Wandering Donkey was really just mediocre for me.  I had the Lamb Barbacoa bowl - the meat itself was very tasty, a little fatty and salty, but those aren't necessarily bad features for me. As some other reviews have pointed out, the rice and beans were essentially flavorless - it was also disappointing to me that there were almost no options (ONE choice of beans, ONE choice of rice, etc). If you are going to charge $11-$12 for a burrito bowl (WAY above market price in my opinion), you should at least offer a few different options for the contents of the bowl.    There were 3 salsa choices (aside from Pico and Corn) - the Medium was very hot so I was really glad I did not get the Hot.   For the price and limited options, if the truck was in front of my office again, I would most likely not buy my lunch here again."}
{"text":"We used Wandering Donkey and their sister truck, Grilled Addiction, for my sister's wedding 2 weeks ago. EVERYONE loved it! It was such a delicious alternative to the usual boring cold reception meal. Our guests were thrilled to be able to order a burrito, bowl or taco from Wandering Donkey or a hamburger from Grilled Addiction. Thanks so much to Lance, Beth and the food truck cooks! Lance and Beth were there at the wedding taking orders and being so helpful. They smiled and interacted with all of our guests which we really appreciated. They were awesome!"}
{"text":"Think Chipotle on wheels...which is absolutely a compliment.  You choose between a bowl, burrito, or tacos (quesadillas were also available), and then go down the line and decide which tasty fixins you want.  They didn't have every meat & topping shown on the menu, so be sure to ask what is available.  I ordered the bowl w/ rice, black beans & chicken.  The grilled chicken was great!  Fresh, flavorful and perfectly cooked.    I am a lover of green salsa, and theirs did not disappoint.  It was the perfect amount of heat.  We were able to walk right up, personalize our orders and pay within a matter of minutes, which was fantastic.  Anyone who has tried a few food trucks will tell you that they can leave you waiting.  Wandering Donkey is a tad pricy for what you get, but they fall in line with average food truck prices ($8-10).  You have to pay for convenience!  Overall, great truck!  I would definitely return to try the carne asada!"}
{"text":"I've gotten food from this truck a couple of times and both times I was shocked to only get two super tiny tacos. Not much food for the price. As others have stated the meat is pretty bland with virtually no flavor to it. They called it carnitas and barbacoa but really it is just pork and beef that has been boiled with no spice or anything until it turned to mush. They do have some hot salsas to add a little heat but if you get the pico or the corn salsa you will find that those also have no flavor at all. The corn is literally just corn kernels with nothing else. It is not even a corn salsa. It is like they just opened a bag of frozen corn.  The main problem as others have mentioned is that their tortillas are really crappy and dry.  They don't heat them or anything so they completely fall apart when you are trying to eat, thereby making the tacos or burrito inedible. They obviously know this already since they serve their tacos with a plastic fork!"}
{"text":"Had a great low-carb carnitas bowl from the Wandering Donkey food truck at the Queen Creek Olive mill today. They were very flexible filling my order. Thanks!"}
{"text":"This review is for the 12 dollar Carne asada burrito i give this a 1 star  Pros: - large burrito  Cons: - Carne Asada was flavorless and tough to eat.  - structure of how the burrito was rolled and broke apart as I ate through the burrito (technique used: peeled wrapper as eaten) - overall taste I would give 1 out of 10.  - individual component taste would give 1 out of 10.  I typically give places a 2nd or third chance. But I wouldn't give this place a 2nd."}
{"text":"Absolutely no flavor \"all rice and beans, and very little meat\". There spicy salsa had no flavor and was unbearably spicy and I like spicy. Now a couple of hours later my stomach is turning and I'm going to have too miss class tonight.  Mexican food that is not even close to Mexican food. Thanks wandering donkey!"}
