{"text":"Ordered a beef quesadilla and a margarita before departing on my flight. Priced really well and the margarita was great."}
{"text":"Worst burrito that I have ever had. Basically, i felt it was not edible and I found it to be nauseating. Told me they use potatoes instead of beans and just barely sprinkled on the ingredients. Never again for me at Barrio Avion which was a complete waste of $8.00. I took one bite and then just threw it away!"}
{"text":"Old and tasteless scarily burritos that flake off when you bite into them. Watered down meat. These burritos belong in a museum they look and taste like fossilized rocks. I wouldn't recommend even if starving"}
{"text":"I am writing this review in hopes that the management of this restaurant reads it and makes some serious changes. I ate a pork burrito here on 08APR2016 and got food poisoning. I am a flight attendant now but used to be a chef, so I was required by law to know exactly what food born illness is and how to prevent it. Aside from a prepackaged granola bar, that burrito was the only thing I ate that day. About 8 hours later, (while on a plane to Mexico ironically), I felt it hit me. By the time I got to my hotel it had been about 12 hours and I was completely immobilized. Luckily I was able to get the situation under control myself rather than go to an E.R. in Mexico, (I do not speak Spanish so that was my main concern), but it was really, and I mean REALLY close!   I will obviously never eat here again, but I do hope that the management of Barrio Avion reads this and takes measures to ensure this never happens again, this can literally kill people. Make sure the meats are being kept at the proper temps, and don't save meats from the previous day and mix them in with a new batch. Please educate your employees on proper hygiene techniques and take measure to ensure they are using them.    Eat here at your own risk people, you've been warned!"}
{"text":"Pretty fast, kind of greasey version of Chipotle. Not half bad for airport food, but pretty sad for vegetarians"}
{"text":"I realize it is an airport restaurant but you don't yell that your bandaid just got wet and take it off in front of me and then tell your coworker you're glad the customers are not ordering from here. Wish I would have read the bad reviews before but there weren't a whole lot of options"}
{"text":"Over priced low quality food. They almost didn't honor our employee discount too. The staff were okay though."}
{"text":"The little aluminum tin of flan had no caramel sauce and was $5.  Very disappointing!"}
{"text":"Needing a snack before my flight, I decided to give Barrio a try. Their Chef Silvana's award winning guacamole looked appetizing since it's comprised of hass avocado, onion, tomato, cilantro, jalapeño pepper, lime, salt and pomegranate seeds served with fresh chips. When I got the bowl of guacamole, it tasted like there was alcohol in it, but most likely something within the salsa must have fermented. I was scared to get sick while on my flight so I didn't finish the rest of it. I'm sure their guacamole is better at their locations outside the airport, but I do not recommend ordering this menu item."}
{"text":"The Barrio Cafe in the Southwest terminal is way better than this one. The tables and floor are dirty, there are flies, and the staff is rude. I'm a fan of the guacamole at the other locations, but this one was just plain bad. There was almost as much red onion as there was avocado. I got the plain quesadilla (I read the other Yelp reviews and didn't want to risk it with anything else).  Way too greasy and just plain gross.   I should have gone to the Wendy's next door."}
{"text":"Vegans, yo!  Get a bowl with rice and beans, veg, spinach, corn and rajas de jalapeños and guacamole.  So good.  I didn't ask about the rice and beans, so if you're shooting for perfection, please do.  But I'll say I'm stoked to have this for breakfast behind security."}
{"text":"This is an OK option if you're in a pinch. The food is OK but not good. Generally the place is super dirty and gross. I hope I don't get sick from this food."}
{"text":"At 645 AM, they were already out of eggs for breakfast?!  Two employees working seemed to be \"put out\" by any questions. Lady behind me asked about sizes of coffee and response was curt if not downright rude. One employee weighed meat before making burrito. The other just estimated. Difference in burrito substantial. Looked like an egg roll!   Wendy's next door would be a better option for breakfast food."}
{"text":"This place is fine and most of the complaints I've seen are more about style rather than quality. The tortilla is flaky because they grill it first, not because it's old. Cabbage instead of lettuce is fairly common in Mexican food. Glad I added the corn because it was pretty tasty!"}
{"text":"Giving them the benefit of the doubt I tried their food anyways.   However I am pretty disappointed in their quality of food and service.  The rice is too soggy and the vegetables doesn't look that fresh.  I'm trying to eat the food as I'm writing this and feel really disappointed that the churro is over cooked and stale :(  I'm not angry, just disappointed"}
{"text":"***Barrio Avion is a good breakfast option for airport food in the Phoenix International Airport***  Barrio Avion is from the popular Barrio restaurant team in Phoenix.  This airport eatery is in the United terminal, which has very few dining options due to the limited number of gates.  Barrio Avion looked good so I decided to give it a try.  For breakfast, they offer build-your-own breakfast burritos and quesadillas.  You can also get chilaquiles.  For my breakfast burrito, I had scrambled eggs, cheese, chorizo, guacamole, salsa, spinach, grilled peppers, grilled onions, sour cream, and cilantro.  There were many other options too including a variety of meats (more lunch/dinner-like meats than breakfast meats), beans, rice, and a variety of vegetables.  The burrito was good.  Everything was fresh and the meaty and juicy chorizo had a very strong spiciness to it.  The burrito was very heavy and you can add quite a bit of not that good for you ingredients in the burrito so I am not sure if it is the best thing to consume before jumping on a plane.  In terms of being a satisfying and quick meal though, I think Barrio Avion does its job well for an airport eatery.  I also saw their breakfast quesadillas and they looked very appetizing.  I also had their churro and it was disappointing.  The flavor was fine though it tasted like it was made a long time ago.  The texture and quality of the pastry (or lack thereof) made it seem like something you would get at a grocery bakery as opposed to a restaurant (airport or not) that should strive for made-to-order (or at least very recently made) food whenever possible.  Service was friendly and quick.  Prices were a tad high, but portions were generous and definitely more than enough for sharing between two people.  Barrio Avion is order-at-the-counter though they do have a comfortable and clean fast food restaurant-esque seating area.  Barrio Avion is a satisfying breakfast option for an airport.  Barrio Avion definitely does not have the finesse or attention to detail of a great airport eatery like Tortas Fronteras in Chicago's O'Hare Airport, but I enjoyed the food here significantly more than most airport eateries and restaurants I have dined at.  I am not sure what the parking situation is like at Phoenix International Airport, but I imagine parking here is expensive like other U.S. airports."}
{"text":"five stars for the pizza, it's airport before check in or after deplaning, my friend had a cold pizza from here on Thursday, had a taste upon arrival, stopped here for departure to verify and it's great . had the Brooklyn family style!! great and maybe we lucked out but had it twice once cold once fresh go for it"}
{"text":"Airport food always presents a problem due to timing, price, and availability but this Mexican-style fast food venue has delicious quesadillas. It was fast and convenient which is critical for the airport experience. If you want something a bit more than the airline fare this is a reasonable choice."}
{"text":"Delivious and quick Mexican food. I had a chicken bowl which was delicious. They also have house-made chips."}
{"text":"Don't waste your money!  I ordered the Chicken Burrito and threw most of it in the trash.  Service was also extremely slow...good thing I wasn't in a hurry to catch my flight."}
{"text":"Overheard the employee telling a trainee that the cooked eggs were old and needs to be thrown by replacing with new batch. But they never did it when I requested. What a superior quality food you serving then? Another best part, they ran out of rice, guacamole, folks and even napkins?? That was really too much!! Will never eat here again!!"}
{"text":"This is a nice little diversion from the typical airport food venues. I've been here a couple time and the food is very good.  Food choices are basic, which I like...why  reinvent mexican food. They have tacos...pork, beef and chicken...Burritto's (same choices)...and salad. That's it...and that's about as simple as it gets...perfect.  I like how they steam the tortilla 's and make them all soft...pick your condiments. I've tried the Burritto's...pretty tasty, but this time I went for the taco's and added pork, avacado, pico de gallo, hot sauce...a squeze of lime...awesome. Use caution as each taco uses only one corn tortilla and it will break apart very quickly...but thats what napkins are for...!!!  Good food, quick, tasty...fair price. Go enjoy...!!!"}
{"text":"For airport food, this place does perfectly fine. I got a burrito bowl. Portion was adequate, quality was good. If I ever found myself in the dump that is Terminal 2 at Sky Harbor, I'd go back."}
{"text":"Stopped here during an early morning flight out. The breakfast bowl was so-so. Not pricey at all. They also have wine and beer to curb those preflight anxieties. Staff can be friendlier...but then again it's early morning."}
{"text":"This was not good at all. The food was greasy and disgusting looking. The bad smell of grease should have been a sign that I shouldn't have eaten here, but terminal 2 doesn't have many options so I thought I would give it a shot.   The service was terrible. There were two women working who seemed to be making an effort to move as slowly as possible. All I ordered was a quesadilla and it took about 15 minutes with only one person in front of me in line. By the time they finally asked what I wanted, quite a line had formed behind me. Even worse is that they weren't friendly at all and seemed agitated that I decided to eat there.   The food wasn't great either. I only tried the quesadilla, so I can't speak for anything else, but it was disgustingly greasy and dripping with oil. I couldn't stomach even half of it. They also got my drink order wrong, but by that point I was just ready to leave so I didn't say anything.   I know it's airport food, but you can do much better."}
{"text":"Awful. Just awful. I took about three bites of my beef burrito and threw it away.  Flavors were all off. I felt sorry for the staff."}
{"text":"Close to the worst airport food I've had. I ordered a Bol with rice and chicken. The rice was crunchy and cold. My husband ordered a breakfast burrito which was pretty bad too. Even if the food is bad, it should be served hot but it was cold. Service was slow as well. I think next time we'll be looking at packaged food options vs. sit down options."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here - a chorizo quesadilla - and it was just great.  It was way too large - I could have been happy with one-third of what I was given.  I ended up leaving over half of it -- so maybe smaller portions could be offered.  The service was fine.  What I want to tell Barrio Avion, if they read these reviews, is that the signage is highly confusing and makes it hard to order.  I suggest:  1)  increase the type size on the signs (it's small and really hard to see), and 2) show some photos of the food.    I would surely go here again - no doubt."}
{"text":"They were the only place open, and they were getting slammed, but they left things off we asked for and adding things we didn't. The tortilla was good and grilled on the burrito, but that's all I can recommend.   Overall, it was a disappointment and my daughter said Taco Bell would've been better."}
{"text":"Perfectly fine chain but has an odd combo of fixings for a Mexican food bar - not enough cilantro laced rice I think! The best part is the staff who were SO NICE and cheerful when I last went. The bad thing was the flan - it's really expensive for a way too dense dessert when flan really should be the opposite of it."}
{"text":"Good lord. Terrible customer service. Everyone seems new and/or doesn't give a shit. They were out of rice and didn't seem like they were going to make anymore... noon in a Sunday. When I opted for the salad, I got a blank look and then the person \"serving\" me yelled to her coworker... how do I make a salad? Whenever I asked a question, such as, \"which dressings come with the salad,\" it took 3 people to figure out there was Ranch dressing in the back.  Food tastes fine. But there are obviously training issues here... just an hour of training would do wonders."}
{"text":"Rude staff.  Dirty floors and counters. I watched the food preparer make my quesadilla with gloved hands. She then grabbed the garbage can and grabbed my hot quesadilla with the filthy glove to cut it. .  Public health?  You need to visit.  By the way, in the spirit of too much information sharing, the food server was discussing her pregnancy and personal challenges with another employee."}
{"text":"I stopped in today before my flight and was honestly underwhelmed.  I am shocked that Chef Silvana puts her name to this dumbed down concept.  The staff was not friendly at all...they seemed bothered to help me.  The chicken burrito was good, but nothing special...you expect a lot more after dining at Barrio Cafe on 16th Street!"}
{"text":"Way to much salt on the meat.  While the service is quick I think I will pass next time."}
{"text":"There is no choice.   I wasted ten minutes in a slow line. I wanted pork. Good thing there was no other meat available. But at 1 in the afternoon, who would think you could still eat here?!  I looked over reviews. I thought the and half would be a very good spot.  But I can't give two starts to a place that doesn't serve half its menu..  I understand I'm in Phoenix. But my bol construction person spoke English very well when they had what I would ask for, then quickly speak Spanish when they were out of salsa, queso, chicken, beef, chili wuth Limon. ...  I can't let another person go through this place"}
{"text":"Third Barrio I've hit up during this trip to Phoenix, and even the airport didn't disappoint! I had a few tacos, while my colleague got a rice bowl, the latter was DEFINITELY bang for the buck! My tacos were delicious and i was just looking for a light snack, but the bowl had to be 5lbs and filled with delicious meat and rice. Definitely recommend if you need a quick meal at the airport!"}
{"text":"Holy Chalupa what a  great find. Ok it's at the airport so expectations are aways low for airport grub. But I needed a bite prior to jumping in a flight and wow, I was impressed. Good quality offerings and fixed for my consumption extremely fast...  I grabbed a Dr Pepper and chorizo Casa Dia. So warning for you wimps the chorizo is HAWT! Your mouth will need a tasty beverage to put the fire out it, but massive flavors for one to enjoy. You have several meat and veggie options to incorporate into your food so pick what u need. Based on brief experience I can say I'll be back when I'm a sky harbor airport waiting for a flight.  Hope u enjoy."}
{"text":"Excellent value...about $9.66 for a meat/rice/beans/fixins bowl...it's as if Chipotle married Gadzooks...the meat is tasty (I've had the beef both times)...the rice is fluffy and the black beans are just right...the guac, cheese, and sour crema are authentic and classic Mexican Mexican food. FINALMENTE- something delicious AND for a more-than-reasonable-price at the airport - I STILL HAVE SHOPPING MONEY FOR MY TRIP!"}
{"text":"This is a great option for good food, prepared quickly and priced reasonable. All the ingredients are already prepared, so you slide down the \"assembly\" line selecting the combination that you want. I went with 3 chicken tacos(street size). Added salsa and pico, passed on the beans and the guc was an extra $2.00. A little disappointed that they do not serve ice tea."}
{"text":"Food was scarce, and waiting for drinks (just soda) took forever! The fish tacos were a joke. It was literally just a small fish nugget on 2 corn tortillas. There were 3 of these \"tacos\" on a plate. After I finished, (without getting asked if I wanted a refill of soda), I waited for over 20 minutes just to get the check. A woman sitting at another table actually came up to me and asked me who my server is and how long I have been waiting. She was not happy with the lack of service either. Next time I fly through PHX, I will skip this horrible restaurant."}
{"text":"Has to be the slowest worst run airport food stand anywhere. Do not get into line with less than 2 hours before your flight"}
{"text":"The most overpriced, low quality food, and dirty presentation of cafeteria style food in the Sky Harbor airport. They weigh the meat on a scale and literally count how many beans go on the burrito. This place makes Chipotle seem like a five star restaurant. The girls behind the counter are unfriendly and look very unprofessional. They belong at a cafeteria serving this crap in a county jail. Their excuse for being dirty is because they were busy. Disgusting."}
{"text":"Great breakfast option in the United terminal. They offer build your own breakfast burritos, burrito bowls and breakfast quesadillas. I opted for the breakfast quesadilla (aka quesadilla con huevos.) I added chicken, which was actually pretty tasty and the portions were HUGE! I would definitely recommend getting a breakfast burrito here over the grab and go across the way at Coffee Bean."}
{"text":"This place needs some serious parental, and/or governmental guidance.  Foods awful, nobody seems to want to work, it's filthy, and they were out of their famous guacamole, but then I saw the person behind me get guacamole."}
{"text":"I won't repeat the prior reviews. Everything is fair. Service is pleasant. Surprised that they did not have either beans or corn!?!  But hey it's an airport. I left satisfied. And they have draft beer. 'Nuff said."}
{"text":"Meh. Didn't have the enchilada sauce, and actually not too many good options. but it is airport food. I still scarfed it down as my last Mexican meal in America before leaving the country. Quick and friendly service."}
{"text":"Had a quick chomp here for dinner before catching my flight this past Friday night. Well, for one thing, retailers/dining, etc in any airport are going to be tough to compete with the non-airport \"stand-alones\" simply because of the constant transient foot traffic.   So, I acknowledge this fact and try to cut airport places some slack. This place could be REALLY great, and the other night, it was decent/okay. But maybe they like mediocrity??  I had the beef quesadilla and I really liked that I could add on unique ingredients to it such as raw cabbage, pickled carrots/onions, cilantro/onion, etc. The taste was pretty good, after literally using maybe 20 napkins to press out the yellow/orange grease from the cheese?? Ughhhh :(  Service was friendly but condiment area needs improvement. They had ample amounts of black pepper packets but no salt?! Plus, just a little better housekeeping would improve on the diners' experience greatly."}
{"text":"\"Terrible service, mediocre food\"   Little-to-no effort to make the tacos and bowls even look appetizing as they construct them. Ended up with a half filled bowl of dry chicken + rice. When asked why it was so little food for $10+, the woman responded \"do you want more salsa?\"   Enough people travel through this airport for the staff to have experience with serving people. Come on. Copper Plate and Wendy's are better deals in the United terminal."}
{"text":"After standing in line and leaving once because of the long wait (with only one person ahead of us), we attempted to order a beer. That's it. Sadly for us, we were informed that after standing in security line for an extended time, we could not be served alcohol because none of the employees on duty was old enough to serve!  Ridiculous!  The young girl behind the counter kindly directed us to the ONLY OTHER BAR in Terminal 2, which was much farther from our gate and already packed (we had already checked). It's absolutely frustrating that of two bars within the entire terminal, one of them can't find an employee over the age of 21!  On the upside, while we didn't try the food, it did look and smell delicious!"}
{"text":"This was the worst at barrio style food I've ever eaten. I'm embarrassed for them and myself for eating all three of my tacos. I got pollo, res, and puerco and all the meats tasted the same. They look legit too so it's very strange. I actually thought I lost my sense of taste at first and walked over to Wendy's and ordered a frosty and nuggets to make sure I hadn't somehow impaired myself from the night before. The honey mustard tasted on point as always, so I'm proud to say I can taste and Barrio Avión has 0 seasoning. The \"hot\" salsa was laughable and the tortillas were a joke. The sad thing is not a lot of people yelp when they're flying so this place will keep embarrassing Mexican food and nobody will be the wiser"}
{"text":"A man was sitting next to the napkins and utensils area picking the skin off his fresh tattoo and was tossing the skin every where.  I asked staff to call airport security and they refused.  I talked to the \"skin\" man and he just continued to pick his skin.  After the man left, I advised staff that they clean up the utensil area, and two of the staff proceeded to take a break.  Still dirty and disgusting.  No one should go here!  Staff to immature and do not care about health standards!!"}
{"text":"Keep walking! Bad \"award winning\" guacamole at $10.50! Stale chips. Rip-off quesadilla. Untrained staff. Would not return, there's a better restaurant toward gate 11."}
{"text":"Let me preface this review. I'm from a northern country where good burritos tacos and enchiladas are hard to come by. So for me when I have the opportunity to be in the American SW, I enjoy eatingMexican as much as possible. Let me explain folks.......I can empathize how some reviewers who eat high quality Mexican on a regular basis may think this place is crappola. It is airport food so I lower my expectations firstly and foremost. For me however I really had a great meal!   My choice was three small tacos for an early lunch. Two chicken and one pork. With them I was served fresh queso, rice, fresh pico de gallo and some black beans and chopped lettuce. Everything was fresh and tasty. It's really all I could ask for. So it's a nice change for me a different meal than your regular run of the mill Airport crap consisting of burgers, sandwiches etc. If in the United Terminal of PHX-Sky Harbour I'm all over this place again.   Just a word of mention, in this little airport restaurant seating is very limited. Be a good person and eat quickly and let someone else take your place rather than use the mindset that it's a Starbucks and hang out here all day like a lazy gator."}
{"text":"According to the sign in the hallway, this was one of the top 10 airport eats listed by CNN in 2013. Alright, so this is a little outdated and today's airport dining options are THROUGH THE ROOF. Seriously, have you seen JFK lately? Or the new additions to O'Hare? Anywho, I had 15 minutes to grab some grub and this looked like a fun and interesting option. I'll say it was on the especially expensive side with my meal running $16 for a tamale, rice and beans with a small (very small) side of guacamole. The meal came with a bottle of water. Similar to American food, Mexican cuisine comes in several shapes and sizes. This place leans on the TexMex side of things - ya know, gravy and cheddar cheese - on everything. My veggie tamale stood out as the star of the show and the guac was fairly tasty. The rice was meh. Service was friendly and quick and the business had a nice façade. Would I return? Yes. Did it knock my socks off? Not so much."}
{"text":"Place is kind of disgusting and dirty. Music is horrible. I want and ordered at 1:30 p.m. and they are out of almost every item. Large sodas only. $10 for a quesadilla is too much money. Very slow service,  especially with limited amount of items.  2 stars because the quesadilla is actually very tasty and I'm hoping I don't get sick."}
{"text":"Fair food and horrible service. Maybe not horrible but non-existent. The waitress took my order and she never spoke to me again. Another server slung the hash out without a word. The sever who took my order never asked how the food was. Never asked if she could get me anything else. Never refilled my water. Didn't say thank you. Nothing...  Crazy! Does she not get how tipping works?"}
{"text":"Mundane Mexican food. Think low end Chipotle. The opportunity to customize a bowl was nice. The shredded beef was tough and lacking flavor. Something in my bowl, probably the beans, had a burnt taste. Staff were friendly but the place needed a good cleaning.   The atmosphere would be better if the equivalent of a Mexican judge Judy wasn't blaring on the tv!"}
{"text":"Nasty.  Over cooked.  Apathetic employee put her earbuds in while waiting on me. Over priced.  Cool and quiet though."}
{"text":"I'm giving Barrio Avion four stars for two reasons. First, because I had a pleasant experience and enjoyed my meal. And second, because airport restaurants should to be graded on a curve. I mean, let's be honest. How many airport eateries would be worth more than 2 or 3 stars in the real world? Across the board (at least in the US) these places serve pre-made, low quality, reheated, packaged food that looks bad and doesn't taste much better. And with service that is reliably below average. So let's acknowledge that when you're eating while flying, you're in a bubble where the usual rules don't apply.  So with this in mind, I think Barrio Avion deserves some credit. They offer a simple menu of Baja style favorites that are pretty tasty, relatively fresh, and better than anything else in Sky Harbor terminal 2. Their chicken, pork and beef all have good flavor. They grill their tortillas, and prep some great condiments including guacamole, and grilled onions with jalapeños. Which you'll need since Baja style beans and rice are typically bland.  So I appreciate the criticism, and have no doubt that many folks either don't like the food and/or had terrible service. But be honest. You're eating in an airport. If you had higher expectations, then you're kidding yourself. Cut this place some slack. Their food is as good as most any chain burrito stand, and worth a visit."}
{"text":"Pleasantly surprised -- seems like the best bet if you're flying United. Girl working was super polite, food was good and portions were generous. Had the chicken bowl with guac. Might be the most and best quality food I've had in an airport for under $10."}
{"text":"Avoid!  Greasy globs of food...out of some salad items...slow.  I ate at Cleo's at The Yard on Saturday - there's a Barrio there that I THOUGHT I'd like to try sometime.  NO WAY!  What a disappointment."}
{"text":"i love the phoenix airport and Barrio Avion is one of the many reasons why.   a little too expensive, but so is everything in an airport. so YOLO. Right?  salsas were bomb, meat was bomb, they have wine which was bomb. The bowl filled me up and made me fall asleep on my plane. Mission accomplished  bomb bomb bomb"}
{"text":"I guess it could be considered typical airport fare, but it was honestly quite gross and barely edible. I hate to be so critical of a small business, but this place needs to get their act together to make this place worthy of a first, let alone return visit."}
{"text":"Food was pretty disappointing but since I don't have high standards for airport food I'd be willing to let that go to except....the service was awful...absolutely no customer service, rude, staff checking their phones right in front of customers, dropping things not picking them up. They had no diet soda...because they ran out and even though beer/wine are on the menu you can't have any because \"we aren't allowed to serve it cause we are underage\" . Note to managers if you have alcohol on your menu have some staff that can serve it and find some employees that show a little respect for having their jobs!"}
{"text":"First off, Terminal 2 at PHX Sky Harbor would safely be described as a remote wasteland on the far outer fringes but, I was desperate for something to eat between the 2 flights to get me back to Austin.  I had passed this place a few times and didn't think much of it but I saw a number of Airport employees in line to eat and thought, what the heck, couldn't be any worse than the other options there.  Probably one of the best burritos I've had in a very long time and the wonderful young lady who put it together for me offered to run down to their other store to get me one of their very cool t-shirts.  I'm not skipping this place again and highly recommend it - a pleasant and much welcomed surprise in the middle of nowhere :)"}
{"text":"Mmm! I was very pleasantly surprised by their delicious burrito! I wasn't excited to have to eat at the airport...but now I can't wait to fly out of here again!  Olivia made my burrito perfectly! All of the ingredients were yummy! I'm hoping they have a restaurant outside of the airport!"}
{"text":"Airport food is rarely any good - so when I tell you that this was the worst food I've ever eaten in an airport, it should really tell you something.   The chips were hard and tasteless. The guacamole tasted like chemicals and nothing like fresh avocado. The quesadilla could have been edible if not for the copious amounts of grease leaking out of it every time I tried to lift it to my lips."}
{"text":"Airport restaurants are usually just ok. The reviews for this one said fair food. Fair food is ok when you're in a hurry but the customer service was terrible. The employee first started by saying \"just to let you know, we ain't got no rice or no beef\".  Ooookayyyy? Not a good start for a burrito spot but whatever. They were so kind enough to direct us to the \"Ohso Brewery and Distillery\" bar and grill further down. Now the burgers in that place were delicious, but a bit expensive but worth it I'm sure. Thanks for the tip, but I don't think the owner of this place would appreciate you sending a customer away. Especially  when we were willing to compromise on the \"no rice\". Which was promptly followed by her comment...\"y'all must really want Mexican food\". Ok. That did it. We left and went to Wendy's. As we walked back passed Barrió Avión, she yelled \"enjoy your Wendy's. Wow how nice of her to be so concerned. Sorry chef Silvana. Horrible representation of your, I'm sure, delicious food."}
{"text":"I give this place four stars because they are the best healthy alternative in a sea of the worst, unhealthiest choices on the planet.  At least here you can get a veggie bol and mine was pretty danged good. I also got their Jarritos grapefruit soda which I would not recommend.   The attendants were cheery and the price was only mildly easy-too-high, but still cheaper than the alternatives."}
{"text":"This place is inside terminal 2 at sky harbor international airport. Food was good however, our server was the MOST unpleasant server I have had. No eye contact when speaking to my partner and I, very monotone, got out orders confused, basically dropped off our plates and walked away. TOLD me they were out of something and walked away, NEVER asked if there was something else I wanted in place of the missing item, JUST WALKED AWAY. She also NEVER once came back to ask how anything was or if there was anything additional we needed or wanted. I have a TIP for her,  if you don't like your job, the do something about it cause your people skills are very barbaric."}
{"text":"Efficient and fast. Exactly what you'd expect from a fast food place. The burrito is pretty good and quite large. The pork looks spicy and flavorful but needs some salsa and other spices. Otherwise it is surprisingly bland. The guacamole side is not bad although a bit too heavy on the onions and also very small for an additional $2."}
{"text":"Here's what to like: it's not a national chain. It's clean. The people are nice. For airport food, the price is amazingly fair.  Not so much: barbacoa burrito with egg - beef was exceptionally tough, the scrambled egg was dry. The salsa Verde was ok. The tortilla was a bit chewy.  I tried their main restaurant months back and chalked the mediocre food up to a bad night. Perhaps my taste runs contrary to others.  In the airport? Want something, anything, other than chain food? You'll be ok here.   Not bad. Just not what I'd hoped for from a noted restaurateur."}
{"text":"I'm expecting a nice breakfast burrito prior to my flight as i do every time. The employees here are just standing around telling me the burrito will take a long time cause there only 1 guy in the kitchen but there's literally only 2 other tables. This staff is horrendous with some pretty negative attitudes. Very rude staff completely ignores customers just stands around chatting about their work drama and eating and drinking rather than attending to customers needs. Time to clean house. Very unprofessional. Send your employees to landmark or something and get some basic training on life as a human being. Well see if the food comes fast and is good enough for a star bump but my first impression is a twosie! Its 10am and the excise is no eggs for a breakfast burrito because the guy in the back has to cook them. Isn't that what a restaurant is for? Imbeciles. Take care of your customers, do your job, be polite or you're getting stiffed, dumbasses! Now more people show up and this stupid lady keeps talking over her customers at the useless guy standing around doing nothing about her work schedule drama. Somebody get this girl a damn hobby! Decent burrito tho and didn't take too long, but why bring it up?! Decent burrito not a great experience. (Downstairs pre-security location)"}
{"text":"Ate here with my daughter while waiting for a delayed flight. I had a Mayan salad with pork and she had the simple quesadilla with corn tortillas. We were both extremely surprised at how delicious the food is! And, wow, the guacamole really is awesome! I was also impressed by the serving sizes and overall cost, considering were in the airport. The gal who wss serving us was doing everything on her own, but she took her time and made it really good!! Thanks for a great meal before our flight!"}
{"text":"Very small portion for the bowl.  Less than half full...am still hungry.  Tastes fine, a little boring."}
{"text":"Over priced. Trying to be like Qdoba or Chipotle with inferior product. The tortilla was super thin and broke almost immediately. The shredded chicken was okay. The lady making my burrito gave me the smallest portion if chicken. I got more black beans than I did chicken. She also just globbed the sour cream and shredded cheese in one spot. I asked for cheese and she gave me parmesan cheese. Took two bites and found out the hard way. When I went back up to get a new burrito she gave me attitude and threw a new one together hastily and threw it down on the counter when she was finished. I was trying to be as polite as possible but she didn't care. I will NEVER come back here again."}
{"text":"This is probably the worst Mexican I've ever had. Not that I expect much from an airport \"resraurant\", bit this was bad... cabbage in a burrito vs lettuce? The guacamole tasted bad or at least the avocado tasted like it was too ripe. Too much onion as well (sorry to the person who'll sit next to me...) in the guacamole. The cheese is super salty nearly tasted like Parmesan... kind of felt sick afterwards  don't go!"}
{"text":"I had the pork barrel it was fantastic. They really charge you for the water though watch out. You don't have much Choice cause you're at the airport so I just have to pay it. The burro was excellent and the Barrio beer is really good where can I get more of that!"}
{"text":"Terrible customer service. Restaurant is supposed to close in 45 more minutes and as pictures show - they are cleaning and mopping practically on top of me - I can SMELL the water they are mopping with. If you can avoid it - don't eat here"}
