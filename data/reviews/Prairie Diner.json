{"text":"Best breakfast in town. One of those great old-school diners that knows how to make a good meal and make you feel at home. The prices are also some of the best I've ever seen for the awesome quality. I recommend the Greek omelette."}
{"text":"Good old fashioned diner food with a generous all you can eat prime rib and butterfly shrimp on Saturdays."}
{"text":"Such a hidden treasure! 

This little dinner is so small, maybe 10 tables. But the staff are the definition of small town charm. The breakfast is exactly like mom would make! Simple, yummy and fast! Its a great place to experience Sun Prairie!"}
{"text":"I haven't had biscuits and gravy like this since I was a kid! the biscuits were light and fluffy and the gravy had a very nice texture and flavor. The hash browns were crispy and not greasy and as the previous review mentioned - the coffee didn't need cream or sugar to make it taste better. My meal was hot and the waitress was quite friendly and very attentive without hovering. It will definitely be my new favorite breakfast restaurant. Yummy!"}
{"text":"I've been here many times. This place is the quintessential home town diner.
Everything is always great every time, period.
It was always fine but the since the new owner took over, clearly better.
The old owner was, well,  basically, a jerk. I don't know what his deal was, but it wasn't a good deal.
The new owner has a great, friendly personality and the food seems better somehow.
Everyone should experience a classic American diner-and this is IT.
My favorite is the half order of sausage & biscuits. The full order is MASSIvE!
Ladies take notice of Ken-he seems shy but..."}
{"text":"To be fair it's closer to four instead of five stars. Great prices and the portion sizes reflect the price. Good diner food and atmosphere. Which is not for everyone. You need to come in with the mindset that you are eating at a legit diner.
I have only eaten breakfast here and it hit the spot after a long early morning of working outdoors.
I had the corned beef hash with eggs and toast and a black coffee. Very tasty."}
{"text":"This place is a local gem!  It's small and it gets busy, so sometimes there's a wait, but it's well worth it!  The staff is always friendly and they are always moving! My favorite thing to order here is the corn beef hash omelet.  I'm not sure if it's still on the menu, but I know they will make it for you!"}
{"text":"Prairie Diner, it's just so old school and that's OK! There not pretending to be anything, it's like walking into the 1970,s just good home cooking at a fair price."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast place since i was a kid! Will always be near and dear to my heart. Ham and Cheese Omelette, Eggs Benedict and Chipped Beef on a biscuit are my faves! Great service as well! Dont ever expand or change even a little bit!"}
{"text":"I'm not sure what all the rave reviews for this place are about. Some of the food was decent like the bacon deluxe omelette; but the service was slow and the waffle was served cold.  Also, when I originally ordered the quiche Lorraine I was told it would be another 10 minutes before it would be done, but there was a piece of the veggie quiche available, so I ordered the veggie quiche and  we still waited almost 30 minutes to get our food!!!! You should never have to wait that long at a diner!! If you like fake, half melted cheese, cold waffles, slow service and supporting a small local business go here. If you want good food, more of a variety, faster service and less expensive for what you get, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"No frill small town diner and I love this place!!!  Great food and prices!  I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"You've stepped through a time portal to a simpler time... and spoiler, the food is pretty great. 

Yesterday was my first experience at the Prairie Diner and I wasn't disappointed.  Hidden out of the way and not much to look out from the outside, they really delivered.  The service was wonderful and food fresh.  I ordered a special with 2 eggs, 2 pieces of toast, and hash browns (peppers and onions were free).  My son ordered a waffle with strawberries.  I was pleased to find fresh macerated strawberries.   The feel of the place is much like the diners of yesteryear.  One of the those town standards.    If you have the time to spend (the food is fresh and not overly fast) and want to go back in time and experience one of the good old fashioned town spots,  I recommended the Prairie Diner. 

Note: The reason I have 4/5 on here is simple.  Coffee. It was drinkable, but not my favorite."}
{"text":"Best breakfast place in Sun Prairie!  Outstanding service, friendly, down to earth.  Eggs Benedict is the best in Madison area(only on sat/sun). Hash browns are made the way they should be, crispy all around and you can top with cheese and onions.  The decor is 1950s and is worn with love.  Everything is great!"}
{"text":"How pleasantly surprised I was to find this old school greasy spoon ( and I say that as a compliment). This is the kind of place I remember fondly from my youth in NJ.  No pretension, no gimmicks, just honest food done well.  I had one of the specials - an omelet with cilantro, chorizo, green and red peppers and onions.  It was perfect.  Perhaps my favorite part about my breakfast was the hash brown potatoes. At many places like this, they are soggy and undercooked.  Not only were they spiced well, but they were crispy as well.  That's no joke with breakfast potatoes!    In any case, I've been back twice in a week and a half, and plan on returning often.  Don't let the exterior or decor fool you; they make good food in that tiny building."}
{"text":"I would move closer to this place if it was an option. I have enjoyed, more than I can say, everything I've eaten here. 

I had friends in town so ended up going there two mornings in a row. Saturday I had the Veggie Benedict (instead of the meat layer, it's a mix of tomatoes, mushrooms, onions, and peppers). I love a good Eggs Benedict and always try the different versions, but this is the best ever. 

Sunday I went back to my old friend, the greek omelette, and it was as good as ever. We sat in a booth on Saturday and then at the counter on Sunday. The coffee was hot and constantly being topped-up."}
{"text":"This is just a tiny restaurant with a real family feel. We came for a late breakfast on a Sunday. The waitstaff were quick to help us. We chose seats at the counter. There were many specials, breakfast, lunch, soups, biscuits and gravy, lots of diner food. We sat among the regulars and were treated like one of the family. The husband had eggs, hashbrowns and toast-all cooked to perfection. I had a pancake that was huge and so delicious-just like dessert for breakfast. The prices are reasonable, the food plentiful and the atmosphere is very friendly. Nothing fancy, just good food.We will be going back."}
{"text":"I tell everyone they have the best breakfast in Sun Prairie. Stopped in today after a long hiatus, and it was as good as ever. The best part is that the wait staff is so friendly, and they always remember us. My son and I both had an omelette and hash browns, and the food was perfect. Their hash browns are still the best one ever had."}
{"text":"If you are looking for simple no frills cooking then I highly suggest the Prairie Diner. The staff is friendly and knowledgeable and greets people by their first name. The food is classic American diner fare which is perfect on a Sunday morning after church or on a Friday night after work. 

The dining area is small and the decor is sparse, but the quality of the food and the speed of the service staff make up for the decor in spades. If you are looking for home cooking in a restaurant setting I would highly suggest the Prairie Diner."}
{"text":"I love local hometown eateries. So when we were looking for a place for lunch while on the road, the Prairie Diner called out to us. Inside looks like a 50s diner with stainless steel lunch counter and cozy booths. Judging by the area around it, it can't be that old but at least it looks authentic. The service was prompt and friendly, the young cook greeted us when we walked in the front door which appears to be the back door as you enter near the back of the kitchen and restrooms. He also thanked us on our way out. I don't think I've ever seen that before, I figured he must be the owner.

The wife ordered the ultimate omelette, I had the perch lunch. They even had a perch breakfast on the menu which comes with eggs - only in Wisconsin! The atmosphere and service made you feel right at home. The food was fairly average. We're not complaining, other things are as important as the food in a restaurant. A much more memorable experience than a stop at McDonald's next door."}
{"text":"Prairie Diner will always be worth 5 stars in my book. It is the perfect classic greasy spoon brimming with local flavor, from the UW logos on the cabinets to the waitstaff's Packers tees. Food and service is consistently good and you will never find your coffee cup empty here. On top of everything, the diner is incredibly affordable. Great memories here since my childhood; I hope they remain in business for decades to come."}
{"text":"Poor quality food, very typical American fare. Our server screwed up both our orders, wouldn't recommend to anyone. Warm old school feel is ruined by lack of food quality."}
{"text":"Classic Diner food.  If you like Diners, Drive Ins  and Dives on TV you would love the Prairie Diner.  It's been here forever and the food is very classic diner food.  I love the old school feel of the place.  It's like stepping back in time.  I had a ham and cheese and cheesy broccoli soup and died and went to heaven."}
{"text":"Heard a few warnings about dining here but I'm a prefer-to-try-for-myself kind of gal. Wished I had listened and saved myself the trip. Both myself and my companion were met with lackluster service and I wish I could say the food was at least that. Within hours after having our first meal of the day here; we both became ill."}
{"text":"So, I love hole in the wall diners, but this was just a little too dirty.  First, I will note, the service was great. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable.

Now, the food. Ew. Sorry, but it was. I ordered the gyro. Ok, it is a diner but something you find good gyros at the most random places.  The meat was prepackaged, presliced meat that was warmed on the grill. The pita bread was NOT pita, but large tortilla. It was so small and barely palatable. The salt in the meat overtook the entire meal.

Needless to say, I will not be back again."}
{"text":"I was here for a late brunch about a month ago.  My friends and I were able to get a table.  We had two kids in our party, but all the high chairs were being used.  Alright, we can wait on those.  We eventually got them after a while.

The menu was wide ranging, and affordable.  I ended up getting a corned beef omelet.  Most of my party had brunch type items.  The service was painfully slow.  The food came out, and I realized there was a reason it was so affordable...there wasn't much of it.  Small portions if you ask me.

My meal tasted alright.  Nothing to write home about.  It took another long time to get our bills paid.  And it seemed disorganized.  

The next day, I logged into my bank account, and saw that I had been double charged.  I get that these things happen, but just left a bad taste in my mouth."}
{"text":"I enjoy a great little corner diner! It seemed like a place \"that everybody knows your name, \" which I really enjoyed. 
I was greeted immediately and my waitress could not have been any friendlier! 
The place was some what full for a mid week late morning, but my coffee cup remained full. 
Go for the breakfast. The omelets are heaping full. I ordered the \"everything\" omelet and it was packed. Exactly what I am looking for when I order something like this.  
This was my first visit, but in all honesty, I see myself coming back many times. This place was a great breakfast/lunch find!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast on the Eastside. Very limited seating  but worth the wait. I've used the catering thru work several times. Very good bang for the buck."}
{"text":"Been coming here for 20 years-great food, great staff. When places like this disappear it will be the end of the world as we know it. Then we will be stuck with Denny's and Perkins.
Much better since the new owner took over.
It is quite clean also, it's just not antiseptic."}
{"text":"Best breakfast I have ever had.  Not the easiest place to find and barely any seats but the food was well worth it.  Had two eggs and ham and would highly recommend it."}
{"text":"A true diner. A little worn, reasonably clean, great Diner food and specials. Counter, booths and a couple tables. Excellent service when not busy."}
{"text":"Good old standby for a quick and affordable breakfast, Sun Prairies version of George Webb"}
{"text":"My husband and I stopped in here on a freezing Sunday morning.  It's a small place,  but doesn't seem too crowded.  We had eggs benedict, and it was VERY good. Prices  they charged were more than reasonable for the quality of food,   and the waitstaff was super nice. As people who drink coffee black,  it's very hard to find small places like this that you need no cream or sugar to make the coffee palatable,  and luckily this was one such place. So really,  nice atmosphere, good food, nice waitstaff,  don't even bother going anywhere else for breakfast."}
{"text":"New to Wisconsin. Had breakfast here with a few people from my school. Chicken fried steak with eggs and bacon. Perfect food after a night out from the previous night. Took a little longer than expected. 
(Was a cook before)"}
{"text":"I was directed to this very small, but well known Sun Prairie staple by a Local Yelp about eggs Benedict.  The location is right off the highway, parking is easy, and seating is tiny booths or counter.  This is not the place to take a group on the weekends.  I was hoping to relax and read the paper, but there was a wait for a booth, and due to their popularity, breakfast was a little rushed.  

When they found out I was new, they asked straight out if I wanted the eggs Benedict.  I also ordered coffee and the homemade biscuits and gravy.  After sitting between strangers at the counter for 5 minutes, I was able to snag a tiny table with folding chairs, and started reading the provided paper.  The coffee is ok, the service is great, the eggs Benedikt is worth the hassle, and the gravy was not.  

I will be back to try other things on the menu."}
{"text":"Old school greasy spoon where regulars know each other and everyone catches up. Biscuits and gravy came with a HUGE amount of gravy. Hashbrowns can be dressed up with your choice of onions, peppers, or cheese. Food is good and cheap."}
{"text":"Eaten here many times. The coffee is good (better than most places), and the food tastes great. The service....this is the \"Cheers\" of diners: where everybody knows your name. 

I've had omelettes, hash browns (fresh potatoes, of course), eggs Benedict, pancakes, and waffles. Nothing disappoints."}
{"text":"A cute a small diner that is hidden and often looked over as a breakfast place in Sun Prairie. The exterior looks no different from a small house, if it weren't for a sign, you would've never guessed it was a restaurant. The inside is like a 1970's time warp. The biggest seating area is a booth for four- so this is not the place to bring a big group! There is also bar-like seating on the counter. Because of the size, there will most likely be a wait during peak hours. The menu is just the right size and includes all your regular breakfast entrees. Food has always been good and price is reasonable. It's an awesome little place to check out!"}
{"text":"If you have not been here go. Best breakfast in Dane county. I work out of state and every time I get to town this is my first stop. If I get in town at 2 am I am up at 7 for breakfast. Bring and tell your friends you wont regret it."}
{"text":"This is a Sun Prairie tradition.
Local folks running a local diner.

The food is good with very down to earth service."}
