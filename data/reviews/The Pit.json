{"text":"aptly named? Guys, I really hate to be  mean but I can pretty much tell you I wont be back. There are a few things that you dont mess with, and mac&cheese is one of them. Met a friend for a quick beer and a bite. Not much on tap, but ok. Place was dead, and yet it was taking a long time for everything. I can understand when you are busy, but when there are only 4 other people here?  Anyway, food. My friend had the nachos and they were rather pedestrian. And kind of icky looking... i mean they aren't real pretty to begin with, but i was not so inclined to put it in my mouth.  The mac & cheese fiasco? I wanted a salad and a little mac. $5 a side is not bad, but I asked the server if it was going to be kraft or it was baked. She said it was baked and good..... i am pretty sure she never tried it. After a few mushy stringy bites of pale orange soggy mac, i decided not only was it not good, but something was very very wrong..... i asked the server over, because I was starting to get the idea that there might be EGG???? in the mac & cheese???  She looked at me strangely and said \" I dont think so but i will ask the chef\".  She came back and said yes, there is egg in the mac and cheese -which accounted for the nasty stringy texture. WHY DO THAT TO MAC & CHEESE????? My experience was awesome. I'm allergic. Not as bad as some allergies but the face puffs and the hives come out.  Not to mention the nightmares I will have about mac & cheese.  My night improved as soon as I took a few bennies (benedryl), another beer, and went nite nite......"}
{"text":"The first time we went the food was surprisingly good.  I had the beef brisket and he had the ribs.  The green tomatoes were excellent.  I was glad that someone in that kitchen knew how to prepare Macaroni & Cheese the old fashion way like it should be made with eggs and cream.  It is not considered Mac & Cheese unless it has eggs in it.  I don't know why other restaurants serve Mac & Cheese like a box of Kraft.  Mac & Cheese made and served that way is for people who do not know how to cook."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews here, I was skeptical but none the less had a $25 gift card for this place.  We went on a Wednesday at 8:00 - and apparently WHEN you go to this place makes a huge difference.    The place wasnt too crowded, but there was still a nice black musician doing cover songs which actually sounded really nice and added to the ambiance.  Maybe the waiters had read the reviews here because ours was very fast, courteous, and filled my glass 5 times.    They give you free cornbread appetizers, which seemed like they would be good earlier in the day - you could tell these were left out from earlier and the sweeter sauce they were drizzled with was unique, but they weren't as fresh as I would have liked.   Being a smoke house, I had to get the Pulled Pork / Baby Back Ribs combo with Chipotle sauce.  The sauce was good but not hot.  The ribs IMO were just as good as any other rib place- nothing to write home about, note QUITE fall off the bone but meaty enough and flavorful not to complain.  The pulled pork was great, but could have used more sauce.   The baked potato was big but nothing special, and the cole slaw was also run of the mill... at $5 for a side  im glad they were included with my kind of expensive meal.  My GF got the collard greens and baked beans - both of which were surprisingly good.   Her cajun catfish was a B+ as well.    The prices seemed high - and I recall getting my bill back and wondering if we were over charged because of the coupon.  It turns out, Wednesdays they just knock 20% off your bill (this is not mentioned ANYWHERE) - so our meal after the $25 coupon only came to $7 bucks!  (plus $7 tip).  That pushed the pretty good cuisine to 'good experience' .    The decor is nice but nothing special, and the location is tucked away in Beachwood by some hotels.  If they lowered their prices to a more reasonable 20% less I think they would get more business.  All in all, not bad (3.5 stars)."}
