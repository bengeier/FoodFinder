{"text":"Great pizza, awesome service. 
They make their own spicy garlic dip and wings!
Their toppings are plentiful and flavourful. 
Pioneers is well worth the extra few dollars for quality food."}
{"text":"Extremely impressed with this pizza joint . Tonight was my first time ordering from Pioneer Pizza. For around $32.00(tax and delivery included) I got a medium pizza with 3 toppings, breadsticks, chicken wings and 4 cans of pop-Great deal. The pizza was a thin crust, absolutely delicious and still hot when delivered on time in 40 minutes as promised. I ordered the combo recommended by whoever answered the phone because I figured the price was pretty good, considering all that was included, and to my surprise the wings were big, fresh and HOT(temperature wise). I can't tell you how many times I've ordered from pizza joints and everything is Luke warm...but not this place. The breadsticks were also VERY delicious, warm, buttery and lightly dusted with Parmesan cheese. I'll be ordering those bad boys again when I get my next pizza ."}
{"text":"I always do walk in, love the atmosphere. The owner and his family make me feel welcomed. I really do enjoy the quality of the pizza every time I go and the toppings are fresh and do come in heaps on the pizza. Great community pizza joint, and i will be a returning customer."}
{"text":"I ordered a specialty pizza for delivery. The guy on the phone who took the order was adamant this would be the best pizza I ever tasted. I agree it was very tasty. The problem lies in the fact that the pizza was over $30 with delivery which was a $5 charge plus tip. And the pizza was TINY. I recall it being about 50% smaller then something from Dominos. 

It tasted amazing that's for sure. I wouldn't order again just based on not feeling the value was there."}
{"text":"Just ordered from here. Had the all meat pizza with the spicy garlic dip and suicide wings. 
The pizza was very good and dipping sauce offered some heat. The pizza was not greasy and had a nice thin crust. Only criticism I had was I wished the crust was crisper. 
As for the wings they are large and the suicide flavour was quite spicy which was great. The wings did not offer that vinegar over salted flavour like other chains do on the hotter style wings which was a pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"We just moved to the area and decided to try the pizza after I read the really good reviews online. They didn't lie! The pizza was great! We ordered the combo with wings, bread sticks & pop. The wings were really good! The prices are on the higher end, but the food is good so it's worth it. I can't wait to try more of the gourmet pizzas and the spicy garlic dipping sauce lived up to expectations! Even my boyfriend, who doesn't like garlic, dipped quite a bit in it!  We will for sure be going back!"}
{"text":"It wasn't terrible but it wasn't great. The prices on the menu [pictured on yelp] are mucho-out-of-date - prices have been raised. We got a large Pioneers and a large First Choice. There was a decent amount of toppings...perhaps not enough cheese for our liking. We just moved here from Montreal last fall and have been searching for a great pizza spot in Scarborough - this was better than the chainstores but we'll keep searching."}
{"text":"This place has great panzerotti (they call it panzerotti, but they were more like calzones). The ingredients were plentiful and it was not greasy. The owners are lovely people; so kind and courteous. Such a wonderful place. I hope they stick around. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Very friendly family owned restaurant. Ordered their 2 large 3 topping pizza for $33.62 and it came out of the oven around 15 minutes after ordering and tasted delicious! Toppings were fresh and the dough had a nice crust to it. Would definitely come again."}
{"text":"Rated 5 stars on Google so I decided to go and give it a shot. I prefer trying out new places and non chains.


THE VENUE: It's not a restaurant and they only have a couple of tables if you want to eat in. Upon entering, I saw makeshift menu signs that made the place seem tacky and I didn't even bother to look at it. Thankfully they had a proper menu to look at sitting in pile on the side of the counter. 
There was lots to choose from on the menu but we ordered their personal square pizza with 3 toppings and bread sticks. Everything is made to order so don't expect to walk in and choose a slice from their display case. I knew this so I expected to wait 15-20 mins for our food in which it did take 25 minutes for our 3 custom made to order pizzas and breadsticks. I heard about the garlic dip so I decided to give it a try as well. 
THE FOOD: delicious. Prices are comparable to gourmet pizza chains but I didn't mind paying the price for what I got. There wasn't too much empty crust around the edge, the crust wasn't thick but wasn't super thin either. The breadsticks were not oily. I honestly don't think I have anything negative to say about our order. I would be interested in trying their wings next time though.
SERVICE: The employee who took our order was nice to us and even brought our order to us when it was ready and threw in a couple extra garlic dips for us. Halfway through our meal, he politely interrupted to see how we were doing and what we thought of the food. He thanked us multiple times and collected our trays and garbage when we were finished. 

I'm very happy I decided to give this joint a try. I'd go back for more, but would call ahead to order to avoid waiting."}
{"text":"Got a combo special for $17 with half pound of wings, a small pizza (3 toppings) and a pop. Used the skip the dishes delivery. 

Food came quick and was hot. Decent pizza. Awesome saucy wings. 

No complaints from me. I'll be back here for sure."}
{"text":"Pioneer Pizza showed up recently on our Just Eat listings, and I had an offer code, so we figured it was worth trying.
We ordered the Pioneer Special Pizza, (Green peppers, green olives, onion, mushroom, pepperoni and bacon) with a pound of mild wings, Chicken Parmigiana Sandwich, and Breadsticks.

I was very impressed with the wings, very likely, the best and biggest wings we have ever had delivered, they were very well cooked and very tasty.
The pizza was very good as well, lots of toppings, and well cooked.
I was too full to try the chicken parm, I'll have it tomorrow, but it was huge.

The only kind of weak point was the bread sticks, when everything else was that good, they were a bit bland.
However the garlic dip that came with the pizza was very nice on the sticks.

Delivery was very friendly, will for sure order from them again."}
{"text":"Ok. Four stars people?!?

My experience with PP was excellent. The pizza and spicy garlic dipping were excellent. The toppings were plenty and very fresh. I also felt that my conversation with the owners brother was personal and genuine. Without a doubt a pizza you should experience. If your looking for cheap garbage, go elsewhere my friend."}
{"text":"Solid food here. They're generous with their pizza toppings and everything tastes great. We tried several different pies and felt this place was a keeper. I wouldn't call it the best ever, but it was good enough that I ate too much."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place and order regularly however the customer service is terrible, Ordered a Pizza around 8pm ended up getting it at 10:30pm,   Called the shop at 9pm and was told oh we made a mistake on your order and are remaking it will be there within 20 mins.  But will send the pizza we made by mistake to you as well which was not a bad gesture however why did i have to call when you were already late.


Driver shows up and pulls the no change scam although i had pre-tipped him 3 bucks on JustEat.Ca he wanted more, Supposed to get $10 bucks in change and he pulls out a $5 and says out i have no more change on me, seeing my pizza was over 2.5 hours late not in the generous mood and did not want to give an $8 tip. Driver finally goes and gets more change, but what type of driver comes with no change when told the delivery would be cash. 

Pizza's overall are ok but the sauce has weird after taste also pretty expensive compared to other shops,"}
{"text":"So - you're after a gem of a pizza shop in a non description Plaza. Well you're in luck because Pioneers fit that description. 

Was causing in Scarborough looking from some good grub and stumbled on this place on Yelp. 

Review were good. Pictures were tempting and the fact that it was a hole in the wall made it all that better. 

I don't eat at chains or big name restaurants. I look for low key ma and pa shops that deliver excellence and this is what you'll find here. 

There is in house seating (for about 6-8 people). There are pictures of Tupac, Marlon Brando, sports cars and other vintage pieces that line the walls. 

This place is your epitome of no frills. However...there's a twist. 

For starters- the young youths that are employed here have absolutely excellent customer service. I'm 38 but feel 20. I can't tell you the number of times these guys made me feel old by calling me sir and asking if I had everything I needed. Top notch customer service- which in all honesty was unexpected. 

Onto the food. Honestly because it was my first time here, I had no expectations. Ordered the large daily special with 2 toppings - $17 and change. 

Crust: the crust reminded me on a wood burning over. The dough was of excellent quality and was thin. Nice but small burn marks added to the flavours. 

Tomato sauce was perfect as well. Not too acidic. 

We ordered mushrooms and olives and both were delicious. 

All in all a great experience. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Great Ma and Pa shop.  I recommend the ground beef as a pizza topping.)- Don't forget the spicy creamy garlic dipping sauce!  Their burgers are great as well."}
{"text":"Just moved to Scarborough and after trying three other pizza delivery joints that wouldn't deliver to my location or weren't delivering all together.  I decided to try this place!

 As mentioned in the previous review by another Yelper, the bread sticks are underwhelming.  Soggy, chewy and salty. I'm not sure why the person on the phone mentioned to me that they wanted me to try the bread sticks, they aren't their best item by far. (Wings are, keep reading)

I also had a medium pizza with jalapeño, pineapple and pepperoni.  The crust was minimal, sauce was balanced and the pizza as a whole I'd consider to be slightly above average! Better than a chain but definitely not the best I've had in Toronto.

I chose to also indulge in some wings, I have to agree with the past review.  They were huge! Wing tips uncut and drumsticks from what appeared to be full size chickens.

Flavor wise, the wings I chose were hot, they tasted good! More of a dry rub hot flavoring appeared to be baked and maybe grilled? Definitely juicy, tender texture to the chicken.  

Must try the wings. Best delivery wings I've ever had!

Will order again!"}
{"text":"Really good local pizza with fresh ingredients and customer friendly.  5 stars for Scarborough."}
{"text":"Absolutely love the panzerotti!  Definitely get the spicy garlic dipping sauce, so good."}
{"text":"Really great pizza . A lot of cheese and toppings . Defiantly better than the chains . Jumbo wings is tender and has good heat( I ordered suicide ). My favourite pizza to order is the first choice. Good value with 3 toppings ."}
{"text":"This is probably my favorite pizza place. Great quality of ingredients used to make the pizza. Well worth it! Go check it out! Price is real good as well!"}
