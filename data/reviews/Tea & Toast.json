{"text":"I've only been here a handful of times, but that's only because I live a good distance away. The Black Rose Latte is one of my favorite tea lattes that I've ever had! It has the perfect balance (in my opinion) of floral rose flavor, black tea, and sweetness level. Just make sure you're a fan of rose flavor in general though; I'm sure this latte wouldn't be for everyone.  I've been with friends and they've gotten the London Fog and the Swiss Ivory. Both were outstanding. Their good ol' coffee is also very good! I really want to return and try some of their food options because I'm sure they'd be delicious. I highly recommend this place to any tea lover!"}
{"text":"Excellent breakfast!! Generous portions, quality ingredients and reasonable prices. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"So cute!!! Amazing avocado toast - I seriously don't know how they do it. Also my friends and I agreed that these were the best scones we've ever had. There was lots of seating in this warehouse style food court. Also upstairs seating. Very nice space :)"}
{"text":"For a place called \"Tea & Toast\", they don't actually have any good teas or toasts. Whenever I order a green tea, I either get a burnt iced tea or a from-concentrate hot tea that's just not good. They have one kind of bread with different stuff on top, nothing special. Great space and fabulous bacon, but everything else leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"I could not be happier about this place!  The cold-brew coffee is solid- full flavored and smooth. I didn't try to tea this time, but look forward to trying it on a future visit. To eat, I had one of the toasts with a sunny side up egg and heirloom tomato- it's not actually a menu item, but it should be! The bread they use is off the charts delicious and the quality of the ingredient made a very simple dish something special. And it was only $4! My husband had the lox bagel and loved it.  The staff were friendly, helpful and accommodating, and the ambiance of the whole De Soto Market is great. The food took a little time to come out but not unreasonable, the staff were very apologetic and it was worth the wait! I live in the area and am so glad to have this addition to the neighborhood. I will be a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"Came in for a simple cup of coffee, \"barista\" spills a large cup of hot latte on me ruining my shoes and drenching my shirt and jeans... Was given a simple apology and asked if I still wanted my fucking cookie and shitty coffee. This is \"local\" my ass, would have gotten better service and care at a Starbucks I'm sure... This place lives on the markets atmosphere but is sub par in overall quality. Do yourself a favor, pick up some coffee on the way here instead, come in and enjoy the atmosphere."}
{"text":"How long does it take to make a piece of toast with avocado smeared on it and banana chunks? Maybe at home, when I'm multitasking and making coffee I'd say 5 minutes maximum. If you want a piece of toast like this at Tea & Toast, sit back, take a snooze, cause it won't be ready for at least 20 minutes.   The almond milk latte also tasted like the milk was expired.   I would recommend going home to make your own toast before wasting your time here."}
{"text":"Had the avocado toast, a decaf coffee and custom blend tea latte with vanilla. I'm not from Phoenix, but the bread they use for the toast comes from a local bakery and it's amazing.  I tried the tea latte for something different it was delish, but if you are a coffee drinker definitely get the coffee! The decaf was amazing, probably one of the best I ever had!"}
{"text":"Get the Avocado, Banana, Chocolate, and Hazelnut Toast... you won't regret it. Cute place inside of DeSoto Central Market. The pastries looked so yummy... I look forward to going back and trying some of them."}
{"text":"Tea is by far my favorite caffeinated beverage and I was so looking forward to tea & toast opening up! I love the location inside DeSoto Market. They have tea lattes, tea machiatto, and much more. They do their own spin on their tea drinks that are similar to what one orders with coffee. I have loved all my tea drinks from here!   Cons are prices are kind of expensive, since I usually substitute my milk to almond. Also, the food is hit or a miss. They recently removed some of their toast items with other options, but the replacement items weren't that great. The French toast was recommended, but it was pretty soggy and it just wasn't flavorful.   I'll stick to my tea latte, but probably won't bother with the food items. Staff has been friendly every time I come."}
{"text":"Great cafe with a surprisingly good kitchen! Tea lattes are perfectly steeped and steamed. Country ham, Gruyere, and b√©chamel was fantastic! My other half had the egg cheese croissant and loved it! Their dark chocolate whoopie pie was perfect for 10:30 am (lmao! No shame). Love this place for a quick brunch!"}
{"text":"IMPORTANT NOTE  As some of you may have noticed, I've unplugged from reviewing on Yelp completely. This has been due primarily to a lack of personal time. That said, I am making an intentional (though severely temporary) move out of hibernation to update my review on Tea & Toast Co.  It has been almost a year since my original review, and a lot has changed (for the better). You deserve to know about it, and the business deserves the accolades it has worked so hard to earn in the time since my first review of its service.  So without further ado...  AMBIANCE  It's 10am on a Saturday morning in the dead center of a sweltering Arizona summer. Beside you, by your feet, reclines a backpack filled with notepads, pens, and your computer. Opened before you, in your hand: a book that sets against a buzzing Downtown Phoenix scene.  Behind you all the sounds of morning business accumulate in fluctuating waves: someone pours a bucket of ice into an oversized water container; an espresso machine rattles and hisses and screams as a barista steams her milk; silverware and glasses clank in almost-musical accord.  Upstairs, dozens have gathered with their mats and comfy clothes to practice yoga on the mezzanine. Natural wood trusses span the open space above their heads. Their synchronized expressions are flanked by walls bestrewn with regular rotations of this city's local art.  THE HISTORY  Underneath the mezzanine, Allison DeVane moves with the clarity of intention at a hundred miles an hour: organizing the Tea & Toast workspace, checking in on supplies, greeting customers, and training her baristas.  It wasn't long ago that this successful business existed as little more than an idea in her head. In actual fact, it began as a bicycle-cart contraption and loads of time and work and complimentary handouts.  Nowadays, Tea & Toast Co. represents the first brick-and-mortar face of Allison's ingenious TEASPRESSA enterprise, introducing methods of preparing concentrated tea blends in forms more often associated with coffee.  THE MENU  So step up to the counter and order yourself a tea latte, tea mocha, tea americano, etc. Or take your pick off the specialty beverage menu (every one of which is utterly delicious). OR order a typical coffee beverage - that's always available, too.  Jumping back to the patented TEASPRESSA tea preparations, you cannot BELIEVE how titillating these are until you've experienced them yourself. Truly - these tea beverages match the coffee consistencies you've become familiar with while still maintain the health benefits of tea and introducing flavor profiles you simply will NOT be able to get enough of!  And FOOD! There's food on the menu, too, including (much to my pleasant surprise) Noble Bread (a well-known local option) as a primary feature. On this last visit, I enjoyed a breakfast of fresh, thick-cut Noble toast slathered in smashed avocado and topped with hardboiled egg, a dash of pepper, and shavings of sea salt.  (Had my stomach allowed me, I'd have eaten 5.)  IN CONCLUSION  My initial prognosis of this business had it worthy of 4 stars: it was interesting-though-not-inspiring and somewhat overpriced. In the time since, Allison has done a LOT of work to legitimize her brand and add value to her offerings.  The prices are more achievable (beyond fair, in fact) and the DeSoto space in total has grown up, too - adding any number of inspiring elements to the mix, ranging from features of architecture & design to local art and even regular (free!) events.  Most inspiring of all, of course, is the story of this young woman bent on building something absolutely NEW and UNEXPLORED: bootstrapping a literally-never-before-thought-of concept into a functioning, successful business all her own.  NOW YOU GO!  So if you haven't been, I want you to fully disregard my too-hasty summary of initial impressions. Tea & Toast Co. is dynamic and it is utterly unique. It's different than I thought at first and it's improving every day. I can't recommend it highly enough. Go say hi to Allison and tell her it was Tim's review that sent ya.  ;)"}
{"text":"So just two days ago I was talking about my floral latte obsession and decided to do some research on where I could go grab some- I found Tea & Toast at the top of the list. I took the Valley Metro Light Rail here, it was super easy and a VERY short walk after the stop which was refreshing. This little tea shop is actually located in the Desoto Central Market (first time there), which is a really cool place to hang out! The menu suggests ordering their signature lattes, which includes the Black Rose (FLORAL!!!!!), London Fog, Swiss Ivory, and Caramel Cape. The Black Rose was very tempting but I was craving a Lavender Latte more than ever before, so I had the barista whip it up for me on ice, extra sweet.   Delicious. Some extra flavor options include coconut, toffee nut, honey, pure cane, rose and lavender. Soy, non fat, whole, coconut and almond milk options available for your moo or no moo needs. Some other things on the menu include hot teas, iced teas, cold brew coffee and a small menu labeled \"Toast\" which is basically snacks (with healthy options!). There are also two small refrigerated sections that contain bottled water, coconut water, other drinks, yogurt, hummus and more.   I will definitely be coming back for the Black Rose Latte. Don't believe me, just watch.   *Update: I came back two days in a row and the latte just tasted like milk.. I don't know what happened. The first day I came back, I tried the Swiss Ivory latte and the second day (today) I tried the Black Rose latte and even brought a friend with me. When I tried the Swiss Ivory I thought the latte would be green (because the person in front of me had a green drink and I assumed it was the SI), but maybe it was not supposed to be green. It was almost as if there was barely any caffeine in either of them :( At least the other coffee we ordered was good! But I don't think I'll be back for a while.   -Good study/work spot, I came around 10AM today before lunch hour and it was nice and quiet, majority of the audience had their laptop in tow. -Easily accessible to the Light Rail (Bus or Train) -Free Wifi"}
{"text":"I'm a huge fan of DeSoto Market (formally home to a motorcars dealership built in 1928) and Tea & Toast Co. is one the businesses that operates out of here. I came here on a quiet weekday morning for breakfast. I just got regular drip coffee so I'll have to comment on their drinks at a later time. They have a wide variety of teas and coffee drinks on their menu. Their food menu consists of breakfast sandwich creations using artisan bread from Noble bread and other breakfast items made from the neighboring DCM Burger Joint. They have quite a unique food menu which made it hard to decided what to order. I tried the Hernando (Mexican chorizo, tortilla, cheddar and egg on a brioche). I didn't know what to expect but found it really good. The sandwich is baked and served open faced with the tortilla stacked under the egg. I'm sure some people will be put off by the prices, but I enjoyed my visit. A good place to stop by for a light meal."}
{"text":"I feel a little awkward being the first to review this spot as I'm not a coffee drinker.  Never have been, never will be (probably).  Even more awkward?  I'm writing this review after coming here not for breakfast or brunch, but for dinner.  Yes, I'm weird (as my friends and family will happily confirm).  So what am I doing here?  Well, I'd seen Tea & Toast's photos of tasty looking baked goods and figured I'd stop by and check out the full menu.  After all, they're in the beautiful new DeSoto Central Market in Downtown so I figured worst case scenario I could grab dinner at one of the other concepts in the building.  On this trip however, the worst case scenario never played out.  The food at Tea & Toast was simply too damn good.  Tea & Toast has all the makings of your typical Downtown Phoenix coffee joint (which are in almost absurd abundance especially in the Roosevelt Row area).  Coffee offerings?  Check.  Espresso machine?  Check.  Baked goods in the display case?  Check.  What sets them apart however is the baked goods that are not displayed, along with their fairly wide array of tea concoctions.  I don't drink tea that often, but unlike coffee I'm perfectly willing to give different tea flavors a once over.  I saw they served something called a Charles Gray tea.  I figured that's gotta be something resembling an Earl Grey (and it was) so I got a small cup of that.    Then my eyes wandered over to their Noble Bread menu.  Aha!  Now we're talking.  Noble Bread for those who don't know is a wildly popular Phoenix based artisan bread maker.  You'll find them at their main location on 22nd Street and McDowell, at farmers markets throughout town, as well as various restaurant menus throughout the valley.  Here at Tea & Toast, they're using the bread as the base for some healthy (and not so healthy) creations with everything from fruits and veggies to eggs, to bacon, and so on.  The one that caught my eye this time was the toasted bread with blueberry jam, whipped lemon curd, and ground up pistachios.  Yup, that looks like a good dinner (go ahead, laugh).  Next for dessert (go ahead, laugh again), I saw that they have a small selection of Nutella dishes.  One of which was a croissant covered with brown butter and a side of warm Nutella spread.  Yup, that should do.    Total cost for the tea, the toasted bread dish, and the croissant came to about $11.  They make both the croissant and the bread dishes behind the main bar at DeSoto so it took about 5 minutes for the food to come out.  As soon as I laid eyes on them, I knew it was worth the wait.  I actually dived first into the croissant as I didn't want that Nutella to get cold.  Good move.  They gave me more than enough of it to spread on that buttery croissant.  And yes, as you might imagine, it was heavenly.  I made sure I didn't leave any Nutella behind on that one.  Now for the toasted bread dish.  Their bread rotates regularly but this time I got Noble's sourdough bread as the base.  Score for me.  The chunky blueberry jam and smooth lemon curd were fantastic and the pistachios gave it a little extra crunch while at the same time another level of sweetness.  Basically played like a second dessert (which in hindsight, should've been obvious to me).  The Gray tea I got to wash it down was good, though a little puzzling as it had foam.  Admittedly I'm not a tea expert so I'm sure there was an explanation for the foam, but it didn't harm the texture at all.  And it really did taste like an earl grey (at least to me).  So there you have it, the most unlikely dinner outing...well...probably ever.  I think this place would do tremendously well as a breakfast spot for the downtown breakfast and coffee crowd, but at least for now it appears they're only open for lunch and dinner (which not coincidentally is when the DeSoto Market opens and closes).  Maybe soon they'll open early so Tea & Toast can work its magic with the morning crowd.  For now, whatever time of day you come, you can be sure they'll have some tasty baked goods available.  Like I said, I can't speak for the coffee so if the coffee sucks feel free to offset my review.  But if you're coming for Tea & Toast's tea and toast, well, if its their namesake its gotta be good, right?"}
{"text":"I'm from the east coast, and back east we don't spread the love like they do here.  It was my first visit and Cali took precious time to ask me about my day, my necklace, my pregnancy - and then she made custom recommendations for my morning brew and nosh.  I ended up with the most delicious decaf red tea latte and a croissant with nuttella.  Awesome space, great for doing work or lounging and eating your yum yum breakfast!"}
{"text":"This review is about the tea drinks only.  Came to Tea and Toast on a Sunday afternoon.  We ordered a London Fog iced, Caramel Cape iced and a Libertea.  The Libertad was good but the other 2 drinks were mediocre and the tea was a bit weak.  The cashier was nice.  Probably will not return."}
{"text":"Teaspresso. Tea-espresso!? Whaaaaa. If you follow these wonderful human beings on Instagram (pocketsizedelle is mine, by the way) they make pretty tea lattes and I was instantly drawn to them (punny, I know, because they do latte art). I went on my break the other day and got a black rose latte, which was so so delicious. I also got the avocado toast, which definitely trumps my home made version. Noble bread is where it's at! I will become a regular, as they are opening at 6:30 AM very soon!"}
{"text":"Was looking forward to stopping by after hearing so many great things, unfortunately I was very highly underwhelmed... I was not impressed with the drink that was recommended, Black Rose. Decided to give it another try, maybe floral infused drink are not my *cup of tea*! Went back during my lunch and ordered a caramel macchiato. Again, not disapointed but also not impressed. Service was not extraordinary, so unfortunately there is no reason for me to come back!"}
{"text":"We stopped in today for breakfast and had another great experience!  I was craving an Italian soda and they recommended a peach vanilla - so amazingly good!  I enjoyed the ham, mustard, and cheese toast...so ridiculously good that I ate every last bite.  We will definitely be back again!"}
{"text":"I am giving this place a lower review because I think this place could be truly incredible, but there are a few things they need to fix. The toast and Noble bread is excellent and I recommend the avocado toast and the banana and peanut butter toast. They are both really delicious and unique and worth trying.   1) Pots of tea.  You are a tea place, please consider having pots of tea available.  2) Service. A little more training for your staff would go a long way. There was a really long wait and when we finally got to the front of the line the girl taking our order was more interested in telling us all about what she thought we should order rather than taking our order. We wanted an iced tea and tea soy latte. In the end I took her recommendation and even though I told her I didn't want anything sweet she gave me a London fog tea latte that was sickly sweet and had chocolate syrup all over the top of it.   3) Larger breakfast menu and post what you are out of. There was only one menu and it was on an  8.5x11 sheet of paper in tiny type. I think a cool chalk board or other display would be great and when you are out of something you can cross it off or add a note. It is a bit of a let down when you decide what you are ordering and get to the front of the line only to find out they are out of something.  I am going to continue to try this place because I love Desoto so I hope it improves."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere... Amazing teas with a perfectly simple menu. Can't wait to go back and try out some more yummy options. Yum!"}
{"text":"The toast is no joke. My first time ordering I got the avocado and egg, as well as the ham, not realizing how filling one toast would be! They were both huge and amazing, but I couldn't finish it all. Now the avocado is a staple for me, but occasionally I'll branch out and really enjoy the pork belly as well. I am absolutely addicted to the honey lavender latte! It is amazing and I think everyone should try it! Prices are fair, if I just get a toast and a latte it's only about $10 and I leave completely satiated."}
{"text":"Waited an hour to get my coffee. They got it wrong on the first attempt and then the second attempt was just thrown together. Horrible experience!!!"}
{"text":"Fab place for a light bite and cuppa.   The avo toast is very good. A thick slice of crusty bread topped with a generous amount of creamy avo, sliced hard-boiled egg, and a sprinkly of salt. I gave up on the worthless plastic utensils- can we get some real silverware??   The tea selections were limited for a place with this name- two hot options- an early gray or a decaf. Lucky for me, I'm an EG fan. My london fog w/ sugar free vanilla was perfect.  Would def return."}
{"text":"IMPORTANT NOTE  As some of you may have noticed, I'm ridiculously busy, and often don't have time to post reviews on all of the places I visit. That said, I am making an intentional move to review Tea & Toast.  So without further ado...  AMBIANCE  It was sometime in the afternoon that I parked on Roosevelt, put my card into the meter and tried to find Tea & Toast. I kept walking by it, because it is inside another business on the corner of Roosevelt and Central. Finally inside, it's got an industrial feel with shabby chic sofas and tables and chairs. It was mostly empty, with a few people at the adjoining bar. Tea & Toast is a little coffee shop and tasty treats area within the structure. Some may say it's a \"buzzing downtown scene\" - I'll let the pictures speak for themselves.  I went up to the counter and met 2 adorable people in their early 20's. Adri took care of me and suggested the London Fog tea. Tea aficionados will know more than I about the hints of lavender and shades of vanilla. All I know is it was THE BEST DAMN TEA I'VE EVER TASTED IN MY LIFE.  Is there more to the place? Sure. The place is a risky investment for that neighborhood especially considering the amount of money the owners clearly invested. The Roosevelt area has a lot of owners bringing their local business downtown. I admire the commitment of local business to that area and any attempts to make Downtown great.  Many of you may have seen my photography of street art I posted in the Yelp category of Downtown Phoenix, as well as on the historic district Roosevelt Row, which I previously reviewed (4/5). There are loads of beautiful murals and art installations in that area, and photo worthy subjects, so it's definitely worth checking out.  CONCLUSION  Let's talk about audiences: Would this be a hangout for a busy out of town professional? Uh, probably not. Would this be a hangout for a 29 year old guy living in a one bedroom apartment trying to find some place to hang out with free wifi and maybe meet friends and/or perhaps meet a girl to get lucky? Uh, definitely.  I would rate my experience as 4/5 stars as a person who is exploring and wanting to see what's new downtown.  However, I wouldn't recommend making a special trip to come here as the first choice to my professional colleagues who are in town for a few days especially if they are used to 5 star establishments, unless they specifically asked about the Downtown scene.  This place has local flavor, but probably not a go-to for the traditional business person.   NOW YOU GO! (OR NOT)  Look at the pictures and decide if this place is for you!  Honestly, 3/5 Stars. An extra 1 Star for the excellent staff.   4/5 RECOMMEND  OF NOTE  *Parking is mostly parking meter on the street."}
{"text":"Such a deliciously cute concept. I ordered a Black Manhattan iced tea and a browned butter croissant with Nutella (which was toasted to perfection). The tea was so incredible that I ordered a \"macchiato\" version to take home, again over ice and blended with vanilla syrup and honey. I'm already a lover of black tea, but Teaspressa takes it up about five notches with their brewing technique and overall brand esthetic. I'm a fan! Hoping for an Arcadia location in the future."}
{"text":"Had the smashed avocado and hard boiled egg on thick toast with their London fog (earl grey with French vanilla and lavender). Both were delicious. The avocado toast was a hearty proportion for only $4! Huge building - two floors that go pretty far back. Laid back with a hipster feel. Apparently their menu changes often. Sounds like they have a pretty creative team back there. Staff was friendly and helpful. Overall great coffee/tea house!"}
{"text":"This place is pretty stellar. We got the London Fog and the Black Rose and the milk/tea/sweetener ratio - perfect!!! I like the selection of choices you get here because they're not overwhelming, but everything sounds really exciting! You also have the option of making your own tea lattes which is really nice.  The toast was also SO good. We tried the avocado toast & the braised peppers/onions/egg toast and were really pleasantly surprised. The braised vegetable mixture was really good if you like a hearty substance on your toast. The avocado toast - omg. Every time I get avocado toast, I think to myself \"Ugh why am I getting this I could make it at home.\" Well, NOT the case. This avocado toast was just so yum!!! The toast (S/O to Noble for awesome toast) was so buttery and crunchy on the outside and soft ish in the middle. The egg was perfectly hard boiled, and the avocado was creamy and very lemony with bits of coarse sea salt. Definitely makes me rethink my avo toast thoughts. I'd definitely try this again! My only complaint is it took fairly long - 20 minutes for 2 toasts at 1pm on a Sunday? Seems a little long, but they were worth it and I didn't mind ambling around DeSoto Public Market at all."}
{"text":"After Tea and Toast's positive review in the New Times we decided to stop by for breakfast. We were quite underwhelmed. It would have been nice to see an updated menu on their website because we arrived and found no vegetarian options for toast although the previous menu indicated there were a few. We got pastries instead which were not fresh and had clearly been refrigerated for a day or more. Considering this is a tea and pastry place we were hoping for a good selection of fresh items. Tea was fine but overpriced for the cup size. Would probably not come back again."}
{"text":"Walked over for breakfast and loved it! I ordered an Americano and Toast with bacon Jam and egg. I wasn't too sure what to expect with the toast but I decided to live a little. It was savory and delicious. I look forward to trying all that they have to offer."}
{"text":"Not too bad, but probably wont go back. Didn't care for the bacon and jam/egg toast. I asked if they had chai tea lattes, she said they do not but recommended the manhattan black tea latte. She said it was basically the same thing. It is not.. Also I did not want it iced but I considered it my fault because I did not mention either even tho she didn't ask me if I wanted iced or hot. So I ordered it in hot, figured I'd give the other to a friend, but unfortunately did not like it hot either. Pity.. I really wanted to love this place :/"}
{"text":"LOVED:  - black rose tea latte - london fog (earl grey and lavender)   I got both iced and loved the flavor of roses and lavender in my latte!!!"}
{"text":"I only gave this place two stars instead of one because my beverage was very good. That is the ONLY reason. I made the drive across town--as I am a Chandler resident--because I've seen the foam artwork that they so heavily promote on all of their social media feeds. I was super excited because it was (is) my birthday [today] and I was already having a bad morning and was hoping this would cheer me up. I am a huge supporter of local sellers and small businesses, but I am very disappointed by this one. Unfortunately I would suggest that people support another business.   The cashier didn't seem to know what he was doing--if he was new then it was very clear and I would understand that completely. If he wasn't, well he may have to learn more about Tea & Toast Co.'s beverages to better help the customers who are unfamiliar with them. Furthermore, after ordering my $5 tea drink, I was upset when I received it with a plain foam top. I questioned the barista about it and was told I had to ask for the design when I ordered my drink. How was I supposed to know that after telling them that this was my first visit? And that it was too busy for them to make it. There were two people in line and my family and I had already ordered. DeSoto was pretty empty.   When my dad approached the barista in the subject she gave a long speech about how there was only one lady who was an artist and she wasn't here and it takes ten minutes to make one cup of coffee. Honestly, she could have just said she's not experienced enough to make those designs and the subject could have been dropped.  We also received a stamp card that you only receive one stamp per visit (even though the card says \"if you buy ten\"). So if you buy five drinks in one visit you're out of luck! Or you will get a barista with an attitude who scribbles across your stamp card because you went back and told them that you only got one stamp even though you purchased five drinks.  All in all, my beverage was delicious (Caramel Cape with Soy milk). My sister ordered a Caramel Latte with Soy milk however and it tastes very bitter and burnt. Basically I would not recommend this place to anyone looking for good customer service, good coffee or pretty designs at your first visit."}
{"text":"Tea & Toast? Please don't forget the coffee because it's one of the tastiest you'll find in downtown Phoenix!  Don't be fooled by the name since they serve many varieties of coffee for you Joe Lovers. From Americanos to Cappuccinos, they can create any drink without the \"oh man it's one of those orders\" kind of attitude. The coffee beans are locally roasted from Espressions which has a nice smooth finish.  I always gravitate to the hot Latte (small $3.50; large $4.50), almond milk with the rose syrup. The large comes with three shots which will keep you smiling all day long! Be sure to ask for latte art because it's only done by request. Another reason to smile!  For this tea, the manager apparently makes a blend and uses the same process of brewing a coffee. If you love tea, they can make it as a mocha, latte or a macchiato. With finesse and patience, this tea is a perfect way to relax away.  The pastries keep on hounding me but I resist because my drink is already sweet. They sell goodies from A Bakeshop and Simply from Scratch. Also intriguing is the food menu. They offer a breakfast menu (served M-F until 10AM and S-S till noon) with a good variety of dishes. The \"toast\" menu is available all day long and is served open faced style. One of these days I hope to try it!  For those who are lactose challenged, this place offers moo substitute of coconut, soy or almond for free, gratis, de nada!   If you need another drink for the road, majority of the drinks can be refilled for half price!   This cafe shares it's location inside the DeSoto Grand Market on the corner of Roosevelt and Central Avenue. With tons of inside and outdoor sitting, free parking and Wi-Fi, this place deserves a thumbs up."}
{"text":"We came here because this place sounded fun. I also just came back from San Francisco and had a love affair with another tea and toast joint called The Mill, so I was excited for something similar in Phoenix. The toast was super yummy (we all got the avocado and hard boiled egg toast) and the price of the toast is fair. That was the good.  Otherwise, we had a disappointing experience. My mom spent $4 on a regular black iced tea....that's the most I've ever seen a tea go for, whether it's Starbucks or the local coffee shop down the street.  Way too expensive, and the cup size was small for a medium....like 12 ounces?  We legitimately waited 20 minutes for our food, and the whole place did not seem that busy at all... I think the toast place shares a kitchen with the burger joint, and we kept seeing burgers coming out of the kitchen, but no toast.  The barista had no idea what was going on the in the kitchen, and she wasn't very helpful at the counter, either. This is a downtown place, and most people coming here for lunch need fast service so they can get back to work. The amount of time we waited was not cool.  Unless we can get faster service, we won't be coming back. :("}
{"text":"Inside the Desoto Central Market this hidden gem is an awesome stop before, after or heck who am I kidding during work. I love their homemade pop tarts, and the coffee is so tasty! Service is wonderful and I enjoy the all around vibe. There's inside and outdoor seating, art, and if you're hungry plenty of places inside to catch a bite. The coffee options are pretty good with it being such a small set up, but worth every second. With so many coffee spots in downtown it's hard for some to stand out. Tea and Toast holds it own and I'm in love!"}
{"text":"So I really like the atmosphere of the Desoto. Lots of places to sit, good parking and lots of choices.   That being said, I'm gonna keep going here, mainly for Tea & Toast.   I have two issues with it though. Service wasn't that great. The staff was speaking to someone and I stood there for a while they finished their conversation. I wasn't in a hurry, and honestly I don't care if they want to talk, but I was there for a good 3-4 minutes waiting. Maybe she thought I was reading the menu? Anyway, once she saw me, service was fine. Felt like I was bothering her, but the drink came quick. Secondly, the sizes and prices are a little crazy. The Small is literally a water cup you get out of a water cooler at work. I think it's the same size as the cup my dentist uses to give kids fluoride rinse. The large was only a large if I was a toddler, and not a gigantic human. Considering I'm paying more than I've paid for some shoes for the drink, I'd hope the sizes would be better-but in all fairness, maybe I'm just spoiled.   TLDR; drinks are small but very much a quality product and worth the price."}
{"text":"\"No,\" Arthur said, \"look, it's very, very simple.... All I want... is a cup of tea. You are going to make one for me. Now keep quiet and listen.\"  And he sat. He told the Nutro-Matic about India, he told it about China, he told it about Ceylon. He told it about broad leaves drying in the sun. He told it about silver teapots. He told it about summer afternoons on the lawn. He told it about putting the milk in before the tea so it wouldn't get scalded. He even told it (briefly) about the East India Trading Company.  \"So that's it, is it?\" said the Nutro-Matic when he had finished.  \"Yes,\" said Arthur. \"That is what I want.\"  \"You want the taste of dried leaves boiled in water?\"  \"Er, yes. With milk.\"  \"Squirted out of a cow?\"  \"Well in a manner of speaking, I suppose...\"  \"I'm going to need some help with this one.\" --Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy  I do love me some dried leaves boiled in water (Cow fluids optional). We were walking around and wandered into DeSoto Market to discover this lovely little tea shop. They were all out of pastries by the time we were here but I was more interested in their teas anyways. It was a hot day so I glanced over at their shaken teas. The gunpowder green mango tea sounded really good, and I was able to request the addition of a little milk to it. It was really refreshing! The mango flavors with the green tea were perfectly balanced, and the bit of milk provided some richness to the drink. The lovely tea barista added some fresh mint too which imparted more of an aesthetic component in my drink rather than impacting any additional taste to it.  Service was very friendly and nice (Not staffed by a Nutro-Matic fyi). If I'm at DeSoto Market again I'd definitely try out more teas from here."}
{"text":"Went last night and ordered a cappuccino and an americano. The espresso in both was incredibly bitter. My wife didn't even drink the cappuccino. Would not recommend the place."}
{"text":"Great Tea Place!!   I've tried a few place and they are the only ones who get the London Fog right.   Their food is surprisingly not bad. Some coffee shops typically have good coffee and terrible food.  The service is pretty good too but I've only been there when no one else is there.  I would imagine in the morning or during lunch things may get slow because it seems only like one or two people are ever there, however they do very well."}
{"text":"Love coming here for a good drink and snack! I'm an ASU student at the downtown campus and Tea & Toast is only minutes away from my campus. I love come to Desoto, specifically to study and enjoy a hot London Fog! Allison, the owner is so sweet, accommodating and personable. Reason why I love Tea & Toast so much, is because she really puts effort into customers."}
{"text":"Dropped in the DeSoto Market for some food and decided to grab a coffee here. Wasn't expecting very much, but the ntiro cold brew was really excellent. Super smooth."}
{"text":"Cannot recommend this place enough! It's a far drive for me otherwise I'd be in EVERYDAY! My favs are the Green Rose Latte and the London Fog."}
{"text":"Teaspressa was average in my opinion. nothing special or spectacular that made me say \"Omg this could be the next starbucks\". I still prefer regular coffee and starbucks because starbucks is consistent. good luck tho."}
{"text":"I love this place. They have a good drink and breakfast selection. I always get the black rose latte, iced and avocado toast. Staff is always friendly and I'm much happier now they have consistent opening hours!"}
{"text":"Super cute place to stop by and catch up with friends! The smoked bacon jam toast was good. I would like to have a little more jam for a touch more sweetness, ask for some heat and add some fresh greens. If they had jalape√±o jelly with this, it would be perfect!!! Cappuccino was good too!"}
{"text":"Love the coffee here but you guys need to change the hours on yelp! Came here on a Sunday and there's a closed sign at 730 when yelp says 9 pm. I drove 30 mins just to get a coffee from here but looks like that's not gonna happen...."}
{"text":"I drove from LA to Phoenix to try and it was worth the drive!"}
{"text":"I love how they brew everything from scratch..you see them grinding the coffee, steeping the tea, etc when concocting your drink. Of the drinks I've tried, their prices, portions and level of \"how much can you keep me awake\" don't measure up to me. Their breakfast toasts are really good though. I do have a stamp card for a free tea/toast and am a couple away from attaining the prize... so it's not like all of my qualms have kept me away =]"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place and gave it a couple of tries. -The first time, I tried to order a large mocha and was told they did not have a large. The 12oz mocha cost me over $6. Mocha had no flavor and was missing coffee & chocolate. Basically, I was given a flavored milk drink. -The second time I ordered an iced tea. The 16oz iced tea cost over $5. I am used to $2-$3 ice tea and was so astonished that my small iced tea was so overpriced. It tasted no better than tea I get from everywhere else.  I try to suppport local bussiness as much as I can and I had such high hopes for this place but it is hard for me to support overpriced & tasteless. If you want better coffee, go to Song Bird, Lux, Giant, or hell, even Starbucks has better coffee and tea."}
{"text":"Love the concept that Tea & Toast Co. has with its use of tea in place of coffee in coffee drinks. Absolutely genius for tea and coffee drinkers!  Tea & Toast Co. is located in the DeSoto Market building which has large open space, huge windows providing tons of natural light, exposed ceiling and distressed walls. Very industrial and warehouse vibes indeed.  Decided to try a tea drink, after all, tea is indeed in their name. I decided on the Black Rose Tea Latte, iced. Decent price, typical of any tea or coffee based drink. The drink was made in a timely fashion. Utterly delicious! The rose tea was floral, slightly sweet and refreshing. Boba shops who use powder, move aside, this is true flavored milk tea. Truly a perfect drink for Arizona's warm, summer weather. Good amount of caffeine from the black tea, nowhere near as much as a cup of joe but totally worth it. You can really taste the quality of the tea here and the ambiance of DeSoto is relaxing. A coffee drinker? No worries, they have coffee here as well!   Definitely coming back to try their London Fog as well as their toast in the near future.  There is Wi-Fi available in the building, which makes it fit for working."}
{"text":"Another UberEats gem. So as I was looking at their menu I saw they had this drink called a \"chillycchino\" and I couldn't figure out what that was. I googled it, I looked on their facebook page, I even came here to see if I could figure it out. To no avail I couldn't find a true definition, so ...I ordered one.  AMAZING, just AMAZING I tell you. It's a creamy smooth, blended frozen drink of deliciousness. I ordered the white mocha and my coworker ordered the caramel. The only thing I can describe this beverage as is crack. Legit, crack.  Also got the breakfast burrito, 3 macarons, passion fruit green tea, and black rose tea latte. Breakfast burrito was a little dry, would've loved 2 salsas to dump over it as I ate, but the one I received was tasty and helped spice up the flavor. The Macarons are nothing but perfection. The passion fruit green tea is bright, refreshing and flavored enough to zest up regular green tea. The black rose is sweet and creamy.  I'll be back for that chillycchino, you can count on that."}
{"text":"Very cool coffee/tea stand in beautiful Desoto Market. I got an iced London Fog. It was balanced between iced tea and a rich milky latte. I'll have to come back to try some more interesting options."}
{"text":"Have only had great experiences here. Baristas have always been great at helping me decide what to get and suggesting new and fun flavor combinations. My favorite so far has been an Earl Gray macchiatto with lavender. Made me feel so fancy!"}
{"text":"Drinking tea on the 3rd Thursday of the month and listening to a live big band and people are swing dancing. What could be better?"}
{"text":"Tea and Toast is located inside the Desoto Central Market, which is a cool space (will need to back when the other places are open). I really like the concept of a tea place, but the execution did not quite work for me at Tea and Toast. The toast wasn't great and they were missing a lot of tea options.  For example, I was surprised to discover that their signature tea lattes on the menu were (like the black rose) were not actually available anymore. The cashier mentioned something about a recent change in suppliers, but it would have been nice if they'd updated the sign or put a little note on the menu that those drinks were no longer being offered. I ended up getting an iced oolong tea, shaken with some basil and cucumber. It was an okay oolong but I didn't really taste the basil or the cucumber. It was kind of disappointing for a tea place to be honest.   For toast, I tried the avocado toast with hard boiled egg. They were out of my first choice, which had bacon jam. The toast had plenty of avocado but the bread just had way too much oil. The bottom was soggy with the oil so I just at the top off. I wouldn't get it again."}
{"text":"Really delicious breakfast sandwiches! I had the Cali and it was perfect. I'll definitely be back again to try the toast and drinks!"}
{"text":"I've been here probably 8-10 times and could happily speak for their coffee options, savory foods, sweet breakfast foods, and desserts. All are great.  Just this morning, I ordered avocado toast with sel gris, a scrambled egg, and bacon, which isn't even a menu option--and they were completely happy about making it happen. (They were actually the ones who suggested adding bacon.) They made a very common / totally understandable mistake of losing my order, so after a while, I asked about the status of my toast. The way they handled it changed everything: Four separate people came by to apologize profusely, offer me refills on my latte, offer a full refund, ask if the food was okay, and apologize again. Restaurants do this all the time, and yet T&T handled the situation so professionally and courteously that it made me respect them even more.  Cheers, T&T team! Great experiences all around with food, service, and people."}
