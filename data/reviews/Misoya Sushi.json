{"text":"Decided to try it based on reviews.  It was very delicious with large portions.  My daughter said it was the best sushi she ever ate.  The waitress was very friendly.  It's a small restaurant and we were the only people there so I worried a bit but nothing to be worried about as it was great.  They had plenty of phone orders while we were there too..."}
{"text":"Extremely disappointed. We were seated and the hostess approached us stating they were not going to be able to accommodate us due to the high volume of take out. Had high hopes as we just moved to the area."}
{"text":"I've been here for the last 20mins and no service. He told me I would have to wait but no drink! I would not recommend this place for anyone not white."}
{"text":"Came here to pick up takeout for the first time. Very polite and professional staff and the tempura shrimp was great. I look forward to my next trip."}
{"text":"Came for lunch and the service was just absolutely awful. There were 4 of us and server took two orders, left the table at a huff because two at the table was late at ordering.  We had to call him back to order the rest of the food. Then when we asked for water, he goes he is busy.   Absolutely horrible experience!  Should not be working in the restaurant. We were the only customer in the restaurant."}
{"text":"If for the rest of my life I could only eat at one place it would be here. THERE FOOD IS SO GOOD. I EAT HERE ONCE A WEEK!!! Love them. I never want to eat anywhere else.   Bit pricey but worth it..  Update.   I'm allergic to salmon so if i ask instead of spicy salmon can I have spicy crab. And THEY SAID NO!! They don't do it now and hung up!!..."}
{"text":"Small restaurant but I have not received such a friendly service from any restaurant in years. Top notch. We went there for Mothers day dinner. The price for the portion and quality of food they served is very reasonable and good quality. What impressed me was after the dinner, the host gave my mom half dozen of roses.  Very heart warming and pleasant surprise."}
{"text":"I am an American in this part of Canada on business. So I do a Suri search for restaurants near me. Misoya Sushi catches my eye. Tiny place with minimal decor. Greeted immediately and sat down. Handed a menu which is extensive for a small place. I order the sushi and sashimi lunch.   The miso soup and salad is here immediately. Outside of Japan, the best soup ever. The salad is fresh and delicious.     The sushi and sashimi is fresh, tasty, and well presented. The ginger has great flavor and crunch.  Strongly recommend the drive to Nobleton to try this place!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best sushi in town. I go to this restaurant on average twice a week because I am literally hooked. Everything is always so fresh and cooked so well. The rolls are massive, filled with ingredients. The price is great for the amount of food you get. It's a very small restaurant with 4-5 tables. Some times I dine in or I will take it out, still the same great quality! I randomly stumbled upon this place once and decided to give it a try and I don't regret it! Thank you."}
{"text":"Place is small! It is a family run business! The food was Great !!!! The service was friendly! Portions are small.... but a healthy small! We will be back for sure!!!"}
{"text":"Yikes! Some poor reviews lately. Let's start off by saying I visited late 2016. Service was pretty good when I arrived.   As the only customers to this small restaurant (it seats about 12 people), we were instantly greeted and seated. I went with the salmon teriyaki bento box. The salmon portion was pretty small in comparison to every other restaurant I've had this staple item at, but all the same tasty. You could tell the cook/chef/sushi master really put care into plating the dish. The bento box came with two pieces of crab meat/avocado sushi, rice, and some fresh salad. My group was also presented with complimentary sliced oranges when we finished our main dishes.   I'm not in Nobleton very often, but I enjoyed my lunch here."}
{"text":"Pretty much the best sushi i have ever had. Everything is fresh and lots of time and care gets put into the dishes. Everthing is made with love here and you can really tell. I highly recommend this place if you are in the area."}
{"text":"?????????????? ??????? ?????? ????????????????? ????????? ????????? ??????  ?????????"}
{"text":"Surprised indeed, great sushi and well priced, definitely worth the drive to Nobleton!"}
{"text":"Mark, quite probably one of the finest sushi chefs in the southern Ontario region is no longer there. We were a huge fan of his work and were sad when Kyle stopped school and our old van could no longer travel the road to Misoya without pain or injury to him. New van, back to school we could not wait to get back to Mark. So we show up, there are three parties there, one eating, one waiting for service and us. I sit Kyle down at one of the table and look into the kitchen. There are two men there scurrying about one cooking something on the grill. He rudely announces that there is no waitress today and only takeout. So I ask about Mark and again rudely not making any eye contact he states that Mark no longer works there. Kyle and I have a long and disappointing stare and we start to head out. I mention to the group not eating that we were there basically for Mark's sushi and that he was no longer there and they leave too. If anyone knows what happened to Mark who used to work there please message me directly. I would love to reconnect with him."}
