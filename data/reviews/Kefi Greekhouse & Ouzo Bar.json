{"text":"I give Kefi a rating of \"meh\".  We've been coming here for the past couple of years, and the food is absolutely on the decline. Portions are becoming smaller every visit, quality is low (salmon had no seasoning, cold rice, massive wad of spinach), service was mediocre.   With so many quality Greek places in Calgary, Kefi better pick up the pace, and soon!"}
{"text":"We really enjoyed our time at Kefi. The blue and white decor is fresh and the server, Justin, while self-admittedly not Greek, was very knowledgeable about the food. We ordered ouzo to start (OPA!) and then shared a greek salad village style. The salad came with nice big chunks of fet and a wonderful tangy dressing. Make sure to order the pita at the beginning of your meal because they make each serving to order and it takes a while. It comes to the table warm and oh, so soft and delicious. We also ordered the Seafood in a Little Skillet to share. It was tasty but I found the thick tomato sauce overpowered the shrimp and scallops. A sauce made with a few diced fresh tomatoes with garlic and oregano or mint would have been better. On to our main. I had the Kota Gemisti (chicken stuffed with spinach and feta)...a little overcooked but very tasty and I loved their lemon potato. The rice was delicious, too, but topped with that thick tomato sauce. It would have been better without it. The man inhaled the Kleftiko (bandit's lamb stew)...so tender and tasty...it was good to the last drop. I am a big fan of Greek music and when it started and the dancers came up I was transported back to Greece. We had a terrific time and will certainly be back."}
{"text":"Five of us went on a Saturday evening and ate 'family style'. I'm a huge fan of eating this way; ordering a bunch of food and sharing. We started with their delicious, pitas and dips. We tried the Tzatziki, Taramasalta and Kopanisti. All three were excellent. We also had Saganaki, which, if you like cheese, you'll LOVE! For our entree we ordered chicken, beef and prawn souvlaki which were pretty good. The beef one was my least favorite. We also had the Bifteki and it was delicious. Plus potatoes and rice - also excellent.   The staff was welcoming and friendly, every 30 -  45 minutes or so they had some Greek dancing which was highly entertaining. We were there for a few hours and even though the restaurant was quite busy at one point we did not feel rushed and we were welcome to enjoy our meal at our own pace.  I will definitely go again."}
{"text":"I've been driving by Kefi since they opened about a year ago or so, but just made it in for the first time recently. I have to admidt the room isn't much and it kind of feels like you're dining in an old warehouse (rough unfinished walls, etc.), but man the food is pretty good! To start I had the avegomaldo soup, which was good but not any better than what I can make at home. For my main i had the lamb stew, which has a really nice sauce, lamb, potatoes, beans, cheese, and tomatoe, served with pita and rice. it was pretty good! we'll be going back!"}
{"text":"Excellent service.  Yummy food.  Good portion.  Highly recommend!  Will come visit again.  The meat balls, kalamari, even the rice are so good!!!!!"}
{"text":"I think that Kefi started out strong when it opened, but is in danger of fading and losing its long-term luster.  The Greek restaurant business is a pretty competitive one, as what makes a great Greek restaurant is consistent quality, great service, and good portion sizes (for an example of a place that follows these guidelines and is always packed, see the review for Stephos' in Vancouver).   I've eaten there with my family a number of times, and have noticed that stinginess is becoming a hallmark of this restaurant.  The souvlaki skewers seem to get smaller every time I go.  You need a magnifying glass to find the feta in the Greek salad, which is otherwise overrun with onions.  The side order of Tzatziki is extremely small (a few tablespoons), despite its price tag (which I seem to recall is close to $5).  Despite the above negative points (which are definitely fixable), the food is overall very good, notably the souvla (spit roasted lamb) which is out of this world.  I just pray that the owners of Kefi don't try to save a few pennies here and there by cheaping out on things.  Despite my 5 or so visits in the past year, I will only give Kefi one more chance.  If next time I go there I see more evidence of the above cheapness, then I am done and will not be returning - and I'm sure I'm not the only one out there that feels this way."}
{"text":"The food was excellent and the restaurant itself is very nicely set up.  Justin, our waiter was very knowledgeable and friendly.  The staff danced a traditional greek dance and gave us a plate to smash in honor of our Wedding / Honeymoon.  Felt very welcomed and well fed.  Would visit again if we return to Calgary!  Thanks for making our last night on Honeymoon special."}
{"text":"Excellent food, great service, and fun dancing in this family run restaurant. Decor is modern Greek and a great feel.  Will definitely return."}
{"text":"Darn. It's gone. I just walked to the door and saw that it had closed down and evicted back in March.  I love the food and some of the best roast lamb in the city."}
