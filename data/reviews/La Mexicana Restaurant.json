{"text":"Just went on a date night with my husband and came across this gem of a place. The food was very good, very flavourful and the service was fast and friendly.
I had the Chimichanga and it was very good, fresh and the chicken was so tender.
My husband had the Enchilada Platter and he was very satisfied. The beef was melt in your mouth tender, the sauce was a bit spicy for my taste, but he enjoyed it. (we asked for next time, and you can request a milder sauce)
We'll definitely be coming back for more!!"}
{"text":"Everything was so delicious, fresh and gourmet tasting! I hadn't come here since 2006 with my Mom who used to take me and my sister here after getting our hair done. Despite the rowdy people I was with when we ate, the service was so kind to us. We came 25 minutes before closing on a Sunday night and the man let us in with a smile and told us not to worry or rush. 
The food - was even more wonderful than I remember (I thought it was the best back then too!) I ordered beef enchiladas and horchata. They gave us tortilla chips and mild/medium sauce (the same fresh sauce I remember from years ago!!!! I was so happy!)
 The enchiladas came with a side of beans in a tortilla chip cup. The sauce on the enchiladas was perfect and so fresh - everything was wonderfully flavourful the portions of the enchiladas made me feel satisfied but not over-stuffed. It was the best Mexican food I've had in a while.The place was very clean and the decor was aesthetically very nice. 
I will definitely be coming back - everything was fresh. authentic and delicious!"}
{"text":"Not impressed whatsoever. Went today for lunch seeing that today is NOT a statutory holiday (Thursday before the Easter long weekend). There was a sign posted in the window that they are closed for Good Friday. Is Thursday now the new Friday?! Not impressed that this happened and that they did NOT advise their clientele that they would be closed Thursday AND Friday and Sunday, but will be open Saturday of the Easter weekend. Really?! Why was this not posted on their website or written on the sign in the window?! Did not appreciate my time being wasted. If it had been a stat or they clearly stated that they were closed for vacation, I could completely understand. This was complete garbage treatment of their clientele and potential clientele."}
{"text":"Really nice place... a bit small... ok cozy! There is a mini-bar. I went in with a friend on a Sunday afternoon... surprisingly empty. Had the Combo Platter with Chicken enchilada, burrito, beans, spicy rice, and a dallop of guacamole and sour cream. The free chips and spicy salsa was too good. The waiter was very prompt and gave us good tips on choosing food and drinks."}
{"text":"Was in the neighborhood and yelped the surroundings to find something for lunch...it was a good find!! 

Pleasantly greeted by the waitress, and even more pleasantly happy to sit down and already be served nachos and homemade salsa (2 types, mild and spicy), and cold lime water.  It was off to a great start!   All on the house!

I had a pozole (spicey stewed pork, corn soup), it was a good portion as it came with a fried tortilla with sour cream, and all the condiments to put into the soup (radish, lettuce, oregano, cayenne pepper powder, onions)  my husband had the combo which came with an enchilada, a burrito, and refried beans in a taco basket.  Everyone around us seemed to had ordered that Combo too!

Will definitely come back if in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"If you like Mexican food this is the place, good food,good prices, there beef burritos are really good."}
{"text":"Been going here for years. One of my go to places. Always get the fajitas. They are amazing and big enough to share. Staff is always friendly. Good comfort food."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place probably 1000 times and never gone in, but the other night we were in the mood for mexican and gave it a try.  It was very authentic and tasty.  My fiance is gluten free, and there was a ton of stuff on the menu she could eat, which is a rare treat. 

I had the fish tacos and she had chicken tacos.  Comes with all the fixins, and really good pico de gallo, with lots of cilantro just like I like it.  The chicken tacos were great as well.  Highly recommend, can't wait to go back and try more things."}
{"text":"I came here on a Monday night with a few friends on a whim. The server told us to seat ourselves which we went outside and sat in the corner. There was the back seat of a van against the wall next to us. We found it funny. 

The food was delicious! I got the talyoyos I think they're called and I loved them. Someone got fajitas and a couple friends got the burritos. The servings were large coming with salted rice (effing delicious), salad and 2 burritos with huge dollops of guacamole and sour cream on top. The friend that got the fajitas complained he only had 3 tortillas with his dish but they gave him a good serving of rice on the side to make up for that. The talyoyos I got were an appetizer but since I ate them all myself I was content. 

We ordered dessert, basically one of everything, but unfortunately they didn't have the churros and I've been dying to try them since I saw them on TV a few years back. The bunuelos with the ice cream was my favourite although the fried ice cream was delicious and the flan was my 2nd favourite. My friend ordered a coffee drink and it was disgusting in my opinion 'cause you could taste the liqour. All 4 of us struggled to drink it.

I would definitely come back again. The only thing that lost them a star was the slow service. Our waiter was good, but i never got his name and I think he was the only one on shift. It took a while for our drinks to come out when we first sat down, our food took a while and our desserts took a while too. Poor guy was serving every table on his own and I felt like I should've helped him. On the bright side, since the service took a while our group didn't have to worry about looking for something to do to kill time before we headed off to bowling after dinner!

Give this place a shot and I hope for the poor guy they hired another waiter or waitress :S"}
{"text":"Kind of ecstatic that there is a if not any Mexican restaurant up here in Thornhill and I  couldn't be happier. Place just opened up a couple days ago and I am a fan. Their chimichangas are delicious.

Edit: As of Nov 2013, this restaurant is now closed."}
{"text":"Had hoped for much better, this restaurant being in our neighbourhood, but sadly disappointed. Tasteless food, which arrived quickly. Their hot sauce lacked punch. Servers inattentive. Ambiance was pretty much the only positive."}
{"text":"Holly didn't like the salsa, but I did.
Fish Tacos were delicious."}
{"text":"The decor isn't anything special, but the food was great! Flavourful, admirable prices, nice hosts, this small Mexican place serves it up well in an unassuming part of the Bathurst strip. 

Great room for parking!

We tried the flautas and the Pollo con Mole and the Veggie Flautas and they were delicious."}
{"text":"First time trying this place. 
Great server. So friendly and helpful. 
For food we got the bean soup, Fish tacos, and enchiladas. 
Soup was great. Definitely will get again
Fish tacos were amazing. 
Enchiladas were not as good. Too salty. Won't get again. 

Overall, good restaurant and will come back and try some other stuff."}
{"text":"The place is kind of in the middle of no where, along Bathurst St.  There's no way I would have come across this place without the aid of the Yelp app though. 

We parked in the back lot and walked up to the restaurant. To my chagrin there were patrons inside!   Which is always a good sign. :)

The decor is hole in the wallish but I had hopes for the food. Our server was friendly, professional, and prompt. 

We ordered a mixed platter which came with an chicken enchilada, beef burrito, and a quesadilla, served with sour cream and guacamole. Plus a chicken flauta -crisp tortilla, rolled and stuffed smothered with sour cream, guarcamole, and cheese. 

I'm by no means an expert in Mexican cuisine - but I've eaten my share of it in California, Mexico and in the city, I thought the food was okay. 

The highlight for me was the corn tortilla quesadilla, and the beef burrito. 

Found the food a tad bit salty, the chips didn't taste that fresh, portion sizes are large yes, but I'd rather pay less and get less food because I didn't require that much food.  Prices are bit on high side for the atmosphere.

Think it's an okay choice if you're in the area and feeling like Mexican."}
{"text":"I had the pleasure of dining at La Mexicana last night. I found out about the place through Dealthons.com. I am very happy that a great Mexican restaurant has opened up close by. The service was great! Very friendly, polite and professional. I have dined at many Mexican restaurants and this has been the best one in Toronto. The food was fresh and not greasy at all. Most Mexican restaurants in Toronto are extremely greasy. We started off with the guacamole and I was in heaven! Tasted like it was made south of the border. I had the fish tacos and absolutely loved it! It was my first time trying them, definitely not going to be the last. My dad had the seafood platter, I tried some of it, it was very fresh and delicious. The scallops were very tasty and big, the lobster tail although very delicious, was a bit small. I was surprised they served the platter with white rice and not traditional Mexican rice. I liked the complimentary chips, however the salsas were not spicy at all. I wish the green salsa had been creamy like the way they serve it in Texas. The red salsa was a little bland, definitely needed some kind of kick to it. We ended our meal with the churros. Let me just say this....it was heavenly! I am a huge fan of churros and was very impressed. I want to go back right now for the churros. I am telling all my friends about this place because overall the food is really good. They have Dos Equis on tap which was awesome, can't have Mexican food without it! They also have drink specials. Definitely going to try their Margaritas, noticed they had them on special for $5 on Mondays. So basically, if you are looking for delicious Mexican food and awesome service, this is the place to be."}
{"text":"Both entrees needed salt, and I overheard another table ask for salt. Hard to believe salt was needed at a Mexican restaurant.

Should have left when I saw the first entree arrive ....it came with frozen uncle bens type rice ....so obviously not home made because it had corn, tiny carrot cubes, green beans,and half dehydrated peas.
5 minutes later the second entree arrived. Same lack of salt.
Fish with coconut was probably frozen. Chicken burrito was probably reheated. Chicken was stringy. There was nothing in the burrito except chicken. Strange.
Sour cream and guacamole on top, but not \"smothered\" as menu suggests.
And the re-fried beans? One came hot, the other not.
Very nice, loud waitress, and a waiter that had to write out our two entree order in long hand.....but we won't be back ever."}
{"text":"Good food but very slow service. it sometimes take more than an hour to prepare the food. They don't have all the items on the menu available sometimes. But, when ready the burritos which are basically tons of beef with a thin bread covering it, taste very good."}
{"text":"Amazing homemade food and atmosphere! My mom and I  and family have been coming here for 10 years or longer! Always consistent and staff welcoming and friendly! Highly recommended ending your meal with the flan! Our server Jesus is always amazing!! Owners super nice! 10 out of 10 forsure!"}
{"text":"So just a head's up, I'm a Texan living in Canada, so I'm really biased regarding norteno Mexican food.  However, I was quite pleased.  I had the combo plate, and my boyfriend had a chile relleno.  The food comes with generous portions, and the food itself is really tasty.  It has pescetarian and vegetarian options, as well as gluten free.  The sauces are rich and flavourful, and the produce in the salad tastes fresh.  The lime vinaigrette dressing is fantastic!  Also, the cheese empanada seems to be filled with queso oaxaca, and that makes Renee pleased.  I was super nervous about being able to find decent Mexican food in Canada, but both places I've tried in Toronto have been good.  Also, horchata.  so good.

The only thing I noticed is that the menu indicates coffees do not have free refills (which is fine, but it appears to be $1 a refill), and the spicy is not as spicy as you'd expect.  I'd go back."}
{"text":"Came here for dinner, it was really good. Authentic Mexican not so much, I lived in Mexico for 6 months and have rarely eaten authentic Mexican food it tends to get watered down north of Texas. However this quaint little restaurant had amazing flavor, good service and huge portions. I'm not a shy girl about finishing my plate but the portions were so big I just couldn't even though I tried. 
The price was reasonable considering the portions, around 16$ to 20$ a plate. I did notice there was a sign that said during lunch time 12pm-3pm the main course meals were on special for 10$. I will definitely go back for lunch in the near future while I'm still here in Toronto."}
{"text":"I was really craving Mexican food, I'm not Mexican but I love Mexican and Tex mex. The tortillas and salsa unfortunately did not do it for me. We tried the platter and enchiladas. The food was good, I was given pork instead of chicken but since the food took long and we were really hungry we didn't say anything. They didn't check on us. I would honestly give them a 3.5 but the horchata was really good. No idea if it was homemade or not haven't had that many horchatas to know"}
{"text":"Not a place to get 'Authentic' Mexican Food in my opinion.

When I use to work on Bathurst my co-workers and I would order from this place when we were really desperate craving for Mexican food.

The food was so overpriced and the food did not tasted at all as 'authentic' as I hoped it to be. I ordered the Steak Fajitas and they were too damn chewy and overcooked. Terrible just simply terrible Im only giving it two stars because its the only goddamn thing open on Bathurst during the night and weekends -____-' at least their complementary nachos and salsa wasn't too bad."}
{"text":"I ordered the combo platter.  Overall, the main course was tasty.  The portion was too small for $16 though.  The Horchata was at $3, but it was worth it.  Excellent horchata.  I dont like how you have to pay for coffee refills.  At least make it 1 free refill.  I wouldn't go back unless I was really hungry and in the area again.

C.L."}
{"text":"La Mexicana is a great place for authentic Mexican in Toronto. My friend found it when we were looking for a fun place to eat near Yorkdale mall, and this happened to pop up in the search.

As some of the other reviewers say, it is a smaller restaurant, cozy and when we went it wasn't overly busy. Being a vegetarian AND a Mexican, I was pretty thrilled to see a lot of good veggie options on the menu. To start we shared the Amigos Platter, which had a little bit of everything - it even came with a bit of mole to dip! And let me tell you - when they say queso Oaxaca, it is REAL queso Oaxaca. I have tasted different kinds of that cheese that you can find here in Canada, and it never seems to taste authentic. I swear if I closed my eyes while eating the queso Oaxaca they used I could almost imagine I was in a Sanborns.

For my main I ordered the veggie enchiladas. I was so excited that instead of the usual onion and pepper that most restaurants consider to be a good enough veg stuffing, these had broccoli and cauliflower! Yummmmm.

Their horchata is pretty glorious, and I had the flan for desert which was lovely and a great texture.

Bottom line is: the food is delicious, I'd go back again, service is great, but the overall design and environment could be improved. Still - this isn't something that would stop me from eating there :)"}
{"text":"La Mexicana is an authentic, delicious and small little joint tucked away on Bathurst. 
The service is always A+ with waiters and waitresses very attentive to your needs. The food tastes authetically delicious and they have many options from burrito's to quesadilla's to even elote! My favorite is to get the enchilada's with beef - the beef is super soft and tender. They always give free chips and salsa (home made) to start and the churro's are divine. The best part about this place is that they serve HALAL meat so to all my Muslim friends who are looking for a mexican place, this ones for you. 

I would def. recommend this place for authentic, delicious mexican food! :)"}
{"text":"This is authentic stuff; I peaked into the kitchen and the line cook was indeed mexican! So take that Donald Trump!

So with that said - lets get to the review. I went on the weekend and missed out on the daily lunch special $10 for a soup and a main (mon-fri). Prices are a little bit more around $16-20 a plate.

However, well worth it. All the heavy chains have their idea about what a burrito is or an enchilada. They should come here and learn first. The beef burrito was the best tasting item. Pulled meat (not ground beef) inside the tortilla and the toppings added on top of it (not inside). Not the conventional burrito that is  mainstream. This is a sit down item and you need a fork and knife to eat this. 

The enchiladas was basic, not too pleased that the cheese wasn't melted on top as that is what makes the dish. Give it a meh- definitely not awful.

The chimichanga was very interesting- I guess the chicken was fried first and then they deep fry the tortilla once they put the chicken inside. So the texture comes out pretty crispy- but the re-frying of the chicken portion also gave it a KFC-ish taste. Was a treat. 

Added points for the home-made hot sauce (they have mild and hot) - choose carefully!
 Actually other then the cheese and tortilla. I think most ingredients are done in house (salsa, guacamole). I will be back to try other items."}
{"text":"Tried this spot during one lunch one day this week and was looking forward to my second chimichanga experience. 

Complimentary nachos were a nice addition and the server was also friendly and knowledgeable about the menu. 

The food however was a disappointment. I feel bad giving them only two stars as the people were nice but this is not a place I would suggest to anyone hence the stars. 

The chimichanga: two small deep fried chimichanga's were very dry and tasted and felt almost like they were bought frozen and dressed with toppings. Or that they pre-make them, freeze and serve to order. A bitter disappointment compared to what I have tasted elsewhere in the GTA especially considering how far I drove to try this place. 

The salad and bean concoction were both good additions to the plate but are not items that qualify to boost them to a three and hence a recommended eat. 

I have read the other reviews and it sounds like the fish tacos may be the hit here but I will not be returning based on my experience and the proximity of superior options.

Tip: Parking is horrible and the washrooms scary so take this into account before deciding to try this place anyways."}
{"text":"Very Disappointed

I've been here a few times and thought the food was decent but it has deteriorated.  Upon arrival was given the complementary chips and salsa, with the chips being stale and cheap tasting.   I ordered the black Bean Soup which was bland and ceviche.   The ceviche was not like any I've ever had, very bland and served with avocado slices so over ripe, they were brown throughout.   

I left leaving most of the food uneaten, and won't return."}
{"text":"My last few visits to La Mexicana prompted me to revise my previous review. I don't know what has caused this change, but the last two times I've eaten here have been delightful. The food has been extra delicious, and the portions seem to have increased significantly. 

The fiesta nachos are almost double the size as they used to be, and there are a few slight revisions to the menu. 

Met the owner the last time we dined here and he was extremely friendly, and even took some stuff off the bill for us. I will be sure to start recommending this place again."}
{"text":"La Mexicana is yet another attempt to try and be an authentic Mexican Restaurant.

First thing I noticed was the small menu.  Everything could fit on one page.  Most Authentic Mexican Restaurants have pages upon pages of various combinations and selections.  La Mexicana's menu is limited to very few items.

No bottled hot sauce located at the table.  They rely on their salsa as that is more of a hot sauce.

First the pros.  They give you Chips with both a Red and Green Salsa!  Great!  However the salsa is so extra spicy, it is like spooning hot sauce on your chips.  Both the red and green were more than super spicy.   Must have kept in the seeds when the chilllies were blended.

The salsa is blended to a point where it is in the sme consisency as a typical hot sauce unlike the chunky tomato salsa you see in an authentic Mexican restaurant.  

The chips are not homemade chips but that out of a bag.   You can really tatse the difference with hommade chips.  These at La Mexicana were very bland and flavorless.   Positive reviews do go to the Complimentary Chips and Salsa as only a few restaurants use this approach.  100% of the Authentic Mexican Restaurants in the US provide complimentary Chips and Salsa throughout the course of teh dinner.  La Mexicann has a $3 surcharge after the 1st basket.

If you are looking to enjoy a Corona or a mixed drink, look someplace else.  The restaurant opened early with no LLBO license and thus cannot serve alcohol or beer.  Choose from ONLY Coke/Pepsi drinks or the Virgin Sangria.  

The food is ok however no where near authentic Mexican food.  The rice is steamed with peas and carrots.  Typical steam rice that you would get at a Chinese Restaurant.

THe beans were actually pretty good.  4 out of 5!  They come in a bowl made out of a nacho.  Cool presentation.  Black Beens only.  Most authentic Mexican restaurants use Pinto beans.

The main courses were acceptable however given the ambiance, lake of items on the menu and the lake of authentic Mexican food, my rating is TWO out of FIVE.

2 / 5"}
{"text":"Good Food with a great atmosphere with staff that really love their restaurant. I met the owner who is Fijan and lovely.  The original La Mexicana is SO awesome, this place is an extension of that and I'm sure will get better and better as time goes on.

Bottom Line: LOCATION. The Sobey's plaza has never had a good restaurant, and Thornhill as a whole has no mexican food!!!! Thank goodness for this place, please eat there so they stay."}
{"text":"We went to La Meicana last night. It's not much to look at from the outside but the food is certainly authentic.  It's so much more work to make shredded beef than ground. If you want ground beef in your taco or bertito go to a chain. We had the chicken with lime soup. My husband had beef enchilada and I had fish tacos. Everything was so flavourful. We also shared a pitcher of margarhettas. Lucy who owns the restraunt has an interesting story coming from Mexico City. 
I will return and bring friends."}
{"text":"This is the second time here. I'm still giving a 3 stars just for comfort food. It's not enough to give a better rating. I would come here only if I'm around the area."}
{"text":"i enjoy this restaurant every time i go. the portions are well sized, the service is always polite and on time, and i've never had any problems with the food. 

there are plenty of dinner options, and every time i go, it's always consistently good. i especially like their bean spread, i find it delicious. 

the place itself is really small, but i don't mind because there's always a table available."}
{"text":"I stopped by since I had a crave for Mexican food and went off the reviews his place had. 

I am Mexican and from California so I know what real Mexican food is. 
Upon arrival we sat down and our waiter took our drink order but didn't give any water or ask if we wanted water since we ordered alcohol. 
After ordering our food we did wait a good while before we got our food.  Never came back to check up on how we were doing until we had finished eating. 
Flautas were okay definitely could improve on the quality. Chicken enchiladas had a nice kick to it but didn't even get the order right. 

The food is highly overpriced. I am assuming since it is one of the few Mexican spots out here and may not have the best quality ingredients.. 

If your Canadian this place might hit the spot. 
I do recommend adding rice to the plates served a true Mexican dish always comes with rice and beans"}
{"text":"I'd give this place a 3.5/5 but I'm giving them the benefit of rounding up this time.

I've had Mexican food in Arizona, Texas, California and Florida. I'm not a connoisseur, but I have some idea of what decent Mexican food tastes like. This place is by no means the best Mexican food I've ever tasted, but for GTA standards, it's pretty good. I'd say it's quite comparable to a decent-caliber Mexican restaurant in California. I opted for the chimichanga and it was decent. Nothing spectacular to jump out at me flavour-wise, but passable, though another companion who got the same thing seemed to like it quite a bit. The enchiladas looked pretty good as well. I came with a fairly large group and everyone enjoyed their meals. The complimentary chips were nice too. You could potentially say that the prices are a touch high for Mexican food of this caliber, but the serving sizes are quite reasonable.

There was only one server on a Saturday night but somehow he managed well enough, though it was occasionally a bit difficult to get a hold of him. He was a good fellow and very pleasant, so kudos to him. The restaurant is small; I'd guess that it only seats about 35 people or so. Was not too busy on a Saturday night; full but no real lineups. Has a good mom-and-pop shop vibe to it. Decor is nothing fancy, just a homely Mexican feel. Parking is somewhat limited but they have a handful of dedicated parking spots in the plaza behind them; I wouldn't say that parking is an inconvenience, but I can imagine that those spots could potentially be filled on a busy day.

Overall, a decent Mexican spot. Toronto doesn't really have too many Mexican options outside of the plethora of burrito places, so best of luck to them."}
{"text":"Always have their interact,credit machine down-only cash. You can figure it out-now past few months. Really never heard of a business only cash!!!!!!!!!!!!!! because their machine is down and never fixed.
Read between the lines"}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant for the third time tonight and I was really unimpressed with the service - it was appallingly slow for no reason (there were more staff and less customers than I've seen in the past).  Our group of 6 had a 7:30 reservation and we were all there by 7:40.  We did not have a server come to take our order until 8...and even then, we had to ask for one!  I gladly would have had a drink the second I sat down at 7:30 while we waited for the rest of the group to show up.  We ordered our drinks and dinner, and the drinks took another 20 minutes.

The drinks were a whole other issue. Some of my friends ordered a pitcher of blended strawberry margarita.  I ordered a classic margarita on the rocks (tequila, Triple Sec, lime juice).  They brought the pitcher of strawberry margarita with 2 salt-rimmed glasses although there were 3 of them sharing it. And they forgot my margarita. When they finally brought me mine, I thought the colour was off for what should be a real margarita...then I took a sip and it was warm, and also sweet (not how a real margarita should taste).  All I could taste was bar mix...it was certainly NOT lime juice as it should be made with (and as the menu described it).  The server insisted they used lime juice.  I told her I would not be drinking it.

At the end of the meal (our food was fine), I asked to speak to the manager. 10 minutes later, she came over. I explained the issue with the slow service, and all I got were some excuses about training new staff and a thank you for bringing it to her attention. I explained the issue with my margarita (my friends didn't care to bring up theirs) and she first started saying they do use lime juice.  I told her a margarita should not be sweet when ordered like that, and then she finally admitted they  use a limeade mix (EW. Definitely not how it should be made and not what the menu says). 

We finally got our bill and they charged my friends the premium margarita pitcher price (made with Patron, Cointreau and \"lime juice\") for their frozen one (made with bar rail tequila) - $45 instead of $26. My friends would have paid that because they didn't notice- so it's a good thing that I did.

The usage of limeade mix in their margaritas makes me question the authenticity of the rest of their food, and makes me wonder what other shortcuts they are taking (perhaps using store-bought salsa/sauces instead of making their own). The location is so convenient to my house, but I won't be returning. And judging by the lack of people in the restaurant on a Saturday night, I suspect they won't be there much longer either."}
{"text":"Great quality foods... not very fancy but taste really good. Also reasonable prices. 
The spice is just right and the ingredients are fresh. The Service is acceptable as well."}
{"text":"Absolutely horrible food! I ordered the zucchini and corn salad - 20 mins later I was told that there is no zucchini. So I ordered the spinach and avocado salad with candied pecans. There is 2 tiny slices of avocado and loads of spinach with pecans. They really skimped on the avocado. The 2 main dishes we ordered were the Polo con Mole and another chicken dish with poblano peppers. The quality of chicken was atrocius... it was extremely dry - as if they used it from a frozen packet. Completely disgusting. I would never go back there again."}
{"text":"The ambience is great and the service is friendly. I had El Burro (beef) and the sopa de lima while my partner had the Carne en salsa de chipotle and everything was delicious. Still didn't feel like the burrito beat out Chipotle, but it was still yummy and a good sized portion. After we ordered, they also brought out tortilla chips and housemade salsa which was good. We will be going back for more."}
{"text":"As a result of working nearby La Mexicana I was bound to order and eat here. Unfortunately, I cannot agree with some of the reviews given to this restaurant by other Yelpers. 

I've tasted a wide range of the dishes that they had to offer and would not put it as the best Mexican food I've eaten. There is something lacking in the food - whether it is passion or skills I just cannot say that La Mexicana is a place that I would like to come back to. (Which is proven, since the relocation of my work place office.) 

On the bright side, the service that they provide and the people that work there are amazing. They are extremely nice and caring. I never encountered anyone that I did not like there. Too bad the food isn't the greatest. 

I think overall this place needs improvement on its dishes. Salsa wasn't that great, guacamole was good though, soups and other dishes definitely need more tending too. I found myself thirsty all the time, could possibly be due to the amount of salt they put into the dish. 

Sadly, this is one of the restaurants I have to say - is not worth trying.

-CL"}
{"text":"The food was good, the service was good, but not great ambience though. 20$pp (no drinks)

I specially enjoyed the fajitas, they were very flavourful and tender. Of all the things we tried this is the only must order. All the other dishes were good but they wouldnt stand out over any other mexican restaurant"}
{"text":"I came here because they offer HALAL authentic Mexican food which is rare in the GTA and area. (I'm not talkin tacos n burritos).
Be aware they also have a few dishes with pork such as the pre-prepared empanadas (has chorizo which is pork sausage).

They said that their chicken and beef has been halal for many many years due to their customer base.
They also had virgin cocktails.

Their menu includes some of the most common Mexican dishes such as chimichangas, enchiladas, fajitas, chicken with mole sauce, and taquitos.

The restaurant is relatively small and decorated with basic Mexican decor.  The service was great and fast. 
The food was good and reasonably priced.

There is free parking at the back which is nice.

I would recommend this place and I would return again."}
{"text":"Apart from the Mariscos al Guajillo (tiger shrimp, basa fish and Atlantic lobster sauteed with onions, guajillo peppers and salsa verde for $22) which was EXCELLENT, the rest of the meal was just ok.   We also ordered the combo platter (chicken enchilada and beef burrito were pretty good but the cheese quesadilla was just ok.   The beef tacos, however, were not eadible. The beef was tough - pieces of steak not ground beef but the beef was chewy and not cooked through.  To their credit, the waitress took it off our bill. 

The maragaritas were ok.  No salt rim and two little pieces of ice inside the glass - watery and not very cold.  It is unforgivable, in my view, for a Mexican restaurant not to have good margaritas!

The waitress was nice but very rushed, being the only wait staff working on this Sat night.  Even though the place was small, she didn't seem to be able to handle all of the tables efficiently.  Apparently, there was a computer problem screwing up the orders that night but I should not have had to get up and find her to get her attention!  

Even though the fried ice-cream for dessert was good and the portion was large and reasonably priced for $6 and the seafood entree was really very good, I can't see myself going back to this restaurant."}
