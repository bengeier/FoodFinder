{"text":"What the....! I am not sure why this place is open. I tried to give this place a chance since they looked new (from the outside). But, it needs work on the inside. The place is dark and needs a good paint job. I ordered a \"pure burrito\" and got a burned burrito. I had to throw it away.  Wasted my money. Never again."}
{"text":"I'm so happy to have a good Mexican restaurant close to home. The food is fresh and very filling. I love that they give you chips and salsa while you wait. The food was out in less than 10 minutes. Thumbs up for this place. I recommend it!"}
{"text":"A swing and a miss! I really really wanted to like this place as I love Mexican food and the location is great. We gave them a try and the food was really bland. We never got a part of our order. We ordered the tamales that were on special and received a chicken burrito which they adamantly insisted was a tamale. They were out of Corona but were nice enough to go on a beer run for us so that was appreciated. If the food had been good, I would have probably overlooked the rest."}
{"text":"Good food for takeout, set up for ordering at the cash register and then either taking out or eating at a table.  Very small but not a negative.  Their cheese dip is very good and their tacos and burritos are tasty.  They lean to the cilantro side for salsas, so my family isn't as keen on the flavors, but I don't mind it personally.  This place is closer to my house than any other of this type, and I hope they do well.  They are at a location that has been tough for many prior restaurant tenants (They are where Donato's was, behind that Indian Grill).  Being in the area that is at the intersection between Mallard Creek and Prosperity Church and on the side with Dunkin Donuts and the bank, this means you have to know where you want to go when leaving, the median doesn't help.     I believe they would do better if they added delivery and sorted out the food logistics. (Can't let the cheese dip cool!)"}
{"text":"This is delicious, authentic Mexican food. My family and I came here for a quick lunch and the food was amazing. We ordered three different menu items and enjoyed each one of them. I highly recommend the fresh, homemade guacamole and the Carolina burrito!!"}
{"text":"The food is pretty good, but they need to fix the operations of the place. I called within business hours to place an order and it goes to voice mail?? I have also made trips there in the past within business hours and they were closed. Weird, i'll take my business someplace else."}
{"text":"I am so sorry that I wasn't impressed!! It's pretty hard to mess up a chips/salsa and a burrito but somehow this place managed to do it.  Im hoping I just should not have listened to the owner and got his taquito burrito special.  It had a very off putting taste that I could figure out if it was from the beans or sauce.  So awful I couldn't finish (which rarely happens).  I would like to say I'd give them another try and get what I initially wanted but I honestly doubt it..."}
