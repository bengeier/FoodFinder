{"text":"I finally checked out Jewel's Cafe today and I wanted to cry tears of happiness when I took my first delicious bite of chicken and waffles!  I was diagnosed with Celiac Disease recently and have been too scared to eat out, so it was a HUGE relief to not have to worry about getting sick from my meal.  The food was delicious, the cartel coffee was amazing as always and even my boyfriend (who loves his gluten-filled foods) was a fan.  I will definitely be coming back!!  I'm so grateful that this place exists."}
{"text":"Having a gluten free 6 year old, this place has been a gift from God. He had loved it since the day they opened. He feels normal and can order anything on menu. The food is amazing and you can't even tell its GF"}
{"text":"I bought a salad,  a gluten-free cupcake and a loaf of gluten-free bread.  I couldn't believe the salad.  It cost $8 & it was supposed to have lettuce, fruit,  almonds & quinoa. It was priced way too high for what I got. It was a very sad salad.  There was a small amount of lettuce,  3 blueberries, 1/4 of a strawberry,  and I could barely find any quinoa! I took it to go and was in a hurry. The cupcake was very moist and tasted like a normal cupcake. I wouldn't know it was gluten-free. The bread is pretty good.  It is soft and has the texture of regular bread.  It was $8 as well. But it was a large loaf.  The customer service wasn't very good.  They didnt smile, welcome me or anyone i saw.  I kinda felt like I was bothering them just to order my food.  I might go back sometime for the bread, because it's very difficult to find soft gluten-free bread & maybe a baked good. But,  it's not worth the drive,  unless I'm already in that part of town. A big maybe!"}
{"text":"On the positive side I special ordered a cake for my sisters baby shower and it was fabulous!  Beautiful,moist and flavorful.
It is a small restaurant so I called 3 weeks in advance to coordinate a table for 15. I will sum it up by saying their communication needs a complete overhaul.  None of us would go back."}
{"text":"I lived in Arizona for close to two years and passed by Jewel's multiple times a week without ever stopping in. A year after moving to a different state, I finally made my way into this Gluten Free Bakery. After being on a GF diet for the last 5 years, I've tasted it all. Jewel's is one of the best GF bakeries out there. The food is delicious and the pricing isn't bad compared to the quality of food that you get! 

On my first visit I ordered the Chicken and Waffles plate- the waffle was just right, crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle, and the buttermilk syrup is out of this world! The chicken was well seasoned and nicely fried (a dream for those of us that grew up eating fried chicken on the regular) I would have wanted at least one more strip of chicken though (or five). My friend, who isn't gluten free ordered the biscuits and gravy and she was amazed that it was gluten free! I tried a bite and it was just as I remembered.

On my second visit ( the next day- since I was on vacation) I ordered a slice of quiche. It was good sized quiche, definitely larger than I was expecting since with GF foods you often receive smaller portions. 

For my drive home I grabbed ( and paid for) a lemon bar (absolutely delicious and massive), two cupcakes (yummy) and 3 cinnamon rolls. Now to the cinnamon rolls- these cinnamon rolls are what every GF eating person has been searching for! The dough is buttery and flakey, terms that are not always associated with GF foods, and the frosting is finger licking good! If you get the chance to stop by this bakery and can only order one item I would recommend the Cinnamon Roll! It's been 3 months since this visit and I am still trying to find a way to go back for more or have friends ship me some!! Traveling tip- I froze all my items and put them in an insulated bag for my 8 hr trip home and they kept very well."}
{"text":"We are gluten and dairy free so traveling can be a real PIA. We found this amazing GF restaurant on yelp and loved it. The baked goods were perfect and we had a delicious full breakfast. Def recommend - the staff were helpful and our meal was reasonably priced. Also close the airport."}
{"text":"Went here for brunch but kind of disappointed on how long it took for my meal to come. Also I sat outside, and felt like the servers didn't pay much attention then. Just got my orders and only came back when the food was out which took almost a half an hour. I do love the food, but as a first time experience, not sure if I'm coming back."}
{"text":"I love stopping here for brunch whenever we can...the chicken and waffles are the best. I have been gluten free for about 5 years now and I haven't had a birthday cake in as long, so this year I decided we were definitely getting a cake! I had friends over on Saturday night and we had the cookie dough chocolate cake. Everyone LOVED it and no one could believe it was gluten free. My only complaint is there was a little too much cookie dough to cake ratio, but that isn't the worst problem to have. :)"}
{"text":"If you are a celiac and are sensitive to avenin, you should know that oat flour is the base for their gluten-free mixes and all their kitchen food. I'm one of the people who gets more sick from certified GF oats than wheat products, so when I saw the ingredients on their flour mix and asked about the menu offerings, I bailed. I won't recount the numerous scientific studies that show oats can cause refractory problems in celiacs, or the warnings that doctors issued for oats saying that they are 100% NOT for every celiac. But please be warned. If you're like me and are desperate for a surefire safe place to eat out, this may not be it. :-("}
{"text":"The first time I ever came here was on that national donut day where you could buy a donut and get another one free. The marshmallow/chocolate one was okay but the cereal one was INCREDIBLE. It was the best donut I ever had in my life. 

I went back for my stepdads birthday and custom ordered a half dozen of them and the 2nd time around they were just okay. Kind of dry/stale? Not even close to the first time. 

Then I went back AGAIN to try their breakfast/brunch stuff and that was meh also. Also for some reason I ordered the eggs benedict and they didn't put salmon on it?! I was really disappointed about that. The sauce was pretty good and I was happy because it's dairy-free and I am lactose intolerant. My friends had pizza and a waffle. The waffle was delicious but the pizza was weird."}
{"text":"Really impressed. Not just good but great. 

The sticky roll was sweet- and the roll part was nice and fluffy. The goat cheese quiche melted in my mouth- and the crust was perfectly buttery and soft.

The bacon was superb- she asked if we wanted it extra crispy- but only cheap bacon needs the extra crispy treatment. This was obviously the good stuff. 

I also tried the biscuit (really had that biscuity goodness to it) and pancakes- yummy but I'm glad I got the quiche as that was just. so. fantastic. 

And- they were doing coffee via pour-over and chemex. Can't get a more perfect morning! 

Strongly recommend! The fact that everything was gluten-free? Beyond amazing. They can compete side by side with glutenois caf√©s and hold their own. Go."}
{"text":"I think I came to Jewl's on the wrong morning. The guy working the register was extremely rude and unhelpful. We waited 30 minutes for our food to come out and when we got it was cold! The young lady who brought out our food literally tossed our utensils on the table and walked away. Based on the reviews I read before coming, this was totally unexpected. I work hard for my money and I prefer to spend it on great service."}
{"text":"I decided to try this place out one day, I have severe gluten allergies so it's hard to find places like Jewels that offer an entire menu that is gluten free. I was not disappointed, I ordered a salad that was pretty good. I was more excited about the apple fritter I ended my meal with, I was elated by how wonderful it was. I rarely eat baked desserts anymore as it is difficult to find ones that are not only safe for me to eat but that actually have good texture and taste good. Many people think to make up for the missing gluten by adding excessive sugar and it reunions the dessert. Jewels fritter was perfect, not to sweet and wonderful fluffy texture. I will definitely be back to try more of there meal items, as well as more baked desserts! So glad to have found a place that is catered towards people with gluten allegies and is in my area of town!"}
{"text":"This place is ok. Not spectacular. I have been here twice now. Once with my kids and once by myself.  

The first time I was there my kids had the pancakes.  They seemed to enjoy their meal. I ordered the chilaquiles. I didn't enjoy my meal. The chilaquiles was made with lots of tortilla chips, lots of green chili sauce, and a tiny bit of egg on top. I couldn't even tell if they used a whole eggs it was so little.  The chips were soggy and gross. I couldn't finish the plate because all it was, was a soggy plate of chips! Not worth the money I paid for it, needs more egg, a lot more egg.

The second time I went there, which was yesterday,  I had their chorizo plate. It was the same thing, lots of potatoes,  not enough chorizo,  and very very little egg. It had great flavor, but I'm not sure if I will ever eat here again with 2 disappointing plates. The coffee was decent though."}
{"text":"Came here after reading about it online. Had the chicken and waffles it was delicious! Chicken had great flavor and breading was crunchy and tasty too. My daughter doesn't care too much about gluten free food but she really enjoy this meal as well. Not too crazy about the coffee or breakfast sandwich though."}
{"text":"This place is a dream come true.  100% gluten free menu, yet from the look and taste of everything, you would never guess. The atmosphere is casual and welcoming. I like that you order at the counter. It feels very relaxed. 

I like the sandwiches and French fries. The bread is soft and chewy, unlike most GF breads. I take a loaf to go, along with a doughnut or cinnamon roll."}
{"text":"My go to for delectable tasty treats and coffee. 

Yes, when they are busy, expect to wait. It can get crazy busy. If you ever have any issue just tell them, because quality is their standard.

Yes exceptional gluten free. 
No worries for cross contamination!"}
{"text":"Everything I've eaten here is really good! I don't like breakfast (at all) but I do like pastries and I've had an array of delicious brownies, cookies, and parfaits at Jewels! The two times I've eaten in was with breakfast-loving people so I couldn't escape a real meal. So I chose the fried chicken and waffles and OMG they are SO good! They serve them with this hot sauce/butter/sugar mix that is yum! 

I don't have a gluten-free diet but everything I've tried was really good, I couldn't tell anything was missing. 

The service is pretty sucky, hence the 3 stars. I can't really gauge if the staff is rude or just awkward, either way it's not the most pleasant experience. The last time I was there, a gal came up to our table and said \"are you finished with that?\" and pulled my plate away before I answered. It still had food on it and I had my fork in my hand en route to my mouth! Haha. And we couldn't have been sitting more than 10 minutes so it's not like we were \"camping\" and she was politely telling us to move along. 

I will be back because the food is good but I will take-out. I don't think I will eat in again. They're not the friendliest of people."}
{"text":"The Green chili corn waffles with marinated  pork, and creamy coleslaw is one of the best dishes I've had in a while at a restaurant. The service is ALWAYS amazing. I am a regular customer and I've never been unsatisfied!!"}
{"text":"Happy to say. Our second time to this restaurant was a much improved experience. Better service and better food."}
{"text":"This was a very bad, negative experience. The service is horrendous. I was waited on by Jewel herself and she was rude and arrogant. Not at all welcoming. I will NEVER go back.
I wasted my money.  The food did not even come out as I ordered it.  I was so off put by the lack of friendliness that I just wanted to finish up and leave. 
This place is not at all what it represents it to be. it is NOT a little neighborhood caf√© by any means. The food is overpriced and served in a very odd way--making it totally unappealing. The food is greasy too which was a surprise.
More than anything, though, was the uppity attitude of the owner.  Really? I would suggest a little humbleness and a smile and a \"Thank you for coming in\" would go a long way.
As for me, I will not give it a second chance and am grateful that I can air my opinions on yelp.
BTW: the other employee there was very friendly. Jewel herself is the problem."}
{"text":"Had the French toast this morning. Avoid. Try something else. Look at all the 131 pics. Only 1 of the French toast. There's a reason for that. Dry thick tasteless bread, sparse melted cream, sparse buttery syrup. The syrup however is tasty and unique. My wife had the chicken and waffles, much better. I would still go back and just try something else."}
{"text":"Love this cute new place in our neighborhood!  Great atmosphere, friendly employees and great food.  We went for breakfast/brunch and would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I come here almost every week for GF DF brownies, they are incredible. Pumpkin muffins & peanut cookies are delicious too. We've eaten breakfast here before too, but it was slightly underwhelming. I will stick to the baked goods. I would also say, the cupcake batter tends to be an odd texture and i wouldn't recommend them."}
{"text":"Jewel's is my favorite breakfast, lunch, and sweet spot in the Valley. I've never ordered anything here that wasn't 100% amazing. The service is top-notch. The decor is inviting. If you haven't checked this place out, you're missing out."}
{"text":"We have eaten here quite a few times and tried mostly breakfast items. They have all been 5 star, but I am here to review the baked goods because OMG they are to die for. I got my 30th birthday cake made here and it was amazing! So moist and not too sweet. It weighed about 10-15 lbs and was worth every single penny. I always buy a package of biscuits when we come by and they are perfect!! This last time, I picked up a package of cookie dough and they are literally among the best chocolate chip cookies I have ever had!!  There have been many times that I have said to myself \"there is no way everything is gluten free\" but it is. Do yourself a favor and check it out. We also love the kale chips in the potatoes. I do wish they had some non-pork meat options though. That's the only thing I can think of that they can improve on.  Maybe some turkey bacon/sausage or even veggie burgers.  Be prepared to empty your wallet when you come here because everything from the coffee to the brownies is perfect!"}
{"text":"It's awesome!! Everything is delicious! Had a birthday cake made here and it was beautiful.. Can't go wrong with any of the desserts! Service is great!"}
{"text":"What can I say. I discovered this place last year when looking for gluten free chicken and waffles. I can literally say I flew across the country for this experience a 2nd time. Once you experience the gluten free chicken and waffles from here you will dream about them every night until you have them again. The cranberry white chocolate cookie was melt in your mouth amazing and the the brownie bar was indulgent and delicious. Do not miss out of this place. It's worth the trip 100%"}
{"text":"We are visiting here on vacation and since our whole family eats gluten free were happy to stumble on to Jewels. We had breakfast the first day and enjoyed the chorizo omelet, pancakes and breakfast sandwich. The second day we came back for lunch and had grilled cheese, a BLT and the buffalo chicken sandwiches all with fries. Both days we brought home baked goods including muffins, cookies, cupcakes and donuts to try. Everything was excellent and we'll definitely make this a regular stop when we're in Phoenix."}
{"text":"Love the food here. It's really nice to be able to have a great gluten free spot that other people who aren't gluten free still think is tasty. In addition to gluten free, I'm also dairy free and the servers are pretty informed about my options/ways to modify things, and if they don't know for sure they always ask.

One star off because I don't really like the physical location....very crowded, seats are not very comfortable for someone with back/neck problems like me unless you luck out and get a half booth, and it does not ever seem very clean to me."}
{"text":"Jewel's was our Go To GF place for breakfast. The service has always been mediocre, but the food made up for it. Not today. To start with, menus are kept at the register, so you stand there with people behind you quickly trying to make a decision while the unenthiusiastic cashier seems annoyed. I always get chicken and waffles, but my husband felt rushed.  We took our number to our table along with our coffee. They've done away with the raw sugar, so we used the white, but it did not improve upon the highly acidic coffee. We squeezed unto a wobbly table, trying not to spill coffee and juice and my food came about 10 minutes later. The food runner said my husband's pancakes would be right out. After 10 minutes I walked up to check on the missing pancakes. The runner looked annoyed and told me they'd be right out. Five minutes later he dropped off the pancakes. No explanation.  As I mentioned, the food usually makes up for the service. My waffles were gummy in the middle, as we're my husband's pancakes.  The chicken lacked the usual seasoning.  Sadly, I don't think we'll be back. At over $30 for breakfast for two, plus tip, it's no longer worth the drive."}
{"text":"Jewel's is this families new favorite breakfast stop in the hood! 
I was loving it because everything is made fresh daily but the boys loved it, well, because....it's DELISH!  The pancakes are a MUST!!! They make their own syrup which is to die for. I'm not sure what they do to their bacon to make it so good. French Toast....YUMM!! Potatoes....more please! 
I'm with the previous reviewer- skip the rat race at LGO and give Jewel's a try. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Took the hubby and adult kids to this crisp, fresh bakery/cafe. Hubby couldn't get over the bread and how great it tasted on his BLT sandwich and everyone's flatbread concoctions! He kept asking \"What is this made out of?\" We are not a GF family but we totally enjoyed our lunch. We asked the owner about franchising opportunities in our bases overseas in Tokyo, Bangkok and Ho Chi Min."}
{"text":"The people who were there are rude. The food is okay but way overpriced. I payed $26 for the same quality I could've gotten at IHOP for like $12. After giving them a second chance, never going back."}
{"text":"Just waited almost 30 minutes and paid $11 for the most underwhelming salad I've had. I ordered the southwest salad with chicken. The menu said it had shaved white cheddar, avocado and came in a tortilla bowl... all of these things were missing.  So, I basically ended up with romaine lettuce with some corn, black beans, unripe tomatoes and a few tortilla strips. To add to the disappointment, the few pieces of chicken that were on the salad were still pink and rubbery! I had to get back to work so the salad was to-go - otherwise, I would have said something while I was in the restaurant. I'm hoping this was just an off day for Jewel's because I used to really like this place :("}
{"text":"I haaaaaaate to write a poor review for Jewel's because I absolutely love their food, teas, and baked goods. The decor is adorable and welcoming and most of the staff is extremely friendly.  But I am just SO frustrated, over and over, at the same server, that I just have to express it. There is one male server that, when I see him at the counter now, I cringe just knowing deep in bones I'm going to get poor service. If it was just one instance, I could just chalk it up that this guy just had a bad day...but this has happened now, 4 weekends in a row and coming in 1-2 times that weekend. And i don't feel I am a difficult customer that that would be the reason why he's so terrible...I only order takeout, I always call ahead, I ALWAYS tip, I usually spend a fairly large amount and I'm typically quick, nice, and patient. So here are just a few of my experiences with this poor server:

- I'm allergic to dairy and eggs & see a random sign in the baked goods counter that says \"vegan\". So I ask which items are vegan...no joke, his response \"oh yeah, everything is vegan...for the most part\". Umm, \"for the most part\" isn't going to keep my throat from closing up. KNOW THE FOODS YOU SERVE. Thank god another knowledgable employee stepped in to answer and show me exactly which items I can eat, without pain. I'd at least have respect for the guy if he just said \" I don't know, let me find out\"

- Every time I come in & he is at the counter, it takes him forever to take my order...even if no one is in line? And I only ask for some pre made sweets from the counter, since my takeout order is ready bc I called in advance. 

- This last time i came in was the WORST.  I'm in a hurry, but wanted to surprise my bf for a couple pieces of pie and a tea for me.  No one was in line and this simple task should've only taken a few minutes. But not for this lazy guy...god forbid I interrupt your joking around to ask to spend money at your bakery & pay you a tip!  He even had another employee help by checking me out, yet he still took fooooorever & honestly, just rude. When I walked in, even though he saw me, he never acknowledged my presence, someone asked him to help and he still ignored it, I eventually had to just interrupt his convo, and he was purposely slow and lazy bc of that. I ask for the pies, and he eventually went to the back to get a new box of Togo containers, which would be completely fine. Except that he didn't realize I could see him through the swinging door, just laughing it up, leaning back and basically taking a break. 8 minutes later (yes, I timed it after I saw that), he comes back and instead of helping get out of there, he slowly starts to unload all the containers. And instead of cutting the pies with an actual knife, he uses a flimsy plastic knife, simply bc they were within reach...aaaaaand the knife kept breaking, so he kept reaching for more and more and running through at least 3-4 plastic knives!!! Just use a REAL serving knife?! Don't be SO lazy to not walk the extra two feet to reach it?! After this insanely long process, he then just puts the pies over the top of the counter without a thank you or even eye contact.  My hands are full and I ask for a bag, he ignores me, once again (not so shocking by now). I had to ask 3 more times and he is obvi annoyed that at me for putting him to such hard 'work'.  He eventually hands me a huge plastic bag where the pies just rumbled around and smeared all over the containers. And just to add insult to injury, after ALL of that, I open up the pies at home and his oh so efficient plastic knife skills gave me 1 suuuuuper tiny piece of pie AND the other was LITERALLY a half of a slice...just sliced horizontally across the middle. Like COME ON?! And I tipped you again?!

So to wrap this up, I'm sure the guy is a nice guy, he seems to get along and laugh with the other employees a lot. That's a nice quality to see, but just remember you're there to do a job. Joking around can take a pause to help your customers. His inefficient and complacent attitude just ruins the whole experience. I don't write this review to deter people to not try this restaurant, the food is truly amazing! That is why I gave 3 stars and not 1. But I wrote this review in hopes that either he may read it and learn to step up his game and how his lackadaisical attitude can effect more than just him...have respect for your bosses & their new startup restaurant. And if he never sees this, I'd hope that the owners/managers do and keep all their employees committed to good customer service.  Sadly, I will no longer be coming here...I would rather spend my hard earned money where it is appreciated."}
{"text":"I actually really like the food here at jewels unfortunately the three or four times I have been there they are slightly rude and not very friendly. For a place that looks so cute and neighborly they never act as if they are happy to serve me. This place could be a hotspot if there service was a little better!"}
{"text":"My recommended this place as it his favorite. Albeit I got a completely different experience the two times I've tried this place. First time, my coffee wasn't burnt and they didn't care to brew another cup for me. 2nd time, I was waiting in the register for minutes before anyone helped me."}
{"text":"I want to love this place because I love the idea of a gluten free bakery. The environment is beautifully designed, and the pastries are lovely. 

The staff is not very friendly, and it takes a long time for orders to come out. I ordered an iced coffee the other day, and it took over 15 minutes for the staff to put ice in a cup and pour the pre-made cold brew over the top. I was one of two customers in the establishment when this happened. I still have no idea why it took so long. 

I've eaten their salads, which are alright, but again, it takes a very long time for the team to prepare a simple cesar. 

I wish this place had better customer service and exicution of orders, it's so close to my work that I would love to eat here all the time, but I've yet to have an experience that would make me want to return.

I'm excited to see they are now open for dinner! I hope when I return for a dinner service that my experience will be better."}
{"text":"I would describe our experience here as \"meh.\" It was confusing when we walked in as a party of 4. There were several table available, but all of them were dirty? We found someone who was more than happy to clean one for us, but then we couldn't find a menu? Once we did find a menu, we all picked out what we wanted... Then to discover that they were out of half the menu. No lie, every item I asked for was gone, even a smoothie. How do you run out of smoothie? There was basically nothing available but egg entrees (which I can't have), and sugary pastries.  I settled on a granola parfait which was good, but it's hard to mess up granola, let's be honest. I was excited for tasty healthy food, but apparently you have to arrive well before noon to get that (we arrived at 12:30).

Once our food arrived (which took more than half an hour for granola, an omelette, and 2 thai flatbreads?), the omelette that one of our party ordered was fantastic, but the Thai flatbread was just ok, and the granola was good because it's granola. We had high hopes, but we're left disappointed by this place. In Arcadia, where consumers have no lack of choice, you have to step up your game. Maybe we were there on an off day? But with all the 4 and 5 star reviews we were ultimately left disappointed."}
{"text":"I would have really like to give this place a higher rating. The food is good but not worth the terrible service. When you drive all the way across town for a gluten free donut and they tell you it will be a 10 minute wait and then you leave 40 minutes later without donuts. They really need to figure out how to get it together here. Next time, I will gladly spend my money at Nami instead. Sorry Jewels, I won't be back."}
{"text":"It's worth a visit. The place is cute. Has good customer service. Plenty of seating. 
Everything is on the $$$$ side. $5 for a 12oz pumpkin latte. $3 for a mini cupcake.
I had a yelp check-in for free cookie, which tasted great but it's dry and crunchy. I don't like crunchy cookies. 

I probably won't be a regular here. I might return if I'm in the area and is craving some immediate sweets."}
{"text":"I waited 45 mins for a grilled cheese sandwich.  Never again. I've been there on two other occasions and same service... Very disappointed.  I had high hopes for Jewels Bakery since I live in the neighborhood.  The food is good however the wait and customer service is not worth the cost."}
{"text":"LOVE LOVE LOVE ....the flavors
A regular go to for our family and my friends
My son loves the chicken and waffles
My grandsons love the pancakes
I love all the salad options
Love the staff"}
{"text":"The entire menu is gluten free and delicious. I've had the biscuits and gravy and the fried chicken and waffles and even my non gluten free companions enjoy eating here.

I don't live here locally, but would definitely make it a point to come here for breakfast whenever I'm in town. 

They have outdoor seating, friendly staff, a range of offerings on their menu, and the service was pretty quick. 

Love this place! If you're gluten free and a lover a breakfast you can't go wrong here."}
{"text":"Everything is gluten free. Everything. 

We usually stop in for breakfast and my favorites are the breakfast sandwich or the Belgian waffle. I haven't had lunch yet, but look forward to trying some of the options they have that someone with celiac would never dream of getting at a restaurant, like grilled cheese! 

Even my non-gluten-free eating husband happily obliges and even suggests going here. :)"}
{"text":"Amazing for brunch. Only harm is that they close early. I tried their fruit plate and chicken with waffles. EEverything was do e ad healthy as possible. Even the waffles and chicken were as healthy as they get. Incredible. And the fruit plate was fresh. Tad on the expensive side for brunch but worth it"}
{"text":"There are few places I can go and eat gluten free food where I don't want to skip a meal. This place, however, is most excitingly exceptional. My wife and kids eat gluten free and it's really hard to agree on a place we like. We typically do Sunday Brunch/Lunch at Jewels, and it's great! The Chicken and Waffles is killer! I'm so glad this restaurant exists."}
{"text":"I do love Jewel's! I love the food! And it is safe for Celiacs. The cauliflower wings are a gift from heaven! But I must say the atmosphere has changed and yes smiles are certainly at a minimum and service has declined which I noticed last time as well. No names. But the baked goods and menu items are all amazing so I'll make my own happy!"}
{"text":"Save your money.  Go to Matt's Big Breakfast or First Watch or Acacia.  Looking for a new breakfast spot closer to our new home.  Slightly busy when we walked in. 3-4 tables still open.  Ordered two orders of pancakes -- one plain, one with blueberry compote.  25 minutes later the lukewarm plain order of pancakes came out.  Server said the other order would be out soon, waited a couple minutes but they were already getting cold.  Ate my lukewarm pancakes with half a packet of butter (seriously it was a small scoop in one of those plastic containers used for to go salsa!). Three bites left and he bring the other order of pancakes.  Less than a dozen blueberries rolling in the plate.  Apologized and said another server took our order of blueberry pancakes and they had to make another. They looked like they had been sitting on a tray. No steam coming off as if they had just been freshly made. Maybe he just screwed up the order.   Who knows.  Whatever it was we'll not be going back.   Too bad.  We like our breakfasts at neighborhood restaurants on weekend mornings."}
{"text":"This sweet little restaurant would almost do better if people ordered at the counter and had pagers for when the food is ready. They could solve the service and staffing issue and just focus on serving their yummy food. Go here, it's worth the wait."}
{"text":"I'm not sure if the food is not 100% gluten free or just plain dirty but I get sick every time I eat here 
I've seen cakes in the case for OVER A WEEK. I'm not exaggerating but they are extremely old desserts and the food is just cooked in very dirty grease"}
{"text":"This place is phenomenal!! EVERYTHING is gluten free here! Biscuits and gravy! Chicken and waffle !!!! I think I just died and went to heaven! The donut are probably the best thing I've had in my gluten free life! This place is a MUST!"}
{"text":"I went into this establishment this morning with a coworker to grab some breakfast before work. And as I walked in I noticed everyone behind the counter seemed to have an attitude. I ordered the biscuit and gravy platter with eggs and the cashier didn't make it with eggs we noticed while we were paying so he rang up the eggs separately. The eggs came out way before any of the other food so they were cold by the time the rest of the food came out. my friend asked if there was syrup and butter in the bag and the gentleman stated yes but then when we got to work there was no syrup or butter. My overall experience of this place was poor the food was mediocre at best. I will not be back."}
{"text":"This is by far the CUTEST birthday cake I have ever had GF or not. My sister ordered it for me and sent a picture for reference, It was identical! Last year I also got my birthday cake from Jewel's, it was red velvet with cream cheese which is phenomenal and the only cake flavor of theirs I've tried. So when I saw my sister ordered vanilla with buttercream I was nervous it wasn't going to be as good. If its possible it may have been even better! Thank you so much to whoever decorated this cake for me. It seems trivial and silly but this cake truly did bring me joy. It gave me a birthday where I didn't think about celiac or missing my old life and for that I am so thankful!"}
{"text":"I stopped by Jewel's Bakery and Cafe for a late breakfast today and left with extremely mixed feelings. The food was really wonderful! I'm not a regular gluten-free eater and wasn't even aware that it was their \"edge\" until after I'd demolished their breakfast platter, which included a great pancake with some of the best syrup I've ever had.
However, the staff was pretty terrible. The cashier was apathetic and rude, to the point where I felt uncomfortable. The chef made his way around the restaurant asking people about their meals but ignored our table completely. I'm pretty bewildered by this, but my best guess is because we're in our young twenties. But the joke is on you Chef Brad, because I'm writing my first ever yelp review about your poor service.
I might be back because the food was so good and reasonably priced, but I'm really put off by my service experience. I'd recommend take out, if you're willing to offer your patronage."}
{"text":"The Gluten Free menu is awesome, in which they offer a variety of food. What I appreciated the most was the notice of detail and ample size portions. However I've been dissatisfied with the service, this has been an ongoing issue in my 5 encounters with the cafe. As a paying customer it is reasonable to expect a greeting and some type of gratitude for my service. I'm appalled at the poor attitude I've received and would even go further and suspect it is a race issue seeing as though my husband has gone through the same thing on a separate encounter. This feedback is coming from someone who has worked as an Executive in Hospitality for over 26 years. Please coach your staff/managers on the importance of quality service, food can not be only the deciding factor for the title of \"Best\"."}
{"text":"Hey for a gluten free restaurant, we were not at all disappointed, in fact very happy to find this on our trip to Phoenix. Staff was very friendly, the food was tasty and priced rather reasonably.  We stopped in for breakfast on our last day in town before heading to the airport. It was a nice relaxed breakfast and we even came away with a fun gluten free pun-filled t-shirt and a canister of cactus green tea. If you are looking for gluten free, no questions, Jewel's is a good choice."}
{"text":"$200+ worth of disappointment. Emailed w/Julie from Jewels over 1 month in advance, regarding GF order for a baby shower. I would need cupcakes, macaroons and also inquired about cake pops- I included a photo of the cake pops I was hoping to acquire. The pops were to be party favors for shower guests. Was told via email that all could be done- emails from Julie were brief and some questions left unanswered- but I didn't think it was that big of a deal. I went in to Jewels to place the order and pay, 1 week ahead of the party. The woman I spoke with was entirely unfriendly, even when I complimented how much my friends (whom the baby shower was for) loved her bakery due to Celiac dietary needs. No gratitude, no smile, no nothing during the entire interaction. I then told her I was looking for cake pops and received sighs, eye rolls, and verbal grief because \"making cake pops is just SUCH a headache\"... OK, well then Julie should NOT have stated they were an option!!! It is a bakery's prerogative to not offer a service for any reason- but don't tell me you can do something then make me feel guilty when I show up to order it, just because it's \"a headache\" for you- especially when I am paying you $70 for said request. I offered to remove the pops from the order and get them elsewhere, but she reluctantly insisted they could accommodate the request, including the custom design for the party theme- and asked me to leave the printout of how I wanted them to look (which I did). I paid $211 (cost plus an undeserved tip- stupid me) for 24 cupcakes, 20 macaroons and 20 cake pops- and I left the store feeling that there was zero gratitude for my business.

Fast-forward to the day of the party. Order was ready on time- great! When I opened the box containing the cake pops, I found they were not even remotely close to what I had ordered. For starters, they were poorly packaged (just set in a box, not individually-wrapped or secured in any way), and over HALF of the pops were broken- off of the sticks, cracked- and most of the faces were smeared, broken, or fell off of the pop altogether. I had to spend time repairing/reassembling the cake pops, individually wrapping, and doing what I could to salvage them for the party that was about to take place. It wasted my time, they were not the look or quality I expected, and they were not worth $70 or the attitude I received about them from the beginning in the bakery. I will say that the cupcakes and macaroon were good, as GF baked goods are not the easiest feat- and that is all that is earning Jewels the two stars this review has. We will not be back to this bakery- which disappoints me as I'd had high hopes. The ungratefulness and crappy attitude is really what did it for me, even more than how poorly the pops came out- at least they provided comedic relief after the party."}
{"text":"I had read about this all gluten free restaurant and was not disappointed. I had the egg sandwich and it was delicious. The prices are reasonable and I felt confident that I wouldn't get sick eating here. The cafe was adorable and not at all busy on a Thursday morning."}
{"text":"My mom and I stopped by here on a road trip. Had the hot chai latte with almond milk! Very delicious, had just the right amount of sweetness for me. We also got the ham and cheese omelette with potatoes. My mom loved the potatoes, thought they were the best potatoes she's ever eaten. The ladies at the cafe were all very sweet. Great place to have a meal!"}
{"text":"Went in for my husbands birthday breakfast this morning. We have driven by Jewels many times and had never been previously- we also had NO IDEA it was 100% gluten free. We are fortunate enough not to suffer from any allergies and rarely eat any bread or pastry product that is GF. We ordered the biscuits and gravy and the breakfast sandwich both came with breakfast potatoes. The hubby said the biscuits were an unusual texture and just ok. I likewise didn't care for the texture of my bread, dry and crumbly.. But I could tell the other ingredients in my sandwich were good quality. I ended up ditching the bread and only eating the insides but the potatoes were yummy! We also both had lattes and the almond mocha was crazy good! I think we will go give it a try again, for sure for a cute little hideout to enjoy a morning coffee! If we had known it is GF, We would likely have chosen items less bread based!"}
{"text":"Food = 5 stars
Customer Service = 1 or 2 stars

The food is amazing. I've tried the chicken & waffles, vegan tacos, french fries, caramel salted cupcake, rocky road brownie, lemon bar, and biscuits & gravy. The last one wasn't as amazing as the rest (the gravy was a bit bland & runny, and the biscuit was flat and not fluffy). Everything else I mentioned though - SO DANG GOOD. 

Service though... sucks. There's one lady there (black short hair, bangs, glasses) that has taken our order a couple times and she never says anything, never smiles, never greets anyone at the register, never does anything but reads off the total. It's very off putting and uncomfortable, especially when this happened our very first visit. The ONLY reason we go back is the food."}
{"text":"Searched for bakery close by for my son's Birthday party and found this place. I was so impressed with their cupcakes that we tried! I literally got goosebumps from how good their Caramel Macchiato Cupcake was! That one was my favorite. Also super yummy was their Carrot Cake Cupcake. Love the frosting on that one and the caramel macchiato. All their cupcakes were perfectly moist and also best cupcakes I have ever had! Can't wait to order my son's cake or cupcakes (haven't decided yet) and also try more things off their menu. To be continued....."}
{"text":"Food is good but the poor service, both times I've visited, deters me from trying it again."}
{"text":"I came for lunch and ordered the Philly Cheesesteak. I wouldn't order it again, it didn't have any flavor and the bun it was served was dry, yet spongy. 

My friend had the BBQ pork sandwich. That was actually amazing. I'd come back for that.

Make sure you check the menu on the register counter-- they told us they're working on updating the menu/experimenting with some things. 

Their baked goodies do look good, so I'll give it another shot (free with Yelp check-in!)."}
{"text":"The food is very good. The texture and taste of their pastry is amazing and all gluten free.  I shared the 2 different macaroon I bought. We thought they were the best macaroon we have ever had. It was a pleasure to find this cafe in my neighborhood. I went during their new later hours and still found plenty of goodies to choose from."}
{"text":"Love their food and prices!!  As a vegan I am happy to find several choices including the baked goods.  I am not gluten avoidant but for those that are, this is a great place.  The staff works hard to accommodate us (with a scooter) and to deliver the yummy food.  I am crazy about their vegetarian/vegan taco!  They care about their food and about their customers..what else can you ask for?"}
{"text":"Jewel's Bakery is SO GOOD. The chicken waffles is what I always get you need to try it. Even if you're not gluten free you should try it because is THAT good. I'm obsessed. Get a side of ranch and dip the chicken in it. A little expensive but totally worth it!!!"}
{"text":"It's so wonderful to have a restaurant that is completely gluten free.  The food is amazing and the baked good are to die for. You would never know it was gluten free.
I also had then make my wedding cake. It's was beautiful and tasted like a regular cake. Every one at the reception loved the cake. I would definitely recommend them as the go to bakery for gluten free items."}
{"text":"The food is fantastic. I LOVE the AZ omelette and chicken and waffles. Plus, the cinnamon and sugar donuts are to die for!

I really want this to be my regular go-to spot. However, there are just several issues that make me want to order out rather than linger over a coffee or bakery item. 

While the service is friendly, it lacks training; for example:

I shouldn't have to flag the waiter down for a spoon, if I've said yes to cream and sugar in my coffee. I shouldn't have to stir it with a fork because I can't get anyone's attention and it's getting cold. Every time I have to remember to ask for a spoon. 

The waiter might also offer a refill on coffee or come by and ask how everything is. The man that offers water is on top of refills! You might also ask him go around with a coffee carafe. 

If I ask for salt and pepper, putting them together in a solo cup means I have to sprinkle your mix on my food, which means it gets over salted. 

If I ask for toast, you might offer jelly if you're not going to put it on the plate automatically. 

Little things that you can anticipate a guest requesting and offering before they have to ask make a big difference. 

Otherwise, it's just too many cut corners that means I'd rather not deal with the peculiarities of your service."}
{"text":"The baked goods here are some of the best gluten free treats I've had!  I wish there was a location in Los Angeles!  They lost a star because I have a nut allergy, and neither of the guys behind the counter knew what was in what I was trying to order.  They went and checked only after I made a clear point that I couldn't order or eat until I knew that the food was safe.  I ended up getting a breaded chicken sandwich that was fantastic and their fries were great too! Excellent food! I plan to go back anytime I'm in town."}
{"text":"The service was so poor that I never even made it to the point of tasting the food. I stood in line behind a man for 15 minutes while nobody helped him at the register. There were 3 women behind the counter and nobody bothered to help the customers at the register. I didn't stay longer than 15 minutes to find out why they were so incompetent. Really sad that the service was so poor because I had heard great things about the food."}
{"text":"I have been gluten free for a couple of years and I thought my days of going out for some chicken and waffles were over.  What a great surprise to get a fluffy Belgian with fried chicken pieces - hot and delicious. And the honey and chiracha sauces served with it gave just enough of that sweet and/or spicy.  Didn't have room for a pastry but will be sure to go back and try a couple - they looked awesome.  The place was busy, the food came out in a timely manner, plates were dressed well and, most importantly - it was delicious."}
{"text":"Jewel's Bakery is surprisingly amazing. I was looking for gluten-free options thinking I would pick up a small pastry, but ended up eating the French Toast on the breakfast menu. It was not a traditional French Toast with generic sliced bread, but almost a cinnamon roll type consistency that was small and satisfying. And whatever syrup they give you is absolutely the best syrup you've ever tasted. Add in some slightly browned potatoes and nicely cooked bacon, and you've got one of the most satisfying breakfasts I've had in a long time in Phoenix.

Be prepared to wait for your food. It seems like quality is preferred over quickness here. And let's be honest if you're out to breakfast why not enjoy the experience for as long as possible.

The Pumpkin Spiced Latte was excellent as well. Homemade syrup that was flavorful without seeming chemically. 

If you're in the area skip LGO and head to Jewel's Bakery instead!"}
{"text":"Having a long list of food allergies, this place is truly amazing! And my boyfriend, who has no allergies, confirmed that this place tastes amazing! It doesn't have that typical gluten free grainy-ness. The waffles and pancakes are so moist and fluffy. He even asked me \"are we sure all this is gluten free, it taste to good to be gluten free\" 
Will definitely be coming back! 
Weather you have food allergies or not, it is worth a try. And the price isn't bad at all, typical gluten free places are way more. The prices were pretty average. 
Oh and I can't forget about the coffee, which was one of the best coffees I've had here in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"I have been enjoying Jewel's gluten free baked goods for the past few years. Now that there is a store front, I can also enjoy their fresh cooked gluten free meals. I haven't had biscuits and gravy in the last 5 years since being on a very strict GF diet. This morning I got an order to go when picking up cupcakes for a party. Let me tell you that it was love at first bite! It was a perfect blend of sausage gravy with a delicious biscuit and when some of the potato hash got mixed in, well, I couldn't have wiped the smile of my face for any reason. 

I really don't know what I will do next time I'm there for breakfast. Get the B&G or try anything else on the 100% GF menu. Either way, this is my new favorite place to share with all my non-gluten free people. Even though it's a 40 minute drive from my side of town, it's worth it."}
{"text":"UGH I reeeeeeaaaally want to like this place but the service is HORRENDOUS. Staff not rude, just very inattentive. I ordered an Iced Tea that never came, with FOUR people in the place. I tried to flag a waitress, two other people looked at me but no one helped. We had to almost beg for the check, and not one \"hey I'm sorry I forgot your tea\" or \" hey I know you've been sitting here for 30 minutes done with your food but I'm way too busy to bring your bill\" :(. The food is good, but service is key with restaurants. I wish the owners would read the multiple reviews with bad service. I'll skip it next time."}
{"text":"Great bakery and cafe! You wouldn't even know it's gluten free I promise! Servers are really friendly and jewels the owner is really sweet. The flax bread is a must!"}
{"text":"This place was AH-mazing!!! For someone who has celiac and has a hard time finding good gluten free food, it was delicious! I got the classic breakfast platter and substituted the pancake for a waffle. The husband got the biscuit and gravy. We both enjoyed our meal very much! The customer service was fast and friendly. They were also very helpful, as it was our first time. Definitely will be going back :)"}
{"text":"I really enjoyed our first visit to jewels for a late brunch today! Our waiter was friendly and helpful. I had the spud plate and my husband had the biscuits and gravy with chorizo. On my first bite, I literally swore out loud. It was that good."}
{"text":"I really love this place! Their food is exceptional! I have always picked up food to go from Jewel's, so I cannot speak on behalf of their in-house service, but the food to-go is always great!

Definitely try the Chicken and Waffles. They have a Honey Siracha syrup that is AMAZING. I would definitely recommend to anyone visiting Phoenix."}
{"text":"I've tried Jewel's now 4 different times, months apart, hoping it would improve. When you must be gluten free, sometimes you long for a delicious doughnut or cupcake. You won't be getting a delicious one here. I can only speak to the pastries, but they are flavorless. Cupcakes are always dry and the frosting is like biting into shortening, though I think shortening might have more flavor. 

How you can ruin a vanilla cupcake, I just don't know. Jewel's was able to do it-no vanilla flavor coming through in the cake or the frosting. Maple pecan scone? I did detect a faint amount of maple flavor in the bit of icing on top, but otherwise it was a gigantic blob of a tasteless, dry biscuit. Raspberry fritter? Tasted like a deep fried yeast ball, though the glaze was similar to a regular fritter. 

I really was hopeful that there would be flavor this last time, but alas, none. I even bought 4 different pastries yesterday, surely one of them would be moist and flavorful? Nope, not one."}
{"text":"It's all gluten free!!!! You've win my heart with Cartel coffee and a finger vanilla cupcake :)"}
{"text":"Great spot if you have gluten-free needs!!!! The food is delicious and there are so many choices, which is not typical of most bakeries. Gluten-free food is often times very dry, however the pastries from here are not. They are soft and moist. I love this place!!!!"}
{"text":"I like this place so much. I have a very limited diet being type 1 diabetic with celiacs and being lactose intolerant and having GERD as well which leaves me to eat mostly fruits, veggies, and potatoes or GF breads if I want carbs. I can eat mostly everything here! Sometimes I'll get a belly ache but it could be the dairy in something I ate that I didn't know was in there. I wish it was open later in the day so I can stop by here on my way from work."}
{"text":"Breakfast and lunch are great and the price isn't bad. It's difficult to trust most places aren't contaminating the food accidentally or carelessly with gluten so I really love that I don't have to worry here. The patio is charming. The baked goods are great quality and the coffee and teas are good too. The line always goes quickly and the wait for food is quick as well. Customer service is spot on. Definitely my favorite brunch spot!"}
{"text":"This is the first place I've been whose food was so good it promoted me to write a Yelp review. Guess I'm a Yelper now.. Their entire place is gluten free and their staff has clearly been trained at a high level. I worked in the restaurant industry for 3.5 years at an upper echelon restaurant, let me be the first to say: Jewel's food is amazing. The decor is fresh and relaxing. My only complain is that there aren't more people filling the tables that all have fresh flowers and all unique chairs. Six stars if I could. My gluten sensitivity needs have been met."}
{"text":"The food is excellent.  For dining in, though, the portion size for the pancakes is way too small for an adult.  Granted, they charge only $7 for two pancakes but they are tiny pancakes. Also, the men's room looks like it does not get cleaned enough.  Dried poop stuck to the toilet, pee all over the floor around the toilet.  Jewel's: I know you're busy but seriously have your staff pay more frequent attention to keeping the bathroom clean."}
{"text":"I called and ordered my wife a 10\" cake. They were able to put a very cool Batman guy on it for her 35th! 
The fruit was amazing in the middle. We are big into Crossfit and the people at the party loved the cake to. It was gluten and soy free!  I would highly recommend this Bakery. Everything was perfect from the customer service, picking the cake up, and the taste!!! Keep up the good baking ladies!!"}
{"text":"Great food, a little pricey but worth it for the quality! Love that everything is gluten free!!"}
{"text":"The food and teas are delicious. The employees are also very friendly and helpful. I've had the roasted veggie sandwich and it was really good! The reason I give this place 3 stars is because of the price of the food, so I can't say that I'm a fan. I work in the offices above Jewel's and most of my coworkers agree that the food is a bit overpriced for the amount that you get. The roasted veggie, for example, is $7 and it's not very big... then they charge an extra $2 for a very small amount of fries. Also, during the lunch rush it takes a while to get your food. I find myself considering Jewel's if I'm too lazy to drive somewhere for lunch, but I usually talk myself out of it and either I don't eat, or I'll drive to Bertha's. I'd probably be a bigger fan if I had a gluten intolerance, but I don't. SO if you must have Gluten Free or you're not a cheap ass like me, then you'd probably give this place 5 stars."}
{"text":"For so long, there was no place that specialized in gluten-free, much less *delicious* gluten free. Well, wait no more, Jewels is it!

The menu is eclectic, but delicious. The bakery case is heaven. This is a fave for my gluten free and gluten loving friends alike.

They just added a hostess which helps differentiate those there to eat and those there to pick up bakery or frozen items and generally just makes the whole experience better all around. 

The patio is small but dog friendly, which is great. 

Jewel's is also a supporter of local small businesses, which I love (who doesn't love Cartel coffee)."}
{"text":"Great breakfast, but the star attraction are the amazing gluten free baked goods. Perfect raised donuts, cinnamon rolls, cupcakes & more. A full spectrum bakery as good as any bakery."}
{"text":"I'm excited that a gluten free restaurant/bakery is in my neighborhood and has easy parking. The menu looks great and the food plates I saw looked amazing. I've only been there three times. Twice to meet a friend for coffee and once to get take out pastries which were amazing.

The actual experience was not so great. Since it is a new place, the staff should be a little more inviting. When you walk in the door for the first time, it's hard to tell if you are to seat yourself and a server comes over or if you are to get in line (and which side of the counter because there were people on both sides and cutting in front of people in the other line). The three times I went there were no greetings or acknowledgement from the staff-even if they saw us come in. I thought that was a little rude. Not a good first, second or third impression for a business that just opened in a community.

I will have to try the food sometime when they have had a chance to get their staff trained on common courtesy and customer service. 

I always hate it when I either go to a place and love the food, but the experience was bad or if I hate the food, but the staff, experience and decor is cool."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best gluten free food I've ever eaten in my life. Belgian waffle and quiche will be in my dreams. Met the owner at breakfast today. Very welcoming and warm atmosphere."}
{"text":"This place is great for even non-gluten free people! I have been a loyal customer for over 4 years and the food and pastries have always stayed consistently AMAZING!!! The staff is always welcoming and takes great care of me. I brought my co-workers recently, and they all raved about it!"}
{"text":"Absolutely love this little gem, Jewel!!!

Gluten free + an added bonus of a 2nd plant based menu...

Whether it's Chicken & Waffles, or Beef Stroganoff or the Lemon Bar or Salted Caramel Brownie to name just a couple tasty delights... You seriously cannot go wrong by stopping in to eat here whether it's breakfast, lunch, dinner or snack to go!!!

I'd love to open up a few of these restaurants myself in other states!

Delicious"}
{"text":"I went to this place because it is gluten-free because my cousin was visiting who is very seriously gluten-free because of celiac disease. Met the owner,  she told us the whole restaurant is 100% gluten-free,  so no cross contamination!  He hadn't had a donut in years and was thrilled to have one! I tried a waffle,  skeptically,  it was delicious!  It was a little bit more spongy than a regular waffle,  but no big deal, I liked it! Everything was yummy, the hot chocolate was very tasty!! She sells bags of her flour,  pancake mix, brownie mix and more to take home, very cool! It has been only open for breakfast and lunch but now expanding to Thur, Fri and Sat night for dinner.  It is small, in the end of a s hoping center. You order at the counter find a seat and they bring the food to you.
They also offer cooking classes!!
I will definitely go back!"}
{"text":"So happy to have found vegan cupcakes conveniently near me. I love the creative flavor combos. I bought them for a work meeting and forgot to tell everyone they were gluten free, everyone was SO surprised to find out! They were so delicious.  I also grabbed myself an iced latte which was great too."}
{"text":"The great thing is everything is gf. I got the biscuits and gravy. If you have had one gf biscuit you've had them all they are good though, the gravy is great and I highly recommend. We also got the chicken and waffles they are great. Waffles are soft chicken is seasoned well. They give you siracha honey and buttermilk maple syrup. Both are very good however I just prefer maple with my chicken and waffles. If you have to eat gluten free come here I don't but my wife does and it's real nice you can eat anything with no substitute"}
{"text":"My husband and I love Jewels. The food is amazing, you would never guess it was GF. I love that they now serve their breakfast menu all day. I had the breakfast platter with sausage today, the sausage was yummy."}
{"text":"Wow! The basic breakfast was amazing. I got mine without egg and they threw in extra bacon. I'm not a huge pancake person but they were light and fluffy and the syrup.......the syrup..... AMAZING!!! Very thin and vanilla flavored. It was almost like liquid whipped cream.
The bacon was thick and well done, how I like it and the potatoes were crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Perfect!
I'm just upset they are next to my yoga studio, I'm literally going to gain 10lbs now that I have found this place."}
{"text":"I don't know how to praise this place properly; I don't think I could find the words. Today is my daughters 6th birthday and all she wanted were waffles, but she has so many dietary restrictions. They not only accommodated all of her restrictions, but they also made her feel special. The service was above and beyond and the food was to die for!! We will definitely be back and would recommend this place to anyone and everyone!!"}
{"text":"Love!! Best Gluten Free food anywhere!! 
I eat here several times a week .. so good & worry free!!"}
{"text":"********STOLEN WALLETT*****My fiance and I went to jewels for breakfast and a few hrs later we couldn't find his wallet so when we called to see if he left his wallet on the table and the owner said no but there was one other person to ask that just went on BREAK, she said she would ask him when he got back.  After tearing our house apart and the vehicle we drove there we went back to the restaurant to check if the guy was back from BREAK... This man said no he didn't find a wallet and took our number down and said he would call if it turns up.  We then decided to check one last time in the parking lot and the stores next to jewels and two men from a store next door was eating on the patio the same time we were and said they saw that we left the wallet on the table and gave it to the employee WHO SAID HE DID NOT find a lost Wallet.  he straight up lied to our faces.... This is very disappointing considering both my fiance and I have worked in restaurant and bar industry for many years and would never even think of stealing someone's belongings
 Sincerely, 
A VERY DISSATISFIED CUSTOMER"}
{"text":"My husband and I were so excited to find this place on our anniversary weekend.  When you are gluten free it doesn't get much better than going out to eat and getting to pick anything off the menu.  ANYTHING!!!"}
{"text":"Delicious food, slowest service!  Took us over an hour to get our lunch, after we waited over 20 minutes to place our order.  We never saw our initial waiter again after he took our order.  We saw 4 employees in random roles, and all were friendly, pleasant, and gracious.  However, we had to stop any of them to ask about our orders; when my latte came, it was barely warm; my friend never got her coffee refill.  Lunch items were tasty.  I would never go back but for the freedom of ordering \"normal\" dishes that are gluten free.  Please, Jewels, get some organized help!"}
{"text":"I work right by this place and have gone in several different times and days and everytime I have had the worst service. They either get my order wrong or the person behind the counter is super rude. I always want to support local businesses but I can no longer support this place."}
{"text":"Just discovered this place a couple weeks back and it's a little piece of gluten-free heaven for me. I was diagnosed with celiac about six months ago and have been struggling to find food that tastes like food. This please was a awesome fine for me. The food was delicious and there was not one item I had I did not like. Unfortunately when I went back they were closed due to plumbing issues but I hope they open up soon. This place is definitely on my top five list. It is worth the 30 minute drive to get there!"}
{"text":"Went for Saturday morning brunch, and was blown away.  The chorizo, scrambled eggs and potatoes were delicious and the portion was very generous.  Also had a bacon-topped donut which was delicious, almost like a crumb cake.  The biscuits were very good as well, couldn't believe everything was gluten-free.  On top of all that, they serve Cartel coffee!  This is immediately my favorite breakfast place in Phoenix."}
{"text":"The food here is not the issue, it's the service, and the care if you have any issues other than gluten.  I have kids with gluten and dairy allergies and it is nice to support a business started by a mom because her child experienced similar woes.  It means she cares.  Which I think she does (so that is the reason for two stars -one for food and one for her).  Unfortunately some of her staff could not care less.  Last visit here they served my allergic son cheese - and it was worse than just an accident since the cheese was only where they had been unsuccessful pulling it off - oops let's just half pick it off and serve to this kid despite the huge allergy warning on the order.  Awesome.  Remake it!!  Fortunately after showing the waitress the significant amount of cheddar left behind, they took it off the bill so we did not feel so bad about cutting half of the omelet off to avoid disaster.  So we forgave the error - that was foolishness.  It was also before we encountered angry cashier.  Oh my gosh the amount of rudeness in this woman is unfit for anyone in customer service.  We tried to use a coupon for 15%.  She tells us it is only for dine in.  I look and it does not say that.  So she becomes angry.  Oh so angry.  Asks the owner then insists she's right.  I would have been fine with it if she would have accepted for a second that it was their error - maybe apologized and acknowledged why we felt we should be able to use it on our $40 muffins (that would be for 6 and drinks - expensive for a side of attitude).  No...angry cashier does not treat people like customers - or even people - she is angry after all.  After we were berated by angry cashier the owner did acknowledge there was nothing on the receipt to limit the use.  However at that point we  were fine paying the full amount for the privilege of leaving -- as I was pretty sure angry cashier was about to burst out horns, a spiked tail and fly.  We will NEVER ever be back.  We will buy our $40 muffins elsewhere (which is a shame as this is right by our every Saturday morning sports field).  Heck, I will gladly just cook for my own to avoid angry cashier and the don't-give-a-crap about your kids' allergy cooks.  Happily."}
{"text":"3.5 stars. Tried Jewel's on the 4th of July as it was one of the few places open in the area. My celiac hubby was thrilled to be able to have chicken & waffles for the first time in ages, and the pure joy on his face was worth the trip, but I was less thrilled with the service. I had to look around for a couple minutes and actually interrupt a woman ordering at the counter in order to grab a menu, because it isn't posted on the wall. 

When I mentioned it was our first time here, the waitress just kind of stared at me - it would have been nice to have been guided through the menu a bit or been offered suggestions such as daily specials or house favorites. 

Due to the uniqueness of their GF menu, we'll certainly give it another go. I understand that organic and gf ingredients necessitate a higher cost, but I'd love to see improved service and experience as well."}
{"text":"LOVE the fact that this ENTIRE restaurant is GLUTEN FREE!  I walked in the door and I was greeted by a glass case of delicious desserts and just before the drool ran down my cheek the cashier asked me what I liked...I let out a sigh and said \"so what are your gluten free options\"? \"EVERYTHING!\" she said.  My day was made.  I enjoyed a ridiculously fantastic chicken & waffles.  I bought a bag of flour AND pancake/waffle mix.  Got pulled over in the airport by TSA for the questionable items into suitcase (just flour!).  But it was an amazing experience.  YAY for Jewels!"}
{"text":"Be careful, they got rated a D by the health inspector. https://envapp.maricopa.gov/EnvironmentalHealth/FoodInspection?p=FD-32530&i=4044096"}
{"text":"I come here for breakfast a lot and everything is excellent as is the customer service.  However, I came in the first time for lunch today and had the salmon sandwich.   There's only one word to describe how great it was - THUNDERBITCHIN!!!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite place to eat when in the area.  The waitresses are all great.  Ashlee tends to serve me the most and has been so good every time.  It good food for anyone but great to not have to worry about cross contamination for those of us with celiac."}
{"text":"This was our first time eating here. It was highly recommended by a family member. 
The wait was a bit long but worth it. 
My wife had the chicken and waffles and I had the curry chicken salad sandwich. I'm now a gluten free bread lover. The sauce that came with the chicken and waffles was the bomb. All and all it was a great experience. (Try the peanut butter cookie)"}
{"text":"AMAZING gluten free waffles! I Didn't like the green chile cornbread bbq waffle as well as I'd hoped,  but my husband had the waffle with strawberries and it was phenomenal!! (The syrup is the best too.) Very good coffee as well. It's a but pricey but fresh and yummy!! Worth the drive in!!"}
{"text":"Best for gluten free and celiac sufferers. The entire cafe is gluten free. Awesome food and good prices. Waffles and fried chicken is excellent (minus the kale chips which I hate), as is the club sandwich and Ceasar salad. Biscuits and gravy,  berry salad,  California club sandwich,  eggs breakfast.... All of these are excellent. Great desserts with tons to choose from. My wife hadn't had biscuits in years until we came here. Not the fastest because they make it by hand. Nice staff. Indoor and outdoor seating. We come here often! !"}
{"text":"Great gluten free food (Celiac friendly) at decent prices. Service can be slow as well but the great tasting breakfast and lunch items are worth it."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner tonight at Jewel's Cafe in Phoenix!  They will now be serving dinner, this was their soft opening.   I had the Trout and it was awesome! The dessert was a Lemon Meringue dessert.  The best part is EVERYTHING is Gluten Free! Oh and they will be serving Cruz strawberry jalape√±o margaritas! Yum!"}
{"text":"I really loved this cafe. I came from out of state so it was so nice to have a restaurant dedicated to gluten free. The food was delicious"}
{"text":"I have been gluten free for over 5 years. This is the first place I've come where EVERYTHING was gluten free. It was so delicious, too. I got biscuits and gravy, I think... I can't remember because everyone at the table just shared all their food and nothing was bad. I ended my stay there with a cupcake and it was SO DELICIOUS. When I am back in Phoenix will definitely be stopping by here again."}
{"text":"Had chicken and waffles which were really good. Also ordered biscuits and gravy. The biscuits were very crisp and not good. Spent about 30$ for two breakfasts and 2 cups of OJ. May come back again to try something different. Definitely don't recommend biscuits and gravy."}
{"text":"Met my friend here on Sunday for breakfast/brunch and I have to say I'm disappointed I had not been here sooner! I had the french toast special with eggs, bacon, and potatoes. The potatoes were delicious, flavorful but not too salty with crispy kale. The scrambled eggs were rich and creamy and the bacon had a hint of sweetness. I don't usually order french toast but I had a craving for sweets. The toast was thick and the syrup was buttery and not too sweet. I can't wait to go back and try lunch and the bakery."}
{"text":"Just wanted to update this....

Been able to get in  now. The cup cakes are awesome and great for work parties!  The service does lack sometimes.  There is not a \"focus on the customer\" attitude.  Last time I was there it was 5 minutes standing at the counter before anyone said anything and the guy that helped me was the one that behind the counter putting things away. He saw me but wasn't very friendly. 

The cookies are great too.

You really need to try this place, be patient and you will like it."}
{"text":"I'm on the gfcf diet and their gluten free vegan cupcakes are so good! I now know where to get my cupcake fix when I'm wanting one!"}
{"text":"Starting with the positive, we've gone here three times now and each time the food is fantastic. We've tried all the starters, the buffalo cauliflower is my favorite. The veggie tacos are really good, too. I've ordered the Hot Chick a couple times and it's always on point. 

Two out three times we've come, our service has been lacking. The first time it was suggested to us that we order ahead, since our main complaint was how long it took to order and then get our food. We did this the second time we came and everything was perfect....but our trip today was disappointing.

We ordered ahead again. When we arrived Santa was on site & the staff was taking a picture with him.  (As we were sitting there we saw they had posted this Santa thing as an event they sold tickets to, and it ended right as we got there. If we were told when we preordered 20 minutes before, we could have changed our lunch to a more convenient time for the staff).

We sat to wait and they finished up, and then...nothing..it took another 5 or so minutes (maybe longer) for anyone to come check on us (we were sitting in a table right in front of the baker line, too). When we did finally get someone to notice us, we let him know we had ordered ahead, but wanted waters for the table. We didn't see him again for awhile...then he came to drop off half of the tables food, no waters..no silverware...no napkins.. 

We did end up enjoying our food (as usual) and we might even go back...but we've already decided to order stuff that doesn't need to be hot, get it to go & eat somewhere else. If we actually go back."}
{"text":"Met up with a friend for lunch on Friday and was very pleased with this place!  It's been on my list for a while :)

We met up at 11:30, just in time to take advantage of the lunch menu.  My friend had a southwestern chicken salad and mine was Greek.  Both were really tasty.

Neither of us took advantage of the baked goods but I have my eye on a couple of things for the next visit.

Jewel's is known for being gluten-free but none of our  food was lacking in flavor  or balance.  It's got a nice, low key ambiance and good service.

This place is cute and worth supporting.  I'll be back soon----there's a ginger snap with my name on it!"}
{"text":"What bakery closes at 3 o'clock? You're missing people who want a pastry or coffee in the afternoon!"}
{"text":"I can't stop ordering the biscuits and gravy! Next time I will TRY to order something else bc it's really unusual for me not to try a variety of things. However, where can you find good gf biscuits that you want to eat again? You forget you're eating gf. Dangerous, so dangerous...."}
{"text":"I promised I would write a review last Saturday so this is late. I have been frequenting Jewel's since before Thanksgiving 2014. I have a gluten and yeast allergy and thought I was doomed to try to create my own yummy baked goods... Enter Jewel's!! I ordered pies for the holiday that were amazing and even family that eats \"whatever\" enjoyed them. They have a great little take-away bakery that I visit at least every other weekend. I haven't had a meal there but everything looks and smells fantastic. Pecan bars are my favorite!! And the cookies!! And the brownies!!"}
{"text":"3 people here and it took 5 minutes to get service, despite about 5 people behind the counter. The waitress was sarcastic when we only ordered 2 apps and 2 drinks. Definitely won't come back."}
{"text":"I usually don't complain about there being hair in my food but after finding multiple strands of hair in my potatoes...I had to mention it to the it to the employees and I do believe they brought it up with the chef right after. 

The food itself is above average I probably would have given them a higher rating had I not found hair infused in my hash browns.

Definitely healthier than your average breakfast spot... Everything is gluten-free and the pancakes were the favorite item on my breakfast starter plate."}
{"text":"I used to be a HUGE fan of Jewel's. I used to plan on coming here every week and I would spend probably $40-$50 on myself because I loved the food and baked goods. 

Today, I wish I hadn't spent the $20 I did. The muffin I ordered was dry. And the Waffle Breakfast Sandwich I had was downright gross. The sausage tastes like it was one of those \"Aidell\" sausages you can buy at the grocery. The eggs on the sandwich were burnt (hard, crispy, and chewy), how eggs should never be. The waffle was ok. But I've had better. 

I'm just really disappointed. I probably won't come back any longer. 
This is the final straw in an increasing series of disappointing experiences here. It was great up until about 2 years ago. I kept hoping it would come back around but it doesn't have the same feel it used to and the food has gone downhill steadily. 

Sad. I hope you guys can turn it around."}
{"text":"So disappointed with my visit here and I didn't even get to try their food. I can understand waiting for a table on a Sunday afternoon but poor service, I can not rationalize. Upon being seated and waiting for about 10-15 minutes, I had to check with the host if we ordered at the counter or if we had a server. 1st time here and no one approached us so seemed legit that maybe we ordered at the counter.  He found our disgruntled server and we placed our order. More time past and a busser brings us water and my coffee. Have yet to see/hear from our server since ordering. I walked up to the counter to get a coffee refill. 45 minutes have gone by and we decided to leave. I came here for my boyfriends birthday brunch based on the recommendation of a foodie I follow on Instagram. I generally don't speak out like this so it's gotta be pretty bad for me to do so."}
{"text":"We met family here today for lunch. We all tried something different, and I don't think anyone was disappointed. The red chili salad was absolutely delicious. My husband had the Greek chicken salad sandwich and sisters in law shared a kale salad. We shared a brownie for dessert. Keep up the great food!"}
{"text":"Love this place chicken and waffles is great and so is biscuit and gravy. A lot of things you won't believe they have no gluten super good food"}
{"text":"Gluten eaters must stop by and try! My boyfriend and I love this place and frequent it. The owner is constantly making improvements and updating the menu. I have not had one dish that has disappointed me. the extended hours are a wonderful bonus. 

Biscuits and gravy are my favorite!"}
{"text":"I can't believe this was my first time visiting Jewels' Bakery in Phoenix, considering I am gluten-free and love donuts   I was excited after reaching out to them, asking about their new flavors - Fruity Pebble, Cocoa Krispies, Oreo etc. 

We got there around 1:15pm on a Sunday and unfortunately, they were sold out of almost all of their donuts, except 1 Fruity Pebble one. We snagged the last one, and also got a Oreo cupcake (not dairy-free) to go. 

We were both pleasantly surprised by the texture and flavor of both treats! Both were moist, soft, fluffy and delicious. It was just what we had hoped for!

The only downside? I wish there were more dairy-free and gluten-free options. Most of their gluten-free donuts and cupcakes (besides 1 flavor of cupcake) all contained dairy, and all contained eggs (for those wondering). 

I would definitely come back though, and most likely stay for brunch. I have been eyeing their gluten-free french toast (as seen on Instagram). I think I will need to invite a friend or two to split it with me 

I would recommend Jewel's for those needing to avoid gluten and wheat for dietary reasons because it was delicious, and the staff was very helpful and knowledgeable. Get there early, because they do run out quick!

PS. They take custom cake orders, so it would be a great place to order a gluten-free cake for a birthday"}
{"text":"Oh my gosh! All I can say is yummy yum yum yum! My fiance and I are always looking for a good breakfast without the crazy crowded wait that you find at the big chain restaurants. Jewel's is without a doubt the greatest new little find. I had the goat cheese, bacon, onion quiche...holy deliciousness! I also had to try the sticky bun which was out of this world. And how cool is it that they have my favorite Kombuca!?!? Woot woot! Awesome food aside...I love the quaint decor and the comfy seats. This will for sure be a new weekend breakfast place for us. So happy!"}
{"text":"This place is a Jewel even if you don't have to eat gluten free. We love everything . Best chicken and waffles"}
{"text":"I was diagnosed with a gluten intolerance last September and have been trying to figure out how to cut out gluten. I am so sick of my stomach hurting and just generally not feeling good... I've struggled with asking for gluten free menus at restaurants - it's always felt like I was depriving myself but then I hated the way I felt after eating certain things. I decided to try this cafe a couple weeks ago - they aren't far from my office. I had the buffalo chicken sandwich and onion rings. Both were delicious. I took home a brownie to share with my family who surprising didn't tell me how gross it was for being gluten free - in fact they devoured it, leaving me barely a bite. I then decided I would bite the bullet and order some mixes and a loaf of bread. The bread is a big one for me... and one of the things I've dreaded trying. To me, bread is soft and fluffy and you should be able to sink your teeth into it. It shouldn't have to be toasted to be good.. it should be able to be eaten with pb&j or deli meat and cheese and be equally good. Anyway, I bought a loaf.. after two days of it sitting on my counter, I finally made some toast with butter and jelly. Delicious! My 3 year old even ate some (and keeps asking for more). Then today was the real test. I never eat a whole loaf of bread in a week, even the store bought bread so I knew I needed to freeze this bread, which I did yesterday with 2 slices per ziplock bag. I pulled out a bag and lightly toasted the bread, which basically just warmed it up.. not making it hard like toast and made myself a pb&j for lunch. My expectations were pretty low... but boy was I surprised and so incredibly happy. I know it's just bread.. but I feel like it's just opened a new door for me... one where my stomach doesn't have to hurt everyday. This bread is amazing, I don't feel deprived, and it is really truly delicious!"}
{"text":"I thought I found heaven when I walked in to this place. So many options. I bought way too much and ate too much but other than my portion control, I was very happy to finally make it over to the Bakery. If you watch your gluten intake, definitely check this place out. So yummy!!!!"}
{"text":"Happy this place is so near to home. They have really good breakfast & lunch selections. If you're in the area stop by this spot & get some food. They also have really good iced teas."}
{"text":"The food here is very good & gluten-free! I had the breakfast classic (2 eggs, bacon, house potatoes, 1 pancake) and it was delicious! The portions are not too much and not too little. I did not have a pastry, but they look marvelous! I took 1 star away because the latte I had was mediocre at best."}
{"text":"My wife and I come here occasionally.  This morning there was a mixup with our orders and the wrong items initially came out.  My wife and I were both very impressed with how professionally they handled the situation.  While we waited for the correct items, they gave us some delicious banana bread and a scone from the bakery to tide us over, and also a VIP discount card to use in the future.  

When our orders did come out, the food was amazing as it always is.  I'm not sure what they put in their pancake syrup, but it's the best in town."}
{"text":"Local, organic, fresh and gluten free. Great music, staff is always upbeat and super friendly. The menu is fairly limited but they always have new specialty dishes added to the chalkboard wall. The coffee is amazing (and I'm hard to impress) and I absolutely love that they offer non-dairy options. I come here quite often and every time I'm blown away!"}
{"text":"Best breakfast, pastries, and lunch in town. Added bonus they are ALL gluten free. This is the motherland for people like me who have celiac. 0 chance of contamination here. The wait staff are all amazing, and they offer new specials every month! Just got their newest addition, sweet crepes for breakfast, and they are Devine !!! Go see how great they are for yourself."}
{"text":"Jewel's was one of the highlights of my most recent trip to Phoenix. One of my coworkers raves about this bakery and special orders their gluten-free bread loaves several times a year and has them shipped. They're that consistently good!

Besides the special-order and bakery options (with a case full of GF, vegan, non-dairy, nut-free, etc cupcakes and cookies), they also operate a breakfast/lunch cafe- the whole menu is available the whole day, which allowed us to each eat our favorite foods.

The GF Chicken and Waffles is one of the best versions I've tried, GF or otherwise. That Sriracha honey is bomb! The AZ omelet is packed with veggies and served with roasted potatoes, surprisingly filling. I also really enjoyed the Grilled Veggie Shawarma bowl, but wish there were a soy tzatziki/cheese option to make it fully vegan.

Service was super sweet, our special order was ready when we arrived, and they offer a free cookie with Yelp check-in! The vegan snickerdoodle was soft, chewy, and just the right amount of sweet. Wish we had a Jewel's in Vegas, love how well they accommodate specialized diets while still serving up flavorful food at reasonable prices."}
{"text":"We went here for breakfast when staying in Phoenix. I got a chunky monkey latte which was a banana chocolate flavor and it was so good. Not too sweet but you could still taste the hint of banana. They also have a lot of other cool latte flavors! Then I got the chicken and waffle  it was my first time having the iconic dish. Omg. So good. And their syrup!!! Omg if they bottled it I would drink it straight that's how good it is. Highly recommend going here."}
{"text":"When I arrived it was the morning of a holiday, so it might have been more busy than it usually would have been on a weekday morning. I was still able to find good seating since I was dining alone. The person serving me was incredibly nice but it was a little hard to get his attention once I was ready for the check.
I ordered the chorizo omelet with hash browns, both of which were great. The house salsa went along wonderfully with the hash browns. I got a (vegan or gluten free, or both, can't remember?) peanut butter cookie as well which wasn't bad, but definitely not at the top of my list as far as cookies go. I would love to come back and try their pancakes or waffles, overall it was a good visit."}
{"text":"The food was spectacular! I had the chicken and waffles. I can't tell you how long it has been since I have been able to have that! If you go there you must try the homemade buttermilk syrup. I wish I could have bought a gallon of it to take home with me! Whether you are gluten free or not I highly recommend stopping here while in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I went here yesterday for breakfast as my boyfriend has to have a GF diet. Unfortunately, we weren't all that impressed. Online there seemed to be lots of options for breakfast, so I was excited to give this place a try. I had seen french toast as an option and even saw a picture posted by someone else on yelp of it. It wasn't on the menu when we got there and when I asked, it was stated they didn't have french toast. So a bit of a bummer. The rest of the food was \"meh\" as well, nothing to write home about. Their coffee was good, but that it because it is brought in from Cartel. Overall, I had to give this place 2 stars as it was okay, but not a place we will be returning to again."}
{"text":"I chose to try out this bakery for my birthday lunch because I'd been given one of their cupcakes before (Almond Joy Cupcake...it was delicious) and heard tons of great things about their lunch menu. So we made the trek from the northwest valley and let me tell you, it was well worth the drive!

First impressions of the cafe: Nice location and really neat decor! Vintage/ Shabby Chic is the closest thing I can think to call it, but it's not so frilly that a guy would feel out of place. Some of the art was done by a local artist and overall it was bright, airy and very, very clean. The staff is AWESOME!!! If I could underline that twice I would, so I'll just say it again..The staff is AWESOME!!!

We ordered the Greek Chicken Salad, the BLT, and Roasted Veggie Flatbread and they were all equally delicious! They forgot to remove an ingredient on my son's sandwich and not only did they apologize and bring us a new sandwhich, they also offered us a complimentary treat for the \"trouble\"!  Now, these treats are the real reason to drive across town because their cupcakes and brownies are good even by gluten standards! I had the Caramel Macchiato Cupcake and it was delicious but then you can't go wrong with the salted caramel brownies either!  The loose leaf mango orange green tea was just another great component to a very wonderful meal. 

We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Let me just start by saying that everything is gluten free in this bakery/cafe! We came here today for lunch and goodies. We were all pleasantly happy by the taste and variety of foods offered. I look forward to trying breakfast and dinner. They just started dinner service recently and the menu looks DELISH! They use local ingredients including Olive Mill and Pillsbury Winery. 
I had the berry salad with seared ahi tuna, mom and sis had the quiche, nephew had burger and fries, niece's had veggie tacos and waffle with syrup. Everything was very good and very fresh. 
I got my free cookie with Yelp check-in which led to a further purchase of goodies including a rocky road brownie and pecan pie square. I can't wait to taste them!!! I did nibble on the chocolate cookie on the way home. Yummers! 
I will be back for sure."}
{"text":"This place was recommended by an old coworker of mine in Albuquerque. We love trying new places and this place is a total gem!! I will start off only saying we ordered a couple kids breakfasts for our kids and there seemed to be some confusion on how it comes. Also, my kids have never really been into box juices and that's what comes with breakfast. This is the only reason I didn't give 5 stars. On to the important part, the food!!

I ordered the biscuits and gravy. Which I must say was Devine! The biscuit was tender and fluffy, the gravy, not at all heavy or filled with pan drippings, no guilt! it also had a nice amount of sausage in it. It came with a sausage patty and not the standard round nasty things that come in a box, rather one that was formed by hand and cooked on site! To finish off my plate, it came with beautiful pan fried potatoes that are tossed with fried kale, just a perfect plate of love in my book. 

My hubby got the breakfast sandwich, I was so in love with my food, I didn't really pay attention to what was on it, I'm pretty sure a biscuit loaded with eggs, bacon and cheese? Either way he ate every bite and enjoyed it. His also came with the same pan fried potatoes, they are so good!

My kids had a (kids menu?) breakfast, so one pancake each, a side of fruit and a box juice. We thought the breakfast came with eggs and what not, so we had to order a side of it. Like I said earlier, a tad confusing. We initially ordered waffles, but I guess the iron was not on. Either way, the server made good with us and was very nice, so it really wasn't an issue. My kids love pancakes too. 

On the way out we decided to grab a 4 pack of cupcakes. I must say, I'm glad we did! We got a carrot cake cupcake, red velvet cupcake, a lemon curd cupcake and blueberry muffin. These were probably some of the best cupcakes I've had. Moist, dense, light and not overly sweet. Just Devine! 

I love finding good places to eat. We will definitely be back!!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough about this place. we visited multiple times for breakfast and have been pleased.  But ordering our pies and rolls for thanksgiving blew us away on how great this place is! Well done Jewels, well done."}
{"text":"Holy smokes. Found the best scones in all of Phoenix (so far!) and some prickly pear iced tea that was so refreshing and flavorful and it was all like $5!! Def coming back many times. Close to work but not close to my gym."}
{"text":"It's so hard to find a place that has gluten free bakery items! I got there pretty late in the afternoon and the selection wasn't huge but all of the items I ended up walking away with were awesome. They even have a few non dairy items too! 

This place also offers a full menu so I'm excited to come back for lunch!"}
{"text":"This place is adorable with a great breakfast. I'd highly recommend the chicken and waffles. You'd never know this restaurant is GF- the food is delicious. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Right now I'm unfortunately giving  this place a poor rating for my first visit. I was really excited to try this highly rated cafe and it's been over half hour for our food to arrive. I ordered a mocha which tasted great (one star for that) and initial service was friendly (another star) but tables around us who sat after us, have gotten their food way before us. And we're sitting as a table for two. I know they're busy but lack of follow up or courtesy notice is quite displeasing. 
 
So never got my pancakes an hour later... ended up eating my side items which were anything fancy. Conclusion: kitchen lost our ticket order. Possibly.
 But somehow our bill got to our table within minutes. 

There is definitely ample seating and the baked goods look great."}
{"text":"Foods okay...wait is tooooo long!! Everyone who walked in after me received food before me....plus the cupcakes tasted like the fridge they were stored in."}
{"text":"This review is mixed. I've gone to Jewels pretty much since it's opened. This latest menu has the best food, but now that it's busy... Their system seems to have some holes. The past 3 times I've been there, I've either waited more than 40 minutes to get food, the order was missing something, and my ticket was missed. Even this morning I saw wrong food get delivered to a table. If you have 2 hours to go to breakfast or lunch and you don't care if the organization is all over the place... Then it's great."}
{"text":"Fresh ingredients and fresh tasting 
1/30/2015 Enjoyed our brunch meal visited for the first time. Meals range from $10 and up quick and friendly service
Wide variety of fresh baked goods"}
{"text":"I love this little place. The gluten free blueberry scone and pumpkin bread are delicious. The staff is so nice. I'll be back!"}
{"text":"So good. Don't believe the bad reviews. Great food, friendly and helpful staff. It's not over the top expensive and they have Vegan options for those with multiple food restrictions! I'm coming here every week!"}
{"text":"I am becoming more and more disappointed with what was my favorite gf place to eat. :( 

-The baked goods above the case and in are always scarce. (We were there at 11... They still had 3-4 hrs of service still)
-Menu items falling off...Ex: carrot cake cupcakes were so delicious... No longer for sale. When I asked about them the male cashier rudely replied \"yup looks that way!\" ... Um he should have tried \"I know, they were so delicious, but we are no longer selling those.\" ((tip? There's your tip buddy.))
-The customer service is no longer friendly.  Cashiers are rude and act like they are in their 11th HR of a 12 HR shift! 
-However, the girls delivering the food to tables were friendly and nice! 

Jewels bakery please step it up!"}
{"text":"I was excited to try a new place offering vegetarian food and the fact they understood food allergies and were able to quickly answer my questions was wonderful. I was disappointed, however, by the actual food. I got falafel with rice and veggies. The rice was dry and lacking flavor, the veggies were so oily that it soaked through the rice, and I could not enjoy the texture, nor the flavor of the falafel.
I gave them 3 stars for even having food I can eat, the staff was friendly and attentive, the place itself is quite cute and because the scone I got was a saving grace to my meal."}
{"text":"I have been coming here for several years. I guess when things are good, it's easy to take an old favorite for-granted. I used to LOVE this place and would easily have given it 5 stars. Service was always friendly, the vibe was relaxed and cool, dining area was clean, and the food YUMMY! But the past few months something has happened. I come here about once a month and have seen a steady decline. Talking with other GFers, they have noticed the same thing. It's such a shame - because a place like this, for those of us with Celiac or Gluten intolerance, that still love good food, is desperately needed!! 

I went in yesterday, and it was the straw that broke the camels back. It was after the lunch rush (about 2:30) but there was lots of staff in the back, so service should have been spot on. No one seemed happy to be there and they showed it. The counters all looked cluttered and dirty. The bakery area was quite empty with few choices (maybe just bad timing). I was just coming in to grab several treats, a loaf of bread, and a coffee, so not sitting to eat this time. That was probably a good thing, because by the looks of things, I'm not sure I would have been happy. The gals behind the counter, weren't just not friendly, but made me feel like I was interrupting them! Another customer came up while I was waiting, and had a problem with her order. I couldn't believe how unhelpful they were to her. If that had been her first time there, I'm guessing she won't be returning. 

Anyway, I'm going to stop coming here for a while and see if they can get it together. Hoping the owner reads this. I know two other families that feel the exact same way and have stopped going all-together. Word spreads quick. This place needs a THOROUGH cleaning and some front of the house training. That relaxed, friendly vibe and good food was the draw for years. It's missing now. I hear they are getting a new chef, so hoping he can spruce things up in the back of the house. I did love my goodies I got yesterday - so I did leave with a small smile on my face. .=) 

I beg of you, from those of us who just can't eat Gluten, to please get your standards back to where they used to be. I don't think these simple fixes would cost a lot and would be huge for your customers!"}
{"text":"Definitely one of the best gluten free restaurants in Phoenix. Everything is gluten free! So no risk of cross contamination and you would never know it was gluten free because it is so yummy. I got cupcakes here for my birthday, thier cupcakes are wonderful."}
{"text":"I tried the special omelette and my wife had the taco Omelette both underwhelming and just can't get above 2 stars on this one."}
{"text":"How do I love thee? Let me count the ways!
We live in Vegas but come to Phx about 2-5 times per year. Jewels is on our list of \"musts\" for each trip.
It is so wonderful to be able to eat with reckless abandon and not worry about reactions the entire time we are eating.
My 3 year old always gets a cupcake.
The pizza is excellent. Cookies are TDF.
Donuts are lacking (I think cake donuts would be better than the standard yeast variety. They always taste stale and dry)
Chicken and waffles or just plain old waffles are both a must.
My gluten-eating husband even likes the food."}
{"text":"One of those really odd places that you just stumble upon and realize you might be the last person to know about it...an 'all week' brunch special with $20 bottle of champagne. An amazing place with great food, great bakery, great service. 

It's local. It's awesome. Go."}
{"text":"Have loved Jewel's since they were a little place up the street from me. Great to have a gluten free bakery and restaurant that offers so many options and doesn't force egg free, dairy free, or fun free. Hands down, the scones are my all time favorite. Wish they'd bring back the jalape√±o pretzels."}
{"text":"The baked goods here are scrumptious, have a fine texture, and are not overly sweet. The breakfasts and lunches are very appealing in taste and presentation. Jewel's amazes me with its ability to get all of these food aspects right, which is truly a feat when it comes to gluten-free food (the cafe does not serve anything with gluten). Beyond the food and beverages, the appeal extends to the bright, eclectic atmosphere of the cafe. The staff is very friendly,  the cafe's location is convenient, and the availability of parking is excellent. Plus, free WiFi  with a good strong signal; my tablet browses the Internet really fast when I'm in this bakery/cafe. In all, this is a most pleasant place to get a great meal or to have a leisurely nosh of coffee and delicious baked goods."}
{"text":"This is very close to my new workplace and a great place to grab a yummy lunch and baked treat.  Yelp check-ins score a free cookie!  (Yesterday, mine was a crunchy snickerdoodle.)  I appreciate the gluten-free and vegan options and enjoy supporting a business with friendly staff people.  On my visit yesterday, I selected the grilled cheese sandwich (comes with bacon, turkey, or ham) with chips (the good, thick kind!).  My sandwich was filling and satisfying, loaded with cheese, avocado, tomatoes....In fact, I was so full that I didn't need dinner.  The cafe is comfortable with plentiful seating and cozy; I've spent a good hour or so on another visit where I happily read a book and drank a coffee.  The pastry case offers a good variety of treats, including vegan cupcakes!, and one can order items for pick-up.  Come support this local business and enjoy some great food."}
{"text":"Yet another great place in Arcadia to get your veggie glow on. 

As part of the October 30 day vegan challenge, I made a point to try as many vegan friendly restaurants as possible and so far this is very high up on my list - especially for being a caf√© with gluten-free, dairy-free, corn-free, and lots of great meat options as well. It's the perfect place to take a date with dietary restrictions. 

The portions were gigantic! Although the price I paid for the vegan tacos was a little high for a lunch break, it is more than enough food for two meals. I can't wait to heat these up for a leftover breakfast tomorrow at the office. 

I also had the buffalo cauliflower. I don't know about you, but this is my current favorite obsession. They're very meaty and fantastically battered! They're very smart to serve the sauces on the side so that they keep their crisp."}
{"text":"I ordered my meal to go from here because I've never tried it and I saw it on Postmates. I got the cauliflower wings and Cali chicken sandwich. The wings were good, but the bread was flimsy and the sandwich was mediocre. Kinda wanna try their breakfast, probably won't return for lunch."}
{"text":"Sadly, I went in to get my wife a sandwich and had to leave empty handed. She is allergic to corn, as well as gluten. All of the bread is made with corn starch. It could be a good option to have bread for a corn allergy sufferer, as well. Jewel's is a step in the right direction. The restaurant just needs to go a step further. Gluten is not the only food allergy people suffer from."}
{"text":"Disappointed. No beverages on menu or posted anywhere. Asked person at counter and said, \"No, we don't have a drink menu but we're working on that.\"  Weird considering they are not a new restaurant. My daughter ordered toast and bacon and no jam came with her one small piece and server didn't offer it. She never came to check on us after she brought us food so we asked another sever for jam and she brought us one little smuckers packet.  I ordered a waffle. Food took 30 minutes which I felt was a bit long considering restaurant wasn't full. Waffle tasted VERY eggy which is not uncommon with gluten free pancakes/waffles but there are easy egg substitutes to fix that problem.  I doubt we'll be back."}
{"text":"Looking to bring unique sweet treats to a client or friend? Jewel's Bakery is sure to win over all hearts! From macarons, to lemon bars, to eclairs, their decadent treats are always a good idea! They specialize in gluten free desserts as well, so there is literally something for everyone! I haven't eaten a meal here so I will most definitely be back again soon for breakfast or lunch!"}
{"text":"Gluten free at their finest!! LOVED everything about this place. I was in town for a birthday weekend getaway and there's not a wide selection of breakfast that's gf from where I'm from. I had the chicken and waffles. The waffle was so yummy, light and crispy, just the right amount of flavor and something that just made it taste amazing. The chicken was good too, actually tenders not a piece of chicken on the bone. Came with a buttermilk syrup of their making and a spicy honey. Both yum. My husband, not gf but supports me by eating gf when he has too, had pancakes and he said they were very tasty. I took a bit and I agreed, nice thickness to them too. I received a free cupcake for my birthday, I choose Carmel.
The place itself is charming with old metal chairs, different colors. Open white space with some brick. Not over done on decor just a nice bakery and cafe! The coffee lattes were also good but I was enjoying the food to much to really notice. Our server was great and all the staff were friendly and wished me a happy birthday! A happy happy gluten-free breakfast birthday to me!"}
{"text":"My Mom and I came in because it was close and had decent reviews. We both had the chicken and waffles plus eggs. Both were good, but not spectacular. I had to ask for butter, and the tiny portion barely covered half of my waffle. (Who serves waffles without butter?) I also had to ask for extra napkins, and the server seemed put out that she had to make an extra trip. The cold brew was the highlight of my meal."}
{"text":"I've been twice now- the first time I got chicken and waffles and brought home some donuts ALL SO GOOD.. I came back a week later to get more donuts because they were so good. Best GF glazed donuts I've ever had and I've had celiac for over 5 years. Friendly service too, always have a smile on their face."}
{"text":"This place is going down hill fast. I come here pretty regularly for breakfast. The service is getting more rude and each dish I get is increasingly lower in quality, flavor, and temperature. 

Service today was really slow and less than professional. When asked for my order, I ordered slowly while she was fidgeting with the register. After I was finished she said, \"OK! What was it you wanted again?\"  If you aren't ready, don't ask me what I want. Really rude and frustrating to think you're being heard only to have to repeat yourself. 

Last time I was here I got their breakfast parfait. The fruit was less than \"fresh\" as they tout on their menu. The bread that came on he side was once warm and crumbled when I attempted to pick it up. 

This time I got the breakfast sandwich. The potatoes were not cooked at all. Normally they are brown. This time, they were still white and incredibly greasy. The sausage on the sandwich was absolutely flavorless. The eggs were cooked too long and were served brown and crispy. There was hardly any cheese to speak of. 

Oh, and don't even get me started on them if they have a line. They have two registers but do not use them. They will let the line get to the door with and still only use one. I've walked in and out a few times because they are incredibly slow. 

If you want a sweet treat and there is no line, this is the place to stop in. If not, don't bother."}
{"text":"I don't think it's possible to convey through words the stressful and horrid experience we had here. We were quoted about a 10 minute wait-waited almost an hour while literally every person that came after us was seated. The poor hostess looked as if she was bambi's mother starring at a room full of poachers with their rifles pointed towards her. She was clearly flustered and had no idea what she was  doing. Once we finally were seated, two of us decided to get the buffet while the other members of our party opted for menu items. It felt more like a soup kitchen then a buffet as we had to continue standing and waiting for the food to be cooked and come out, which it did in very small quantities and very infrequently. I'm leaving having paid for a plate of cold unseasoned potatoes and 1/4 waffle (for which I thought I might loose an eye or a limb in the crowd for obtaining the golden treasure) our server never took our drink orders, checked on us only when she brought the food and promptly forgot all our drink orders until we were ready to leave. This place is a serious joke. I know it was a holiday but the service we received was inexcusable and unprofessional."}
{"text":"I love this place! We drive all the way from Surprise to get amazing gluten free food. It's so nice to be able to order anything off the menu and my kids can choose what they want. I love the fried chicken and kale chips. Their cupcakes are out of this world! My kids love the grilled cheese and breakfast plates."}
{"text":"Jewel's Bakery strives to make gluten-free items taste good. They have an amazing selection of bakery delights and desserts that are just as good as any gluten item. I've been wanting to stop by here for some time. Jewel's is located in the Arcadia district and is family owned. They are a local favorite and a place you can visit and feel at home. They have a variety of salads, waffles, sandwiches and breakfast items on their cafe menu. You can also order your food online and they offer cooking classes once a month. I ordered the delicious Santa Fe bowl along with a slice of pumpkin pie. It was a nice prelude to Thanksgiving and the customer service was awesome. I had an enjoyable dinner here and I look forward to stopping in for a pastry or one of their waffle creations in the future."}
{"text":"First visit I waited 30 minutes for a cup of coffee, had to ask twice for water. A couple at another table waited so long for a server to take their order, they finally gave up, ordered some cupcakes at the counter and left. My food was good, bought some cupcakes to take with me, they were delicious. Was really disappointed in the service but once our order was in, the kitchen was pretty quick, so we chalked it up to a bad day. Service was friendly, just slow, understaffed.

Went back this weekend, hostess warns us that the service might be slow. Not \"we had 2 servers call in sick so we're a little short-staffed today.\" We asked what that meant and she just mumbled again about being slow and didn't really articulate herself. There was a couple of larger groups but a few open tables and no one on the patio. We decided to sit and the hostess went over and asked a server to come by our table, that was nice but if that's not the standard deal - a server coming by pretty soon after sitting down - yikes. Server was really friendly, took our oder (we put food in right away) but she never brought water even though she asked if we wanted any, after being there 20 minutes and well after we had coffee, I finally got up and helped myself to the disposable cups. Food took 45 minutes. We regretted not grabbing tacos and moving on with our Sunday afternoon.

Being the celiac in the family, it sucks to ask people to go to the ONE place you can eat super safe and always get bad service and have it be a poor experience for them. They give two shits it's gluten-free, to them it's the caf√© that's always slow (and apparently it's so bad the hostess tries to warn you).  I'll go back only when I'm by myself, I have my computer and can spend an hour and a half getting lunch. Or, will pop in for baked goods at the counter. Why not have enough servers to cover the tables you have? I guess they have a captive, niche audience."}
{"text":"So happy I popped in here for lunch on Friday. I had the red chile chicken salad... Grilled chicken cooked perfect and great layer of flavors. My only suggestion is that I would pay more and add more chicken to the salad. I didn't find it that filling.  My hubby had the BBQ pork sandwich and it was really tasty! Loved the flavors. It is such a cute comfy place ( the most comfortable chairs) I can't wait to try other things on their menu."}
{"text":"I am a breakfast lover and decided to try Jewels Bakery as the \"Yes way Jose\" item description sounded delicious along with Orange Juice. For the $16.29 plus the tip. What I was imagining versus what I received was different. The portion of my omelette was bit smaller, it was warm at best cheese was already thickened up from cooling down, the potatoes were I would say room temperature and salty, the avocado had dark spots I had to cut out, the orange juice was about 6oz poured from a gallon jug.

The overall flavor was okay however, I can think of other places to get the same if not better flavor for less. 

Maybe they shine with the baked items which I did not try but the girl who worked the front was very friendly so I give them 2 stars for the service."}
{"text":"Very tasty gluten free food and beautiful and delicious plethora of GF baked goods include cookies, cupcakes, bars, muffins, loafs and cheescakes.
Lunch and breakfast all GF too. My favorite is the quiche which is only $8 and change and comes with a generous portion of potatoes, fresh fruit and dusted with housemade crispy Kale chips. 
I've compared this place with Essence Bakery and they are slightly more affordable and ALL GF.
What's not to love!"}
{"text":"We live a few blocks from Jewel's and have been several times since they opened - it's definitely our new favorite place in the neighborhood.  The only problem is we like the food and treats so much that we always spend WAY too much when we go so had to limit our trips :)  My husband and I both eat gluten usually and both of us feel that the food and bakery at Jewel's is some of the best we've had and you would never know everything was gluten free.  My favorite item is the grilled cheese with added avocado, my husband likes the BBQ pork sandwich.  He is a big cheesecake fan and we had the strawberry basil cheesecake when that was available which he said was the best cheesecake he had ever had!  We always buy a few white chocolate macadamia nut cookies as they are some of the BEST cookies I've had!  I made cookies at home recently and when looking for recipes my husband suggested I make them \"G-Free\" like the Jewel's cookies - I had to explain to him that many gluten-free cookies are not delicious and Jewel's is the exception :)  The staff is very friendly and welcoming and as you can see from the photos the interior is modern but warm and inviting - a really nice place to sit and chat over a delicious lunch.  I can't recommend Jewel's more!"}
{"text":"This review is for the baked goods. I had the pleasure of buying a pack of 4 cupcakes and boy were they delicious! The cake was moist and the frosting was just the right amount of sweet. Each flavor was unique and scrumptious on its own. If your looking for good quality baked goods, look no further! I can't wait to come here for a sit down meal! 
I hope this place stays in business forever!"}
{"text":"Smallest sandwich ever and very expensive by the way! I'm so disappointed! I paid $10.89 for a tiny sandwich with only veggies and 2 extra thin slices of avocado. I was asking questions to the cashier (by the way she didn't smile at all), she had to ask a question to the manager. The manager was super rude! I can't believe they treat customers like that! The cashier said my sandwich was going to take 10 minutes. Guess what?! It took longer cause they made a mistake with my order. The cashier brought me the sandwich when it was ready. She didn't say thank you. They don't know anything about customer service! My fries were very salty! 

I have been here twice and have had very bad impression about their service both times!"}
{"text":"Oh. So. Good!!! 

My boyfriend and I have a multitude of food allergies, not just gluten. These guys are super accommodating and really tastey. There are so few GF bakeries out there and the ones I have been to always add more additives to get the right consistency with their product. Not these guys! A perfectly healthy product that doesn't make us sick. 

Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Been here a few times now, I appreciate this spot for the consistent quality food prep & good service. I also like the open windows throughout. The environment is chill and great for those mornings when you want to avoid chaotic spaces. They serve Cartel coffee which is a plus in my book."}
{"text":"OK, I decided to give this place a shot due to some food allergy issues for the B-day girl. First off, they were slow in response to my request and they wanted payment up front. Which, for a specialty shop i can understand. The issue I have is with the experience there after. I was scheduled for a Monday pickup, I said would 10 am be good, and they confirmed. When I got to the Bakery, which was a drive for me, it was closed. As in closed for the whole day for remodeling. I think you would know, as a manager or owner if the store will be closed on a certain day well ahead of schedule. On top of that, the phone number posted on the door was wrong (both ways) It was a 602-and below it a 480 number....which one? NONE, cause neither worked!! Matter of fact no combination of the numbers worked. nobody answered their business line either. Anyway, I left messages, and two emails. Finally one person called me back, and said I would get a refund....Over a month later, I'm still waiting. If you want to be treated like you are not valued as a paying customer, who never got the product, then by all means, go to Jewel's. They are good at dismissal.  IF YOU THINK I AM COMPLAINING ABOUT $21.18 AND IT'S PETTY, I CHALLENGE YOU TO READ ALL THE NEGATIVE REVIEWS AND LOOK AT THE DATES...RECENT MANAGEMENT AND STAFF CAN BREAK A BUSINESS."}
{"text":"So cute! While I didn't try the food, they had great gluten-free baked goods with a lot of variety. Loved the chocolate chip cookies and the donuts were pretty good too for being gluten-free.."}
{"text":"Disappointing. If your only allergy is gluten, go for it. But if you're allergic to tree nuts, it's not worth risking your life. Items in the bakery case were only sporadically labeled for other allergens. I asked about the lemon cheesecake bar, and the order-taker had to ask a chef if there was almond flour in it because it WASN'T LABELED. (There was indeed almond flour.) A vegan muffin had a \"vegan\" label but no mention of the pecans covering the top.
As for the \"No Way, Jose\" omelet: the omelet was so-so. Chorizo was fantastic. Avocado was mostly black and inedible. Salsa was spectacular. The staff was extremely friendly; they simply weren't given the information they need to provide a safe, allergy-free experience, which is a shame.
The doughnut selection was limited and uninspiring. (Since it's a bakery, I went there for doughnuts.) They mostly offered cupcakes, but that limits the bakery selection considerably. There was no bread (another thing I went for), so overall, this was an underwhelming visit.
However, the brownie was phenomenal. The cinnamon-sugar doughnut was only ok.
I'll give a star for the brownie and a star for the people. Another star for the omelet. But the lack of allergy labeling and lack of selection means this stays at a three-star rating."}
{"text":"This is the most incredible gluten free heaven. I only wish that it was in LA so that I could go there all the time!!!

GF or not, the chocolate chip cookie was the absolute best cookie I've ever had in my life. And let me tell you...I cookie.

The eggs Benedict with the thick, orange cashew sauce was decadent, heavy, unique and left me craving it the following day. 

The servers are all so friendly and helpful. 

The coffee is yummy.

All in all, I lurv this place.

COME HERE!!! Like NOW! YOUR SEARCH HAS ENDED!"}
{"text":"Very fun original cafe. Excellent iced tea and organized counter service. Veggie flatbread was a bit flat (!) for me with a heavy tomatoe sauce.  (It has been eaten up as leftovers in our home, hmm.) Flatbreads can be so flavorful with an olive oil rather than pizza sauce...yep, that's a preference.  Desserts appeared a bit ordinary to me. Admittedly, that may be the appeal here.  I promise to revisit to expand my tastings."}
{"text":"I honestly had to check to make sure I was at the right place because all of these reviews had me fooled! A friend of mine raved about this GF restaurant so when family came into town we made sure to stop by. The guys behind the counter were incredibly annoyed that we didn't already know what we wanted to order (there was maybe 2 other people in the whole restaurant so it wasn't like we were holding the line up). We got our food & all 5 of us in our party barely ate. I had chicken & waffles, the waffles were still gooey in the middle & the chicken had zero flavor & was overcooked. I'm assuming the owner (as she had been behind the counter on the phone previously) came by to clear our plates & didn't comment on the 5 plates of barely eaten food. My mom mentioned how disappointed we were & she basically just brushed us off & walked off. This was NOT a cheap brunch at all. Such a disappointment. We will not be back."}
{"text":"I was visiting from out of town.  Found this place in a newspaper article online while searching for gluten free bakeries and they were open on Sunday.  The inside was very comfy and they had outside seating.  The entire place is 100% gluten free so I would have come hungry for lunch/brunch if I had known.  They had some vegan items marked and some more they told me about.  Great safe food place!"}
{"text":"Went here for lunch today after reading about their dedicated gluten free facility and thinking it was a safe place to enjoy a meal without all the typical  worrying. The food WAS really tasty, it was reasonably priced, and the place itself was cute, but I found out mid-way through the meal (by reading a review online and then confirming with the waitress) that most, if not all, of the food has oat flour in it or is subject to cross-contamination with it. Which is too bad, because oats are off limits for some people with celiac disease, including me. I feel so dumb for not checking, but in my own defense, I was told by some reputable sources it was a safe place, so had a false sense of security there. 

 So..... the rest of my meal was given to my kid,  who does not have celiac disease. So bummed. I wish they had some indication of the presence of the oat flour or other allergens  on their menu or even on the website. If it was present on either, I missed it. 

Maybe I'll go back once my first year is up and I'm allowed to re-introduce oats, but til then, I won't be returning."}
{"text":"I am in love with this place! Here's the deal, I can eat gluten....but my friend can't. She met me for lunch and took me here and good grief, it was amazing! We ordered and shared the fried chicken sandwich, it was to die for. A co-worker had me pick her up the cauliflower wings and those were like HEAVEN! For real, if eating gluten free food is as tasty as this, I'm ALL IN!

Super cute venue, cook to serve. Awesome GF bakery, try their red velvet cupcakes.

Can't wait to get back there, I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Dedicated GF cafe!! We were in town for a conference 10 minutes away. We had lunch here 3 days in a row. We are from a small town where GF is hard to find. This was SUCH a TREAT!!!   It was delicious on any scale....GF or not.    I had the special 3 days in a row. I think it was called sweet hot pickle chicken.  That was the best thing I've had at a restaurant in ages (we tend to eat at high end places even).    My fav was when I had it with no bun and instead of fries I had the kale slaw.  My husband had a hamburger the first day. It was ok. Nothing special but totally ok.  My daughter had a grilled cheese with tomato and bacon and that was yummy. My son had the quiche 2 days in a row.  We all had pickle chicken the last day...and they didn't even laugh at us coming 3 days in a row!!! lol.   We had the buffalo cauliflower twice which we really enjoyed. Nice and crisp and not soggy like home!  My son had seen fried oreos at our state fair that he couldn't eat and Jewel's actually had them as a special! How fun.    We enjoyed the cupcakes and donuts also.    Thanks to Jewels I will be eating zoodles (veggie noodles) for a week now that I am home.   The atmosphere is also very cute/artsy.  We really really really appreciated the food and service!    I didn't catch names, but if you waited 2 days in a row on a family of 4 on 10/26 and 10/27, thank you very much! (we were there with different staff 10/25)"}
{"text":"Love this dedicated gluten free bakery! My favorite one here hands down. Plus they have a bunch of egg free and dairy free options for my kiddo. I wish they had a location further north, I'd go there way more.

The last few times I've been the services hasn't been as good as it used to be. Slow staff that seemed very unhappy to be there. Yesterday it took us over 30mins to get our bill taken care of. 
Wonderful food but allow time for slow service."}
{"text":"Whenever I am nearby, I try to go to Jewels.  I love that I can come here and not worry about cross contamination.  I can hardly ever contain myself and usually have all the bread products I can.  I had the maple bacon French toast for Mothers Day and it was delightful.  Sandwiches are amazing.  The smothered chicken and biscuits are heavenly, the fried chicken and waffles are a thing of dreams (you don't dream of chicken and waffles?  You must not have celiac!)

My gluten eaters also like the food, so that's saying something!"}
{"text":"First time picked up treats from the bakery case and an iced tea.  The iced tea was super strong - I am passionate about tea and this just wasn't good.  Baked goods were AMAZING.  A scone and a lemon bar.

Second time I brought more people back for breakfast.  This is when I found out the entire restaurant is gluten free!  Could not believe it.  Loved the biscuits and gravy.  Only thing I didn't like was the sausage patty on the side.

Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"We met a friend here for brunch yesterday and had a good experience.  It was quite busy, but we only needed to wait about 5 minutes for our table of three.  Our server was friendly and efficiently took our orders.  I enjoyed the AZ omelette with egg whites, sausage, bell peppers, onions, cheddar and house potatoes.  Nice atmosphere, friendly service and good food.  

My only complaint is someone took my husband's plates (pancakes & eggs) while he still was finishing/chewing his food - definitely threw us all off with that!  I kept wondering if they were running out of plates and that is why they swiped us up before he was even completely done eating."}
{"text":"It's hard to believe some of these reviews on here. The service is always amazing. I love the food and the baked goods are excellent. I can't wait to come back to this AMAZING gluten free paradise."}
{"text":"A friend told me about Jewel's knowing I'm always looking for a great gluten free spot to eat. This place is going to be a new favorite. Everything is gluten free! They have a great breakfast and lunch menu, and so many baked treats. I had an amazing gluten free & vegan vanilla almond cupcake. Very excited to have found this bakery/cafe!"}
{"text":"Finally made it in for lunch yesterday. What a great place! I ordered the chicken and waffles to eat in and also took some baked goods home. The chicken and waffles was absolutely delicious and the loaf of gluten free bread I took home was THE best I have tasted since I started eating gluten free 8 months ago. I cannot wait to go back and try more menu items. The only thing I would change about this gem of a restaurant is to make it closer to home!! :)"}
{"text":"Gluten free??? Most people think it's a fad or a preference but my fianc√© has an extreme allergy.  We frequent Jewels and I have to say the food is delicious and fresh and not one ounce of gluten either.  To me gluten doesn't matter either way, but their scones to chicken and waffles are awesome!  Come check out Jewels and support local restaurants and coffee! (They serve cartel)"}
{"text":"Both the sweet & the savory were great. Cranberry lemon scone was terrific. Bacon, eggs & potatoes were all cooked really well (especially the potatoes!!) They even gave me a cupcake when there was a little confusion over what I ordered. I'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"I desperately wanted to like this place! Its so close to my home! But on the 3 occasions I've been here I left feeling like I wasted $20 on a terrible experience. Let me detail my last and final visit: terrible customer service- I was not greeted, just asked what I wanted and scowled at when I had a couple of questions about the menu(I get having a bad day but you should never take it out on a paying/tipping customer!!), and actually had to ask for a number so I could receive my food... The omelet I ordered was hardly cooked (when I asked it to be well done- runny eggs are atrocious to me) and it was seriously served COLD. I just can't! Worst of all, I ordered a cup of black coffee and was making my way outside when I was bumped by a staff member, spilling my coffee everywhere and wasn't even offered an apology or a refill... when I sat down with 2 oz. Of coffee and a terrible omelet I got up and left. I have never walked out of a restaurant until this day. I don't know if I just came on bad days or what but I can assure you I will not be giving this place a 4th try ): Arcadia has several other excellent breakfast joints that offer better food, service and coffee."}
{"text":"Just had the gluten free grilled cheese, it was GOOD!  Love this place, desserts are the bomb also."}
{"text":"The ENTIRE cafe is gluten free!! W a full menu!
Custom grilled cheese and chicken and waffles - all the way to the lighter fare side of wraps and salads.
Great atmosphere, accommodating staff, take home-fresh whole bread loaves and rotating weekly specials. Serving Cartel coffee, the best roaster in town.
Design is reminiscent of a modern country bakery, w cool clean white tiled kitchen facade, antiqued rustic signage, exposed brick walls, and wooden trusts.

Bar stool seating at the window, tables for larger parties, and outdoor patio with misters!
 Vibes galore!"}
{"text":"Jewels Bakery - I was in awe the first time I went there. I kept asking, are those donuts gluten-free? Are these cookies gluten-free?  EVERYTHING IS!! :)  to a girl who needs to avoid gluten due to a thyroid condition - Jewel's is a dream!

Their cookies are great, they have a few to choose from. I've had their cupcakes (no one would ever know the difference!), brownies I've tried both the regular and salted caramel- yum! I've tried their donuts and while the texture isn't exactly like a gluten-filled donut, I'll take it!! It has great chocolate glaze on it. Their waffles are very golden and crispy and the syrup/butter sauce that comes with them is what makes the dish. I get potatoes and eggs almost every time I go.y favorite things to get at Jewel's are the flax bread (have them slice a loaf and freeze it to keep - if it'll last that long!!) and the MAGIC BARS! Just get there early because the magic bars will sell out! They also sell GF cookie and bread mixes, as well as frozen items for a little cheaper. Cute little outside patio for nice days and my boyfriend loves the coffee and some breakfast items (he's not GF but still loves it here).

Bottom line is, if you are a human who enjoys good food from a cute, hip bakery, go to Jewel's! Service is fabulous, patient and always cheery & helpful!!"}
{"text":"When I visit Phoenix, I always try to make my way to Jewel's.  It is very relaxed environment and the food is amazing. Especially the waffles!! You won't be sorry :)"}
{"text":"Disappointed!! first time going here ordered the breakfast special the eggs and the pancake that I had to ask for because they forgot to give it to me were good but the the potatoes and sausage were dry and cold and tasted like they been sitting out all morning. Staff unfriendly also no smiles no greetings."}
{"text":"I went with a group from work during lunch.  I had the Black berry tea, Cali Chick sandwich and the chocolate white chocolate chip cookies, ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!"}
{"text":"Waited for 12 minutes for two iced coffee till I finally asked for a manager and got a refund. They were busy and I also noticed staff standing around not working on orders. Never coming here again."}
{"text":"I love that this is a gluten free environment since I have a severe gluten allergy. I love their food & service! The only reason I have three stars is because the last time I went with friends, a friend found a long hair cooked into her pancakes. I know that can happen anywhere but it still wasn't pleasant! 
My favorite is their chicken and waffles."}
{"text":"Thank goodness for this place. All GF with many things that are DF/EF as well. hooray!"}
{"text":"I would recommend the owners find another line of work as customer service seems to elude them.  Rude with sub par food = please close soon!"}
{"text":"Now open for dinner! So happy to see that there is a great place to go that is certified gluten free. Everything is gluten free and it is all out of this world. We started with the app of brussels with dates and bleu cheese. For my entree I got the chili cornbread waffles with pulled pork and green slaw. HELLO can we say flavor parade? Dave got the Cali chicken sandwich with fries and again absolutely delicious. I ended with the cheesecake and it did not disappoint. In fact, it was out of this world. The best part? The total for all of it was $29 because of their happy hour prices. Where else can you go for fresh food that is also gluten free? Answer: nowhere.  For those of us that need to stay gluten free this is a godsend. For those that don't you should still come because the dishes are delicious no matter what. Come. You will leave full and happy.  Carry on."}
{"text":"I really want to like Jewel's but they are just plain mis-managed. I have been there a half a dozen times only because I work close by. I'm glad Julie developed gluten-free food that we can't eat in conventional restaurants, but I have to debate with myself if I'm ready to deal with their \"under deliver, why are you here?, lackadaisical service\" attitude. My last straw was the \"D\" from the health department and another change in their hours."}
{"text":"Oh my.  What a gem! Pun intended :)
Seriously I haven't had good restaurant food since having to stop gluten.... this will be my go-to place while I'm here in scottsdale for sure.
I had the burger  & sweet potato fries- Wow!!! So delicious. The bun was a bit too much bread for me so I took the top off and just ate it with the bottom. Bacon, lettuce, tomato, cheese.... YUM!  I'd have to say though, the sweet potato fries were the star of the show.....crispy on the outside and sweet/soft on the inside, perfectly salty.... just soooo good.
For around 12 bucks, I'd say this meal was a good value, I couldn't even finish it and am having leftovers for lunch tomorrow. Definitely trying dessert on my next visit.
Also want to add, the employees were helpful and the hostess was the sweetest.  A+++"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! It's the second time I come here and I don't live in AZ. 
They have plenty of gf dairy free options 
SO GOOD! 
big thumbs up!"}
{"text":"Awesomeeee! They made this delicious cauliflower and a delicious vegan salad! Thank you! We really enjoyed it :))) more vegan options would be awesome!!!"}
{"text":"Great little place! I did redeem the yelp free cookie coupon and I haven't eaten it yet, but it looks rather promising! Their bread is fresh and homemade. Here is the breakdown of our order.

Breakfast Parfait
This was my selection. I was not prepared for the plain yogurt so that was an unpleasant surprise but once I added a packet of Stevia it was very good. I also had a side of bacon. This was not good for me but only because I enjoy center cut (more meat and less fat) and these were the exact opposite! I don't think there was but a sliver of meat on either piece! So I ended up not eating very much of them and at $3 for two pieces, I was not overly happy about that. 

Breakfast Taco
This was my husband's selection. My husband said that while his choice did not look too appetizing at first,  it did taste good. He really enjoyed the green salsa. Home potatoes were good and flavored well."}
{"text":"On my last visit, there was an associate who was less then welcoming and had me leaving the bakery just completely rubbed the wrong way, well into the afternoon! 

It was a Monday Morning (I know, by far one of the more difficult mornings to get yourself up and at'em) and as I was waiting in line admiring the treats that were out on display, the associate at the counter was assisting the women in front of me as she was picking up an order. Another associate came out from the back, and was hoping to assist me, and I was speaking with him and asked about the cinnamon rolls availability as they were not displayed, the man I was dealing with, politely said \"You know, I'm not sure, let me check in the back for you.\" As he just finished the statement the other associate yelled \"WE DON'T HAVE ANY!\" Alright sir, calm down! Came running to my head after being slightly taken back. Pretty startling to hear coming from someone you are not speaking to and from behind. I can understand he was hoping to save the man helping me some time, but all the same, assist the customer you are with before abruptly chiming in on a conversation. Then when I turned back around to the associate that was supposed to be helping me had walked away to the other room, without as much as recommendation to another item as you were out of the cinnamon rolls! I mean although the cinnamon roll was one of the reasons I went in, I would of course be buying other treats! I stood there and went back to looking at the case to make my other selections. Once the associate finished up with the women picking up, he returned to behind the counter and let me know that there were no more cinnamon rolls as the kitchen had run out of baking soda or was it powder? Whichever it was, it seems a tad silly to run out of such a key baking staple. 
We then began to go into my order and he was just the most unhelpful bakery associate I have encountered! It was like pulling teeth to get a recommendation! I get it, eating too much sweets I am sure some dental work is needed, but not when it's someone's JOB is to sell baked goods!  Also when someone inquiries about the reheating of one of your freezer products, best to have your associates well informed of how to advise a customer on doing so and making sound as though it would be just as tasty had it been fresh. I was told to \"leave the donuts out on the counter for 30 mins from them to come up to room temp and that they would taste alright\"...Yea that sounds real appetizing!...As I ran down my list of items that I was going to get he went to bag each one instead of placing them in a pastry box, which once I noticed had to ask him to do so, and he obliged. When he got back and was placing everything in the box he was multitasking and rang me out prompting me to finish the transaction and stop looking away from the screen till it was complete. It seemed as though he just wanted to be done with me and move on, but it's not as if there was anyone in line behind me...so not sure what he was rushing me for. I mean if I want to continue to look and potentially add more to my check that would seem like something that would be promoted!
Also not sure if I was over charged for a small cream puff dipped in chocolate as I drove away noticed the receipt said $4.00 for a \"large cream puff\"...My bad for not paying attention and asking.

By far one of the most disagreeable encounters I've had when walking into a bakery with such sweet treats! Please have your associates take a customer service training course! In my opinion if you're getting paid to be a customer facing associate, you had better smile with everything you have, when you talking with one!"}
{"text":"My wife and I went to have lunch, and immediatelly we noticed our waitress had an attitude towards us, but mostly towards my wife, we couldn't put our finger on it, but she was rude and she wouldn't make eye contact, through out our entire stay, food was ok, nothing special, \"over price¬°¬°, oh almost forgot, a lot of flies"}
{"text":"Julie Moreno runs a first class business!  The atmosphere, service and gluten-free choices of delicious food is worthy of a drive to get here.  
She organized a top-notch Breakfast with Santa and Mrs. Claus event yesterday to benefit teens at my non-profit, The New Foundation.
Generous patrons donated gifts for our underserved kids and Easy Financial donated a $500 check!  Cory McCloskey from Fox10 News covered the event and made it festive with Julie's guidance.  What a great place with kind staff!"}
{"text":"My friend lives in Phoenix and we were looking for a quick breakfast place that served gluten free, and wow am I glad this place came up in the search. We called to see what was gf, she responds: everything. Me: excuse me... Everything?!?..yep. Everything. Donuts, pancakes, pastries, breads... Everything. 

Upon arriving I really wanted to order three.. Of everything.. But my friend and I settled on an omelette with red potatoes, pancakes, a lemon bar, and a chocolate covered donut.. I was in heaven. It's been a long time since I've had a real donut..I usually just get those packaged-frozen-weird texture-somewhat edible ones in the gf section. 

Everything was delicious, both the sweet and the savory. Seasoning-perfect, fluffiness and texture of the baked goods-spot on. It was.. A divine experience. The inside is cute with little tables and chairs and fun wall art. Everyone was very friendly and informative. Cost was pretty affordable as its a specialty bakery. The only problem is that it's in Phoenix and not Lincoln and I can't make it one of my local haunts.

If you're avoiding da glutzens in the Phoenix area, don't pass up this gem."}
{"text":"I was expecting more with all the good reviews, but I wasn't all that impressed with my breakfast.  I had the basic breakfast which came with a pancake, eggs, sausage patty and potatoes.   I asked for bell pepper and onions in the egg, which they forgot.  The pancake was totally doughy and chewy in the middle and was not all that great.   The \"Potato hash\" was just breakfast potatoes and very bland.  I mean, it wasn't awful, it was just so so.

The sausage patty was soooo good, I think they must make it there or something.  That was the only redeeming part of this breakfast and why I would return.  And, I would return because the space was a cool spot and conveniently located and with easy parking.  The service was a bit slow, it took 10-15 mins to get my food.  I will go back and try them again, and perhaps try an omlette or something."}
{"text":"Very impressed! Coffee was delicious, staff was delightful, patio seating was refreshing. Overall, great experience. The pancakes were to die for and their syrup really made the dish. The chorizo bowl was very flavorful and perfectly put together. The atmosphere has a very clean relaxed feel. I definitely plan to come back next time I'm in Phoenix!"}
{"text":"Omg the lemon bars!! They were mind blowing beat I've ever had not to mention the excellent customer service!!"}
{"text":"Just SO good! It's SO tough to find a tasty AND allergy friendly brunch place but we finally did! Not only were we pleasantly surprised to find out they don't use soy oil but then we found out the pancakes and waffles are but-free! And when you visit a restaurant with people without allergy/food restrictions, they don't usually find anything tasty. Luckily that is not the case! The chicken IS all it's cracked up to be! They're syrup is like pure caramel! Macarons melt in your mouth! Fresh strawberry muddled lemonade or tea! We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"For May 5th wedding, the parents of bride pre-arranged and agreed to a gluten-free cake. For a lot of important people at the wedding, including the maid of honor, gluten-free was mandatory because of Celiac allergy.  On the wedding day, no cake delivered, and there is no communication from Jewels or answers to calls. Father of bride had to leave the wedding to find a cake. We had to cut a cake from the grocery store, and family members were not able to eat it. The cake portion of the wedding was ruined. Brides parents were stressed calling Jewels and figuring out an alternative. We will always remember the wedding cake fiasco from that special day. Jewels took a special moment from us."}
{"text":"I've known about their baked goodies for quite some time.  I was so excited when they opened a storefront! 

I took a friend there for lunch on Tuesday and she loved it so much that she said Jewel's will be our new hangout spot on Tuesday's.  She can't wait for the holidays to be over (when our kids go back to school) so that we can go again.  I ordered the Greek Chicken Salad Sandwich (delicious), she had the BLT and we shared the blue cheese buffalo chips.

Seriously, make this your new spot.  They are dedicated to being gluten- free (which isn't a dietary restriction for me, but hey, the food is so good!) and will take very good care of you.  Fast- casual atmosphere.  Walk up, place your order and go find a table."}
{"text":"I was looking for a quaint place to take my mother for mother's day along with my daughter that might also be able to handle my food sensitivities.  Jewel's looked like it would tick each box.  I called and made our reservation for 3 at 11:30 am outside knowing that the weather would be perfect.  I also asked if they would be able to provide me with any vegan options and the person I spoke to on the phone said they could speak to the kitchen and make sure they had either waffles or pancakes available for me.  I asked for waffles and asked if my special mother's day cupcake could be vegan as well.  She said that was no problem and promised me she would make a note of it for the kitchen.

The day came and we were running a bit behind due to the fact that traffic was pretty much a slow crawl all the way to the restaurant.   I called and they said that would be no problem at all.  We finally arrived and were told to wait a few minutes while they cleared off our table.  No problem.  Once we were taken to our table, however, we knew this wasn't going to work out.  The table was barely big enough for two, let alone three with food, drinks and mother's day memorabilia.  We asked for a bit bigger of a table and they told us they could not accommodate us right away, but we would have to wait 10 more minutes for a table to be available.  A bit put off, we agreed to wait and sat in front of the restaurant until they were able to find a table that would work after they assured us the wait would be worth it.  Finally they led us inside to a table only slightly bigger than before, but with booth space on one side which we would be able to put bags, purses, etc on.  We said this would be fine and we sat down and waited.  And waited. 

When no one showed up to take our drink order or food order we finally realized that we had to go stand in the ever growing line to put in our order for food since no one initially felt the need to share this important bit of information when we were seated.

There was only one person taking orders and making drinks and the line was long.  It was mother's day after all.  I waited in line for what seemed like forever until someone got the attention of another person in the kitchen who finally opened up a second register.  I was appalled at the extreme lack of service up until this point, and starving.

I finally make it up to put in our order and I begin by asking if the vegan waffles were available.  The lady behind the counter looks confused and begins asking almost every one of the cooks if there are any vegan waffles available.  All I see is one shake of the head after another.  Finally, one of them looks at me and says \"we don't have a special vegan waffle maker.\"  Confused I tell them I don't need anything separate from a normal waffle maker, I am just not able to have eggs or milk.  They stare at me for a moment and finally say that they can, but it will take an additional 20 minutes for them to make special vegan waffles for me.  After being assured that they would have them available and ready for me, I was very put off.  This is not at all how I imagined my perfect mother's day brunch to go.  I decide to endure my intestinal problems due to the fact that I was beyond starving at this point.  I order for the three of us and (thankfully) discovered they did, at least have a vegan cupcake for me to enjoy.  I return to sit down and we begin the long wait for our food to be ready.

Again, after what seems like forever, the food arrives and it was not at all worth the wait, the hassle or the unkempt promises.  The bacon was cold and the rest of the food was lukewarm at best.  The cupcake was good, but for that to be the only part of the mother's day that was memorable is saying something about Jewel's Cafe portion.  The place was so crowded that we could barely move around and by the time we were done the entire table was full of trash, plates and drink cups.  Only once did someone come by to ask if we needed something so we could get a refill on our coffee.

In conclusion, as a bakery with gluten free and vegan options I imagine this place could be pretty good and possibly for lunch on a weekday, but steer clear of this place if you are looking for a memorable mother's day or any other holiday experience.  They are obviously not equipped to handle as big of a crowd as they had.  We will not be returning.  Not ever."}
{"text":"This is the second time here. First time i was here, i tried the grilled cheese sandwich. I thought it greasy but tasty. This last time i tried a grilled turkey club sandwich with gf flax seed bread, that too was greasy but good. I had a red velvet cupcake, that was delish.
They make their own bread here, $8 a loaf, a bit steep, but you pay for freshness and quality. I think a good time to buy goodies is probably in the afternoon, you can buy them at a discounted price. I'd like to try their pretzels, they look so good, but you have to pre-order them.
Will i go back? Im sure i will, i want to like it. It's Gluten Free and i want to support that."}
{"text":"We have eaten at Jewel's twice in the past month for lunch and so far, we love it!  After learning of a gluten sensitivity I needed to cut it out of my diet for a while and it is so nice to have a restaurant where I don't have to search the menu for only a few items that I can eat.  The brownies, cinnamon rolls, and vegan cupcakes were delicious as well!  The kids meals for $5 are perfect and my son eats all the grilled cheese and fresh fruit that it comes with.  Great job, we will keep on coming in!"}
{"text":"I tried this place for the first time using Postmates. I ordered the Santa Fe Bowl and a muffin from whatever assortment they had that day. The bowl was ok but not out of this world amazing. I'm not a big fan of corn and the black beans/red bell pepper/corn was predominatly a corn relish. But regardless, the bowl seemed to lack a lot of flavor. I heard better things about the bakery over the actual cafe food so I was excited to try the muffin. Again not bad but a little dry. I know it's gluten free flour but maybe more bananas or something to have it not be a dry baked good."}
{"text":"The food is just ok but for time you have to wait for it your better off going to another place and snacking on something then come here and eat because your going to wait."}
{"text":"I am super excited about finding this place. Finding a all GF restaurant is awesome. The bakery goods were delicious. We drove 25 minutes away to try it out. Well worth it. 

The woman who helped us was super honest, funny and real. I believe her name was Adriana and she made the cost way better. 

The place was packed, so it was defiantly a popular place. If we could get you to open one in our town in San Diego that would be great. From a visitor to az, thanks."}
{"text":"I can not even begin to tell you how delicious these waffles are. Being gluten free, you really miss things like this. If I lived in Phoenix, I would treat myself to a meal here every week."}
{"text":"So much love for this gem!! Ashlee takes the best of care too!! She is always on point with a packed house! The food is so consistently incredible and plentiful and delicious!"}
{"text":"Ok can we just take a moment to thank the stars for this bakery? Always switching up the baked goods and keeping the quality top notch. Today I tried a new creation and I think it warrants an updated review. White chocolate Chocolate chip cookie crust cheesecake with fudge, fresh whip cream and a beautiful white chocolate cookie to top it off. Needless to say I should have just bought the whole thing. Well, there were only 3 pieces left but you get the idea. If you see this on the case just get it. Don't ask questions and thank me later ;)"}
{"text":"I bought some treats to take home to New Jersey because there were vegan options for my daughter.  3 days later, the brownies, muffins and apple bars are still so scrumptious that we are going to place an order online and spring for the shipping cost."}
{"text":"Today my fianc√© and I went their for breakfast and I had accidentally left my wallet on the table. I called to see if someone had picked it up but the owner had said she did not hear of anything. I then went down to the restaurant and talked to the waiter who serves us and said he didn't see a wallet but took my number down. 

I then went to the barbershop next door thinking I maybe dropped it in the parking lot. The kind barber said he saw me eating their earlier and told the waiter that I had left a wallet on the table. (The same employee who I questioned). The barber went over the with me to confront the guy who then admitted to his owner that he took it off the table and left it in his apron but it was gone. 

Turns out the employee took it home but when I threatened I would have the police come he magically went home and said he accidentally switched aprons and now my wallet appeared. Too bad I'm afraid he copied my credit cards numbers down and had to cancel everyone of them. 

I worked in the restaurant industry for many year and I would never think of doing this to someone. The owner was very cooperative and helped resolve the situation quickly.  I hate to always blame an establishment for one bad egg, but it left a sour taste in my mouth this time.  I hope in the future I  can return there with different results!"}
{"text":"What a treasure! Everything is gluten-free (and absolutely delicious), the atmosphere is relaxed, friendly, and charming, and the staff were so accommodating and patient with us as we took our sweet time ordering from the lengthy menu. This place is a MUST try whether or not you're gluten-free."}
{"text":"I love this place.  I been coming here since it first open and they have changed their menu a few times; their menu is always on the healthy side unless you are going strictly to the cupcakes!  Which are delicious! !!!
Only thing that bothers me is that they probably need more employees.  They always seem to be so busy hardly anyone checks on you, the line to order is so long,  and I can tell how stressed the cashier is. Other than the service the food is real tasty."}
{"text":"We have been anxiously waiting for Jewel's to open for the past 6 months, we are regulars of the baked goods from the farmer's market and have been really excited to have it in the neighborhood. So maybe my expectations were too high from my conversation with them at the farmer's market. 

The positives:
*Great ambience and location
*Coconut creamer for the coffee :) -awesome to have a non-dairy option
*Vegan muffins - we had the apple cinnamon and it was really good
*the potato/kale hash was great

Things that could be better:
*The line is confusing about which side to enter, therefore, we waited for a couple huge groups to go in front of us coming from the exit side of the line before we were helped, its probably hard for the cashier to know who is next-maybe a sign would be helpful?
*There were no vegan cupcakes or scones available (11am), only muffins, we were really excited to be able to buy cupcakes and disappointed when they had multiple other, but all with dairy. We normally go to Treehouse, but this is so much closer. 
*Our food (one order) took about 20 minutes, this might get worked out as they settle in, but it was a long wait (one of the chefs did come talk to us and apologized)
* the smoothie tasted like pureed kale, they did ask for feedback on it, which was great, but doesn't help my situation at the moment, i tossed it when i got home 
* there are minimal vegan options on the menu, I saw 3, I guess I was expecting more based on their baked goods and other options at the farmers market (so this could be my own issue, but I was really disappointed, there is such a need for that in this area)

Overall, the food was ok, the ambience is great! I didn't try the coffee but it looked good. So, I would go back for coffee and if in stock, a vegan cupcake, but not again for breakfast. 

Glad their is a dedicated gluten free bakery, but I would love to see more vegan options too."}
{"text":"Be careful if you order online, their menu is not updated and they are not very friendly and accommodating for their mistake. First experience here, not a pleasant one. Staff is rude."}
{"text":"Excellent gluten free menu! Items that I haven't ever seen before that I could have- took a cinnamon bun to go today!"}
{"text":"Free cookie if you check in with yelp!  YES please.  I got the vegan peanut butter cookie which was wonderful.  I made the mistake of getting a donut though and it was no bueno. :(  I'm sure they have other tasty items but I struck out big time!"}
{"text":"We came here for breakfast after a long drive from California. I have NCGS and gluten triggers horrible inflammation and digestive distress, so eating out is always a pain. Luckily, this place has gluten free everything! Oh and the pancakes are heavenly! For being gluten free, they were nice and fluffy and had great texture. They were so good, I also snapped up a few items from their bakery. I'll be back here, often."}
{"text":"Open during the week day, this unique caf√© anchors a strip of shops on the corner of 40th St. and Thomas.  There are very tempting desserts and sweet breads.  
One meal we ordered was chicken and waffles.  This combo came with a sweet and a spicy sauces and was a big winner for taste.  My order was a portabello mushroom burger.  With a delicious bun that reminded me of Schlotski's bread, the sandwich was served with fries and plenty of veggies on the burger.
The Green Tea was notably good.   With free refills, the thirst-quenching, drink encouraged us to enjoy a healthy hydration.   For dessert we tried a chocolate cookie, mochaccino caramel cupcake, and pecan pie.  They were fresh and delicious and a great take-home item.  These are part of a selection that includes scones, pies, donuts and bars.  
Anthony was our server and kept us satisfied with ideal suggestions for food and beverage.  To my delight, the owner/chef came out from the kitchen and spent time visiting with customers.  This place is a great lunch time treat that will cater to vegans and the glutton-free crowd while pleasing their omnivorous friends."}
{"text":"Good, delicious, and wholesome food. Staff was great, service was good and food was delicious. I had the chicken and waffles with an extra egg on the side.  The green berry tea was also a treat. I definitely would visit this place when stopping in Phoenix. 

You could tell they use great ingredients as the food also felt good after eating.

Good atmosphere, wireless internet, and nice patio."}
{"text":"The BEST gluten-free dessert options in the valley. Helpful staff, decent prices."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff , their chicken and waffles are delicious ! I went in the evening would love to come back and try they're breakfast/lunch menu"}
{"text":"I adore this place... and not just because it's close to home! It's a cute and cozy little cafe - so nice and quiet! The workers are all really sweet, and the brunch is pretty freakin' good!

I had the chilaquiles, and they were superb, even to-go. The husband had the bisquits and gravy with chorizo. He wasn't over-wowed by them, but said he'd go back. 

We tried a couple of their baked goods: the lemon-blueberry scone was alright. The maple-bacon cinnamon roll is a good idea... but could use some work. Our roll was mostly... well, roll. It needs more glaze, and more filling - it was so bready that it was hard to tell that there was any bacon involved. The winner for us was the blueberry loaf. That was pretty awesome (and I'm a pretty good home baker, so... I don't do baked good compliments often). 

I returned later in the week for lunch, and had the Red Chile Chicken salad - it was really good! I wish it was a bigger portion, and I wish it was tossed a little better - all the good stuff was at the bottom and I didn't realize it until I had eaten almost all the greens!!! 

The \"Cafe\" part of the name is kinda misleading - I thought I'd be able to get a latte there. They have Cartel coffee, but no espresso drinks. If I was still a student, I'd be here ALL the time studying!"}
{"text":"Best gluten free restaurant in Phoenix! Solid spot for breakfast, brunch or lunch. They have a great selection of dishes to choose from.

The classic breakfast platter hits the spot with a nice fluffy and tasty pancake, eggs, zesty potatoes and kale, with your choice of tasty chorizo, homemade sausage or mouth-watering bacon...the kind that would certainly make Ron Swanson proud!

And of course, after your tasty meal, you can never go wrong with any of their delicious baked goodies!"}
{"text":"I love this place!!! They have yummy chicken and waffles and donuts! I highly recommend it. If you can't eat gluten, their entire menu is gluten free!! And it is extensive. YUM"}
{"text":"1st and not the last visit. The food was amazing. I had breakfast and my wife had a BLT.  The service was top notch. I highly recommend"}
{"text":"I love that this place is gluten-free and the pastries are so yummy. I can't wait to go back and try more stuff!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic! Food tastes homemade and spectacular, chicken and waffles is to die for.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the staff isn't too friendly. They usually seem annoyed that it's super busy (which it has been everytime I've been there) other than that- I love this place!"}
{"text":"Adorable bakery and brunch spot. Such character! Staff is awesome and so accommodating to dietary restrictions. Bakery treats are delicious and ever changing!"}
{"text":"Came in for lunch today because I was intrigued by their plant-based menu. Well they no longer have a plant-based menu... so that was off putting. 

Got their garden tacos, but they were missing the quinoa... which is one of the reasons I chose them! Nonetheless they were delicious, but lacked the protein I would've liked. I wish it was communicated to me prior. 

The front of house staff is okay, some rude some curt some friendly- all in all, not consistent. Food service was slow. 

I would come back with company to try a few more things on the menu, but I'm in no hurry."}
{"text":"This was my first time. I've been looking for a good chicken  sandwich. So I decided to stop and give this place a try and the first thing that I seen in their menu it was there Cali chicken sandwich so I decided to order to go it was delicious. I'm definitely coming back to this place"}
{"text":"I love this bakery!! I'm so glad a found a place where gluten free food actually taste amazing!! Their cakes are just the best. I bought one for my daughter's birthday and everyone kept asking me where I got it from. Once I told them they couldn't believe it was a gluten free cake.They do an incredible job!! 

Even if you don't eat gluten free, this place is a must go!! I would highly recommend to anyone I know!!"}
{"text":"Loved eating at Jewels!! Sometimes, I just need a quiche, and they're not easy to find. But Jewel's has 'em, and they are yummy. I was a little worried about the Feta Cheese, as I don't normally eat Feta, but it was super good. It came with potatoes and an awesome selection of fruit.

I'll be back, thanks Jewels!!!"}
{"text":"Excellent #glutenfree food + customer service! Highly recommended from #TheFoodClick!"}
{"text":"Gluten free t-shirts are the dress code for the staff so I'm guessing that's their thing.  Place is a bit crowded although they do have a patio.  The chorizo is good and I like that you can order it with the basic breakfast.  

Three of us went, my order came out first.  15 minutes later (not exaggerating) the second order came out.  20 minutes after that the third order came out.  The waitress said the cooks were struggling with the special.  Seems kind of odd they would put a dish on the menu that they couldn't execute."}
{"text":"Delicious food.  I had no idea the restaurant is gluten free. They have mastered everything from quiche to pancakes, and all sorts of wonderful baked goods. Nice selection of iced and hot teas too! This is a great place to meet a friend for breakfast."}
{"text":"Tried two flatbreads and a cupcake.  Would never have guessed any of it was gluten free.  The cupcake even fooled my teens!  The staff was really nice and the d√©cor was fun.  I would definitely go again and make sure friends with gluten challenges know all about it."}
{"text":"The food is great, the service not so much. They recently changed what used to be a QSR type restaurant to a \"sit down and have a waitress serve and expect a tip\" type place unless you dine out. It does seem the time it takes for your food to come out is longer than any other place I've been too. Also, if you are only \"ordering out\" you cannot sit at a table to wait, you must stand awkwardly in the corner waiting for your food to come out eventually. The homemade gluten free bread and deserts are amazing though."}
{"text":"First time trying this bakery. It had bomb waffles :) definitely coming back for those. However, the cupcake frosting tasted store bought and the cupcake itself smelt burnt and was a little burnt."}
{"text":"Food was decent but I was SO disappointed that they use canola oil which is a super inflammatory oil, nothing is organic and they don't source quality meat. Nothing is quality about their food, they are just gluten free. Really wish I would have just gone to True Foods, I feel terrible after eating their food."}
{"text":"Very disappointed! We used to come here often and loved it. Not only is their new model inefficient (wait to be seated vs order at the counter and sit... what if you want just coffee), but the service and food were both disappointing. Toast wasn't toasted and crisp but just grilled. Coffees were brought one at a time and were just ok. Service was slow and not friendly/ pleasant. Sad to see a great place go down the drain  We won't be returning... too many other choices and life's short to waste time on bad experiences."}
{"text":"Don't like their change from coffee shop bakery to a semi okay restaurant.  Food is still good, staff friendly  but lost the small neighbor feel. Hours were changed, opening later and staying open later in the day."}
{"text":"Jewels Bakery & Cafe is one of my daughter's favorite restaurants. She has Celiac Disease and we have been coming here for nearly four years.
I ordered the green shredded beef chili tacos. They had just the right amount of heat to them. My daughter ordered the chocolate chip pancakes and my husband ordered the Arizona omelette with home fries. Everything was fresh, hot and delicious.
We had great customer service. Our waitress was pleasant and efficient. The cafe was clean and bright. It's a nice place to come for gluten free food. The prices are reasonable. The portions are nice sized. We will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Cool spot, definitely a restaurant vibe more than a coffee shop. Though Jewel's serves Press Coffee and serves pastries, it reminds me of Matt's Big Breakfast in Downtown Phoenix. I felt a little awkward bringing my backpack in and reading for a little bit as opposed to coming in for breakfast.

GF kitchen and free cookie on check in! Do it!"}
{"text":"The place its self is awesome. Love the chairs and tables, so simple and so chic. 
The service was friendly and attentive.
The food was ok. I ordered the quiche and a decaf coffee w/ a molasses cookie. The food was good... the only thing is the crust like the cookie was rock solid.:-/"}
{"text":"Half of the family is gluten free. Lots of baked goods. Lots of protein options. Clearly made with care. The best gluten free pancakes so far in Phoenix. Best gluten free biscuits and gravy. Best gluten free sticky buns.

They also serve Cartel Coffee which is great."}
{"text":"This place is adorable and such a great  addition to this neighborhood- the best part? They serve Cartel coffee! I can really only speak to the coffee and the zucchini loaf I ordered and both were very good. I was nervous to order a Cortado, since it wasn't on their coffee menu, but a sharp employee overheard me ordering a Cortado with the cashier and he certainly delivered! The zucchini loaf, which also happens to be diary free, was delicious and not overly sweet. Those with a sweet tooth are in for a real treat. Their pastry counter has it all. And their breakfast menu looked even more enticing. I absolutely look forward to enjoying a meal at Jewel's sometime soon."}
{"text":"We are new to the area and were thrilled to hear about this gluten free bakery. It's about 30 min from our house but I heard it's well worth it.
Today is my husbands birthday so I called and placed a custom order for a dozen vanilla cake pops with white chocolate coating. 
Unfortunately, there was a miscommunication somewhere and I ended up with chocolate cake pops with chocolate frosting. Not ok especially since neither my husband nor I care for chocolate at all. Total ruin for his birthday; however when I called to discuss this with the bakery, they were very kind and even offered to redo the order and bring it to us. If we hadn't had plans for the rest of the day, I would've taken that opportunity. That was a very wonderful thing for them to offer and I appreciate it. 
Fortunately, I bought two vanilla cupcakes while there and the cupcakes will be my husbands birthday cake. Not ideal but it's the best I've got right now. 
I will probably try them again solely bc of the great customer service I received but won't do a custom order for awhile. I think they're worth a try."}
{"text":"I can appreciate a restaurant that offers a full gluten free menu! When we walk in, the cashier was really friendly and had I not stop at my favorite coffee shop beforehand, I would've ordered coffee here. 

We proceeded to order the famous chicken and waffles and the breakfast sandwich. I liked the chicken and waffles - it tasted fresh and the sauce that came with it was perfect! I could've used a little more chicken though as they were a little stingy on the chicken.

The breakfast sandwich was ok - a little dry and lacked flavor. It could use some avocado and a type of spread. Since I checked in on Yelp, I got a free GF chocolate chip cookie and that was delicious! 

Overall, I like the restaurant and I love eating gluten free (when I can) so this place definitely allows me to do just that!"}
{"text":"Wow, cant say enough about the new dinner menu at Jewel's! Just got back into town from a trip and my husband took myself and the kiddos to dinner here...it was awesome!  I highly recommend the French Dip appetizer and the Beef Stroganoff.  We all had something different and there were happy diners all around.  Thank you for expanding into dinner:)"}
{"text":"What a fun spot for brunch! Not only was the food delicious but the service was excellent. I felt very taken care of at Jewels. The menu is super eclectic as well - not sure where else one could get a delicious waffle sandwich. I got the veggie omelette made with egg whites and cooked with no butter and oil (thank you! I love restaurants that are happy to accommodate when I'm trying to watch my calories). The side of potatoes was sooo good and crispy too! 

My boyfriend got the breakfast waffle sandwich. I had a few bites and It was amazing. I can't believe that was a gluten free waffle because it tasted sooo good and it was so fluffy and really soaked up the syrup. 

We shared a cold brew and my boyfriend finished off his meal with the peanut butter dream brownie. Nothing short of delicious. 

Service was fast as well."}
{"text":"Our son is dfgf and he was so excited to visit today. The bites I had were fantastic, not overly sweet with complex flavor and \"regular\" texture. Not just as good, BETTER"}
{"text":"In Love with this place! First time here and had the most delicious cinnamon roll with an egg and sausage sandwich."}
{"text":"Gluten free or not the food is great. I had the chicken an waffles and the chicken is very tender and the coating very good. I tried the green chili pork tacos. I'm not sure I would order them again, but had good flavor. I also had chunky monkey coffee, I was unsure at first but it was good. Our waiter Conor was very nice and made sure we were taken care of, way above average service. Next time I will get a massive plate of the chicken."}
{"text":"I drove 25 miles to eat here with a friend with food allergies. This is the first place I have eaten at that had all gluten free and tasted amazing. You would never know! The dessert and breakfast was great. Service was great and fast. I will make the drive again."}
{"text":"I just want to say what fantastic cakes they bake here. We ordered a confetti and a red velvet for a baby shower and man were they delicious. I  would never know it was gluten free, so moist and rich. I highly recommend if you need a cake for any event. They delivered on time and when there was a slight mishap they fixed it right away. Classy business."}
{"text":"The apple cinnamon pancakes are delicious, and my boyfriend loves the pile of bacon and all of the other bacon products! The decor is also very cute, I love the real flowers, very nice touch! Will definitely be back soon."}
{"text":"Jewel's  makes delicious gluten free breakfasts and perhaps the best gluten free cupcakes I have ever tasted. They are by far better than some cupcakes with gluten in them. And not so sugary like some other gluten free cupcakes I have had. In a word they are perfection. I recommend the Almond Joy one. 

The breakfast biscuits are also delicious. 

So happy this place opened and takes gluten free seriously and deliciously!"}
{"text":"Seriously the best place ever. This is all gluten free, but trust me it's better than any gluten filled brunch you'll ever have. Specials are great, always new treats to try, and great coffee. Best part is it's locally owned. I've watched these ladies hustle their way from farmers market to brick and mortar and I couldn't be happier to see this place succeeding. I don't even know what of recommend for someone to try because everything I've eaten here has been incredible."}
{"text":"Such a cute little place ! I had no idea that it existed. We had the build your own grilled cheese with turkey , Caramelized onions and cheddar cheese. It wasn't super cheesy but it was pretty good. Also it came on gluten free bread. Did I mention this bakery is gluten free and organic. I also ordered the Caesar salad which had chicken , some sort of grain as well light Caesar dressing. It was absolutely amazing , the lettuce was fresh. I really want to go back and try their baked goods and breakfast. Give them a try !!"}
{"text":"This is one of the best gluten free restaurant in the valley!  Friendly, accommodating and great food.   It is so nice to be able to eat at a restaurant and know you are safe from gluten.    Ashlee is the best. One of the hardest working servers I have ever seen.   Come visit Jewels.  You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"No. No. No, no, no, no. 

I've been meaning to try this place for quite a while. The menu looked fun and any place with the word \"bakery\" in it already has brownie points (heh). We roll in on a Saturday around lunchtime and the first impression is totally meh. Nothing special about the space, and the set up is confusing with virtually nonexistent signage. Do you sit yourself? Are there servers? I see a counter, but no menu posted. Where do you order? No clue. We get in a line that was moving at glacial speed, which I guess is good as it gave us time to peruse the paper menus and ogle the baked goods. They brought out a fresh tray of salted caramel brownies while we were standing there, so foolish me thought we'd hit the jackpot, the holy trinity of carbs, fat, and sugar, fresh off the press. 

I ask what the soup of the day is, and -- whoops! -- they're out of soup. Well, okay, grilled cheese with avocado and fries. My SO orders quiche, but -- whoops! -- they're out of that. He defaults to the meat loaf sandwich, and we ask about pop -- there's no fountain, and a cooler up front is practically empty. Well, that's all they got there in that little cooler: chocolate milk, coconut water, cucumber soda, root beer, and a couple of fruit sodas. All fully loaded -- no zero/low cal options, not even water. (Lest I sound like the world's fattest hypocrite, I will stuff my face but I don't drink my calories, unless they are alcohol. Period.) The employee is totally disinterested and unapologetic. We add one of those caramel brownies and before you know it, lunch is $35. For lunch!? Ohhhhh-kay. While we're ordering, an employee comes out from the kitchen through one of those swinging doors, and when the kitchen side is visible I catch a printed sign saying something like all employees using disposable cups for personal beverages will be charged $1 a cup. Fucking tacky. I hope I hallucinated it. Even if you're that much of an asshole to treat employees that way, I'd hope you'd have the sense to put the sign somewhere where customers might not see it. 

We sit. And wait. And wait. And wait. It took well over half an hour for the food to come out. My sandwich and fries were stone cold. The slices of avocado were practically paper thin. The bread was dry and hard. The \"meatloaf\" sandwich got the same treatment, with the portion of meatloaf so thin my SO suggested that it might just be meat paste instead. His sandwich was full on burnt on one side. His fries were like one giant mass of fries all stuck together in a lump. His meal was pretty much inedible. I hoped the fresh brownie would maybe at least somewhat redeem the situation, but its edges were hard and even its middle was dry. The flavor was bland and I've made countless batches of brownies from Ghiardhelli mix that were 1000x better than these. 

The experience would be completely maddening but let's face it, it crossed that line and is now just frankly absurd. I have NO IDEA how this place is in business. I don't know how it has any reviews above two stars. It's beyond \"oh, they were having an off day\". It's thievery. $35 for an inedible meal. No one acknowledged the fact it took half an hour to get the food, and apparently no one acknowledged the fact the food was cold and burnt -- they just sent it out anyway. Patently offensive. There are way too many other reliable and delicious lunch options in the area for that price, and even much less -- save your time and money."}
{"text":"I didn't think I would ever have to write this but after coming here since the first day open to now the food quality has greatly decreased. After having many thing's off the menu and always giving it another shot, today's biscuits and gravy was the last straw for a while. The gravy was bland while adding so much salt, the potatoes had little flavor, and the biscuits were to hard to even cut with my fork. The atmosphere is great and I will give it another shot after the new year but my experiences continue to be no good. Hopefully other peoples experiences have been better than mine within the last year. I can't say I will recommend this place while I continue to see poor reviews, I am sure others are seeing what Im seeing after being a such frequent customer."}
{"text":"Just moved down the road from Jewels and came here on accident after looking for another restaurant. And boy, am I glad I did! I was diagnosed with celiac disease 25 years ago and it's been amazing to watch it transform over the years. This place is by far one of the best GF restaurants I have been to. Delicious food, all gluten free, and the desserts look awesome. I will definitely have to control the amount of times I stop by so I do not gain 200lbs eating here all the time. Although I already have a breakfast date scheduled for tomorrow here. Uh oh. Highly recommend!"}
{"text":"Since finding out a year ago that I was gluten intolerant, I have looked far and wide for good gluten free options at restaurants, and while most are good, they just aren't the same as their gluten laden counterparts...UNTIL now!  Jewels Bakery and Cafe is awesome!  I haven't had one thing there that was bad & that's huge considering that a majority of foods that are gluten free taste \"off\" or taste grainy or like cardboard to me.  
They are a little on the pricey side, but I will gladly pay for good food that is gluten free!"}
{"text":"We stumbled upon Jewel's Bakery via google maps the other day, and were absolutely delighted with breakfast. Our server was so sweet and accommodating, the food was incredible- some of the best gluten free I've had. Prices are incredible, considering almost everywhere upcharges for gluten free items. Service wasn't super fast, but the servers were attentive, helpful, and everything was awesome. Will definitely be back and recommend!"}
{"text":"I have eaten here for years, but starting this year it has been falling behind a bit. I go there and the bakery options have dwindled to the same items over and over. I used to walk in excited to see what sort of creation I could find, especially in their reduced price freezer they don't have anymore. No more donuts except on days they 'tell you on Facebook' but somehow never see. I used to love their flatbreads and breakfast sandwhich but they have changed their menu so many times, and now a lot of it are things you can easily get at another restaurant, like bowls and pancakes. I got excited awhile ago seeing biscuits and gravy, but the biscuit is not buttery at all, and the sausage gravy, as well, does not have much flavor. I kinda HAVE to go there though because of the gluten free aspect, but it has lost a lot of its appeal"}
{"text":"I never knew this place was located so close to where we live but I'm glad we found it! It's a cute little cafe and the food is delicious! I had their chicken and waffles and they were delicious!!"}
{"text":"Love this place!Gluten free food here is amazing from the shrimp taco to the chicken & waffles."}
{"text":"As always, when I try someplace new for breakfast, I get the platter or the basic breakfast. Theirs is to die for!

Agave syrup with my pancake. Crispy kale sprinkled on top of my breakfast potatoes. Scrambled eggs with the perfect texture. 

Their brewed coffee is divine as well. 

I cannot wait to go back!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few more time, since I work right up stairs. Just wanted to let everyone know that I'm I've just grown to like this place even more. I've tried a few other coffees like the German Chocolate mocha and a caramel latte with coconut milk. I also tried the grilled cheese and I've had some cookies and bread pudding. None of these items disappoint, they are all good choices!"}
{"text":"Every time I come here I am disappointed. Because it's local and a neighborhood spot, I really want to support.  But EVERYTIME the service is TERRIBLE.  Rude, not helpful, and SLOW!  Even if I call ahead, the food is not ready and The order is wrong. Today I wanted to use Local Dines Certificate and they insisted that there wasn't an offer for this restaurant, although I pulled it up on the ap and was able  show them. Once again, rude, short and NO Smiles to be seen"}
{"text":"My daughter's wedding cake from Jewel's cost far more than any other bakery would have charged in town.  Therefore, I expected perfection.  While the cake itself tasted amazing, the decorating was horrible.   When our event planner found out how much I paid for the cake, she was amazed of how poorly decorated it was.  She said it was very unprofessional looking.  It was a two layer cake with  vines up the side.  Whoever put the cake together, didn't even bother to make up the vines from one layer to the next.  The flowers on top of the cake were supposed to match the flowers for the wedding, but someone put basic frosting roses on top of the cake that could have been made by any armature cake decorator.    Bottom line, if you  want cake that tastes good, go to Jewels, but if you want your cake to be beautifully decorated for your wedding day, don't use Jewels."}
{"text":"Jewel's is so very good! I've been gluten free due to Celiacs disease my whole life. Walking into a completely GF restaurant and ordering scrumptious food is like  dream come true!"}
{"text":"I love this place, it's definitely my favorite restaurant! The staff is always friendly, the food is always fantastic, and they have AMAZING pastries that even my non gluten free friends love. I haven't disliked anything I've tried (but the chicken and waffles are a strong favorite). It can get VERY busy at times, but think about it - how many restaurants are completely gluten free? Not many, at least not that I've found. In any case, give this place a try!"}
{"text":"Everything was amazing. I mean everything (4 kids and 6 adults). Minus one star for not refilling water jug and a bug that was there for the whole hour right by it."}
{"text":"Our youngest has Juvenile Arthritis. His gluten-free diet has helped to alleviate his symptoms; however, it leaves him longing for donuts, cookies, etc. This cafe is his new favorite spot to eat!! He was so excited that he could order ANYTHING on the menu!!!! He had the hamburger and we treated him to a rocky road brownie. He was so happy and wouldn't stop talking about how good everything was! The brownie caused him quite the dilemma as he lamented, \"It's so good, I want to eat it all up, but I want to eat it slowly!\" 
The staff were very friendly and knowledgeable, making this a wonderful experience all around."}
{"text":"Messed up my online order (missing ingredients), absolutely RUDE AND UNPROFESSIONAL when I contacted them about it. Made me feel like they were \"too busy with the holiday rush\" to even entertain fixing the problem, excuse after excuse. NOT RECOMMENDED!"}
{"text":"Gluten-free paradise here in Arcadia. I've been here 3 times this week and everything is good. Cinnamon rolls, donuts, sandwiches and pizza. If you are gluten free and in Phoenix, this MUST be your next stop. Just make sure to get there before mid-afternoon. They close at 3 on weekends and 3:30 weekdays."}
{"text":"It was okay, very clean, nice atmosphere but the food itself was a little disappointing."}
{"text":"Awesome service, awesome people great food and baked goods. The coffee isn't to Bad either. The decor reminds me of little coffee shops in portland, oregon. My kind of place. I would definitely comeback and recommend this place to anyone."}
{"text":"Just had breakfast there with my best friend. Our waiter Connor was really funny and friendly. He was also very attentive and genuinely helpful. Also the coffee was delicious! I'm very picky about my coffee and I could tell that their coffee is of high quality."}
{"text":"Absolutely love this cute little bakery and cafe! I love that I never have to worry about gluten here. Also, Connor is an amazing server! Kudos to Jewels!"}
{"text":"This is a 10 Star Cafe!!! My friend recommended this place to me and said I had to try it! I couldn't have been more pleased with my experience at Jewel's Bakery and Cafe. I stood in line and people were telling me what a GREAT place it is. I haven't had a doughnut in 5 years... it was DELICIOUS!!!  I went on to purchase Two Sandwiches, 2 Doughnuts, 2 Scones, Cookies and Sweet Bread and a Loaf of Bread and Two Iced Teas... Everything was amazing!!! Being Gltuen Free for 4 years has changed my life and transformed my health. However, finding a place such as Jewel's has not been found here in Temecula, CA - I would highly recommend this Cafe and since I visit AZ fairly often, I plan on coming back again and again!

P.s. I took everything home and shared half with my beautiful daughter who also cannot eat Gluten.... She was thrilled and ate her doughnut as fast as I did :o)"}
{"text":"Friendly, sincere, unpretentious and the gluten free waffles and pancakes are amazing.  A happy breakfast experience."}
{"text":"I have died and gone to gluten free heaven. The chicken and waffles are better than I have even had in the south when I used to eat gluten. It's a good thing I don't live in phoenix because I'd never leave this place.... I think there's actually space on the patio for a tent. Maybe I'll stay and have another cinnamon roll."}
{"text":"I love love love this place! Phoenix is SO lucky to have a decicated gluten-free facility/restaurant/bakery/cafe right in the heart of Arcadia! This is THE BEST PLACE IN TOWN!"}
{"text":"I planned a birthday party for my Mother-In-Law's birthday. Unfortunately our friend who was baking the cake had to go into surgery. I needed an equally fabulous cake as the one we had planned to be the centerpiece and Jewels Bakery saved the day. They gave us a beautiful Frita Kahlo inspired cake on short notice that was delicious. Every one at the party said it was stunning and took pictures. Thanks Jewel's Bakery."}
{"text":"I really do like this place, however things lately have been very inconsistent. I've had the iced mocha with coconut milk three different times within a couple of weeks and it's been different each time. The menu has dropped many favorites and been streamlined to the point of being a little boring. 
I'm not sure if I will keep coming, however it sadly does not rate as one of my favorites any longer. Hopefully they will step it up. Open to trying them again, but coming less and less."}
{"text":"Anthony my server made this first timer feel welcome and appreciated as a customer.
Today's visit was just for coffee and a cinnamon roll. BTW this maple glazed cinnamon roll with bacon crumbles is a whole new level of awesomeness. I'm a cookie fanatic and am happy to report that my free cookie with CHECK-IN was delish.

I'll be back soon for breakfast, especially after Jennifer the shift manager is going to the tables making sure the customers are happy. Great service trumps much for this YELPER.

I like this place. The decor made me think somebody loved collecting random chairs and opened a cafe so they could display them. Goldilocks would have a field day. This place is cozy but also urban hip with a dash of industrial. Chatty crowd here for a Friday near mid-day, gives a good vibe.
For the neighborhood this little shopping center (40 Palms) is very nice. I've reviewed three great eats in here already.

They have full breakfast and lunch menus in addition to the off beat bakery selections."}
{"text":"The gluten free donuts offered here are the best I've ever had. They actually smell like a donut, like a proper real don't.  They aren't cake like a all and have a perfect crispy outside and are smothered in icing. I want another one just writing this.

Other fabulous items... Gf Ginger molasses cookies, cupcakes, macaroons, gf flour mixes for cookies and cornbread mix. They also do breakfast which is delicious. 

On a side note, they rock at cakes too. Last year my husband and I popped in to grab a cake for our wedding party. Our guests had no idea it was gluten free and were saying how delicious it was. I recommend placing a custom order though and not being spontaneous like us!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! You have to try the chicken and waffles!!! To die for! Can't wait to go back and try more items!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Local, gluten free and amazing. Great service with a fun ambience. A must try. Yummy full breakfast, lunch and desserts."}
{"text":"Update to my review: Finally got to try this place. The staff is SO friendly and service is great. My cold-brew was tasty and they offer coconut milk along with the creamer/sugar selection so that was really nice. I'm leaving the review as 3-star because I found my sausage and egg breakfast sandwich to be pretty dry and bland. Also the menu online doesn't match the menu they offer in the store, so don't be one of those people who looks ahead and decides what you want... they may not offer it. My experience doesn't really seem to match all the good reviews so maybe I will try it again down the road.

Original review: I would love to try this place out but the two times I have stopped by before work they have still had the doors locked at 7:10am even though the sign on the door says open at 7am. :( :( :("}
{"text":"Great neighborhood spot. Great vibe, great food, free wifi, relaxing and enjoyable atmosphere."}
{"text":"When I was walking in and saw a couple leaving and the man said \"we have to pick a better place next time\" I should have taken the hint.  I tried to order 2 different dishes and they told me they were out of the ingredients.  I then ordered the protein bowl which is supposed to contain chicken, quinoa, rice and veggies.  when it arrived at my table there were a few scoops of quinoa and a few mushrooms and the whole thing was literally drenched in balsamic vinegar. It was inedible.  I brought my plate up to the cashier and asked where the chicken and rice was and they said oh im sorry we are out. I also asked why they found it necessary to drown the quinoa with vinegar and they said oh thats how we serve it.  I politely asked for a refund and left.  I was not happy with how they handle their business and would never dine here again. I also overheard a woman in the restaurant commenting on the baked goods have absolutely no flavor.  Thankfully I found another wonderful place for brunch close by I would avoid this stinker"}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to eat and decided to give it a try. It's super cute and completely gluten free. I had the bacon dish which was just scrambled eggs and a lot of awesome bacon -very tasty. Fiance had the eggs benny which was different and not the traditional. It wasn't bad but we didn't like the bread part on the bottom. It also had a TON of sauce. It was still pretty good. The cookies though are AMAZING!

I would go back here for another try at the food and for sure the baking. The staff is super cute and nice so that makes it worth it as well."}
{"text":"Love, love, love  this place!! My sister and I come at least once a week, more if we can! The cauliflower bites, waffle with shredded pork and the chicken shawarma are downright amazing dishes. We refer everyone at work with a gluten allergy to stop by and check it out. We never leave disappointed!"}
{"text":"2.5 really. The good, the bad, and the ugly

The Good:

Walked into a very inviting space and a nice location (near my home) with ample parking. The gal behind the counter was super helpful and very courteous. All the baked goods looked awesome, and the molasses cookie we finished our meal with was freakin amazing. 

The Bad:

The pork sandwich. I never figured you could have a pulled pork sandwich that could be dry, but sure enough... The bun on this thing was a disaster, sapping all moisture and deliciousness from the pork. About half way through I discarded the top bun and it got better, but...chips on the side were just ok. Not a great sandwich by any means. 

The Ugly:

The kale salad. Are you freaking kidding me? Giant, and I do mean GIANT pieces of kale with some vinegar dressing and beets and peppers. The beets and peppers were fine, but what the hell am I supposed to do with these sandal sized pieces of kale? No chiffonade, no nothing. Bizarre to say the least and inedible to say a whole lot more. 

I am certainly willing to give this place another shot (perhaps for breakfast, perhaps a different sandwich) and the baked goods are a for sure, just avoid the kale salad at all cost."}
{"text":"Being gluten free it's hard to find a really good breakfast place. Well this place, hands down is the best gluten free breakfast I have ever eaten. Service was quick and friendly. Portion size is hefty as well. I ordered the waffle with strawberries, my husband ordered the French toast and my daughter had the kids breakfast. We all thoroughly enjoyed our food. Prices were also reasonable considering the portion size. Would definitely eat here again!"}
{"text":"Ordered a cake for my wifey's birthday.  In short it was amazing!!!!  I'm not gluten free but ive tasted quite a few GF items from restaurants and grocery store.  This did not at all have an odd flavor to it and just tasted like a delicious 'snicker doodle' flavor cake.   And everyone at Jewels was so helpful and friendly!!  When I picked up the cake, I got a delicious latte too.   We will be back soon to try some more of the menu."}
{"text":"Jewel Cafe and Bakery is a gluten free haven. It has everything under the sun for fellow gluten free folks- or for anyone looking for some Sunday morning comfort food. The service is amazing and the servers, chefs, hostesses, and owners are so kind and welcoming- they also give the best recommendations. I have never had anything that I didn't like on the menu- but the fried chicken and waffles are delish. This place is a must in the Phoenix area, check it out."}
{"text":"Who knew there was a gluten free bakery in town??? My best friend just showed me this pace today and it's seriously amazing! I live on the west side of town, but this is well worth the drive. The staff is very friendly and knowledgable about the ingredients of all their naked goods and lunch menu items. 
The decor is very nice too! They have quite the eccentric collection of tables and chairs, but I'm really impressed how well everything fits together since nothing matches! Love every aspect of this place!"}
{"text":"Love the food, love the decor, love the staff. 
I have eaten here 9 or 10 times. You cannot go wrong with the chicken and waffles with kale chips. The macaroons are terrific as are the lemon bars and pecan pie bars. The to go salads are great."}
{"text":"It gets one extra star just for being completely gluten-free.  It was amazing to see all the gluten-free options and not have to worry about cross-contamination.  Honestly, the food was okay - nothing spectacular.  The service was decent but it's the kind of place where you go up and order, and then they bring your food out to you.  I have other food allergies that I wanted to mention to them, but I felt really rushed because people were behind me.  I would definitely go again now that I know what I can eat - it's hard to find safe, gluten-free breakfast!"}
{"text":"This place is incredible! Not only do they have lots of gluten-free and vegan options, but they're actually delicious. I tried the waffle breakfast sandwich and it was bursting with flavor. It included eggs, bacon, sausage and lots of melty havarti cheese, all sandwiched between two waffles, and it comes with a delicious caramel-like buttermilk syrup that is to die for. It also comes with \"pots,\" which are their house potatoes and I don't know what it is about them but they are amazing? I truly am still in shock from this place. I want to go everyday. I also got a chocolate chip scone and a salted caramel brownie for later. They serve Press Coffee which is a yummy local favorite. Additionally, the inside is super cute and they have a nice patio for nice weather. The staff was very friendly and personable and the food came out quickly. Seriously you need to come here! #lfthx"}
{"text":"This place is such a gem. Fresh, locally sourced ingredients and plenty of delicious gluten free options. The staff were wonderfully friendly and helpful, my food took longer than I expected to come out but actually tasted freshly cooked when I got it. They have bottomless bloody mary's and mimosas every day of the week which is huge when I have guests in town visiting and the menu is varied enough for everyone to find something they like."}
{"text":"I love this place!! The food is always super tasty and I love how the whole menu is 100% gluten free! My girlfriends really love this place too. One of them has celiac disease and has to be very cautious about what she eats so it's great knowing we can always come here to eat and not have to worry about any gluten contamination. I also really like how it's a local spot. I'll even catch a glimpse of the owner from time to time. If Jewel ever reads this thank you for opening this place!"}
{"text":"The food was very tasty but the service was poor, our waitress took forever getting to us, have us refills only once and didn't check to make sure we were fine or needed anything, she took forever with the check also, l know that they recently started dinner service and maybe that added to the long wait times."}
{"text":"Quaint little place, super clean, bright, and friendly staff. In a culture of oversized portions, Jewels hit the spot with the perfect serving size. I had the tomato, mushroom, chicken and cheese omelet and it was very tasty, my wife had the biscuit, egg and sausage sandwich which was also delicious.
I would def. return to explore the menu further. They also have a lunch menu, served after 11am."}
{"text":"I have heard of this place and saw the owner on TV. I have only been twice and both times had a good experience with great food. I'll give 5 stars after I try more items like the baked goods and coffee. I've only had a soup I liked and this week ordered breakfast. OMG the biscuits and gravy with sausage were fantastic! I did not even know I liked gluten free biscuits. Nor did I know I liked a few kale chips sitting atop my perfectly cooked potatoes. Keep up the good healthy cooking cause I'll be back and will bring my biscuit and gravy loving spouse!"}
{"text":"I had heard great things about Jewel's, I attempted to get lunch a few months ago; after waiting about 20 min just to ask if they had any soup I was told they did but didn't fit my dietary needs so I left. I decided to try my luck again, the board listed two soups a warm and chilled soup. I waited about 10 min with only one person in front of me to be told, \"I don't think we have the creamed soup\" with no attempt to go look or ensure that there wasn't any. It is disappointing I haven't been able to try any of the foods as the service has been slow and the items are not available or staff does not look. (My visit the second time was around 1145am so early enough to miss lunch Crowd in hope there is plenty of the foods listed from the menu)"}
{"text":"Went in for a late lunch. Ordered biscuits and gravy, and unfortunately I was not impressed. Gravy was quite plain and biscuit was not fluffy.  However the potatoes where spot on and the Cartel coffee was good. I also got a white chocolate chip and dried fruit cookie which went well with the java."}
{"text":"I'd have to give this place 2 stars and it's strictly b/c of the presentation of my food. We ate here over the weekend and I was looking forward to it b/c of all of the good reviews, and my friend enjoys it. Being new (and my friends hadn't arrived yet), I walked up to the counter to look at desserts and possibly order dessert. Stood there for 2 minutes with no acknowledgement. A couple comes up behind me, & who gets acknowledged & serviced 1st? The couple. I ignore it and when they were I ordered a brownie. For a total of $4.34, that brownie was hard as a mf brick (didn't notice this until I got home). I even put it in the microwave thinking that would soften it and it came out a HOT brick instead of the cool brick it was previously.

Long story short, I ordered the chicken and waffles which is allegedly the best thing in the menu. It looked great but it was tasteless. The syrup and extra salt didn't help. To top it off, it made me nauseous that has lasted until today (it's Monday and we went for brunch on Saturday). 

My friends liked their food so I'd go back, but will only have water"}
{"text":"Went to Jewel's Bakery today after hearing about it on Facebook!  I was so excited to go because I have so many allergies and this place could be an answer to my lack or yumminess I have in my life now. 

I had the build your own omelet and it was amazing. I eat paleo so I didn't try the hash browns, but they looked great!  I did eat the kale chips that they out in with the potatoes and they were amazing. 

After we are I had to try some of the pastries  and they were out of donuts so I will have to go back :). I did try the blueberry scone and the lemon curd cupcake. Amazing!!!  

I will for sure go back. And most likely for lunch!!  

Thanks for opening"}
{"text":"I come here every time I'm in town for breakfast. The waffles are AMAZING! Such a treat as a celiac to be able to eat whatever I want off the menu and not have to search for hidden gluten."}
{"text":"I heard about Jewel's being GF, and having just discovered this restriction for my teenager, I've been scoping out places to take him that are GF AND tasty. The d√©cor is very cute.  I went for a late lunch around 2:30 and the staff was busy keeping the place looking nice and shiny.  I ordered the special, a Philly Cheesesteak, and while they were out of hoagie rolls, the ciabatta did not disappoint.  The sandwich was really great, and they were accompanied by homemade chips - great flavor and not heavy. I was gonna take a picture of it, but it smelled too good as it found its way down to my belly! I can't wait to try their breakfast items.  This place is added to my roster."}
{"text":"I got the veggie tacos and they were amazing... I'm talk best tacos I've ever had. My friends didn't like their food much nor the tea or coffee. I liked what I got but it did seem overpriced."}
{"text":"An awesome gluten-free restaurant/bakery/cafe. Absolutely delicious and no worries about ingredients! Finally, no need to ask a billion questions. Super friendly staff.

I've had the breakfast sandwich on Ciabatta (no meat, add avocado). The GF bread is tasty and doesn't turn rock hard after sitting out. Potatoes were flavorful and our post-breakfast snacks (cupcakes and donuts) were delicious."}
{"text":"The BEST waffle I've ever had. Had such a nice time eating here, great calm vibe all around."}
{"text":"I have been here twice so far and with more visits I will potentially alter my review, but as of now this place is pretty great. I'm not on the gluten free bandwagon (oh so for thousands of years humans were fine but all of a sudden everyone gets a bit farty when they have a bagel...yeah you totally have a disease...*sigh*) butttt, for being gluten free you can hardly tell because unlike other gluten free options in this world (gluten free bread! gluten free cereal! gluten free water!?!) jewel's baked goods have FLAVOR! Cupcakes are bomb. Macaroons, you ask? Bomb diggity. Bread? Yes. Apparently they make their own flour and there is the secret. As a marketing manager, I will be using these guys often to win over clients. Looking forward to more tasty treats, thanks guys"}
{"text":"In love with this bakery especially the fudge brownies. The flax bread while quite good has oat flour. Unfortunately I have a sensitivity to oats so I will not be buying it again, but I will certainly be back for the brownies!!

If you get the loaf of bread call ahead and ask them to slice it for you. Bread is $8 and brownies are $4."}
{"text":"I LOVE that this is a dedicated gluten free restaurant and I don't have to worry about getting sick when ordering. I was able to eat biscuits and gravy for the first time in a long time. It was really good and there were a lot tempting items on the menu (chicken waffles anyone?). I will definitely be back to try more."}
{"text":"I've been going to Jewels Bakery since they opened, and have gotten a lot of free cookies with check-in so I'm finally writing a review...there are pros and cons to Jewels but I continue to go because the pros definitely out weigh. 
Pros..the food is delish. Especially the bakery items. Everything is gluten free, since I do not have Celiac I can say the cupcakes and bars are better than some of the white flower filled bakery offers in Phoenix.
The place is locally owned and was opened with a purpose to support other families and provide options to the community. I love that.
The service is good. I have never had an issue with orders or customer service.
Cons....mostly selfish but it seems like they made their actually food menu smaller since they opened. I really like their food so I wish they had more to choose from, especially vegetarian.
Be prepared to spend a bit more. It is probably more expensive to run a gluten free bakery so I will continue to support. 
Basically you should go. Especially if you are skeptical of gf food and want to try a good representative."}
{"text":"I have to eat gluten free by disease so when a whole restaurant and bakery is guten free I can just go in and order anything!  Now, that is pretty rare for me!  I usually have to involve the chef or manager to ask about cross contamination or how something is prepared.  At Jewel's?  The work is all done for me!  Where else can you get organic, gluten free options like build your own burger, Chicken and Waffles, Pancakes, Grilled Cheese, brownies, Cartel Coffee and more?

The daily specials are scrumptious and keep me coming back time and again.  I have been a customer of Julie's since she baked out of her house and I am so happy to see this great place appealing to so many gluten free diners as well as people who have no idea this is a totally gluten free environment.  Her food is just that good!

I buy my bread there as well.  The flaxbread I can have freshly sliced and it tastes amazing!  It's so good that my daughter requests it and she's not even gluten free!  Cookies and scones are terrific as well and this is my GO TO birthday cake and cupcake store as well.  I had a Monte Cristo donut for National Donut Day that knocked my socks off!  It was nitrate free ham with brie cheese and a cherry sauce in a powdered sugar donut.  Yea, baby!"}
{"text":"I have to give it to them, for being gluten free they make some pretty damn good food. For those that need to eat gluten free this is for sure your spot. They have a range of breakfast, and lunch items, even stuff for the kids. To top it off they even have dessert which was amazing as well. They also sell loafs of bread and some flour to make cookies or brownies with, as well as some honey and a few other gluten free things. The place is a decent size, they also have patio seating which is gorgeous!

I had the rocky road brownie and it was rich and moist. Im not really a brownie fan because most brownies ive had were either too dry or lacked A LOT of flavor. This one did not. I did find 2 hairs in my brownie. One under the marshmellows they put on top and one inside, when i was pulling it apart it didnt seem to let go of the other half of brownie and that was why. One of the cooks saw and came over with a new brownie. 

Some may find it gross and never return after finding hair in their food. To me it was gross and i was disgusted but not enough to not give them a second chance. I wish they would wear a hair net though because it could have been prevented that way..

As far as everything else, their pancakes are amazing! Potatos as well! Between the bacon and sausage i would recommend the sausage, bacon is somewhat always dry when ive gotten it. Their syrup/butter sauce they give you is to die for! Its a place to check out, and an experience for those of you that arent gluten free to taste the difference. If im in the area, i MIGHT stop by, but because i dont need to eat gluten free there are plenty of other places in the area that id rather eat it."}
{"text":"For sure the best gluten free restaurant I've ever been too. Even if you're not gluten free it has great food. Don't be scared by the word \"gluten-free\" because basically half the menu is stuff you would eat regularly: great omelettes, parmesan fries, and some good chicken and turkey. But either way the food is great, service is great, drinks great and also the bakery also a great variety and always fresh. Highly recommend not just for people with dietary restrictions but for everyone. ASHLEE WAS GREAT!!!"}
{"text":"Great experience this morning at Jewel's! There were 11 in my party, and even though I made a reservation, I was a little worried that we would have to wait because it was Sunday, but we got right in. The service was top-notch and the food was excellent."}
{"text":"I went this past weekend for brunch with my friends. I'm not sure what they put in the sauce to top the pancakes but it's magical! The pancake was my favorite, the rest of the food was alright. They serve fresh Press Coffee made locally in Arizona! Oh, and they have gluten free options too."}
{"text":"Let's start with the extraordinary Bacon Bloody Mary I just had, it was perfect! The gluten free fried chicken was off the chain, moist with a crisp finish and packed with flavor...the bite of waffle I stole melted in my mouth. It's an adorable little spot with attentive and friendly staff. I am hooked!"}
{"text":"Checked this place out today! It was really cute, open and bright, everything smelled so good when we walked in. The servers were friendly, and they kept our glasses full! We had cappuccinos, which were pretty good! The fried chicken was really good - it was crunchy, juicy, and seasoned well. So good, I would go back just for this. The brisket sandwich was just okay - it was tender, but that's about it. I would definitely go back to try some baked goods and some of their other items on the menu!"}
{"text":"Great food and atmosphere!  I had the biscuits and gravy, my daughter had a waffle.  Everything tastes great!  My favorite was the buttermilk syrup on the waffle, it was so good!  If we lived closer, this would be a regular place to eat for our family."}
{"text":"We've been waiting for her shop to open. We ran at our first opportunity to visit.  Let's say thee best gluten free desserts we've had. Almond joy cupcake killer good. N the chocolate chip scone is delicious.  Thank you jewel for our gluten free experience."}
{"text":"I am always in search of scrumptious baked goods and desserts, so when I heard about Jewels bakery I had to give it a try. I dragged my brother with me (cause he has a sweet tooth too), and we soon found ourselves staring at the bakery case. Unfortunately, what we expected to be a tough decision due to too many options was really quite an easy one...we didn't order a thing. That's right, not one thing...for multiple reasons:
1. There was no one in the bakery (bad sign)
2. No one came to help us 
3. The case was dirty
4. There were only a few baked goodies in the case and none of them looked appetizing or worth the calories. 
We were both shocked and disappointed to leave empty handed. When an eatery claims to be a \"bakery\" I expect to at least have the desire to try one thing in their case, but nothing looked good. Next time I'll take my sweet tooth to LGO, essence, or AJs."}
{"text":"The absolute rudest service poor quality always get the order wrong and don't stand by there quality inspire of their high high prices - won't come here again !"}
{"text":"gak!  never again!  slow service, out of items and expensive.  Once was too much!"}
{"text":"I've been following their Instagram for a while, but finally had the chance to come in. 

Today they were selling the \"scoffles\" scone waffles. Bought one of each flavor; practically inhaled the savory one. Five stars alone for this delicious innovation. 

We plan on coming back soon for dine in service!!"}
{"text":"We had the cauliflower wings (fantastic!), the beef stroganoff, chicken and waffles, and molten lava cake with sangria. We also took some pastries and cupcakes home for later- they were too good to resist. All of it was 5 stars. Our server was amazing and took awesome care of us also. Love this place! We will definitely be back again."}
{"text":"Jewels had three things going for it. Very close to our house, looks cute from the outside, had a fun looking menu....unfortunately they did not have anything else. My husband and I ate there a few weeks ago for lunch on a Sunday. I had the rice bowl, my husband had the gravy dish. Mine was O.K.,  but his was luke warm. Several weeks passed, we thought we'd give it another try, thinking it might have been an off day before. Our second experience was worse than the first. It was busy but about 2/3 full, we waited along time before ordering. My husband asked for a cup of coffee....never came, he had to finally go and find someone to get it. Our food took a long time to come, my grilled Turkey Stack was not crispy, had limp lettuce and was room temp. The fries were also room temp and stuck together. My husband had the Omelet, he asked for silverware, I asked for ketchup.....waited......never came, he finally got up to find some himself. No one ever came by to ask if things were good.  I really wanted to like this place, but it's off of our list."}
{"text":"Yummy food and super delish cookies! Service was a little slow but it is Sunday afternoon. Really great place. Try it!"}
{"text":"Being a gluten-free person can be very challenging even with so much awareness of its dangers theses days! I stumbled upon this fantastic restaurant for people like us! I had their hot chick sandwich with onion rings and it was amazing. Spicy, fresh and cheesy sandwich on flaxseed bread! A perfect recommendation from Julianne! She was super helpful in my decision making for the perfect dish and desert! Such huge portions that half the lunch is packed to take home! Be sure to try the aioli garlic sauce for dipping your fries or onion rings in! Yummo!!! They also offer local honey and gluten-free flours so you can take home to make your own homemade goodies GF! I'll be back for sure! Just wish you had a location up in Cave Creek!"}
{"text":"Jewel's Bakery & Cafe is an excellent addition to this East Phoenix neighborhood. We enjoyed a lunch of both their sandwich specials for the day: Pesto Chicken & Balsamic Portobello. Each sandwich came on a different gluten free roll that were equally tasty, the chicken was super juicy, the portobello was roasted with just the right amount of tang, and everything was definitely homemade. 

We were too full to try any of the baked goods, which include awesome-looking cupcakes, sticky buns, scones & cookies. But I will definitely be back to try those gluten free creations, as well as their quiche for breakfast/brunch.

All the staff was super friendly and efficient. As we settled into the cozy cafe, Julie, the Jewel's behind the cafe's name, stopped by to check on us! You can't get better than that!

Possibly the best part, as we left, my boyfriend who suffers from a gluten allergy, smiled and said he didn't feel any discomfort at all. A sandwich any where else normally means lots of heartburn medicine. We are thrilled to have found Jewel's Bakery & Cafe and can't wait to go back!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing! I wish there was one closer to where we live but it's definitely worth the drive."}
{"text":"This place is a God send! However, their hours are short and they run out of their delicious treats fast! 

The rocky road, ehhem, GLUTEN-FREE brownie is phenomenal, even for the people not worried about that stuff! I crave it and can eat all the gluten in the world.... check the other reviews. Haha 

The caramel brownie is also delish, but not as much as the rocky road one."}
{"text":"Amazing!! I can't believe I actually found someplace to eat that is gluten free, that is as good as Jewel's! My husband took me to Jewel's for lunch one day, and now every time I go have lunch with him, I always want to go here! It is absolutely incredible! Everything so far in the menu has been fabulous! Thank you Jewel's!!"}
{"text":"Very cute little local place! I've tried the chicken and waffles and Cali chick sandwich! Both were great but needed a little more to them... The customer service is great as well and the sweet potato fries are worth the extra 2.00!!!"}
{"text":"Everytime my mom visits (celiac disease) this is priority #1 to go eat at. I've been there probably 6 times, a few with my mom and few with just my boyfriend. I love that the ENTIRE kitchen is gluten free so you don't have to worry about cross contamination. I always get the grilled cheese which you could never guess was gluten free and some french fries (OMG so good). 

My mom orders the waffles there because their syrup is literally the best syrup I have ever tasted. It's a buttermilk syrup that is very sweet so you don't need to use a ton of it. My boyfriend springs for the chicken and waffles which has the buttermilk syrup but also fried chicken on top. You will never miss \"glutened\" fried chicken again! 

The wait staff when we went has always been on top of it (we come at off hours, never at exactly noon). Their hours recently changed, as noted by a sign on their door, so I will call ahead if I plan to come very early or very late in case things change or special events go on. It's definitely worth it to come and visit and especially if you have celiac disease, you will be in HEAVEN! The price also is extremely affordable, I might even say cheap. For two people for lunch we only spent about $20 (no drinks, just entrees but free water). I think that's a great value and there's also a bakery to order cupcakes and brownies.... yummmm!"}
{"text":"I had the biscuits and gravy with sausage. Deep fried  potatoes, sausage and kale in old smelly oil. Really anyone can deep fry. Biscuit is ok if you like military style with no flavor gravy missing any hint of sausage."}
{"text":"One more fantastic spot that I've driven by and not stopped in. BIG MISTAKE! 10$ om let and potatoes that ranks up with the best. Going to be part of my routine now.... can't wait to hit more of this cool menu!"}
{"text":"Absolutely the best place in Phoenix to grab a gluten-free, Celiac-safe breakfast or lunch! It's so nice to walk in to a restaurant and be able to order anything on the menu! I would highly recommend the chicken and waffles, biscuits and gravy, or the Cali chick sandwich! Their baked goods are also wonderful; definitely the best gluten-free cupcakes I've had.
My only complaint would be their somewhat limited hours and the variable selection of baked goods, which are sometimes pretty cleaned out. Service isn't the greatest, but most of the waitstaff is nice enough."}
{"text":"Although I've only been to Jewel's for pastries and cakes, it is one of my favorite bakeries in the Valley.  You wouldn't even know Jewel's divine desserts are gluten-free.  Her pastries and cakes are moist and light and packed with flavor.  With a rotating array of goodies behind the counter, you'll never be at a loss to find something sweet and delicious when you stop in."}
{"text":"Very poor customer service experience with Julie, who I assume is the owner. 

I found this bakery through yelp with the keywords \"gluten-free bakery\". I felt pretty comfortable making a last minute cake order for a birthday, based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews. 

Unfortunately, this was not the case. For the short version: Julie miscommunicated the hours of operation to me, and made some pretty rude remarks in the process of both ordering and picking up my cake (ie she told me I could pick it up on the doorstep).

My experience: I e-mailed Julie wanting a gluten-free butternut squash cheesecake. Julie emailed back saying it wasn't enough notice for that ingredient. There was no offer for a different service (for example, plain cheesecake), so pretty much was ok with not making a sale. 
I acknowledged that my inquiry was last minute (2 and a half days notice), but being that she had such a great reputation for her gf products taste and quality, I was open to whatever options were available. I called the morning after our initial email from the night prior upon opening at 8am.

I called 3 times before anyone picked up, and Julie ended up answering the phone. When I began asking about types of cheesecake, pricing, and how many people each cake serves, Julie told me it was \"too early in the morning\" for this. This is extremely rude and unprofessional. I laughed it off, because I wanted a good cake for my husband's birthday that was gf. I live in the west valley, so I'm not exactly up the street from the bakery. I honestly asked basic questions, and she had plenty of opportunities to try to upsell me if she wanted, and she made me feel like I was an inconvenience, and not valued. Still, I ordered.

During our phone call, I asked twice if the summer weekend hours were that they were open until 7pm, and twice she said yes.

Now being the day I pick up the cake, my friend who works about 10 minutes from the bakery offered to pick it up for me. I told him everything would be ready by noon, and that they close at 7pm. He arrives at 3:15 and no one is there. He called twice, then went to the front to knock, and no one answered. I then call twice, no one answers the phone, so I quickly send an email obviously panicking. Julie calls me from the bakery a few minutes later and asks me why my friend didn't knock on the backdoor? SO incredibly ridiculous and rude. Is there a password I should have given him as well? Why would I even think of telling him to look for a backdoor? I remind her about our conversation about hours, and she says that's weird, because they haven't been open until 7 for over a year. I said that is weird, because you specifically agreed with me,  saying yes when I asked twice if you were. 

So, I ask her to let me call my friend so he can turn back around asap and get the cake, and she says she can LEAVE IT ON THE BACK PORCH for him. Excuse me? I told her I was not comfortable with that, and she laughed!! I now am curious if she's actually being rude or is totally aloof when it comes to interpersonal skills. I am still just confused about how that was an actual suggestion by the owner. I picked you, I thanked you, and I was polite and thorough with you. How can you stand by such service? No apology, no accountability at all for your lack of professional conduct.

My friend ended up having to send one of his employees to pick up the cake, and Julie was not there to give it to her, but 2 men were there. They assumed it was me that picked the cake up, as they called her Gina. I literally said twice it was not me picking up the cake. 

All in all, I got the cake which is why I'll give 2 stars instead of 1. So thanks (question mark??) to the 2 men who opened the backdoor to make that possible, but I will never return nor recommend this place to anyone. It was so unnecessarily stressful to accomplish what is supposed to be a specialty here. I work in this industry too, and this was an embarrassment. And for what it's worth, I did not find the quality in taste or execution.

**Final thought: I made a decision to not leave reviews for businesses anymore, even though the majority of mine are positive, because it's tough to see businesses attacked by pettiness, but I felt so wronged in this entire experience, and the lack of accountability by Julie, the owner was too upsetting to not share with other patrons willing to spend their time and money at a business that may not value it."}
{"text":"Y'all, Jewel's is the BEST place ever. They treat their customers like family, and I can't wait to go back. Make sure you register your phone number, as you'll get TONS of points and freebies! Today I got a free donut, cupcake, and coffee all because I've been there enough to get points!! It's incredible. Gluten free folks, rejoice!!! It's a complete gf kitchen! Great staff, great good, and lots of love. I can't recommend it enough!!!"}
{"text":"Was excited to check this place out based on the reviews...maybe I have a different idea of what good food is because this was some of the worst food I've ever had at a restaurant. It was pretty much inedible. I got the blueberry pancake stack with a side of sausage snd a latte. The \"sausage\" was a homemade patty of ground beef with raisins and other random crap in it. It's was cooked to the point of being pulverized. The pancakes on the other hand were undercooked and gummy tasting and that buttermilk syrup was disgusting. The latte was the only good thing I had there and the pastries in the case looked good. I hate ragging on mom and pop businesses but this was a total fail and waste of money. I will admit that I am not on the gluten free bandwagon but I do know there are plenty of ways to make it taste good, this was not one of them."}
{"text":"Came here to pick up lunch to go, food was very good. Love that they have gluten free options. 

#lfthx #jewelsbakeryandcafe #glutenfreeoptions"}
{"text":"Omg can you say yummy! The baked good were out of this world. Can't believe they were gluten free!!! We waited in a long line for them and were given free cookies for waiting! I'll go back soon:)"}
{"text":"The best gluten free options ever. They are kind, have good music, and great people. Our waitress Kayla was awesome! Pancakes , quiche, !!!
They put lots of effort into their menu for us Gluten Free people."}
{"text":"Awesome gluten free place!  I am hooked on the chicken and waffles!  The desserts and pastries are always fresh and tasty!"}
{"text":"I had high hopes after seeing all of the reviews and pics but I was kinda disappointed. We got the biscuits and gravy, the egg taco, a salted caramel brownie and snickers cupcake. Paid $30, which seems a bit much for brunch. The food was just okay, nothing special. The desserts were however pretty good. This is a hipster place and everything is gluten free, though you can't really taste a difference if you ask me. Probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"I'm the past I've come here and it's been busy with great food. I don't know what is changing but every time I come in the food is different and the menu is different. I wish they would stick to a core menu. I always get the quiche and now it's gone and replaced with much messier breakfast tacos at the same price range. I can make breakfast tacos myself at home and come to jewels for things like waffles and biscuits and quiche. Please simplify your menu! Your baked goods are so good!"}
{"text":"Let me first say I love Jewels. We eat here frequently and have never had poor service or poor food quality. 

We went yesterday for Mother's Day brunch, and the experience was not good. We had a reservation, and we were seated promptly. The \"hostess\" had told us that when we were ready to order we could just go up to the counter and place our order. We went and stood in a very, very slow moving line and finally got up to the register, placed our order, only to be told they were out crepes (along with several other items on the special menu). We ordered something else, and coffee, and took out seats. After 10 minutes our coffee appeared and after another 10 or so minutes our food came out. According to the menu we were supposed to get a bread basket with herb butter to start the meal, but when we asked about it the server looked confused. She finally reappeared with some various dried up biscuits and pieces of miscellaneous bread in a bowl, with a little cup of cinnamon butter. We had to get up and go to the counter to ask for silverware so we could eat our lunch.
While sitting and eating, I saw one of the staff come out and inform the front end people \"you guys know we aren't out of crepes, right?\". So since this was what I had originally ordered it was a little upsetting.
I was going to let it go, but when the hostess girl came around and asked how everything was I decided to mention it to her. I was pleasant about it and just let her know it was a little upsetting. She literally looked at me and walked off saying nothing. 
Not the best service or experience.
The entire staff seemed very unorganized and overwhelmed. 
I will be back, because I have been there on \"good service days\". I don't think I will go back on a holiday"}
{"text":"Just an amazing concept great breakfast menu and even better brunch menu love the cupcakes and cookies"}
{"text":"I found the staff to be very unfriendly at this establishment and the food to be way over priced. I ordered a tea, chicken sandwich, kids meal, and a small dessert. This came up to 27 and some change. I thought that was high but was curious about the food. I was very unimpressed- had no real flavor and needed salt in my opinion. The person that brought my food out to us was very rude. I will not return."}
{"text":"Baked goods are wonderful if you are Celiac and require gluten free. But the service is horrible. I traveled quite a distance two times to purchase an $8 loaf of bread. The first time, the place was pretty much empty but I had to wait about 12 minutes for them to slice it. The second time, the place was virtually empty again but the person behind the counter was conversing with a non-paying customer. I waited a good 12 minutes or more again and several employees walked past me and never asked me if I needed help. I finally gave up and walked out. I won't be back."}
{"text":"PROS: I like the concept of the gluten free restaurant and the baked goods were very tasty. I did get a glance at the owner as she walked by and she seemed very worn out. I would like to go back another day and try some of the actual food like chicken and waffles.

CONS: The moment I walked through the door the place was a mess. Tables were all dirty and so was the floor. Food was everywhere almost like there had been a food fight that just ended. There was a gentleman who appeared to be cleaning but really just moseyed around trying to look busy while gawking at myself and my friend who was also female. It made us feel uncomfortable to say the least. The girl working the register was for the most part helpful and friendly. I caught a glimpse of the back kitchen as workers passed in and out through the swinging door and the kitchen was very dirty, un kept, disorganized etc. My friend and I sat in my car to enjoyed our treat and as workers geared up to leave for the day one of them walked by my car with a completely grimace face almost to be dogging me. I just smiled but no change in attitude. This is the kind of employee who is running the business down.

Summary: Jewel, I believe you have a fabulous idea here but you really need a crew that can hold the atmosphere of the restaurant for you. Someone to manage this place well and from what I saw you just don't have that at this time. Some of the employees are lacking greatly for your restaurant. The baked goods were great but the service and the cleanliness is seriously disappointing."}
{"text":"A old friend had returned to town and so we decided to start up or tradition again of going to a different restaurant every six or eight weeks . . . and this time we chose Jewel's Bakery and Cafe . . . and this place truly is a hidden Jewel.

An eclectic little place with a small menu . . . and a great bakery selection.  I chose the Curry Chicken Salad Sandwich with Fries, an Iced Tea, and we split a Rocky Roads Brownie.  The sandwich was a flavor explosion in my mouth . . . the spices , , , the big chunks of chicken . . . the fries . . . hot and crispy . . . the brownie . . . well lets just say . . . I thought I had died and gone to heaven.

This is a hidden jewel that everyone should try at least once in their lifetime . . . but I know i willl try it again . . . and again . . . and again."}
{"text":"PSA: If you have celiac disease, you should know whether or not you are sensitive to gluten-free oats before you go here. Jewel's uses (gf) oats in their flour blend, which means if you're an oat-sensitive celiac, your menu options are much more limited. However, there are a handful of oat-free (and vegan) options, and since the entire place is certified gluten-free, I feel safe coming here for a snack and to hang out with a friend or three.

oat-free vegan options: buffalo cauliflower with vegan ranch, sweet potato or white potato fries, garden tacos, garden salad. 

be warned that the ingredients listed on the menu aren't inclusive: if you have any other restrictions besides celiac disease, bring it up to the server. for example, the garden tacos don't list that they include tomatoes (this didn't seem unusual with so many other veggies in the tacos), but when they arrived there was definitely tomato, and so my husband got two tacos instead of getting one and sharing the other with me.

the service is REALLY slow. like, painfully slow. not just to take our orders, but to bring out the food (and everyone's food was not brought out at the same time, even though we were the only people eating food from the kitchen at the time). BUT... those buffalo cauliflower bites are pretty delicious though, and kind of worth the wait. (the hot sauce is on the side, and it tastes like plain old frank's red hot, so it's not that exciting, but the panko breading and the vegan ranch dressing are awesome.)

the servers kind of treat you like you have no idea what you're doing. we've been here twice, bringing my parents the second time, and i felt like the servers were acting like we were a handful of tourists who wandered in off the street just looking for random food, rather than a family trying to accommodate their one member who is a super sensitive celiac. the server didn't want to explain what was in the flour blend, either, which was really weird. seems like the'd get that question every day, unless they're mostly catering to the GF fad dieters who don't need to be gluten-free.

the bread (oats and all) was a real hit with my gluten-eating family. my parents are serious gluten junkies, so if they liked it, it must've been good.

I'd actually give this place one star for the oat flour, abbreviated hours, and slow slightly condescending service, but they have a Black man working there (I'm sorry I don't remember your name, sir! you were the only Black man when I was there!) who was truly wonderful. He kept the dining room very clean and said hello to us a couple times. A little girl dropped a takeout cupcake on the floor, popping open the container and losing the cupcake. She started crying and apologizing profusely right away. I'm not usually super excited to share my dining experience with crying children, but I can relate to her utter sorrow: when you've got celiac disease, dropping a fancy (and expensive) treat like that on the floor is suddenly a whole lot sadder and upsetting than when you up-end a pack of Hostess cupcakes onto the sidewalk after school. I always do the mental math to calculate how much money I'm throwing away whenever I drop a cookie on the floor at home, so I was pretty sad for this little girl. It looked like a good (if oaty) cupcake. This quiet hardworking gentleman just brought her another cupcake in a new container without making any kind of fuss over it. I've been to plenty of shops all over the country that probably never would've been that nice.

accessibility: the ramp between the parking and the sidewalk is in disrepair and very narrow, but mostly manageable in a wheelchair. there's space enough for wheelchairs in the restaurant, although it may be a wee bit cramped when they get busy. the bathroom is wide and clean."}
{"text":"First time here and we are very impressed. I ordered the cheese and mushroom omelette. It came with kale and potatoes. Outstanding. My hubby ordered the chorizo and was in heaven. We grabbed some baked goods to go, for later when we get the munchies. I have high expectations for them."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the Cartel Coffee as well as the Chicken and Waffles! My friend got the French Toast and loved it."}
{"text":"Went here for breakfast today. Waited in line and got up to the register. 

The gal at the register asked what we'd like to order. After telling her our entire order, she forgot everything we said and had to repeat it. Then, she asked for clarification on something. As we answered her, she got sidetracked in another conversation and we had to repeat what we said again. She kept complaining about how distracted she was and \"didn't know what was going on in this world\". Ordering took 2x longer than it should have. 

We proceeded to find a table and were excited for our meal. After waiting about half an hour, we asked for an update on our food. The cooks told us they were just starting it and had a \"large backup\" even though the restaurant was relatively slow. 

After waiting 10 more minutes for our food, our breakfast tacos finally arrived. Except, they were just omelettes. Nothing \"taco\" about it. We could've gone anywhere for omelettes. 

We asked a waitress for a manager, who never showed up. 

We finally got up and found the manager ourselves. The manager was understanding, but spoke in a confrontational way and pretty much said \"I know there is a problem, but deal with it. The last customer waited 50 minutes for their food, so your wait wasn't even that long.\"

All in all, we won't be back. Ditsy, clueless cashiers; insane wait time; inaccurate menu descriptions, uncaring owner."}
{"text":"My favorite burger place in Phoenix. 100% delicious. All natural meat cooked to perfection. I like a well done burger that's still juicy and not burnt or dried out and they pulled it off perfectly. Got saut√©ed mushrooms and onions for extra yumminess. The sweet potato fries are the best I've ever had. Hot. Not salty. Not greasy. Truly great. I'm a big fan and WILL be back."}
{"text":"I took my daughter who has Celiac's Disease to Jewel's.  She tried the BLT, she loved the bread and the sandwich overall.  The bacon was way under cooked thus the missing star.

We tried the macaroons, they were fresh and delicious.  We took home a cupcake and a cinnamon roll which my daughter really liked.  

We were there at lunch time on a Saturday and it was super busy, we had to wait a bit to order.  The staff was friendly and helpful.  We will be back for sure, nice to have new place to go."}
{"text":"AMAZING!!!! Brought the family up to Jewel's but didn't mention that it was a gluten free place (I am the only one gluten free in our family) we ordered bakery treats and breakfast items. As we were enjoying the pistachio donut, blueberry fritter and rocky road brownie I started to worry that maybe I had misunderstood and that these things were not gluten free. They were delicious! Not just good for gluten-free things, they could stand up to any gluten treat and still be great. I asked and they assured me that yes, everything is gluten free. :-) My family did not realize that these items were gluten free even after they ate them. Amazing taste and amazing texture. For breakfast we had bacon egg and biscuit sandwich and chorizo biscuits and gravy. The chorizo is ground fresh there on Fridays!  It was about 40 minute drive each way for us to get there but SO worth the trip.  I will definitely plan on going back, there are a number of amazing looking bakery items I can't wait to try. Tip: Order the rocky road brownie and ask for it to be heated, they warm it up and the marshmallows get all toasty and lightly browned."}
{"text":"Walked in 10 minutes before they stopped serving breakfast. The woman behind the counter was very friendly and sweet. It wasn't until I heard a comment from the cook behind the window about me \"being able to order whatever I want off the menu\" that made me feel rather uncomfortable seeing as I ordered before they had finished serving breakfast and not to mention i was 1 of 3 people there, so I thought they would have appreciated my business regardless. The food was delicious and the atmosphere was cute. I may be back if I am in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"I'm obsessed. Everything I've had there is awesome. I will say that there is some occasional inconsistency in quality but for the most part, I get what I expect. When I want to treat myself, nothing beats their donuts or brownies."}
{"text":"Amazing!!! So excited to find a COMPLETELY GF place to have treats on vacation week! Excellent service and excellent products. Highly  recommend!"}
{"text":"I stopped by here in September with a gluten-free friend and was delighted that everything looked delicious and was reasonably priced. We shared an omelette, potatoes, waffles and coffee; she took home \"incredibly fluffy for gluten free!\" donuts and we shared a lemon tart. I am impressed with the array of options for any diet, the friendly and informative staff, and the business's unique ability to ship their gluten free flour anywhere in the country. I am not GF but actually want to come back to support this business!"}
{"text":"I have been here a few times now and each time I fall more and more in love. All of the food is delicious. There are plenty of vegan options for me on the menu and also in the bakery. The portions are perfect and the food is always fresh. Staff is super friendly. Nice and comfy little spot. Highly recommend if you're in the area. There is a little wait time but I didn't mind."}
{"text":"Food was good,  but very pricy.  They didn't have any colds brew coffee and the staff was less than nice.  Not sure if I would call out a cafe, we had to be seated."}
{"text":"Amazing gluten-free breakfast joint.  A must-go!!  The baked goods are to die for and the specials are a hit (including the chicken and waffles).  It's a great place to bring a group and a sure sign the gluten-free phenomenon is here to stay."}
{"text":"I'm a big coffee drinker and love trying new coffee shops especially if the word bakery is involved. The coffee is super watered down, I definitely make better coffee at home. The ambience and service is good."}
{"text":"After I find out I was gluten intolerant back in September I thought finding a good waffle or pancake was going to be impossible. However, Jewel's exceeded my expectations! Not only were their waffles to die for but their cupcakes pleased so many members of my family we are choosing them to cater my wedding. 
On top of amazing food that keeps us coming back for more their service was exceptional. A little slow during peak morning hours but always friendly. Ashley was our server on multiple occasions and always made us felt welcomed and never rushed. 
I would HIGHLY recommend them for anyone with any sort of gluten intolerance or aversion. Or for anyone looking for a moist, delicious cupcake or brownie!"}
{"text":"First time for going and I will be a repeat customer. I had the house salad which included feta cheese, pecans and croutons. All gluten free. I added the tuna for a little protein. The bakery case was full of delicious lookng pastries. I couldn't pass them up. I had a salted Carmel cupcake. Frosting was DELISH!! I am not usually a frosting fan, but it was so creamy and good."}
{"text":"Had an amazing kale and bacon quiche for brunch with crispy potatoes.  YUM!  I am stuffed and I am already hoping that they have this next Sunday. Comfy and casual cafe, great location."}
{"text":"Beautiful shop.  Great breakfast and pastries. I'm not GF, but  have tried a number of pastries, and couldn't tell a difference from other well made baked goods.  So glad it is near-by."}
{"text":"My favorite distress place!!! Chicken and waffle is surreally amazing ! My tummy loves this place! Service is friendly and quick, place is clean and fun ! Love the owner!! Cupcakes & deserts are die for and the best part is they are tummy ache free !"}
{"text":"We were looking for a quick place to eat breakfast before catching a flight back home and popped in here. Cute place. Didn't realize until after we received our order that it was a gluten free restaurant, so I didn't love the bread on my breakfast sandwich, but the eggs, sausage and bacon were all good. Mainly I just want to make sure people know everything is made as you order it so the service is on the slower side but if you have the time it would be a nice place to sit and chill."}
{"text":"There are so many reasons I hate that Jewel's has the best chicken and waffles of all time.
1. It's not a chicken 'n' waffles place. There are plenty of chicken 'n' waffles places. This is better.
2. Everything is entirely gluten-free. Even when I factor that culinary feat out of the equation, this dish is best in show. As I'm shoving a fluffy, crispy Belgian waffle into my face hole, I find myself wondering why gluten even exists. 
3. It's a bakery, but the meat is better than most restaurants. The chicken is tender, boneless, and there are no bad pieces. The fried coating is entirely crispy and incredibly flavorful. Ask for extra. It doesn't come with all that much, and you'll want it.
4. It's not a Southern joint, but you get warm buttermilk syrup and Sriracha honey, and it beats hot sauce and honey by miles (coming from a Nashville native, tail betwixt legs.)
5. The whole thing is topped off with crispy kale pieces, which, despite seeming superfluous, is entirely necessary and adds a fantastic, toasty flavor.
6. There are too many insane-looking desserts not to get one. The creamy lemon meringue with graham crust is superior to the slightly gummy apple pie, but if you're limited to GF goodies, they'll be the best you eva had. I put Jewel's up against \"normal\" bakeries because nothing about them reminds me they're gluten-free.

However, the comprehensive experience is a mixed bag. On my first visit, the kitchen staff called out, \"we can't make that. The iron broke.\" And the cashier simply said, \"so... what can I get you that's not chicken and waffles?\" The blas√© shut-down sans any alternative offerings was a bummerdrag, especially since we came specifically to try that dish. (As substitute-for-waffle items go, the fine-crumb biscuits are awesome. The eggy, but basic, French toast doesn't pair quite as well.) Another time, the staff had little clue what was in the pastry case, and despite nothing requiring prep, took 10 minutes to get two pieces of pie to our table. This would be ignorable if there were more than three people in the caf√©. The ambiance is basic, and like most Arizona things, Jewel's is in a strip mall. Fanf*ckingtastic food combined with hum-dum everything else earns an emotionally-conflicted four stars from me, because Jewel's really does have the best chicken and waffles I've ever had."}
{"text":"Great food good service. I'm not gluten-free but the wife is. Their food always has excellent flavor."}
{"text":"Everything on the menu is gluten free and tastes amazing! I have tried a good portion of their menu and have loved it all. Even my husband who doesn't eat gluten free has likes the food and couldn't tell it was gluten free. Their baked good are also delicious. They do have some vegan options as well. The staff is friendly and helpful. Sometimes the food does take a little bit to cook but that's ok, it's fresh and tasty! Thanks jewels for providing healthier food that still tastes great!"}
{"text":"I love coming to Jewels because it's one of the only gluten free restaurants in town! Such amazingly delicious food that let me feel less guilty about eating out! 

Today I had the salmon salad with roasted red peppers, feta cheese and bacon. So delicious! Paired with a freshly brewed green tea, it's the perfect lunch combo"}
{"text":"This place was banging on Sunday morning, which is always nice to see at small local establishments. I had had friends bring their baked good to me before, and they blew me away - I'd never have known they were gluten free, which is a common theme among their reviews. So, they already had that going for them. Also, they're just down the street from my house, so I had no excuse for not going in to try their traditional offerings. Wouldn't you know it, they have my favorite breakfast - eggs Benedict. I couldn't wait to try it. The presentation was very nice and traditional. It tasted great. It wasn't a Hollandaise, but still a delicious and creamy sauce. My one complaint is that the flatbread it's served on was rather dense and dry - a common issue for gluten free bread. Luckily, there was enough sauce and runny yolk to mostly compensate for this. I prefer classic style with an English muffin, but would definitely order this gluten free version again. The potatoes were also grand. It wouldn't be difficult to convince me to go back for brunch or just to grab baked goods."}
{"text":"Fabulous biscuits and gravy - enjoyed every bite!  Such a treat to enjoy biscuits out in a fabulous GF bakery"}
{"text":"Stopped in with my fianc√© this morning and she ordered the GF Pancakes.  Not only were they the tastiest GF Pancakes I have ever tasted they were easily one of the best pancakes I have had ever!

Excellent service, friendly staff and delicious food.  Will be back for more!"}
{"text":"Amazing cafe! Came here right after flying in from Phoenix and immediately loved it. Everything is gluten free and the staff is super friendly! They also have a lot of vegetarian options."}
{"text":"I was hesitant to try Jewel's for a long time because generally I don't like gluten free food and I don't see the purpose of it for someone who does not have a gluten allergy. Regardless, I decided to try Jewel's for breakfast after seeing a friend post a super tasty looking photo of their food. I was also excited that they use many local providers for their ingredients. I had their egg sandwich with the egg cooked over medium (which they weren't sure they could do, but did end up doing). The husband had the biscuits and gravy. The sandwich was.... lackluster. They forgot to put the cheese on it, and when I asked for the cheese, they gave me a cold slice... not exactly the same as having melted cheese on a breakfast sandwich. The sausage on the sandwich was mediocre and the bread was dense... heavy... unpleasant to eat. The sandwich could have benefited from A) different bread or even a wrap or tortilla and B) some vegetables.... who wants to get a sandwich that just has meat and egg on it? It needed something fresh. The biscuits and gravy were the same story.... dense heavy biscuits with mediocre gravy. So why 3 stars? I got their chocolate chip cookie with check in.... I was worried it wasn't going to be great given the meal.... I was SO wrong... this was one of the best cookies of my life! The cookie had to be about 80% chocolate to 20% cookie.... it was so good. I would go back just for that cookie. I can't say I'd go back for the food."}
{"text":"i heard this place was great from a few friends and finally decided to try it for myself. who knew that a bakery could have the best chicken & waffles in the valley and it be gluten free?!? the chicken was super moist and the side honey & syrups that can with the meal added the perfect amount of sweetness & flavor. the service is also great!"}
{"text":"I've been on the hunt for a closer decent coffee shop. I've lived in the area for years and finally decided to give it a try- wish we would have come years ago!!! Delicious food- delicious coffee (cartel by far is he best ever!) and I will be visiting frequently. Super cute interior... Awesome menu for allergy sensitive customers!! My only complaint is that I wish they were open earlier so I could stop on my way to work and later so I could visit after :)"}
{"text":"Loving the food and service here. Very clean lots to choose from and none of it boring. Really innovative food with a great taste. It's gluten free as well also nice for those who need that option cause there is nothing lacking in the food options. Great addition to the neighborhood we are loving this precious gem called Jewels."}
{"text":"The guys behind the counter couldn't muster up one smile between the two of them, the selection was small, and what WAS there seemed very expensive.

It's unlikely that I will try it again.  But maybe someday."}
{"text":"Jewel's now offers a full dinner menu with table service and alcohol (gf, of course.) The night we were there was a little weird because it was restaurant week. The kitchen and our server had some miscommunication that made ordering a little difficult. Initially my husband was told that he could order from the breakfast menu (his favorite.) Then, he was told that he couldn't. It went back and forth that way a few times before everything was settled. Once we got through it, everything was fine. Our waiter was really attentive and the dinner was pretty good. 

I had the chorizo hush puppies and Thai shrimp tacos. I loved the dipping sauce with the hush puppies. I thought these were really good but don't expect them to taste like southern style hush puppies. The tacos were great! They were spicy and the shrimp were large and tasty. 

My husband got the beef stroganoff. He was a little disappointed with it. He thought it lacked garlic and salt. 

Jewel's still does a great breakfast and the pastries are fantastic. I'm hoping that a little more time will get the dinner menu and service up to par."}
{"text":"Family was visiting from OC and 2 needed a gluten-free haven, so we went for Sunday brunch.  the food was homey and quite tasty.  Our niece was thrilled to be able to sit down and order off a menu w/o having to make adaptations and worry if later on she'd get sick.  The only comment this coffee drinking crowd did think should be included were free re-fills for the price of the cup of regular coffee.  My dad was a bit unhappy with his French toast-but that was more due to his age (86) and not understanding why it wasn't the \"right\" kind.  It looked pretty delicious to the rest of the table.
My niece even took home a lemon bar and a cupcake to enjoy later.  I'm dairy free and it was nice to be able to order a muffin and not worry as well."}
{"text":"The best chicken and waffles ever!! The biscuits and gravy was so fresh and homemade and the potatoes were really good!!"}
{"text":"Not sure what's going on here. Been coming to Jewel's for well over a year now. Have always loved it in the past. Over the course of the last 8+ months I noticed items falling off the menu. Usually my favorites. Each time I would try something different as a substitution. Two weeks ago I returned with my partner and each ordered something different. I had the Eggs Benedict which I have had several times in the past. This time the two flat breads (their version of English Muffins) had been replaced by a more rubbery single flat bread. The sauce which I had loved in the past this time required so much salt, I looked like a crazy man shaking the salt shaker over and over. My partner got the special which was the right choice as it was balanced and tasty. And then he found a long hair in it. The staff removed the plate and a little while later replaced it with a fresh one. I know these things happen, but it's very nasty. With the remade breakfast came a free entree card and an apology which was appreciated. 

We returned today to yet another menu. (It's only been two weeks.) This menu even smaller. Eggs Benedict removed. Prices raised. I asked the guy at the counter what was going on. His response was \"I don't know... They got rid of like half of the menu.\" So again I looked for a substitute. When we finally made it up to order we were told it would be at least 30 min to get food out to the table. At this point, it was not worth it. We purchased a scone which was good (the reason for 2 stars) and found a different place for breakfast. Ultimately a good decision. We probably will not be returning. Even with the free breakfast."}
{"text":"The service was very poor. Walked in and was not greeted by hostess to be seated. We had to walk up to someone cleaning a table to request to be seated. Asked if we can sit on the patio. Waited a few minutes and I believe it was the owner or manager came out to us and said the entire patio is reserved for a private party and is not available. Which is interesting because my brother had called earlier to make a reservation but was told they don't take reservations. Hmmm. Interesting. When I brought this up to the worker, she stumbled through her words and said the reservation was in an hour so if we will finish our brunch in an hour she can sit us in the patio. We said fine. Reservation for this mysterious private party was at 12 noon. It was now just past 11 am. We were given a time limit for our brunch. Rude but whatever. Around 11:30 they sat a couple people out in the patio. Around 11:45 another group with a dog was also seated. But wait.. wasn't there a private party reserved for the patio at 12? That's why we were originally denied the patio but now all of a sudden other people were being seated there with no problem? We ended up leaving around 12:15 and guess what, no private party ever showed up. Not sure why the lies and why we were denied the patio originally when other people got seated no problem. The food was okay. Chicken and waffles was actually pretty good but because of the service I don't expect ever going back there again."}
{"text":"Having gone gluten free and egg free two weeks ago I've been on a quest for places to dine that meet my dietary restrictions, and provide tasty nutritious food. I'm glad that Jewel's Bakery & Caf√© was recommended to me. 

Before visiting them, I visited their website. In addition to giving up glutens and eggs due to sensitivities, I have to balance my carbs and proteins so that each meal I consume has at least as many proteins as carbohydrates. I was disappointed that their website lacked nutritional information for their menu items, but that didn't deter me from visiting. 

I arrived at around 12:30 on a Monday, and it thankfully wasn't terribly busy. The restaurant offered only counter service, but was pleasant with a fair amount of table space. The menu was Gluten Free, and had good variety, including breakfast and lunch items and desserts. My own options were limited by the number of menu items that had eggs in them. 

An approachable young man was working at the counter, and helped me figure out which items contained eggs. I didn't really want a salad or sandwich, and decided to have the biscuits and gravy, and selected sausage as my breakfast meat. There were no high protein, low carb sides offered.

After ordering, I found a table, and watched the cutest little girl trying to take bites out of a sprinkle covered donut that was nearly as big as her face. She was pretty determined, so it made for interesting watching! 

My food didn't take long to come out, and looked appetizing when it was set in front of me. The biscuit was good, although it wasn't the light fluffy sort. The sage sausage gravy was ok, although there was very little sausage or sausage flavor in it. The sausage patty was delicious! If I were to have the dish again, I would order an extra patty for the protein and for the flavor. The house potatoes were nice and crispy, but I only tasted them since they were just more carbs. The meal just didn't have enough protein to meet my needs.

In retrospect, I should have ordered the Classic Burger. 

I'm certain that without my egg sensitivities, I would have loved this place. It is clear that a great deal of care and attention went into crafting the menu items - there were just so many that I couldn't eat. Not the fault of the restaurant. I have to go back again to see if I can find my groove there, and get a meal with enough protein in it."}
{"text":"This place is a dream come true for anyone who is gluten free and especially anyone who is newly gluten free (like me).  They now serve breakfast lunch and dinner. I love how they dont even need to advertise or flaunt that they are gluten free because even people who dont eat gluten free would enjoy thoroughly and probably wouldnt even realize.

I got the chicken and waffles and it was amazing. Better than any other chicken and waffles I have had in a long time. I went to lolo's a couple of times and always left feeling sick and bloated. This is not the case here at Jewels. You will be pleasantly full but wont feel disgusting. 

Check in on yelp and you will get a free (delicious) cookie. I can not wait to bring my non gluten free friends and boyfriend here because I know they will love it. 

I read some other reviews about the service being bad but me and 2 friends were here at around 930 am on a Sunday on Labor Day Weekend and there was no wait, the server was attentive and the food came at a normal speed. I can't complain about anything here. I can't wait to go back!!!"}
{"text":"I have to update my review on Jewels. 

In Phoenix there are really only 2 places I have found decent GF pancakes. Here and Snooze. 

If you want a traditional delicious GF breakfast. This place is spot on. The food takes a little bit to come out because they REALLY do make it fresh when you order. Think about how long it takes you to cook bacon at home . 

BUT

The thing about this place that sticks out to me is the staff. I see the same waitress here almost all the time. Regardless if they are slammed or slow, she ALWAYS has a man upbeat attitude. She gives me the best service and remembers my order almost every time. 

Most importantly, the owner here REALLY cares. She even reached out to me after a not so pleasant experience. To me that speaks volumes. 

Show support to your local spots!"}
{"text":"Great place for a quick, but great tasting breakfast! Special brunch menu on weekends only. Had the mushroom, bacon, cheddar omlet with hash. My boyfriend ordered biscuits and gravy. Both were great, especially the hash. My order came out about 5 min after his, but the nice girl gave us a complimentary pastry so I got the bacon cinnamon roll."}
{"text":"My daughter had been craving traditional fried doughnuts. I was able to preorder 3 to her specifications and when we came through town on our way to Flagstaff we picked them up. She savored each one and continues to talk about them. I look forward to a return trip in our near future."}
{"text":"This little place is literally a Jewel! We had a great experience even though we didn't get what we wanted due to items containing dairy. We will go back for sure! We tried the chicken and waffles, curried chicken sandwich, and the omelet. The chicken and waffles were so crispy and yet literally melted in your mouth. Both of the sauces they serve are excellent and give you a completely different flavor profile. One is caramel and the other is a sweet heat type. The chicken was crispy and moist. The curried chicken salad sandwich needed some spice, but was still way above average on that vegan/gf ciabatta bread. Fries were a bit limp but hand cut so the flavor forgave the sog. The omelet was very good. Just a normal omelet. The homestyle potatoes were good. The vegan cupcake was delish and the pecan pie bar was equally as good.
So...the only con I have is that they need more dairy free choices to go with the gluten free. They do have vegan options, but no waffles or pancakes unless they are slow. The customer service was excellent and they were very busy. Good enough to bring us back again and again."}
{"text":"Amazing gluten-free dedicated caf√© with friendly, knowledgeable staff and reasonable prices-highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Discovered Jewel's on Instagram when they had a speaker on Homeopathy. The food is amazing & the baked goods are incredible. Been back 3 times and I've been impressed each time! Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Super adorable and the food was great!! Love the atmosphere and the staff was fantastic!"}
{"text":"We've ordered two awesome cakes from here for work birthdays. They were delicious and gluten free and super pretty! They are huge cakes!"}
{"text":"The food is usually very good and made fresh from scratch. That being said, they don't list ingredients very thoroughly on their menu, which is surprising for a supposedly allergy friendly restaurant. It takes a long time to get your food, so if it has to be remade, you're in for a long wait. However, I do like their food and their pastries are tasty, as well."}
{"text":"Love it!  Excellent gluten free, vegan cookies and cupcakes.  The oatmeal raisin cookies are the bomb!  Will definitely  back to try more of their creations."}
{"text":"My fiance and I both eat gluten free. In comparison to several other gluten free places, this establishment is by far the best. We liked it so much that we ate their twice and got a \"to go\" order for our road trip. Even though I really enjoy their desserts, their food is what really keeps me coming back. It is really good.

We tried a wide variety of food between the various meals that we had their. We tried quiche, chicken and waffles, onion rings, a breakfast sandwich, a pulled pork sandwich, a breaded chicken sandwich, gluten free pancakes and biscuits with gravy. Everything was absolutely delicious. Some were even better than their glutenous counterparts. If I had to pick some favorites, I'd say they are chicken and waffles, the biscuits with gravy and the onion rings. They also have local coffee from the cartel, which was delicious. 

Don't think twice about going here. It is tasty, well priced and decorated very nicely. You won't be sorry. I've included some pics so you can see what I mean."}
{"text":"Tried the Chicken and Waffles and split it with my wife.

Chicken is in strips and the waffle is buttermilk. Both were good, did not jump off the page.

Buttermilk Syrup and Honey Sirachha Syrup.

Nice little restauant that seems locally owned with nice touches."}
{"text":"The best gluten free place in AZ for sure!! The French toast is to die for!!! My husband loved his BLT. The latte was awesome and pretty!! My kids loved their food. And the desserts are to die for. We took several home!"}
{"text":"Jewels is a jewel in itself! The chicken and waffles are Devine!!! I highly recommend Grandma's latte... the hazelnut in it is heavenly. We came to this area for baseball spring training and it is difficult to find quality food that is GF and doesn't taste gluten free. Jewels is the exception to that rule. 

The doughnuts are moist and delicious!! Don't miss out on those!! And the honey is incredible!!"}
