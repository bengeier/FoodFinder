{"text":"Great place for typical food from Îles de la Madeleine! Seafood mainly. Warm atmosphere"}
{"text":"Ambiance des Îles de la Madeleine garantie! Ce petit restaurant est familial alors le service est super personnalisé. Menu varié, principalement des produits de la mer, mais possibilité d'avoir du poulet ou autres viandes dans quelques plats. Service au table efficace et agréable et les assiettes arrivent plutôt vite. Pour le prix, ce n'est pas trop cher, en raison de sa spécialité, mais n'est pas abordable non plus. Un restaurant à découvrir, si vous chercher des plats un peu moins commun.   Atmosphere of the Îles de la Madeleine is guaranteed! This small restaurant is family buisness, so the service is very customized. Varied menu, mostly seafood, but the possibility to have chicken or meat dishes. Service is efficient and pleasant and plates come rather quickly. For the price, it's not too expensive, because of his specialty, but is not affordable either. A must for researchers of dishes a little less common."}
{"text":"The website is being redesigned and with little info on Yelp page, it looks like the place is closed but NOT THE CASE! This is a small family run business who specializes in all types of seafood but especially the lobster from Les Îles de la Madelaine. Lobster season starts in three weeks, can't wait!!"}
{"text":"I have been here recently but was hoping to go again soon to give an updated review but I'll just post what I have tried so far since this restaurant deserves to have more reviews. I had the cod fish cake appetizer and the seal burger. The fish cake is deep fried and was very good, it was light and not too oily. The seal burger was interesting, the meat has a very dark color. It wasn't gamey but hard to describe the taste. I would eat it again. I want to go back to try the seal sausage and other stuff. The seal sausage was actually sold out on Sunday so I guess best to go on Saturday if you want to try that. The decor is very distinctive and has a lot character. I really liked it and the owners are very nice. There are a fair number of tables too. Seal is called \"loup marin\" in French on their menu as opposed to the other word, \"phoque.\""}
{"text":"Nous y sommes allé pour un anniversaire et nous avons été extrêmement déçue. La nourriture y est bonne mais dispendieuse. Côté service c'est horrible! Nous avons été servît par la femme du propriétaire et cela a pris 1h25 et 3 demandes simplement pour avoir un verre d'eau tiède. De plus, notre côté de table n'a jamais reçue de pain, ni de menu. Une fois commandé, grâce au menu du voisin, l'expérience c'est améliorée compte tenu que la serveuse n'avait plus grand chose à faire. J'en reste perplexe au fait d'y revenir :-/"}
{"text":"Went there last evening. The service was warm and friendly. The live music (some of it of local Magdalena songs) added to the great atmosphere which makes you feel like you are right over there on the Islands (or at least it's what it felt like to me who's never been there!). The food was tasty, well-cooked and well seasoned. I chose the Seal burger, which was very good indeed and worth the try if you've never had seal meat. Friends had the Pot-en-pot and the Cod galettes (which the waitress told us were the house specialties), both were also very good and fresh. We also tried their deserts: The sugar pie was very small but good, the cake was tasty and buttery and the fritter very... surprising (fried in seal fat... you can taste the seal and the sea... which for a desert isn't totally what you'd want but hey we've tried it!) As we didn't get to try some of their own local beers, we will definitely be back and try other specialties. I'd recommend it any day!"}
