{"text":"This place came in clutch on New Years Eve last minute, without a reservation. I have to say I'm shocked this place didn't come more highly recommended! The food was really special, with such a wide array of flavors and perfect portion size. Our waiter was very friendly, very helpful with our questions about the menu. Also, the decor in the place makes you feel like you're in a museum or watching the history channel - it is so well designed! I recommend this place and will come back!"}
{"text":"Service agréable et décoration aussi. Mais la qualité dans l'assiette laisse à désirer. Le poulet effiloché baigne dans une sauce et ça ressemble à ... (on ne peut en parler à table!). Le chevreau est très cuit, mais bon. Après les travaux de la rue St Denis, on dirait que les commerces ont de la difficulté à s'en remettre."}
{"text":"What a disaster - decent food, incredibly stupid and incompetent service.  Unless you want to overpay for adequate food and hopelessly incompetent service, find another restaurant.

Friend and I went there for dinner - we usually eat at the bar, and so we did this time.  There were a couple of ladies who looked to be friends of the bartender/server who were given exclusive focus.  The music kept changing mid-song to whatever, volume going up and down and the experience was generally unpleasant.  Uh, when there are only four others at the bar, getting a drink should not take 10 minutes.

Cocktail was pretty good.  We ordered a bottle of Sparkling wine which the server did not know how to open - reason I mention this is because the bottle was pointed towards the hanging glasses and if the cork had exploded (which I've seen on more than one occasion), every one would have been showered with glass shards.

Appetizers - Ceviche were quite good, but I've had better for less.

Oh, we ordered the main courses - my friend ordered beef and I ordered fish - even pointed at the menu entry couple of times.  Entering them into the computer seemed to be an onerous task with many questions that were answered when we ordered the dish.

35 minutes later, my friend gets his beef (far too well done) and I get some kind of a meat dish, not the fish I ordered.  This sets up another monumental discussion between the two servers.  I told my friend to eat his while they replace my dish.  That takes another 40 minutes by which time I was frustrated and ready to walk out.  The fish comes out - served on a cold plate which was already making congealing the sauce.  I'd rate this as adequate - I've had better at half the price.

For this experience the bill was $150 - nothing was removed from the bill or nothing else was offered.  When we mentioned this to the newly arrived \"manager\", her expression was like \"what, you want me own up to my mistake and at least and compensate you for your inconvenience?\"

Needless to say, will not be returning and making sure none of my dining friends will ever darken their doors."}
{"text":"We choosed the bass and tiger shrimps. The courses was amazing. The tastes was so pure and in perfect balance. We had chardonnay white wine from Peru which was recommended by the personell. As dessert he served Intipalka (cabernet sauvignon) and it topped the evening! The personell was so service minded and nice. Really recommend this place."}
{"text":"Had an awesome dinner at this Peruvian restaurant recently. 

The decor and the ambiance are perfect for a relaxing or romantic dinner. 

Mochica has a nice selection of cocktails and non alcoholic beverages. 

Started off with a mixed appetizer plate for 2, piqueo crillo. All 4 entrees varied from good to excellent. My favourite being the tamalito verde. A parcel of mashed corn with cilantro steamed in a banana leaf stuffed with chicken, egg and Alphonso olives. 

This large appetizer plate was followed by the Lomo saltado which are tender beef morsels with red and green onions, tomatoes, in a tangy and very tasty sauce. It was accompanied by garlic rice, cassava fries and rocoto mayonnaise that were spectacular. 

My partner had a sea bass dish with a seafood sauce that was excellent. Portion for this dish was exceptionally large. 

Presentations were beautiful for all dishes and the service excellent and friendly. 

Oh yes, one should not miss a trip to the rest rooms (both men an women). The resident tenant may fire up your imagination as to how to finish your evening or, at the very least, make you smile. 

Overall this was an excellent dinner experience and I recommend this place highly."}
{"text":"This place was great! Delicious, authentic Peruvian food and fantastic service. 

I got the Ceviche classico, which was amazing. The lomo saltado was good, but I feel like it wasn't anything particularly special. The sauce was tasty, and the cassava was nice though. We also had the Pisco sours, which were delightful. 

I tried the Alpaca off my mom's plate, which was an absolutely exquisite taste. It's pretty incrdible that they even have Alpaca. 

Service was fantastic. We even got to briefly speak to the chef. 

Can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"I had the Grilled red tuna in an ancestral sugar cane and red ají panca sauce Quinoa.  The tuna was seared to a nice medium rare.  Very nice interior.  There were many items on the menu that looked really good.  I might have to go back to try some of the other dishes."}
{"text":"Sooo fucking good. The food and the exotic flavours take you to peru and back. We ate so much but the food was soo good that i wanted when i got home.

Enjoy..my first 5star. Try the calimari starter. And the cubed beef entre."}
{"text":"Great food and nice prices. The Ceviche is delicious. Best Peruvian food we have tried in Charlotte. Definitely we are coming back."}
{"text":"Exceptionally good!  My wife and I tried 1/4 chicken (white and dark), rice, pinto beans, black beans, sweet plantains and green plantains and a garlicky dipping sauce. It all was fabulous, so good in fact we kept eating long after we were full!  Everything was packed full of flavor.  We will be back soon!"}
{"text":"I'm not familiar with Peruvian cuisine but I thought the alpaca burger was pretty good, definitely doesn't taste like beef. It had a nice grilled flavor. It came with a small salad and yuca fries. Tiradito appetizer was interesting with thin slices of fish complemented with beans and crunchy corn in a sour but slightly sweet sauce. This dish is similar to carpaccio. Also had a pisco sour. Never had pisco before but it's strong from what can tell from the cocktail I had. Mains range between $20 to $35 so it's pricey but the food quality and execution is good even if you won't be full. Service was good too. They have a lot of interesting dishes that I want to go back to try. There are a decent number of tables and the decor is nice inside as was the music being played."}
{"text":"I am Peruvian and the food is good but not what we are used to eat in Peru, the dishes have been modified. For example the anticuchos are served with salad and cold in small pieces, the Lomo saltado is served with fried cassava, The jalea has almost no fish on it."}
{"text":"This Peruvian restaurant on St. Denise has a really nice going with their setting and ambiance. Neatly designed interior and very cozy service is memorable. Unfortunately there were a lot to be desired for it food. 

We were there for an early dinner in a beautiful Montreal's June. Ready for a break and good meal after a whole day of walking around. We started with a couple of appetizers, Papa ala Huancaina (potato balls and goatcheese in aji amrilo sauce) and Yuquita Rellena (Fried cassava stuffed with seavood) Both were really good with an absolutely stunning presentation. Such artistic arrangement of shapes and colors on minimalist plates, gorgeous and delicious. The highlight was the sauce for the potatoes. Terrific.

For the entree we had Conchas ala guyanabana (Raw scallops with guyanabana lime sauce) and Cudado de mero (Steamed grouper in spicy rocoto sauce) Again these dishes came with impeccable presentation, but this time the taste did not measure up to the look, the scallop was stiff and much to chewy with slight aroma even defying the guyanabana sauce. My grouper seems to be steamed frozen, the spicy sauce couldn't not help. Sorry to say we had to abandon them half way and continue instead to nibble on the peripheral cassava and plantain chips."}
{"text":"Super awesome find. Just opened in November 2017. The food is amazing with lots of great flavors. The prices for what you get can't be beat. I highly recommend giving them a try. We got a whole chicken and 3 large sides $20. Just walk up order have a seat and let ur taste buds get excited. The manager was super friendly and answered all our questions so don't be shy."}
{"text":"Man listen. Forget all those Viva Chickens, and whatever other places. This is the most authentic Peruvian spot out here. Uber delicious too. Sheesh! They've got YUCA folks. Yes Lawd! Chicken is super moist, and packed with flavor. Tell your momma, and bring some friends. This place stays consistent, they will be extremely successful."}
{"text":"I am a huge fan of Peruvian food so I was excited to eat here. Our server was great. He did a good job of steering us toward the best menu choices and he made a mean Pisco Sour. The table shared an order of ceviche served with corn nuts, of course. For my entree I had the duck and it was delicious, perfectly cooked and falling off the bone. I would certainly eat here again when in Montreal. It's a nice change of pace from the average fare you get at Mexican and other Latin restaurants. If you haven't had Peruvian food, give it a try."}
{"text":"Nous sommes allés à Mochica hier soir (vendredi), et nous avons passé une excellente soirée!
Le service est très bon, le serveur était aux petits soins et faisait des blagues; il était aussi de très bon conseil.
Le choix d'entrées et de plats est vraiment incroyable! Il y en a pour tous les goûts!
Nous avons opté pour la dégustation de ceviche (excellente!) puis la chèvre braisée et la bouillabaisse de fruits de mer, toutes deux délicieuses aussi.
Nous avons aussi pris le cocktail Vodka clamato qui était très bon!
La déco à l'intérieur ainsi que dans les toilettes est à voir!
Bref, tout était super, on y reviendra volontiers!"}
{"text":"This is a late review. I took my mom to celebrate her birthday on July 28th and we were excited about this place based on the reviews we had read. Ill start with the positive: the drinks, my seco de cordero were good and the quality of the ingredients spoke volumen of the place. Unfortunately, my mom didnt have the same experience. Her papa a la huancaina was a bit on the garlicky side and her arroz con mariscos (her favorite dish) was way too salty. She only mentionned her disappointment after we left and I wonder wht she didnt finished her plate. To make matters worse, the restaurant was understaffed  and I had to ask for my bill 3 times which left us seated at the table for an extra 40 minutes. We liked to believe this was an odd night but as Peruvians we had a much bigger expectation of its cuisine."}
{"text":"Great meal, helpful staff, nice environment.  Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Probably the best looking Peruvian restaurant I've been anywhere outside Peru. This includes Canada, U.S, Mexico and Colombia. I mean, these guys did a great job with decorations. The exotic ceramic works (Huacos) are awesome! . Like I said...excelente!

Now, regarding the food, boy, the place fell short. After leaving the place, I was like \"meh\". Seasoning was needed everywhere. The ceviche was ok. No cancha (toasted corn) and the Lomo was also bland. The pisco drink was good however. My wife (american) who loves pervian food, got the corvina and was also disappointed.

I've eaten much better Peruvian food in Miami and NY.

Like I said, great place, but I do hope they get a better cook in there and get the sazon back in!!!"}
{"text":"Great Peruvian Restaurant in the Maple Country. I'm Peruvian and I must say this restaurant is pretty good. Good selection of dishes, including Llama which is not so frequently found in Lima restaurants given that is our national animal."}
{"text":"Absolutely amazing--only about 15 min off the interstate and completely worth the detour. Pollo Saltado was fantastic"}
{"text":"I tried their 2 piece white meat plate and it was delicious! This is definitely a hidden gem in Concord that I'm glad I've found. I will definitely be back to eat here again."}
{"text":"J'y suis allée une fois, c'était ma première expérience dans un restaurant péruvien. Nous avons testé en entrée le carpaccio de lama histoire de goûter une fois du lama mais la viande était un peu trop froide pour qu'on goûte ses saveurs. Par contre plat principal de boeuf était divin! 
Le restaurant est très bien décoré avec des objets et art péruviens. Le serveur est vraiment très attentif, et en somme c'était une belle expérience!"}
{"text":"Mochica is fantastic! The food was amazing. I had aji de gallina that was fabulous. And the drinks were also great. I got a pisco sour that I highly recommend.

The owner was our waiter, and he was incredibly friendly and helpful. The ambiance was very relaxed and pleasant. 

I will definitely go back the next time I am in Montreal."}
{"text":"Fantastic FOOD! Great service! 
Awesome drinks! 
amazing ambient ! 
What a great find in the city! Love everything about it."}
{"text":"Great food. Love the Lomo Saltado."}
{"text":"So this place is one of our new faves! Family owned, great food, clean and modern interior.

They have all of the Peruvian food you could want. The drinks are authentic (try one!) and the sweet plantains are a must! We get the family meal that comes with 3 sides. We love the rice with beans on top, sweet plantains, and Yuca (yoo-ca) fries.

I am a huge fan of the dipping sauce that comes with the chicken. They should sell it!

Fast service and the food is always fantastic. They also own the taco/ice cream joint a few doors down. Excellent as well. Try it! 

Easier to get into than Viva Chicken and a few bucks cheaper."}
{"text":"Food: great though their ceviche leaves something to be desired. 

Service: for a Friday night, despite it being a small restaurant, they had three servers among 10-15 tables. 

We sat for quite a while before they came to take our drinks order. I ordered two appetisers in place if a main and asked for the two to come together as my meal. As a restaurant, they should have a better sense of when to serve the food. All the appetisers (four: 2 ceviche and 2 tapas) came out so half of our table starred eating while others were waiting for their mains. Easily had to wait at least another half an hour before we had to remind them to serve the mains. We ordered three burgers, a main of beef and rice, a steak, and a lamb. 

They also charge $1.50 per person for cake cutting for birthdays, which just seems greedy for a restaurant that doesn't actually carry cakes. There's also a mandatory 18% gratuity for large parties, which I typically have no problem paying as I understand it's harder and more work to accommodate a larger group. However, given that they never checked up on us during the meal, forgot our orders, us having to specifically request the food be served such that everyone can eat together, I was hesitant with paying for a below-standard service.

Then came time to ask for the bill: we asked if it was possible to split the bill. Our server said it was fine and she'd be back to take down which items to group together. Thirty minutes later, still nothing. Server didn't come back to verify our orders. Forty minutes later, we received our bills which were all mixed up. At this point we've been at the restaurant for three hours. 

We had to recalculate all the correct totals, with the gratuity amounts calculated separately just to save ourselves another 40 minute wait. To add to this frustration, our server could not understand that the tax included total is the same as the balance on the bill without gratuity, or which of the two numbers (total and gratuity) was the value for gratuity. This whole ordeal took us 3.5 hours when we were hoping to finish early enough to hit up the bar down the street. We missed out on that due to our meal taking up such an unreasonable amount of time. 

Overall, food was great but the experience left such a bad taste in my mouth, it completely overshadows food. I will definitely not be returning."}
{"text":"My husband found this little hidden gem in Concord so we decided to try it out. They serve Peruvian fare in a cozy, relaxed setting. We were pleasantly surprised by the reasonably priced, tasty items. We had rotisserie chicken, white rice, salad, black beans and sweet plantains. The food was good. My only complaint is that it's served in individual containers and small paper receptacles and not on ordinary plates which makes it awkward to eat. Other than that I liked the casual atmosphere and the friendly workers. Recommended."}
{"text":"Being a regular traveller to Peru I've had the chance to sample the real thing.  Mochicas isn't perfect, but overall I love going.

The cancha they sometimes serve before you get your food is great.  The papa Ala huancayna is excellent.  The llama dishes are certainly deserving of praise.

But what really stands out is the decor.
Definatly worth a visit, if only once out of curiosity.  But I'd recommend going twice to sample a few different things"}
{"text":"I went quite a few times to Mochica when I was living in Montreal, essentially for everything they offer.

The food is absolutely awesome, very good quality, and original. The service can explain every meal, what's special with every piece (for people who are interested in that, like I am) and where they source it from.

From time to time, one gets to meet the chef wandering around and chatting with customers. Very humble and shy. But seriously, best profiteroles on Earth-- Ice cream lucuma and home made chocolate sauce, this is to die for!"}
{"text":"I tried this restaurant out with a friend of mine for lunch. I had the fried rice and the she had black beans and rice with tostones. I had a pineapple drink and she had a Inca cola. I added chicken and steak to my rice. I did not know that pork was already in the rice but I was asked if I wanted it to say. I said yes because it was my first time there and I wanted to experience it. It came with yellow sauce and I asked for the green sauce. It was such a large meal that I was able to take half of it home and eat it the next day. I was able to try the passion fruit drink which I also enjoyed. Their food is seasoned well and I would try this place again."}
{"text":"Not many Peruvian restaurants in Toronto (like Montreal) but this is the best one so far, and the best part is that it is close to downtown (in Little Italy). The attention is great and the place welcoming. The decoration is focused on the north of Peru with reference to an ancient culture \"Mochica\"  (even older than Incas) ( don't miss the erotic sculptures) . In regards to the food we
only tried Ajo de Gallina (chicken),
Lomo Saltado (meat) and Jalea. My favourite the first 2 but Jalea is a great appetizer ( Jalea is fish)"}
{"text":"I've been to Peru 3 times in the last 3 years. The scenery is fantastic but what really captivates me is the world-class dining in Lima. 

Mochica has some dishes that take me back to Peru:

Cocktails (Pisco Sour and Maracuya Sour) are fun and delicious. 
The ceviche and tiradito (raw fish sliced thin, like sashimi) offerings were pleasing to the eye and the palate. I appreciated their use of passionfruit as the \"cooking agent\".
LOVED the anticucho de corazon (grilled veal heart) appetizer! It made me think of La Tia Grimanesa in Lima...

We were excited to try the alpaca. According to the friendly waitress, the meat comes from alpacas raised in Quebec. Unfortunately, I cannot say that we enjoyed the preparation. The sauce and accompanying \"risotto\" were a bit heavy for our taste.

I did not like the desserts we tasted. Next time, will try the crepes with dulce de lece."}
{"text":"Je trouve que les prix sont un peux élevé pour le goût des plats, mais ce que je vous conseille les coquilles St Jacques sont super délicieuse, à ne pas raté"}
{"text":"Excellent!  Having been to Peru a number of times I had high expectations for the God at Mochichia. I was not disappointed.  Started with the ceviche, very good with just enough heat and authentic vegetables.  Could have used more pervian corn , choco I think, but otherwise great.  For main we both had the haddock which was delicious.  Also the wine recommended was good and not expensive. Service was great, ambiance authentic definitely a repeat!"}
{"text":"We were introduced to this restaurant by a Peruvian couple, and came here to celebrate a family event. We had a great evening here! The service was warm, the food was amazing, and the restaurant had a lovely atmosphere - classy yet family-friendly. 

We particularly enjoyed the ceviche. Ceviche is something we've always craved for, and here the Peruvian ceviche is served in two different styles - one with cubed fish and the other in \"tiradito\" (finely sliced) style. The starters tasting menus for two offer a value-for-money way to try different things (including the alpaca tartare and veal heart). 

Between us we had different items for the main course: alpaca burger, duck with rice (so flavorful it could _almost_ outshine the duck!), Peru sea bass, and beef. Their sauces make the difference.

The desserts had sauces / ice cream made with this fruit known as the lucuma, which hails from the faraway Andeans of Peru. It was explained to us that this amazing fruit is to Peru as the maple syrup is to Canadians. Well worth it!

I mustn't forget the drinks menu. The Pisco  Sour is a must. There are different variations here... we were spoilt for choice! They also have Peru wine."}
{"text":"I was excited to find this Peruvian treasure during a recent visit to Montreal. The Pisco Sours were potent. I had a couple varieties of ceviche. Everything was delicious and absolutely Peruvian. The restaurant itself was beautiful with an exposed wine cellar and gorgeous Peruvian art everywhere. I had a great time! A good Pisco Sour is difficult to find outside of South America!"}
{"text":"This restaurant has far exceeded my expectations. Michelle took my reservation and welcomed me like a family member. Awesome service and the food is amazing. I can truly recommend this place for a great night out"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Nice atmosphere. I ordered alpaca steak, it was delicious but my food was a bit salty."}
{"text":"What a wonderful meal.  Probably one of the best meals I've had in a long time.  The lomo was made to perfection and the lucoma (sp) ice cream was amazing.  The service was impeccable."}
{"text":"Excellent food and service. The waiter was so friendly and told us things about Montreal. The only issue was the food came out slowly. We ordered the octopus salad, ceviche mixto, and crevettes."}
{"text":"I got the \"Whole Chicken\" deal that comes with 3 sides (we picked rice, black beans, and sweet plantains) for the family.  Each individual item seemed to be cooked with great care and everybody loved it.  
This place is awesome and is a great addition to Concord."}
{"text":"Great ambience. Our waiter was very friendly and helpful. We had the ceviche for an appetizer, and it was excellent. Great pisco sours too. For dinner, I had the kingfish and my boyfriend had the shrimp. Both were delicious, but the fish took the prize. Both were garnished with exquisitely prepared vegetables, including the best brussel sprouts I've ever eaten. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"The food, the atmosphere and the service were great! Best chilcano in Montreal! Como en casa!"}
{"text":"This place is AMAZING!! Definitely a must try. The chicken is so moist and flavorful, it really makes all the difference. Decided to try on a whim and so glad we did. We will be going back for sure!"}
{"text":"I usually love this place but today I'm soooo disappointed.  Why at 3:40pm on a Saturday afternoon did they \"run out\"of chicken and rice???  This is a Peruvian restaurant, known for their chicken, and most of the meals come with rice. I drove a long way to get a meal and left only with plantains. So disappointed."}
{"text":"Went today with 2 other people. We were all disappointed that only the Summerlicious menu was available. The only good thing were the Anticuchos (although it was small) and the Mazamorra Morada. Everything else lacked flavour. The ceviche was underdone and had very little flavour. The potatoes in the Papa a la huancaina were under done. The chicha morada didn't have any fruit and was too sour. It needed more flavour (seems to be a trend with this restaurant). 

The server forgot about us a few times since we were the only ones that chose to eat in the patio.

I wouldn't recommend this overpriced restaurant."}
{"text":"I've had Peruvian food in Montreal closer to the real deal and way cheaper than this place. The ambiance is too dark to eat, the waiter barely spoke Spanish, the lúcuma ice-cream tasted like D'Onofrio (which is a cheap generic and artificial local brand) and the tiradito was not really all that for its pricing. You're better off in some other Peruvian eatery near Jean Talon."}
{"text":"This place brought me right back to my trip to Peru all those years ago. The Pisco Sours are the best I've had outside of South America, and everything else I tried was great. The Anticuchos were perfect - too bad it wasn't the Llama heart, but they had Llama elsewhere on the menu, so there's hope. :)

I'll be returning here the next time my dad is in the city, so we can remember our trip together. In the meantime, it was a lovely date night. Worth every penny."}
{"text":"I was treated to a delicious meal in this beautiful restaurant with a friend from Peru. I felt like I was in Miraflores or a museum there. Met the chef and owner. The washroom has a surprise."}
{"text":"More of a 4.5 but I wanted to balance out the average. This was one of the best meals I've had in the last year and the restaurant has quite interesting decor.

All of the dishes we had were very tasty (despite it being Summerlicious) and many had unique and surprising flavor combinations. The presentation and colour schemes were consistently appealing while still feeling unpretentious.

The mango daquiri had a delicious green mango taste and the chicha morada was light and refreshing.

The service was somewhat slow but very friendly. I definitely plan to return!"}
{"text":"Came  to Mochica with my friend for some authentic Peruvian cuisine. We  ordered  from the Summerlicious menu and we  chose items that were authentic but unable to get elsewhere .    Our starter was Alpaca  Tartare  , our  Main was Alpaca a la Cuzquena,our  dessert was mazzamora morada. I also got the chicha morada drink . The food was  excellent .  The restaurant is well laid out with lots of Peruvian culture on display in the form of curios and pictures on the walls.  The kitchen is visible through a window where we saw our  food being made ,   Our server Ellen was very  attentive , explained the menu & suggested some good drinks such as the pisco sour and checked on us throughout our meal to see if we were enjoying it .

Now to discuss the food we enjoyed  in detail .
STARTER -Alpaca Tartare: I have had Alpaca in dried meat form and today  having it as a tartare was a unique experience.  It came  with a quail egg on top and  some dips on the plate . I experimented with each bite having it with the tortilla chip and sauces. 
MAIN-Alpaca a la Cuzquena:  The Alpaca main was  braised  in a corn  based liquid from what I could figure out from eating  it and came on top of a  mushroom risotto. The Alpaca meat was  leaner and softer than beef or lamb and a hint of sweetness to it .  The risotto and the gravy were flavourful and mild which let the taste of the alpaca shine. We loved it . 
DESSERT-Mazzamora Morada- Our dessert   was a  tasty blend of corn , cinnamon & cloves. + the fruits  that came with it.  Left us feeling happy and relaxed after a tasty meal 

  I will be back  with friends to try  other dishes that  I  felt were   interesting such as the Ceviches, Anticucho de Corazon, Maracuya sour"}
{"text":"This restaurant was a delightful surprise.  A visiting friend and I had difficulty walking around the plateau finding a restaurant that could accommodate his gluten allergy.  Most items on Mochica's menu were sans gluten, happily.  I had the lamb leg and he the cubed steak.  Both of us were bowled over by just how delicious our meals were.  The service and presentation were top notch, the prices VERY reasonable and the taste was out-of-this-world.  I have had few culinary experiences like that where I am tasting flavors totally foreign to me and can't believe how good it is.  Highly recommended."}
{"text":"We're fans of Summerlicious/Wintelicious despite the criticism among some foodies and restauranteurs. We see it as an opportunity to try new restaurants without bleeding hard-earned $. Each year we try out several new restaurants through this biannual event and some of them have become our faves over the years.

We decided to give Mochica a shot during this year's Summerlicious and we were glad we did!

We had no idea what to expect from \"Peruvian cuisine\", but we figured we would never know unless we tried.

We were pleasantly surprised by its tantalizing Summerlicious menu. We both chose \"Tiradito\" or thinly sliced sashimi-grade raw fish for appetizers and Peruvian seafood paella for main dish. Fish was fresh and artfully garnished with tiny flowers and what seemed to be toasted corn kernels, diced fruit, and dried peppercorns(?) in yellow sauce. It was both refreshing and yummy.

Paella was loaded with seafood and served in a generous portion for a pre-fixe menu. A bit too spicy for our taste (we're wimps when it comes to spicy food!) but rice was perfectly done and was VERY tasty.

For desserts, we chose Inca pudding made from purple corn which was light and delightfully and crepes with milk jam (=dulce de leche). The latter added a \"classic/familiar dessert\" feel to the meal and satisfied the diner's sweet tooth.

We each had a glass of Pisco (Classico and Sour) which tasted sweet and bitter at the same time. Very unique and enjoyable.

Their service was friendly, prompt and attentive. The atmosphere was lively but not too noisy, and relaxed. We definitely enjoyed our meal and will most likely to return to Mochica on other occasions. Mochica is a good find for those craving something different yet tasty and pleasant."}
{"text":"I wanted this place to be good. I really did. First the good, the wine list is amazing. If you would like to try Peruvian wines, here they have a good selection of them. Now the bad, the food. I started with Papas a la Huancaina, what a disaster, the potatoes were undercooked and the sauce was watery, tasted old, and nothing like what I am used to in Peru. Papas a la Huancaina are usually my go to starter dish since its easy and simple to make. Somehow Mochica managed to give me something that not only tasted nothing like its supposed to, but seemed old and undesirable. Next I ordered Aji de Gallina. I was completely disappointed. Aji de gallina is supposed to be creamy and hearty. All I got was a runny sauce with no resemblance of what ahi de gallina is supposed to taste like. I was so disappointed at this point that I just left without ordering desert."}
{"text":"As peruvian myself I must say Mochica's like any other restaurant in Peru, the same flavor, the same ingredients (at least that's what I tasted). I felt like eating in my home country. However, we got our food one hour after we ordered, which was to much! The environment was charming, authentic but I really bothered me how slow the service was. Perhaps happened 'cause that day there was a big group of around 15 people ordering different stuff. But still you know... And there was just two waiters on a saturday!"}
{"text":"This was my first Peruvian food experience and I want to go back again! Some friends and I went for the summerlicious and their food was really good. The decor was interesting and their food presentation was appealing."}
{"text":"I was excited to know of a Peruvian restaurant, sadly I came to realize that it is disgrace to Peruvian food. This is not Peruvian food, please don't come here. Food portions were ridiculous, I understand what tasting portions are, this is not it. My partner got ceviche, with old fish & slimy sweet potatoe. Our server acknowledged that it was uneatable yet decided to do nothing about it. 
Now we have food poisoning. 
Please stop saying that this is Peruvian food.
It makes me ache and cry seeing the cooks wear Peruvian jerseys. FUCKING STOP!"}
{"text":"what great find
we were hungry and walking aimlessly and i was at that point where i get aggressive if i dont eat
we got here half hour before closing and without much hope for it maybe because of the bad mood
turned out to be a place where i know we will be back again and again
we had octopus to start and it was delicious
true that is one of my fave things on earth and i will eat it almost no matter what
but then i had scallops with black quinoa and my husband had goat and they were both amazing
it is not easy too cook goat and there are tricks to make it not taste like what a goat smells which are not hard to achieve but not everyone does
this dish was outstanding so i am assuming these people know just what to do
my scallops and surroundings had so much flavor i had a hard time figuring out what i was tasting which is pretty rare for me
i could not stop smiling
cocktails
dessert
service

{"text":"Over-the-top good. I've been three times now and each time - equally fantastic. The mac n cheese? Holy to die for - if you're southern, it tastes better than your grandmother's - not kidding. 

The chicken is perfectly seasoned and has a great flavor. Very juicy. I've gotten the avocado quinoa salad twice and it's just so good. Everything - even the fries!!!!

THE. SAUCES. Unbelievable. That is all. 

The most awesome thing about Mochica is the fact that they use organic and clean ingredients- including the chicken. This is very important to my family and we're THRILLED to have a place like this in Concord. 

And lastly, they're super accommodating and sweet. I can promise you won't be disappointed with your meal here!!!"}
