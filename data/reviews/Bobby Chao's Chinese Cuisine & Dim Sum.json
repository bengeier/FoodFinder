{"text":"Dim Sum is pretty nice, however the quality on dinner dishes have dropped significantly. My family used to be big fan of this place but not anymore...."}
{"text":"The only thing good about this was the location, the food had hairs in it, the service was bad and they didnt have the drinks onThe menu, and the food was generic. Not impressed"}
{"text":"Had the famous crispy chicken here for dinner. One piece of the chicken I was having was pink around the bone and bloody. We told the waitress and she told us, \"it's normal for Cantonese chicken dishes to be a little bit raw.\" I am not Cantonese so I might not know the custom. They didn't even say sorry but offered us a 10 % off. They offered the 10% off meaning they do know it is raw and wrong! Food. I would say it's mediocre. Ingredients definitely weren't fresh. Service. I felt humiliated!"}
{"text":"The Pho and Chinese restaurant is the same place, both equally bad. Also, Bobby does not cook anymore, he is a lazy man that walks around the restaurant.The main complaint was the speed of service, food came out dish by dish for over 2 hours. I am Chinese and this is the worst Chinese restaurant in the city.  The food and service is terrible!!! see below for the highlights of my experience, btw I went when it was half empty so i couldn't imagine it running full.  Food: The food was either overcooked or cold The food took way too long to come out of the kitchen (started dinner at 6:30 and finished at 9:30) The proportion of food has decreased since the opening Also, just took a look at their health inspection and they continuously violate health code ( http://www12.albertahealthservices.ca/health-inspections/SearchServlet?direct=showReport&ID=6731A542-DDFD-402B-9396-6D972290C8E6 )  Service: Waiters have zero respect for their customers They forgot to bring water 3 times until we spoke the the manager Did not refill the tea or rice pot until physically bringing it to the kitchen Waiters took the wrong order  I hope everyone well and can't wait till this place closes so the NW can be served with a better Chinese restaurant"}
{"text":"I went to get takeout on a Wednesday night.  The food is usually pretty good, especially their fried rice and noodles.  This time, the fried noodles and ginger beef was completely different and terrible.  I don't know for sure, but my guess is the chef is different.  Given all the options in the area, I won't come back."}
{"text":"I will say that the dim sum here is actually pretty good.   I will also say that the staff here are among the most sour, joyless and unpleasant I've ever been subjected to. What makes it worse is that you practically have to light a napkin on fire to get their attention, it's actually ridiculous.    It's too bad, because there aren't a lot of options for good dim sum outside of downtown, so I find myself supporting them more than they actually deserve."}
{"text":"I usually order delivery from this place which arrives promptly and hot! The driver is always courteous and pleasant and the food NEVER fails to please. It is tasty, never to greasy or salty with just the right amount of kick! If there is a glitch in the just eat app, they always call to confirm my order before sending. Which, I appreciate and shows the high level of service standards they offer!"}
{"text":"Our go to restaurant for Authentic Chinese Dinner.  Consistently good quality and portions are large.  Their Peking duck is great along with the baked crab on rice.  Service could be improved, but you don't really go to a Chinese restaurant for the service...  :)  I have never been next door for the Viet food but I hear it isn't the best."}
{"text":"We are officially DONE with this place! The food is okay, but the service is atrocious. We have ordered take-out on multiple occasions and almost each time, an item has been forgotten and we have had to drive back to the restaurant to get it. After this last time, and no indication from the staff that they were sorry for our inconvenience, we've decided to take our money elsewhere. Check your orders before you leave the restaurant with your take-out, or just don't bother ordering here. There are more reliable places that actually care about providing great customer service and decent food."}
{"text":"LOTS of MSG.  Some dishes were cold when they were served and they did not taste good.  Bad Service: I didn't expect much of the service since it is a Chinese restaurant. But wow, the service is extremely bad. They did not give us tea until almost towards the end of dinner and they were not even busy."}
{"text":"I've frequented this restaurant quite a bit dining in as well as take out. Dishes typically range in the $12 - $14 range. The food has been consistently good and the place has always been busy regardless of the night.  Service has always been good as well  It is not a place that I would go out of my way to get to but would be considered a good bet for NW residents looking for good food, decent portions, at a reasonable price."}
{"text":"I think they upped their game since 2017. Very large menu with lots of special items. Its a guarantee satisfaction place."}
{"text":"I'm on the fence with this place, I've had four meals so far, yes their service could definitely be better and the staff could speak better English because usually I have a group of six or seven staff there's only one who speaks some passable English and they just make her take my order because otherwise nobody understands what I'm trying to say. The food is not as bad as these negative reviews I see here, but on the other hand not as good as the positive ones, in fact I wouldn't be surprised if the restaurant owner is writing these positive reviews because no it's definitely not that great. Each time I order their hot and sour soup because it is one of my favorites and probably less calories than the other crap I could order, my kids say variously it either smells like old gym socks or cadaver feet. Which rather lowers my appetite. It is true that their hot and Sour soup is one of the worst I've ever had. And one day I ordered beef vermicelli noodles and was sick all day the next day, it's the only thing I ate that day other than cereal therefore I know it was food poisoning so I'm guessing the kitchen is filthy. Probably I should never go here again but I have had a couple of good meals, and unfortunately it's literally the closest restaurant to my house and they have free Delivery for orders over $30 although I am worried about trying that feature because other people have said there's always items missing. We will see. Hopefully things will improve in the future."}
{"text":"This is my favourite place for Chinese delivery. Everything is delicious and the staff is great. The ginger beef is comparable to none, and everything is always hot and fresh. If you don't order from Bobby Chao you're doing it wrong."}
{"text":"We were in the neighborhood and decided we felt  like Vietnamese. Upon arriving at Bobby Pho's, it was clearly a Chinese restaurant but they did have a Vietnamese menu as well. It was very busy and everyone there was eating Chinese food. I didn't see any Vietnamese dishes. We ordered two vermicelli bowls;  Charbroiled Chicken and Spring Rolls and the Lemon Grass Pork chop with Spring rolls. When the food came, we couldn't tell the difference between the two dishes. They both could have been pork possibly. We tried to ask but as many other yelpers have already noted, the service was abysmal. The meat was very heavily spiced with what tasted like 5 spice. I didn't taste much else. The spring rolls were dreadful, tasting of minced onion. Again, the meat, if any, was unidentifiable. The flavorings were not reminiscent of any Vietnamese dishes I've ever had in this city. But on the plus side, the veggies were fresh and crisp.  I definitely would not recommend ordering either of these dishes."}
{"text":"Never again!!!! Horrible service as the waitresses brought us the wrong food, and would never hear us trying to get their attention. On top of that they took 20 minutes to get us a can of sprite and the fried rice took way longer than it should have. The blender was being used  right in the middle of the restaurant and was EXTREMELY loud. We won't be returning any time soon....or ever! Don't recommend  Bobby Choas for anyone..."}
{"text":"Was recently treated to a  wonderful Hong Kong-style dinner  which included duck egg yolk coated fried softshell crab, an especially good value for the sizeable and meaty specimens priced at $6 apiece, spicy wok-fried dungeness crab, Hong Kong Style steak nuggets in a piquant sauce, sauteed pea pod shoots in broth and an oyster and tofu clay pot.  Dishes are prepared well and generous in portion.  Service is fair for a Chinese restaurant.  Atmosphere is likewise fair and seating is comfortable with a good amount of space between tables.  I would readily recommend this restaurant to family or friends, and I look forward to dining there again."}
{"text":"Well, it's been three years since I've been so we decided to try it again last night.  Very nice surprise from last time - change of ownership and direction of food and service.  They have expanded and added to their menu - it now has Pho and fresh roasted meats (BBQ Pork, Chicken, Duck, Pork Belly).  The Sifu who was at Happy Valley in Chinatown is the guy who runs the roasted meats here and it is very good.  I have found my new Sui Yook place.    Onto the dinner - we ordered two authentic Chinese dishes along with white rice - Fish fillets with Vegetables and Pea Shoots with Crab Meat.  HUGE portions on both, so well worth the price tag.  The taste was also very good.  Super picky eater liked the fish fillets, they were well seasoned with onions, ginger, garlic, etc.  The pea shoots were well done, just soft enough but with some snap left.  And the crab meat topping was not too salty as other places do it.    Wait staff was very attentive and friendly, different from last time.  The owner / manager was onsite and very hands on, which is very good to see.  So, I will give them an upgrade as there has been a real improvement in both service and food.  The parking still sucks, but not much anyone can do about that."}
{"text":"The food is just ok; and the service - is horrible both for dine-in and ordering take-out (the lady on the phone was rude and insulting).  I don't have high standard for any Chinese restaurants in Calgary but this one is terrible after a couple of visits (dine-in and take-out).  I won't give this place another chance!"}
{"text":"One Of The Best Chines Food Restaurants I've Ever Had. Food Is Always Hot And Fresh. Tasty. Nice Friendly Staff. They Have Many Kinds Of Dishes As Well As Bubble Teas."}
{"text":"We have been to Bobby Chao's since his small restaurant days on 36 Street SE in Forest Lawn.  Even back then, I recognize immediately that this Bobby Chao guy knows how to cook well.  Fast forward to today, the restaurant is much bigger and in the NW where there is a big Chinese population.  We do not come here too often, but when restaurants closer to our home is packed full.  Bobby Chao always come through, since it has a large expanded space that it started leasing a few years back to do Vietnamese noodle but really it is an overflow to its bread and butter Chinese food business.  The restaurant is obviously doing quite well with the big crowd, but more importantly the quality of food is still top notch.  My all time favorites are French Style Bake Crab or Oyster, Braised Whole Pork Hock, Lotus Leaf Lobster with Rice.  The bad thing about the restaurant is parking.  The parking lot is always tight and the City removed some on-street parking in front of and across from the strip mall for some strange reason, so now you need to park in front of other people's houses, which I am sure was not the intent.  The mall owner and local residents should write a petition to the City to have the on-street parking reinstated, as there is no safety reason why the parking was removed.  As for customer service, it is in line with other authentic Chinese restaurants.  It is not the best and not the worst either.  It is definitely better than having good customer service and then getting nasty food, which a lot of restaurants do.  Although I now only come to Bobby Chao's 4-5 times a year, this is a restaurant that I don't mind going back to from time to time, even though it is not the closest to our house."}
{"text":"I've been to Bobby Chao's about 3 times now. It would not be my first choice for Chinese food but if you are looking for fairly authentic Chinese food in Edgemont it's a good place. I have to say that I was disappointed with my last meal. I had a craving for Salt & Pepper squid and the squid was a tad overcooked and tended to the rubbery side. The Snow Pea leaves with Garlic sauce was just OK. Service was friendly and efficient. I've had dim sum there before and it is fairly decent. When I go for Chinese food I'm looking for a place that doesn't offer up Ginger Beef and Sweet and Sour as their main fare, although it is a perception that these are staples of Chinese cuisine, for someone who was born and lived in Asia, these dishes are not representative of Chinese food, Bobby Chao's offers an interesting selection of dishes and flavours are OK, I don't think they have a Wow factor in the dishes but a good place for being out of the way."}
{"text":"What a pleasant surprise! They upgraded the tables and chairs!  The servers are happy (they smile now)!  The best thing is that you can now actually read the bill (the items listed are both in English and Chinese).  We still haven't tried their Vietnamese fare or roast items (they now sell roast duck, roast pork, BBQ pork, soy chicken) yet.  P.S.  Their French style baked oysters are still the best in town.  A lot of succulent oyster, less mayo."}
{"text":"Food was very tasty once we warmed it up. Delivery took just over an hour and a half so it was cold when it got here. Got a flyer in the mail so thought we would try it. We ordered what we usually do from other restaurants but it cost about $20 more than where we usually order from. Can't complain about the quality of the food. Chicken fried rice was awesome."}
{"text":"This place is a \"go-to\" for us. It's close to where we live in Edgemont. They have lots of verity, large menu and even have bubble tea.   If you eat there, the customer service is great. Food comes out quick and the decor is simple and modern. The food is delicious.   We've had food for take-out (10% off) and delivery. Service for delivery is quick but takeout takes some time so be sure to order in advance.   Bubble teas are average and not worth the money.   Overall, a great place. We are loyal to them."}
{"text":"Ordered their combination dinner for 1, had won ton soup, chicken fried rice, ginger beef and sweet and sour pork (a substitution). Their won ton soup is excellent, that is my favourite dish to get at any Chinese food restaurant and they nailed it.  The rest of the meal was quite good, I would definitely order from them again.  Their delivery is fast also!"}
{"text":"Wow. Upgraded furnishings, and the servers now smile at you! Best of all, the dim sum is as good as I remember it, if not better, and the portions are generous. Shanghai soup dumplings, shrimp dumplings, radish cake, scallop and choice soft rice crepes, beef and flat rice noodles, beef congee, sticky rice, breaded salt and pepper pork chops, shiu mai, even mango pudding was good! This is my 5th year eating here (haven't been to the Vietnamese side yet) and I've seen it progress from so-so to delightful."}
{"text":"Had dim sum again at Bobby Chao's.    This time we wanted to try different items:  - House Special Dumplings - minced pork with ginger and garlic - very freshly made and tastes really good - the skin is like the Chui Chow Dumplings (with peanuts) but the skin is not tough like some other dim sum places         - Hot Pot Rice with Pork, Salty Fish & Egg - this came last 'cos I guess it took a while to steam - the pork was so tender, there was a hint of salty fish, the rice was steaming hot in that claypot and a raw egg sits on top of it all.  Quickly, stir in the raw egg and it cooks in the heat of the rice and pork.  Also, stir in the slightly sweet soya sauce as well.  The egg makes it meld togther quite well.  If you've had Korean Dolsot Bibimbap, it's quite like that except it's Chinese style, Bobby Chao style!  NOTE:  Bobby Chao is expanding - the owner is renovating next door to its restaurant.  It wil be a VIP Room for group dinners and the Bobby Chao Vietnamese Pho and Bubble Tea.  Can't wait for it to open!"}
{"text":"If you want quantity, value and taste, this is a sure thing.  By vancouver standards, their dishes are monstrous--as pics indicate w/ the bok choy, it's enough to feed a family of 4, maybe even 6!  The pork belly w/ mui choy was good, though i've had it better back home in Richmond by szechuan chefs but still tasty.  nice clean resto, good customer service and free parking.  Not one your typical hole in the wall as it seems to be in a well to do burb, up in Edgemont. that even sounds high-end lol"}
{"text":"I was really craving Pho and nothing was open, so my boyfriend suggested we check out Bobby Chao's in Edgemont, since it's super close. Seems like there are two separate restaurants, one for Chinese Food/Dim Sum, and one for Vietnamese/Pho. Slightly confusing, especially as we walked into the Viet side and were told to go to the other side, as it was closed. Walking in on the other side felt completely awkward. Everyone was staring at us like we didn't belong there, and nobody acknowledged our presence. We wanted to order to-go, but the menus were all in Chinese. A lady working at the till gave us another, which we then proceeded to order from. She kept cutting us off, and just being pretty rude in general when we inquired about a certain dish.  I was getting frustrated at their attitudes and was pretty 'hangry' at that point, and I guess I looked annoyed because that was when she started being nice, apologizing that she couldn't understand us. We finished ordering and waited, after taking home our food we were really disappointed. I know this isn't a Vietnamese place, but don't advertise it if you cant do it properly. And it's pretty hard to screw up Pho! Never again."}
{"text":"I've been to this place with my family while I was going back to Calgary for a visit. I like the food there. I remember I was here  for dinner and I got some pretty decent Chinese food from this place. I never got a chance to tried out dim sum from them though. Maybe next time I visited I suggest to my family we go for dim sum here."}
{"text":"I MISS CONGEE QUEEN!  Moving to Calgary from Toronto, I've been on the search for my Chinese staple.  Congee queen in Toronto is the best!  (see my review for it for a better understanding)  So I decided to try Bobby's in search of my Chinese staple and unfortunately it was just OK for me.  We came on a Sunday afternoon so the main location was closed and all customers were redirected to their Pho Side.  We were still able to order dim sum and they also had a tea time menu.  It wasn't really busy at the time and service was ok - typical Asian service where if you need something ... just ask!  I'm ok with this as you don't have a server standing at your table and it's just what's to be expected.  We ordered:  steamed bbq pork buns, hargaw, cantonese chow mein and 3 types of bbq w/steamed rice.  Everything tasted ok just subpar and nothing memorable for me.  The bbq was quite tasty and fresh.  They brought the steamed rice in a metal container to keep warm - nice touch!  I just kept comparing it to my fav place in Toronto so everything was ok.  I don't think I will return as it is out of the way and was sub par."}
