{"text":"This place was a wonderful find while we were walking around The Fremont Street Experience. The food is wonderful! The gyro was amazingly flavorful. The meat was perfection the pita that wrapped it was soft and delicious. The half pastrami sandwich was really more like a full sandwich. The dolmades were the best I've ever had! But it the baklava that has me leaving this review. Oh my gosh! The owner told me it was going to be the best. He wasn't lying. It is indeed the best I've had, even though I'm eating it the next day. I will definitely stop here again on our next trip to Vegas."}
{"text":"Went in, because it was too darn hot to walk farther and I was looking for something cheap and fast. $9 for gyro plate...I was okay with that. I bought a small soda...eek, total bill was $14 and change. After $2 tip, $2 parking.  Almost $20 for just okay food. Portion size was good and food came out fast."}
{"text":"I love this place, the service is great and quick and the baklava is amazing. I dont like how tiny it is in here. Sometimes one big party of guests can fill the entire place. But that has only happened twice out of all the times ive been here. I have liked almost everything i have eaten"}
{"text":"I am surprised that this place is still open. The employees are horrible! I've been here 3 or 4 times. The last time, I just left!! I ordered Lentil soup and a Gyro. After about 15 or 20 mins, I ask if I could get my soup. The sever said \"No, we make it to order.\"  Really? Soup made to order? No thanks!! The only reason for 2 stars is because the food (before) was ok, but still, even then, servers were not happy to be there.  

To the owner:  Your employees are rude!! I am not an arbitrarily bad review writer. If your soup is, in deed,  made to order, you might be in the wrong business.  Date 08/09/15."}
{"text":"We had the steak, shrimp and chicken kabobs with rice. So fresh and delicious. Great location on Fremont is a plus. Service was great."}
{"text":"I was in search of something to eat that didn't come from a walk up window or a standing room only area right as I stumbled around this place.  Looked at the specials in the window and decided $10 for a gyro and fries wasn't the  best deal but I was hungry.  I went in ordered but a not so smiley Jessica.  I went back to where my kids were sitting and decided I wanted to see if the had hummus on the menu and just then I heard Jessica Yelling at my kids \" NO DONT DO THAT\" as she comes running from behind the counter to grab the sugar packets out of there hands that they had taken out of the container.  I was completely embarrassed not of the fact that my children had moved the sugar packets out of the container but that this crazy lady is screaming and running toward us over SUGAR PACKETS!!! I immediately told her I would take it to go, I just wanted out of there.  By the time I got back to my car to eat my food the gyro was cold it had way to much sauce and there was oil dripping out the ptia from the \"meat\" I watched the cook pull from some rubber container from the fridge...The fries were ok but there were in the middle of switching brands of ketchup so I got a few Heinz packets and a few Sysco type brand...yuck! I will not be going back there and I hope that if this place wants to stay in business they will drop the dead weight!"}
{"text":"Nice place next to heartattack grill on freemont.  Seating is both indoor and outside.  It is not an upscale place you order at the counter. But the menu is huge.  Plenty of vegatarium and non Greek items.  They even have burgers.  The food was good and the service was fine a bit slow but not terrible.  Want a different food on freemont give it a shot.  I had the Gyro and the bread was fresh and the meat was well seasoned just not a lot of meet. But with all the salad and other things piled in I left full"}
{"text":"Been here a few times now, the ambiance is classic, a good place for a downtown eatery. Greek food isn't their focus, but what they have to offer isn't bad (gyros, wraps, falafels) small eating space, but the pricing isn't bad. Portioning is on styrofoam plates, but they try to fill it as best as they could. Personally I'd recommend a choice of the hot subs, or the gyros or wraps. The menu has a lot of variety, but any choice would be satisfying. Overall 3/5 stars, would come back again. (Update after eating) the meat was seasoned well, gyro falls apart at some points. And a major problem I had was that my girlfriend ordered the chicken gyro, but halfway through the meal she begins to find beef and lamb pieces. She doesn't eat red meats, so this was alarming. An issue is address from the beginning, to make sure no meats are crossing each other for future reference."}
{"text":"Would rate a 10 star !
Amazing service delish food !
Love the sweet potato fries mmmm !"}
{"text":"These people should be ashamed of giving such a name to their restaurant  (couscous Mediterranean food).
There food sucks and has nothing to relate to being Mediterranean. All pre made bad tasting food.
I grew up on the Mediterranean and I know all about the food there.
I advise you to save your hard owned $$$and go spend it else where unless you just want to stuff your fave with whatever"}
{"text":"You really have to be looking for this place to find it, but it's definitely worth checking out.  It's located in Neonopolis just west of the Heart Attack Grill.

The place is tiny and cute, and the food is classified as Mediterranean, and made to order.  Menu items include: pitas, skewers, soup (gazpacho, lobster bisque), sandwiches, coffee, gelato, and assorted other desserts.

I decided to try the lobster bisque; the soup was pretty good - It's rare to see lobster bisque on a menu in Vegas, and it was just what I wanted now that the weather is getting cooler.

Since the place is so small, it's only natural to strike up a conversation with the other patrons since you're practically sitting together, which is a refreshing change from the surrounding bars and casino restaurants.

If you come across this place, stop in and check it out."}
{"text":"The food isn't great. The falafels were hard and cold. The hummus was bland. The spanakopita wasn't bad but tasted odd. The gyro was decent. 

They served all of our meals on styrofoam plates and bowls. 

I wouldn't recommend."}
{"text":"I don't really know what this is, but it certainly isn't Mediterranean. The service is awful, but the food is even worse! We walked in because it sounded healthier than other options around. There are several things awful about this place. I will list them. 
1. Instead of using pita bread, they used a stale, old torilla. 
2. The food came COLD. Not room temperature cold, FRIDGE cold! 
3. Everything was smothered in some weird tasteless reddish brown sauce. They tried to tell me that it is tahini sauce.
4. When I took the food back and told them it was awful and that I wasn't going to eat it. They tried to tell me that the food was cold because the vegetables were \"Fresh\". I explained that the chicken too was cold. The owner just stared at me. I said I wasn't going to eat it. And they continued staring at me. Didn't offer a refund. Didn't offer to make something else. Didn't offer to warm it up or to remake it. Nothing. 
5. Rude service. Terrible, terrible, terrible food. Like seriously, the worst I've ever head."}
{"text":"I'm a Downtown Vegas local and this WAS my go-to gyro place. I've visited maybe 20 times over the past year. For me, it was a loaded gyro that more than satisfied for the $.

HOWEVER, today I dropped in for my usual and upon digging in, I noticed HALF of the beef/lamb meat was missing. I asked the server what gives and apparently mgmt let their old cook go bc he was using too many ingredients. They now weigh each plate before sending it out. Gone was the familiar hearty gyro with 7-8 slices of meat. I ate a sad sandwich with only 3 slices and left hungry. 

I understand the economics of running a business; if you need to stay profitable, bump your prices like everyone else, don't serve me a pathetic sandwich. Sadly, that was most likely the last time I visit Cous Cous."}
{"text":"I ate here years ago and remembered it as being good. I tried it again last night and it did not impress. I had the falafel pita. The falafel was not your typical round balls but rather a hamburger shaped patty. The flavor was decent but it was an odd orange color. The pita itself was a bit tough. The way they had it wrapped encouraged eating it from the top down. It had an OK sauce with lots of cucumbers and tomatoes at the top. This helped because there was no falafel pieces to bite in to at the edges of the pita. However,  once at the bottom I was left with a pita full of dry lettuce, no sauce, cucumber or falafel left. Overall it was very disappointing. Maybe if I had cut it all up and mixed it first it would have been better?"}
{"text":"Friendly Staff, Clean, Typical Mediterranean food. Location is good. Halal"}
{"text":"The best Mediterranean food my wife and I have ever had, not to mention affordable.  Both times we visited over the past year, it was the best meal we had in Las Vegas during our stay.  The golden best salad is phenomenal and to die for.  The restaurant is located beside the Heart Attack Grill at the Fremont Street Experience."}
{"text":"Pay the same as you would for the junk food on the street but get quality food here. I got a falafel wrap and it was really fresh and the tzatiki was delicious. Also the cous cous was good too=)

I'm really picky about falafel too cause I worked at a Greek restaurant for a while when I was a teen but this place made it just fine.

Thanks for the great service and food!!"}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I ate here yesterday, and by midnight we both had the worst food poisoning ever. It was the only meal we ate together yesterday and have the exact same symptoms. The only reason there are stars is because the staff was very nice and attentive and she shouldn't be blamed for what happens in the kitchen. We live in the neighborhood and will never eat at this place again. Eat here at your own risk."}
{"text":"Food is decent, but service is definitely lacking. Just be aware when you're heading there for something a little different that you will have to compromise in this department."}
{"text":"Food is ok. For a restaurant on Fremont St there should be more than two people working at 2 in the afternoon in St Patricks day. Took over 30 min to receive food!!  Will not be back."}
{"text":"Great food! Perfect location!
This is definitely a place you  must stop to eat at while hanging out on Fremont street!"}
{"text":"I just had their beef kabobs with white rice. the meat was very tender and the rice was very good. the portions could be a little bit larger but overall the flavor was there. They probably need to hire one more person at the register it took a little bit longer than expected. I would eat there again overall my experience with 4 out of 5 Stars I guess I would have given it five stars if the portions were a little bit bigger."}
{"text":"Delicious! After underwhelming food experiences on Fremont Street, this place was a breath of fresh air. Too bad you have to try and find it behind the scaffolding and jersey barriers holding up the zip line. C'mon Fremont Street, can't you come up with a better design so no business has to suffer at the expense of another?"}
{"text":"What a refreshing, healthier option while staying in Vegas! There's only so much prime rib and fried foods one can eat, especially a vegetarian and meat eating-non seafood eating husband! We had a delightful meal, sat outside and people watched (whoa!). Great price, too! Highly suggest you check it out!"}
{"text":"This is an excellent place to eat. I've not tried everything on the menu yet. The Gyro is ok, actually Pita Kitchen in Sherman Oaks California is better but the Gyro tacos are excellent. 
Today I'm having the Philly paninis. The Lagunitas IPA is excellent as well. The service is excellent."}
{"text":"this place was great when it first opened.  since then, quality has gone down, and prices have gone up.  I went there for lunch almost every day a while ago, now I never go.  Hope they wise up and go back to how it used to be, probably not, since tourists will still probably fill this place.  too bad nobody cares about keeping up with quality and keeping local business.  on another note, the couscous is great."}
{"text":"My husband and I stumbled upon this little gem a while back when we were on Fremont doing the the touristy Zip Lines. 

He was in the mood for a Burger and I wanted Greek. This place satisfied us both. They had a Turkey Pesto Burger that he said was tender and juicy and \"all the good things a Burger should be\". 

I ventured out and had the Lamb Shawarma Pita. It was love at first bite. The lamb was tender and the sauce made me long for more when it was all gone. 

We came in here late and noticed several of the local Fremont performers (such as the Bumblebee Transformer) were dining here. We got to chat with them and had a great time. The staff was hilarious. 

I thought the prices were great for Downtown Las Vegas especially for a healthier option than the usual greasy food."}
{"text":"It was delicious exactlly what i wanted. some light healthy tasty food.  I will be going back again.  As someone who lives downtown  we need more places  like this"}
{"text":"Being a Canadian living in the US I get a little excited anytime I see poutine advertised so we had to give it a try. There was a Canadian flag sticker on the register and, when I asked about it, was told the owner is Canadian. Heading in the right direction! The poutine arrived and, at fist glance, looked good. Nicely browned fries and lots of brown gravy. But, something was off. Instead of big pieces of fresh cheese curd there were little cubes of some cheese. Not sure what kind and I didn't ask. A major disappointment. The fries themselves were really tasty. I'd forgo the poutine and just get plain fries.

The lamb shawarma pocket was just ok. The lamb was on the dry side and not overly flavorful, although in their defence when we asked what the best shawarma meat was they said chicken or beef.. The veggies were fresh as was the pita."}
{"text":"So happy to find a healthy option to eat on Fremont Street. Great location, nice staff and cute chill vibe."}
{"text":"Way less crowded than the other places on Fremont. Excellent food choices. Delicious
Lamb burger is mouth watering. Also got the Greek wrap with spinach tortilla. Yum. Oh and they have sweet potato fries my favorite! Kudos to the chef!"}
{"text":"Not fresh food and few customers. Call themselves halal but they serve pork as well. Convenient location close to Fremont Street activities. Not sure if I would visit again."}
{"text":"Have since been back and still love this place. Fun, friendly staff and great inexpensive food. :)"}
{"text":"Surprisingly good fare at an good price. Quick meal early afternoon. Gyro and Greek salad a better alternative to burgers friend or questionable oriental restaurants nearby."}
{"text":"Great little spot, super friendly staff. I ordered the falafel wrap with  tzatziki instead of tahini. Best tzatziki I've ever had!!!"}
{"text":"I ordered a Shawarma, which came out ice cold. I asked if it was supposed to be cold, and they said yes, only the beef is cooked. Which I can understand, but fresh veggies doesn't mean borderline frozen! The falafel was all right, but the tahini sauce was literally flavorless. Definitely wouldn't go back."}
{"text":"I really hope they advertise to the rest of the downtown residents bc THIS PLACE IS GREAT! The owner Renatto is awesome, and really wants you to have an excellent experience. You have to try the scallop kabobs with couscous and the strawberry gelato pita! Also, they're open with full kitchen until midnight and you can byob :) I'll definitely be going back soon!"}
{"text":"Wonderful place for lunch . it is a quiet place with soft Mediterranean music playing in background. The gyro platter with pita and vegetables was outstanding. Great value for the quality. Definitely a place to regroup after the noisy casino atmosphere."}
{"text":"Food was tasty. The portion size was generous for the price. The service was what I expected from a small restaurant.  They took my order, brought out hot food, and refilled my drink other than that they were busy taking and filling orders. This is the kind of place that if you need something you need to go to the front counter and ask for it."}
{"text":"I went here for lunch, & it was tasty food, clean place & the owner was working hard too.
Outstanding Greek Salad, I was hungry & it was enough for two.
I bet all the menu had great food.
At one end of Fremont & not loud inside either."}
{"text":"Took over 40 minutes for one sandwich!! Staff very rude and unprofessional. Over priced and over rated.. Save the trip and go downt the street  to the other Mediterranean restaurant"}
{"text":"I was recently in Vegas with my mother to deal with some family business and we ended up at Cous Cous Mediterranean Cafe for lunch one day.  My mom had been stressed out and was trying to relax when Joshua Burkett, (one of?) the assistant manager(s?) came out and started chatting with us.  He listened to her troubles and concerns while our food was being cooked, offered a drink to help with the stress, and then stayed and continued to chat as we ate.  That is not to say that he neglected the duties of his job.  He would occasionally walk off to take care of business, but he would come back and lend an empathetic ear.  By the end of our meal, it felt like we had made a friend.  He went so above and beyond the call of duty in offering us customer service that I felt it needed to be recognized here.  

The food itself was tasty.  I am vegan and was glad to find a place that catered to my needs with a minimum of special ordering.  It also happened to be one of the healthiest meals we had on this trip.  I would try to visit again if I ever return to Vegas, and its location on Fremont Street makes it convenient as a restaurant stop when gambling."}
{"text":"Even with all the casinos around, when you're downtown every day like me, the lunch choices for a non-tourist are scarce. Believe it or not I don't really want a buffet or $6.99 prime rib Monday-Friday. This new little cafe popped up and gave me another option to explore. 

Let me begin with the couscous. YUM! I could just eat a plate of that and be done with it. The chicken skewer is tasty and the sides of veggies, pita and gyro sauce is more than enough for lunch. I had the gyro platter last time, also delicious. That's also when I began my couscous love affair. The menu has a good variety. Not the cheapest lunch in town but the portions make up for it. The staff is really nice and checks up on you as you enjoy your meal. They offer gelato but I have yet to try it. 

Go try it, even if it's just for a little snack of pita and sauce, so yummy. I hope this place makes it in the sometimes dicey shadow of Neonopolis."}
{"text":"WORST PLACE EVER! Never eat here! HORRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! The owner knows nothing about customer service and gave me attitude for his mistakes. The food also sucked. If you want real Mediterranean food DO NOT COME HERE! I repeat DO NOT COME HERE!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is THE hidden gem on Fremont Street. The owner and staff are so friendly. I've been there three times for lunch in the last two weeks. Yes, it's THAT good. Twice I ordered the shrimp skewers plate. Both times, the shrimp were cooked perfectly! The plate comes with hummus (I think it's a red bell pepper hummus), pita, veggies, and Israeli couscous.... Oh, that couscous. It is SO GOOD! I've made couscous several times and each time, it comes out quite bland. This place works some magic on the couscous because it is really flavorful!

The last time I went, I ordered the lentil soup. Upon first sight, I didn't think I'd be impressed. The broth was watery and the lentils whole. I was expecting more like a split-pea soup. But the soup was hearty and delicious. 

Would highly recommend Cous Cous! (And they serve beer and wine. Bonus.)"}
{"text":"The food was incredible. I ordered a gyro and it was awesome. I am glad  I am local, so I can go back again! The staff was friendly and the place was very clean. This is hit with me and my husband. I will be telling friends."}
{"text":"Great small spot that we went into just because. I had the Mediterranean bowl and it was perfect. For a low price to get such great food, I'm glad to have been!"}
{"text":"One of the best gyros ever! If you are downtown make sure you stop in. They have a very extensive menu with more then you would ever expect! Wonderful service!"}
{"text":"I am really torn about reviewing this little shop. On the one hand, the girl at the counter was really nice, and the guy who made my sandwich was great about adding whatever I wanted. Additionally, the sandwich was actually pretty delicious and fresh which was totally unexpected from a Fremont Street/DT Vegas chain on a Sunday night.

On the other hand, I asked to add pepperoni (got peperoncini at first, then added the right thing) and I asked for NO CHEESE. This is not a fancy-person affected lifestyle choice: I am highly allergic to dairy products. The first half of my sandwich was delicious and amazing and as I ordered. The second half had cheese, and I could have died.

So... Three stars? ... and a recommendation that they read order slips more carefully."}
{"text":"Delicious gyro! Definitely get the gyro. The lamb is amazing! My hubby had lamb envy. Lol!

Hands down the best baklava I've ever had. The owner makes it himself. Thick, crispy, so sweet. Ahhhh.

We ordered an extra 2 gyro plates and baklava to go. Ha! 

Super casual, plastic plates, silverware, cups, etc. Sit on the patio and people watch.

Great service, very friendly people! Definitely be back!"}
{"text":"This is a great place for groups that want to comprimise between vegetarians and those that want a hamburger.  Look for it adjacent to Heart Attack Grill."}
{"text":"I was pretty disappointed after my dinner at Couscous tonight. I went with my family-- five adults and two children-- and we all ordered dinner and appetizers. My salad was nothing like the menu description and came with--get this-- quartered BabyBel minis instead of goat cheese. I stated to the server, \"I thought this came with goat cheese,\" and he responded that it WAS goat cheese. Really dude? I mean, tell me you ran out. Tell me it was a mistake. Tell me pretty much ANYTHING, but don't lie to me. I know what freakin' goat cheese tastes like. My Mother had lamb that she said was incredibly tough. The hummus and baba ghanouj  were mediocre. Meh. It happens. Afterward, we were listening to a street musician a few yards from the door when the server ran out hollering about us not paying... except we did pay and had the receipt to prove it. I'm not outraged, the service was fairly friendly, but the food was a bummer and the fibbing waiter left me unwilling to spend my money at Couscous again."}
{"text":"Great little place with an extensive menu, tasty and healthier options than around in the Fremont street experience.  The cashier was very nice and personable.  I will go there again."}
{"text":"Great chicken kabob and shawarma! Great lunch place if you're by downtown. They are always friendly."}
{"text":"THAT ONE STAR WAS FOR THE FOOD. The food was good, let's just say that. For something quick and not so unhealthy. BUT personally me I enjoy my food more when I have GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE, especially when we walk in and say \"we've never been here\" and the girl behind the counter looks at us like we're stupid just points at a menu... Mmmm \"don't you want to walk us through your delicious top selling items.?\" To say the least; THE SERVICE WAS HORRIBLE FROM THE MINUTE WE WALKED IN TO THE MINUTE WE WALKED OUT. I can go on and on about my whole experience... I didn't see the workers smile not once to all the customers walking in, so unprofessional, no one asked how we were doing... how our food was, nothing...didn't get a warm \"Welcome\" nor a \"Thank you, have a good day.!\" Small things like that matter because this isn't a \"chain\" restaurant you gain clientele by word of mouth and \"reviews\" from experienced individuals. There's so many other places to choice from ESPECIALLY being down in the heart of Fremont. Take your business elsewhere."}
{"text":"SERIOUSLY SO GOOD! I work downtown and come here nearly everyday on my lunch break. There's not one thing on the menu that isn't delicious. My personal favorite would be any of the kabob platters. Its a ton of food! Meat and veggies are on the kabob, your choice of either rice or toasted couscous, pita and hummus, and some more veggies. If you're traveling with kids or more picky people they have things like chicken wings and mozz sticks,  also delicious burgers and salads. Wraps too! All of the Mediterranean selections taste authentic and delicious. 

The service is always on point and if you're lucky to be there while the owner is he is such a sweetheart! The restaurant has a nice ambiance with plush bences, also cute tables and a nice outdoor patio. The bathrooms there are for customers only, which prevents the....more.. eccentric people... you often run into downtown from coming in and out. 

You definitely wont regret dining here!"}
{"text":"Let me preface by saying I am middle eastern and very familiar with the cuisine. I almost ordered a gyros sandwich, but noticed a customer eating gyros and realized that it was those paper thin frozen gyros. So I ordered the beef shawarma pita pocket and my husband ordered a falafel wrap. His wrap was filled with veggies, tahini sauce and 2.5 falafels!! You get more falafels in an appetizer! The beef shawarma pita had slightly more meat (all at the bottom of the sandwich), but the spice on the beef shawarma was different, and not in a good way. For those 2 sandwiches and a small drink, we paid $25 and were hungry again in an hour. I understand we're in vegas, but that was soo not worth it. I can't figure out why this place has so many positive reviews."}
{"text":"Cute little caffe hidden after all the casinos in Fremont street. Friendly atmosphere and service. We got the Greek salad and gyro meat it was delicious and the price was reasonable."}
{"text":"This is Mediterranean fast food.

If you're anything like me, you eventually get a sick gut and stomach thanks to greasy food over and over again. Fremont can make the gut rot happen to just about anyone!

This place is a cheap, simple and straight forward spot to get a wrap with some nice veggies. 

A good find in the ocean of chili dogs and burgers!"}
{"text":"Food is okay. They give very little meat for the price. Not very flavorful , I wouldn't buy for the price again .... not worth it. Shouldn't have ignored the reviews"}
{"text":"I got a gyro and the  dolmas they were cold when I got them like out of the refrigerator cold  the dolmas I have had in the past were always hard because they are ground beef and rice as these were described on the menu there was no ground beef just rice and they were ice cold when I called to ask if that's how they serve them I was told yes that's how we serve them and the french fries were also soggy and the gyro was very mediocre"}
{"text":"I had only an hour before I had to leave for the airport and all the fried food, secondhand smoke, and noise of Las Vegas had gotten to me. I needed an oasis. That's where Fremont Mediterranean came to my rescue. 

It is so calm and peaceful in here, that my rushed feelings of getting to the airport and back to reality vanished while here and I stayed close to a quarter hour longer than I had intended. Of course that was also because of the food.

Finally, I had found some fresh, healthy food full of vegetables!. I was so excited to see a beet salad on the menu. Their's is with golden beets, sliced toasted almonds and fresh goat cheese, with a wonderful vinaigrette over lettuce. YUM! I had to have the baba ganoush too, which is served with warn pita. I couldn't eat all of either one of them because of the generous portions though the salad I ordered was the small size and the baba was an appetizer.  My friend had a wonderful fatoush salad and dubbed it the best she had ever had. It had lots of fresh greens, and fried pieces of pita. 

The staff here are so helpful and friendly. You can tell they are passionate about the food. The cashier exclaimed,\"yum!\" when I ordered the baba, and the guy who took our cleaned plates was so happy my friend loved the fatoush.

Definitely stop in here for some great, fresh food and a relaxing atmosphere, if you are on Fremont Street."}
{"text":"Food was really eh. The falafel wrap had this weird fibrous substance in it that wasn't edible, had to be spat out, similar to the stuff at the base of artichoke leaves."}
{"text":"Small platters. I tried Shawerma isn't delicious. That doesn't represent Mediterranean food."}
{"text":"Decent Mediterranean dining in the Downton area. It is located in the Fremont street experience. The space is somewhat small and can get a bit crowded during lunch time. 

Came here for lunch today and ordered the chicken gyro that came with fries. The meal was almost $10.00. I received a 10% discount because I work for one of the downtown properties. It was tasty and the fries were plenty! It definitely made me full. I thought it was a bit on the pricey side but I was still satisfied. I wish they offered shrimp or salmon gyro though. Because they don't i think I prefer Crazy Pita for my Mediterranean fix (it is also much closer to my house).

However if you are in the area and are looking for this type of meal, I definitely recommend giving them a try!"}
{"text":"Ended up here at the end of the night and without any grace devoured some awesome gyro nachos!"}
{"text":"My cousins and I were really hungry while strolling old Vegas and found this place on yelp. There seemed to be a lot of good reviews and the star rating was pretty decent! But when we got our food I was a bit disappointed. We ordered the tzatziki for appetizer (it was okay), lamb kabob (comes with either couscous or rice), and chicken chipotle wrap. Mediterranean restaurants should have good lamb right? But our lamb kabob was a bit dry. It comes with two kabob sticks which I shared one with one of my girl cousins and we were both still able to get full off of it. I tried a bite of the chicken chipotle wrap too and it wasn't too bad... But still not good enough for my cousin to to-go the second half after he finished the first half (the wrap is pretty big and comes in halves). Overall I've had better Mediterranean food elsewhere."}
{"text":"Had lunch here while visiting Las Vegas, fabulous food, great price and warm atmosphere.  Highly recommend this restaurant!!!!"}
{"text":"Food was good!!! I especially liked the supreme gyro it was packed with flavor! I also tried the chicken kabob plate, rice was a bit too hard for my taste and the hummus had way to much garlic"}
{"text":"Tasty Greek food in the heart of Fremont.  The gyro meat was very moist and flavorful.  My friend enjoyed his Greek salad.  I was pretty impressed with the extensive menu.  The spinach pie and grape leaves looked good.  The lady behind the counter was friendly and quick.  1 gyro, 1 Greek salad and 2 bottled waters came to $22.  Portions weren't overly large for the price but it's located in a tourist part of town so nothing is going to be cheap.  The food was great so I'd definitely go back."}
{"text":"Over priced. Don't get much either. Ordered a chicken shawarma wrap and had to hunt through all the 'filler' veggies to find, at most, 1/4 chicken breast. The hummus appetizer was real good though and their gyros are okay if you're in a bind. Not too bad overall, but it will be some time before I come back."}
{"text":"The food is okay, but the service sucks.
Cute interior, massive menu. Opted for a gyro, just under $10 but I like that you can add on fries for just a dollar more. Salads also looked good, and they have a spanakopita special for $9.99. Ordered to go, waited at bar.

My entire visit, I was listening to two female employees shout in Spanish, fighting with the cook, who was out of sight. Awkward and super unprofessional. Order was tossed on the counter without a word, employee turned back around to shout some more.

Gyro was okay, nothing spectacular. Good size, tasty tzatziki, entirely too much onion. Doubt I'll be back."}
{"text":"This place is a culinary oasis of Fremont St. Whether getting a wrap, sub or kabob. The bread is fresh and crispy on the outside , & soft on the inside. Beats paying for expensive room service for hotel food that isnt half as good as FMC.  Plus, they will deliver to your hotel, too.  Friendly, cool staff.  You can eat here once a day everyday you are downtown getting down!"}
{"text":"I asked, um, Amellie, I think she said her name was, what comes with the Tzadziki appetizer, and she proceeded to tell me what Tzadziki WAS, not WHAT COMES WITH, as I asked. So I said \"for $6 you only get sauce?\", and she says bak, \"No, it comes with pita.\"  Shaking my head. I mean God forbid this idiot actually listens to the questions asked.  This is the new state of affairs of the world.

There was another genius standing next to her, who answered my question too, which is so fascinating that when TWENTY FREAKING MINUTES LATER, genius #2 handed me my food...without the Pita bread.  These two couldn't come up with 5 IQ points between the two of them.

Just before getting my food I got up to ask for my money back because I had zero faith the food would be good and I was refused a refund. No manager or owner is on site so genius #1 calls the owner who said I could not have a refund as he didn't want to \"waste food\".  

But it's ok to have terrible customer service."}
{"text":"Good food!  We've had delivery from Cous Cous a few times at our office and it's always great.   The hummus isn't amazing but everything else is perfect. The Dolmas (stuffed grape leaves) are my favorite! !

Plus,  the delivery is fast and the food is still pretty fresh/hot when it arrives."}
{"text":"I've been here plenty and can say that i have never been disappointed by the food (besides the poutine which I am just not a fan of in general) best things to order are hands down the philly cheese steak , turkey avocado sub , gyro and the turkey wrap. They are delicious!"}
{"text":"We came here expecting to have a Great Mediterranean meal, but they don't have some many options. You can not have rice and salad in the same plate what makes not sense in the Mediterranean culture. 
The most of the dishes in the Mediterranean culture comes with rice, salad and meat. 
The cashier told us that we the only way was add a salad for $9.99 are you kidding me? They don't have sides either. We paid $2 extra dollars for tzatziki sauce WTF??? The rice wasn't cook enough and we wait at least 30 minutes to get our food! NEVER AGAIN"}
{"text":"While taking a break from the heat and almost endless walking, Freemont Mediterranean Cafe was a great place to have a nice cold drink and chit chat with my friends."}
{"text":"Accidental find on recent trip to downtown Vegas! Wonderful meal for all four of us. Wraps, salads and sauces perfect! Gyro platter and bowl was wonderful! Have never had more tasty grape leaves. Would highly recommend  this restaurant if you find yourself hungry on Fremont st!"}
{"text":"This place is delicious. Food is fresh, service is great, and there's good beer on tap. It doesn't feel very Vegas-y, so it's a nice, simple little break from all the attractions. It's very vegetarian-friendly and my friends said the meat was yummy as well. I will definitely go back the next time I'm in Vegas."}
{"text":"Got the chicken chipotle wrap in a spinach wrap with a side of onion rings and it was delicious! Inside is small and cozy, perfect for couples or friends needing something quick to eat at super good prices! The onion rings were hot and fresh and wrap had delicious combo of flavors!"}
{"text":"Meh. There's much better dining in downtown Vegas and on Fremont St. than here. It's a fast-casual spot with ho-hum food and little to no ambiance. And the tables and floor were not exactly clean. And staff were less than friendly. It's primarily filled with tourists, especially those with small children (at least when I went). The food is edible, but not really worth it. And definitely don't get the poutine fries. They were the saddest poutine fries I've ever encountered."}
{"text":"Wow. what a great little place. In the midst of greasy burgers and cheap hotdogs, it was refreshing to find delicious good on the cheap. I ordered the chicken kabobs with rice, pita, and hummus on the side. The chicken was perfectly seasoned and the pita warm and satisfying. The portions were large. My husband ordered a burger and fries. Both were also delicious. The staff were very friendly, refilled our glasses, brought what we needed out to our table. Great late night meal in a cozy corner. We will be back."}
{"text":"Cous Cous Mediterranean Cafe is awesome. I'm glad that we are getting more diverse food options in the heart of downtown. I had the gyro bowl and it was excellent."}
{"text":"Joshua was amazing..and the food where do I start I haven't ate at a better place in Vegas.  From the atmosphere to the food to the server it was the best experience I have ever had.... Joshua is absolutely a great person to have working in your establishment. ..even with the craziest people...his patience and service was outstanding! !!"}
{"text":"My family and I decided to eat some gyros and decided on this place. We are glad we did, it's right across from the Fremont parking, so super quick walk. I've never had gyros before and this was my first time, glad we went here! We were not disappointed! (My son enjoyed the fries and my spouse and I enjoyed the gyros! Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Very dry and undercooked! 

Came here on Sunday midday just before July 4th with my bf and his friend. My initial choice was going to try out the Heart Attack Grill (quite a infamous restaurant for healthwise) but the guys wanted to try out this Mediterranean cafe, which was literally next door.

The ambiance was pretty cosy, liked  the decorations around the restaurant. The menu was displayed upon entering the restaurant which was pretty good to see what you wanted.

I ordered the lamb shawarma my bf ordered the chicken shawarma and his friend ordered the chicken kabob. The waitress was kind and sweet, took our orders without a problem... then the problems came. We waited more than half n hour  for the chicken kabob, and another 15 minutes for the two shawarma's. 

At start the friend says the kabob was good until he found an uncooked chicken. He later says that the parts that were cooked was over cooked and dry. The flavour was blah and it was bloody expensive for a chicken kabob. 

My bf's chicken shawarma was horrible. The flavour was blah, the marinated chicken didn't contain flavour. The lettuce were black and un-fresh (even when they say \"always fresh\") the wrap was hard and cold. Even the Tahini sauce could not saved it. 

They both left there dishes uneaten. They both walked out dissatisfied and disappointed.

On the other hand my lamb shawarma was equally the same as the chicken shawarma but instead of leaving it uneaten I decided to at least finished it all before walking out and never coming back to this restaurant. 

Overall the restaurant was expensive, the waiting order was long, and the food isn't as great as what others say. 

But hey if you want to try it, Goodluck and \"enjoy\"!"}
{"text":"Probably healthiest and tastiest food on Fremont street. Had the lamb shawarma and greek salad. Very tasty and healthy. Service from Princess and Thalia was top notch. Will return"}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this place while tooling around the Freemont Experience. Good stumble! 

I only had a salad with golden beets and feta on it, but it was delish with that orange vinaigrette on it, yumm!

I wish I had more time to come back here, but def will in the future! The owner's son was SO nice...and cute!"}
{"text":"Wow, this is our second time eating here and it was every bit as good as the first. Food is so good, service is so so friendly and professional. Definitely a staple any time we're on Fremont. 

I had the classic burger, Katie had the falafel wrap. I might have finished hers."}
{"text":"After sharing a burger at the heart attack hell next door, we needed something healthy and refreshing to eat. We had the tabbouleh and Gyro and some falafel. All was delicious and the owner was so nice and helpful. Prices are VERY fair for Vegas too."}
{"text":"This is far from Mediterranean food. I ordered gyro platter which came with a great about of gyro meat, but the rice is not what you'd expect at all from a Mediterranean restaurant. It was plain yellow rice, not basmati. The vegetables was also a disappointing surprise as I was not expecting zucchini and broccoli with pizza sauce (tomato sauce). Being a local, I thought I'd have a nice gyro spot to go to daily but this experience let me know I was sure mistaken."}
{"text":"The food is absolutely delicious. We love it. However, costumer service needs improvement. The girl was bitter"}
{"text":"Not bad, especially when we had no idea what we'd find on Fremont St. Go in, order at the counter, wait for your number, clear your own table and get the secret code to be allowed access to the bathroom. Nothing fancy, but it satisfied the whole group of birthday parties--6 of us could all agree on this one place. Nice selection of regular standbys for Mediterranean/Greek fare. I got to try a lot from the others. No complaints from anyone! The price was right and everyone left fortified for the festivities."}
{"text":"This is a great Mediterranean cafe in the Fremont Street area.  Lots of good staples on the menu such as shawarmas, wraps, kabobs, salads, gryos, pita & hummus, even poutine!  The owner is from Canada.  Our group had a wide variety of items and everyone was very satisfied.  They have veggie options for those who are vegetarian.  The pitas were warm, everything was done well with friendly service.  The pricing as also welcome change from the gouging prices that you see along the strip - the prices were all normal and under $10 per item!"}
{"text":"Cute little place on fremont street, we just kinda stumbled upon it walking down fremont street, right under the giant zipline slot machine... gyros were AMAZING, good service and they had a 2 for 1 beer special that night which was nice esp on fremont!"}
{"text":"The food was tasty and filling! Group ordered the Vegetarian wrap, fish and chips and falafel pita. Compliments to the chef! 

However, the establishment was kinda dirty, granted it is on Fremont Street. The bathroom was full of trash and looked and smelled like it had not been cleaned in days. The tables outside were not bused the entire time we were there.

In addition, there was a long wait time to both order and receive food. For Mediterranean food, it took a while. It also seemed as though the cashier/waitress was tired."}
{"text":"It's actually a three-star for food, but negative two stars for the customer service.  

First, the food--it was okay.  Nothing special.  My girlfriend and I each had the chicken shawarma plate--hers with couscus, mine with salad.  The salad option, by the way, cost an additional dollar.  Whatever.

The service was HORRENDOUS.  First, the girl spilled my friend's dish and didn't clean it up/bring out another napkin/or apologize.  Second, any extra anything costs a dollar.  (I despise being nickled and dimed to death--especially when I'm getting charged eleven dollars for some lettuce and chicken).  But third, and most annoying of all, I DIDN'T ORDER CHICKEN.  I ordered the gyros plate.  When I went in to let the lady know I'd gotten the wrong dish, she advised, \"No, you ordered the chicken.\"  Well, no, I actually know what I ordered, thanks.  There was no offer to fix it.  Nothing.  She advised me that for another three dollars, she'd make me what I ordered (say what, now?!).  I politely declined.  She said, \"Is that ok?\"  No, ma'am, it is absolutely not ok.

And I won't come back.  Kabob Korner it is.  Cheaper and friendlier for the same mediocre grub."}
{"text":"Fantastic gyros one of the best I've ever eaten. The service is fantastic so friendly and so accommodating they really care alot"}
{"text":"I ordered a Mediterranean bowl with gyro meat and I must say it was high up there. It contained perfectly tender meat and lightly grilled veggies that were all infused with a delightful oil based sauce. I also had the pleasure of trying their cous cous, which while nothing extraordinary, also left nothing lacking."}
{"text":"We stopped for something different, had the sampler platter and a gyro. Both were great, we were surprised, everyone was very kind. Not a suite and tie place but a come as you are and get really good food."}
{"text":"Excellent food at a very good price. The owner was very polite and friendly along with his staff. Not the usual high price Las Vegas items."}
{"text":"Just had my first meal here, and my 4 stars are based only on the Greek salad and the chicken kebab. The Greek salad was excellent - the feta was superb quality and even the tomatoes were great! The chicken in the kebab was cooked to perfection with a crisp exterior. I was given the choice of couscous or rice and chose the former which had hearty grains and was very tasty. The pita was fresh and not greasy. I'll definitely be back or just have it delivered. So glad to have another good place to eat downtown!"}
{"text":"Nasty food, worst customer service, just a waist of money. I ordered veggie with rice and it's the worst veggie rice I have ever had. My husband ordered a beef kibabab and it was under cooked, so he doing ear it either. We tired to talk to the lady at the counter, but she was not interested in hearing negative reviews. It's a shame."}
{"text":"It was just ok. Sweet potato fries were not as fresh and crisp. The lamb gyro was tasty but nothing I would rave about. Waiting super long, like 30 mins for my food. They weren't busy."}
{"text":"I like to order the Greek salad with grilled chicken.  I get extra dressing.  Its always good.  The chicken is very good, they give you lots of olives.  They dont skimp its huge very tasty."}
{"text":"Great food and great value. If you're hungry and want something healthy and cheap, go here. I had the chicken shawarma and it was delicious."}
{"text":"this place looked good and the reviews were good ....our meal was horrible ...lamb kebobs tough and flavorless the golden beet salad had no goat cheese ,,it was a babybell type of cheese ...very very disappointing"}
{"text":"I've only had their gyro sandwich but it really was great. Since we have no real Döner Kebab in this country Couscous is the closest you can come to this kind of meat. It can't replace it, of course, but if you crave Döner come here. I k ow is not the same but it tastes very similar here which is nice. Their staff is very friendly, too. I suggest you give this a try and see for yourself :)"}
{"text":"After a disappointing experience at Kebab Korner down the street the day before we decided to give Fremont Mediterranean a try. It was so much better! For well under $20 I got the veggie wrap, my husband had the falafel sandwich and we shared a HUGE Greek salad (one of the best I've ever had and they do not skimp on the feta!). The service, atmosphere and food was excellent. I totally recommend this place as a break from the usual greasy junk on Fremont Street."}
{"text":"Great choice on the Fremont Experience strip for  casual healthy fare with wine or beer.  My wife had the appetizer sampler plate, good baba ganoush and hummus.  The falafel was different with alfalfa sprouts.   I had the chicken shawarma plate and the chicken was perfectly cooked, delicious rice with veggies and hummus.  Busy but staff hustled and friendly."}
{"text":"Wandered in late night to get take out and the staff greated me warmly. 

Ordered a gyro and it took under ten minutes and was piping hot and just the way I ordered it! 

Staff attended to dine in patrons graciously also.

I will definitely return and recommend this to everyone!"}
{"text":"First of all, they say they deliver, but when you call, the delivery person is never there.  If you work downtown, and only have one hour, definitely not the place to go for lunch.  The food is far from tasty nor appealing.  They do not get your order right, and the price is high compared to other places on Fremont Street.  I would not suggest this."}
{"text":"Stopped in while enjoying the Fremont Street Experience - sadly our service , meal and cleanliness of the place was disappointing and we made the mistake of not checking other reviews before we waited 15+mins in line to order . I had the gyros plate and my husband ordered the lamb tacos and an order of fries. Food came out fast and was served by a friendly gentleman. However tables were dirty and the ladies bathroom was filthy. Meat on the gyro plate was dry as if it was left over from earlier in the day and cold Menu says Gyro plate comes with salad and humus - for 11.99 I was expecting more than an ounce ( really) of salad and no hummus was served . My husband said his lamb tacos were okay but the fries were old and cold. Hate to give bad reviews but I would not go back and would hate to see others waste time and money here ."}
{"text":"Went here at the suggestion of a co-worker. Hadn't been there in a while and was craving a gyro. The place was pretty empty, food was just ok, the gyro didn't automatically come with fries ($2 extra) and on top of that, they charged me $.50 for taking the food to-go. I'd rather pay a bit extra for the entire meal than be charged extra for every little thing. Won't be recommending this place anytime soon."}
{"text":"My husband I land I ended up here looking for a quick bite to eat before he comedy show at inspire.  First off unfortunately it was an oven in the place. We were looking to enjoy food in a cool environment but instead it felt hotter inside than it did outside.  Secondly for $20+ for two gyros I expected more. They were a decent size came to our table warm but for me something was lacking. Definitely edible but average.  Not over the top. I felt like I needed more sauce. My husband enjoyed it slightly more than me. Overall it didn't distinguish itself from any other Mediterranean place here in Vegas.  If you are in a pinch for a quicker place for food it might work for you but if you have a choice pass on it you won't be missing anything."}
{"text":"Great food. Friendly staff. I was on a 2 week business trip to Las Vegas. This became my favorite place to eat in downtown Las Vegas. By the 3rd visit they recognized me and knew my order. Very impressive."}
{"text":"Great meal and open late. 
Much better meal than the Heart attack cafe.
The meat was tender and delicious."}
{"text":"Great place to get a last minute bite before heading downtown. I usually get a lamb gyro or shawrma and they are both delicious! If i remember correctly you can add a order of fries for an extra dollar and change. Totally great deal especially because your food will be gone so quick.
A little bit on the expensive side but the food is made well and the lamb is juicy."}
{"text":"Terrible service!  I couldn't even get what I PAID for, how about that? The lady who works the counter talks to people and looks at them as if they're disturbing her at her home's front door. This place is awful!"}
{"text":"While visiting Vegas 4 years ago, my mom and I stumbled upon this Mediterranean restaurant while walking Fremont street. Tasted THE BEST lamb gyro we had ever had. Four years later visiting Vegas again and it is STILL the best. Mom and I are already talking about our next Vegas and Cous Cous trip. If you want something fresh and different, also more reasonably priced than other restaurants in the area, then you need to at least stop here for lunch!"}
{"text":"Had the Lamb Pita Pocket. And would like to say that was delicious. The flavors of the lamb to the dressing all blended really well. Joshua was our server and was very friendly. While having to deal with rowdy customers and a rush of people all coming in at the same time. He kept his cool and still added joy to the atmosphere."}
{"text":"First I have to say the girl that is at the counter hates her life....she hates her job and she clearly didn't want to be there. Not friendly at all, and spoke to me like I was suppose to know that the old menu is on the wall and they are to lazy to correct it.

I ordered a salad to go and they charged me .50 just to take it to go...paid 13 for a salad to go....not that special at all either. N vet going back there again and I would have been a regular since I work in walking distance....should be nice to your locals. Jerks"}
{"text":"Their pesto turkey burger is probably their worst item in the menu if I had to guess. It called to me as something that couldn't miss but the turkey paddy was obviously frozen and not house made, and the trimmings we're just regular with basically tasteless fries. They reminded me of in and out fries that you need ketchup with. The staff was just ok to. I suppose Since I was at a Greek restaurant this was not the best thing to get but at the same time, this was just not worth $10."}
{"text":"The food here is okay, I had the lamb kabob and a beet salad.  There are definitely better options around.  I won't be taking the opportunity to find out if other menu items are better as I will not return to this restaurant.  Typical Las Vegas 'service', I ordered my meal to-go, when I got home and opened the bag one of the items I ordered was missing, I called and let them know and they assured me I was wrong and that I should come back and prove to them that it was missing.  No apology and no concern about losing my patronage.  Seems odd to me as there is another Mediterranean place right across the street!  Not a big shock that there were only two other guests in the place."}
{"text":"REALLY great service and great food! A great little place to grab food downtown. It's easy to miss as it's tucked next to the Heart Attack Grill next to the stairs. Had a gyro and the dolmades. Good stuff!!! They've got a nice outdoor patio too, for the days when sitting outside is tolerable."}
{"text":"I went there with my girlfriend for a late lunch. It was pretty dead, but still a nice cozy place. 

We got a beef gyro with fries, a lamb burger, and two Sam Adams beers. Total cost was $29.  A little more than I expected, but the food was solid and we were hungry. Well worth it. 

The wrap for the gyro was absolutely delicious and soaked up all the oil and juices. The fries were thin cut crispy with soft insides; my favorite kind of fries!

My girlfriend had the lamb burger with a greek salad. I don't usually like lamb meat because I find the meat too pungent and gamey (people who have had fresh venison or elk will understand what I mean), but this lamb was INCREDIBLE. The best lamb burger I have ever had. 

They have a little gelatto ice cream station that I really want to try out. Definitely check this place out if you're in the Fremont area."}
{"text":"We decided to go to Freemont St. after watching a show. We walked and showed our boys around Freemont st. We were starving by the time we got there and we were planning to eat elsewhere but since we've had a long day we saw this place and decided to get food here to-go. 
We got the beef shawarma platter with couscous, grilled veggies, hummus and pita. Omg, it was delicious! The beef had a great marinade, the couscous was cooked perfectly, the hummus was very tasty. I'm so glad we stumbled upon this place."}
{"text":"They stop serving food early before closing time. I wouldn't recommend coming to a place where they are more concerned with getting off work early than taking care of their customers"}
{"text":"In a town like Vegas you wouldn't think that there would be a problem getting eats downtown 24/7, however I ran into this predicament on Sunday. Le Thai, Chicago Joe's, Rachael's and Eat., among others, were all closed. Casino restaurant takeout seemed odd, so I checked ye ole Yelp app for options and up came Freemont Mediterranean Cafe.  

After ordering over the phone, I checked on the exact location and started on a trail of \"Oh sh*t\" statements....
\"Oh sh*t, it's IN the FSE\" 
\"Oh sh*t, wtf is the Neonopolis?!\"
\"Oh sh*t, I can't find it. Where is this place and why is the middle of Neonopolis a dead zone where no one can hear you scream?\"
\"Found it! Oh sh*t, why is it empty?\"
\"Oh sh*t, how is my order $28?\"

OK, enough with the cussing. The order was ready when I arrived (20 min after I called) and the staff was friendly. I rocked a chicken shawarma pita pocket and a large greek salad with gyro meat. The shawarma was solid: tender pieces of chicken in a not-to-thick tahini sauce and veggies in a pita. I crushed it in maaaaybe 4 minutes. The problem? It was $9. Ouch. $5 should be the price tag on this bad boy. Even the famous Mamoun's in NYC only charges $6. At $14, the salad was a bit much as well. The gyro meat was decent and plentiful, but the rest was an average greek salad. In my book, this meal wasn't worth the dough."}
{"text":"Awesome awesome awesome! Awesome gyros awesome wraps awesome hummus awesome kabobs. Tasty food that's quick and super reasonably priced. People who think it's expensive are nuts. You'll pay more for food in any restaurant in the area. 

My dad is gluten free and wanted to eat here for dinner and lunch everyday and we 
almost did. Service is also usually great."}
{"text":"Yummy. Loved the lamb/beef gyros so so so delicious. If you've never tried it I highly recommend!!!
The cashier/hostess/waitress was such a nice lady."}
{"text":"Came to Vegas for my Birf'day and whilst walking around after having a few cocktails and feeling a bit hungry, my friend and I came across this place and decided to try it out. The food was horribly......delicious! OMG, this was some bomb food. The pieces of meat on the kabobs were ginormous! I got one chicken and one steak and both were flavored very well and were juicy. Came with pita bread slices and also some couscous which was really tasty and plentiful. We both liked our food so much we came back the next day. I got the chicken wings and fries special. I asked and he said about 5-6 wings came with the order.....pretty sure there was 8. Pretty decent amount of food for $6.95. And besides the food being really good, the woman that runs the place, didn't catch her name, but skinny with a pixie hair cut and a tattoo going down her back, was very nice, very friendly and loved to engage all of her customers in some banter. When we left the first night I told her, \"I'd come back again for the food because it was great, but your personality is what seals the deal!\" Better than any chain Greek place....sorry Daphne's! If I lived in Vegas, I'd be a regular."}
{"text":"I was there March 4 and 5, 2018 and the food was freaking AMAZING!! I had a Lamb Greek salad both days. I actually ate here for my birthday and it was well worth it.  My friend enjoyed her food as well.  I cannot wait to come back just so I can eat here again.  I'm not sure if the young lady's name but she even gave me a free birthday drink!! I'll see you again!"}
{"text":"Low quality food. Awful service. If you order a side or salad here, you get it once you are done with your food!"}
{"text":"Red wine and Dolmades were a refreshing treat. My friend ordered the lamb burger and enjoyed every bite of it. The cafe space is small and there's a patio to people watch on fremont. The TV screens on top of their menu board showed the actual pictures of the food items on a loop. The movie The Heat was showing and the TV beside that played a reality show of this guy eating bath salts and going to jail."}
{"text":"Hidden gem. The food and spanakopita and poutine. So good.   Owner is awesome. So friendly and always trying to be helpful.   Everything here is fabulous."}
{"text":"Had the shawarma kabob plate. It wasn't juicy broiled kabab, it was like dry flavorless fajitas. The veggies on the side were over cooked and mushy. I guess people who like this place don't really know how Mediterranean food is supposed to taste. Although the prices are reasonable, don't waste your money."}
{"text":"I've recently went to Cous Cous after I got off work from a playoffs game for the golden knights, hungry and eager to find something to open do to being after 1230pm, I walked in with the smile and very excited to eat. The server/waitress was extremely rude and short with me after I waited a half hour for my food it came out cold, old at sight and taste & it was not presentable at all. I made my order to go so I didn't notice this till I got back in my car two blocks away. The service was so bad I told myself to forget about it because I didn't want to go back inside & have to deal with the service again. But the food was so disgusting & gross that I paid $25 for, I walked two blocks back to the restaurant to get my money back. As the waitress/cashier was closing down her drawer she told me (OH that's too bad)she says  You have to come back tomorrow to get your refund sorry. I must say it was a total waste of time and I do NOT recommend eating at this place ever in the future if they're still in business DON'T GO..!!"}
{"text":"Had lunch here on 5/30/16 around 1pm and it was great! I had a chicken bowl, the chicken was juicy and the rice was perfect. I also had some pita and hummus, the hummus was smooth and had a great flavor.  Great spot if you are tired of buffets and or other greasy food in Vegas."}
{"text":"I really loved this place when it opened and was happy to have a high quality sandwich and med place across the street. Unfortunately since originating management has left the place has rapidly gone down hill. My sandwiches are now about 1/2 the meat and less attention to quality as before and the prices have gone up. I sure they will make up in the transient crowds but its sad to see them squeeze every buck versus having consistency and quality. I just paid $7+ for a sandwich that should have cost about $4.50. I wish them luck,  they lost a local."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this nice lito place walking down Fremont. It was late nothing else is open and we were hungry saw it said midi terrain so I figured I couldn't go wrong with a gyro. I ordered a supreme with feta and it was in my top 5 it was really that good. The meat was moist and very flavorful the cucumber  yogurt sauce wich I can't spell was amazing. I had read somewhere that the service was slow well it's not it was actually great the girl there I'm sure she deals with alot of bs because of location and people there but I was respectful and polite about my burnt onion rings and she responded accordingly. Try the gyros they're well served."}
{"text":"Grabbed take out from here the other day and I was very impressed. Small place. Quite clean for the location it's in. It's kind of hidden to the side but one you find it your good. The menu has a lot to choose from. I find there aren't too many Mediterranean options around here.

I spent about $15 on two items for lunch and I was very happy. I got the Lamb Gyro. Very flavorful and not messy to eat. The lamb was cooked perfectly. I don't understand why the lamb is mixed with ground beef. I don't like beef and couldn't take it out. Some people just like lamb so having it prepped without beef would be great.

For an appetizer I had the Tzatziki  yogurt with extra pita bread. Very light and full of flavor. Great as an app or a light lunch. Even good to eat the next day for left overs.

The girl who took my order got the job done. Wouldn't say she was OVERLY friendly but could have smiled more or made a few recommendations when I said I never came here before. All and all I would come back. Maybe for sit down next time and see how that goes!!"}
{"text":"I'm writing this as I wait.. It's been a while now and I don't think I'm going to make it . Soo hungry. Wait here it is .. Vegetarian wrap, it is lettuce and maybe a pepper dripping wet with sauce . The wrap is loose and I cant keep the wrap together as I try and bite in. It's a mess. Not worth the $12.50 for the soggy fries and wait. 2 stars because I've been here before and the falafel was okay."}
{"text":"SUPERB! Caprese is out of this world and we had 2 sandwiches the size of a whale. Only draw back was the bread was a bit tough. This is not normal bread tho but the sandwiches had TONS of meat on them. Try this small place. It sure beats anything else on Freemont."}
{"text":"So tasty, reasonably priced, cozy and clean inside and such friendly and courteous staff. What a treasure! I just got a gyro plate tonight, but I'll be back to try more of the menu for certain!"}
{"text":"I love this place, the food is really good, tasty and the ingredients seem to always be fresh! The staff is friendly and it's also very clean in there. I order a few times per month since I work downtown and they always have my food ready on time. T"}
{"text":"Wonderful food !! And a clean restaurant. I loved the chicken kabob with fries. I will definitely come back here. Very friendly staff"}
{"text":"If you love Mediterranean  then you'll love this Freemont street eatery. I had the Greek spinach wrap and replaced the chicken with lamb, it was delicious."}
{"text":"Well if you are expecting good fresh quality food. DONT COME HERE the food is microwaved and cold in the middle. Veggie burger literally melts in your hand too ew. They dont care about cooking quality or service be warned."}
{"text":"So excited to try Falafel for the first time here! This restaurant was great! Friendly service, no wait or line on a Friday night and right next to The Old Strip! Food was also delicious!"}
{"text":"Great little spot to grab a bite. This was my second time. 
I had the lamb pita pocket something or other on my first trip and it was good. On my second trip I had the veggie bowl, add lamb. The sign is a little misleading as it says that the bowls are $5.99 ( I think) and you have your choice of veggie, chicken or etc. However, at the register she is very clear about asking if you would like to add Lamb or chicken for a charge. I did and I'm glad that I did. It was really good and worth the $9 or $10. It is a quick and easy healthy option for downtown. 

Also, the staff is great. I really liked the girl behind the counter, and not just becuase she said my name reminded her of a movie star. She's cute, friendly, confident and seems like she doesn't take any crap. She's got a great sense of humor and I had a good time while I was there. 

At first I thought the only alcohol they served were these little togo wine glasses. They seem cute but I wasn't in a wine mood. I guess I never looked up, becuase they clearly have all the beers lined up on the top shelf. Anyway thank goodness for that because it was well past beer thirty when we got there. 

Pro tip: Bathrooms are for customers only, so you need a code to get in. 

Also, you can call ahead for your order if you are in a hurry."}
{"text":"Maybe I should've ordered more 'native' food here but I was craving for a burger and the thought of a lamb burger made my slightly buzzed stomach growl.  While the meat itself was decent, the bun was pretty bad.  Think burger king bun.  Also the fries that came with it were quite soggy.  

So what can I say? I expected more from a $10 lamb burger.

I'll give them the benefit of the doubt because I DID order a burger at a Mediterranean place, even though the servers and cooks spoke to each other in Spanish. Maybe their Mediterranean dishes are better ...

2.5 stars rounded up to 3."}
{"text":"This place has such good gyros!! Such a great find. We were here on New Years and tried their special which was amazing. The service is also friendly and knows a lot about local attractions. Will definitely come again."}
{"text":"Fresh, tasty food, reasonable prices, and friendly service: great little cafe!

The Fremont Mediterranean Cafe, located towards the end of the pedestrian-only part of Fremont Street near the Neonopolis Mall, was a welcome discovery during my recent visit to the city.  In fact, I would probably say that it was my all-around best dining experience in Vegas.

Towards the end of a long day walking, drinking, and gambling my way through downtown Las Vegas, I required sustenance-- and preferably something somewhat healthy, quick, and affordable.  Luckily I happened to stumble upon this place which fit the bill perfectly (and in stark contrast to the Heart Attack Grill, which is just a couple of doors down).  

The falafel sandwich I ordered here was huge, delicious, and a great value at $6.  A mistake at the counter resulted in my sandwich being given to another customer, but the waitress was very apologetic and treated me to a free baklava for the additional wait.  Good stuff!  And really, having window seat facing out on Fremont Street was entertaining enough that I hardly noticed the time pass anyway :)"}
{"text":"Stopped at this quaint place after strolling down Freemont st.  What a great surprise! The service was amazing and friendly. Their recommendations were right on. My daughter loved the lentil soup. The rest of us shared an avocado and chicken panini, flavorful and crispy, a Spanakopita with a Greek salad and Falafel. .. everything was delicious and the price was just right.  Definately will recommend to friends and come back next time in Vegas!"}
{"text":"I made a quick late night pit stop to Cous Cous Cafe during a recent trip to Vegas.  It is located right in the middle of the Fremont Street Experience so you can't beat the location.  There are a lot of late night options in this area but everything feels like your average pizza stand.  Cous Cous was a nice break in the normal pace with a clean and inviting ambiance, which is highly appreciated late at night in Vegas.  

The menu is typical Mediterranean and is extensive.  It's a little pricey for this area of downtown Vegas.  Most of its neighbors are offering $2 tacos but Cous Cous is holding strong to a gyro for $8.95.  I'd love to stay that you get what you pay for, but it's only A-Ok.  The food didn't seem like anything more than fast food pitas.  Whatever they lack in deliciousness, they make up for in fun, personable service!"}
{"text":"Some of the best fresh hummus Ive had.   Great location!   I like to walk to a nearby foot massage afterwards.     Very Very Cool Decorations!"}
{"text":"The \"EEEK!\" level rating is because I found a hair curled up inside my falafel. Euuughh.

The prices here are insanely high, especially compared to Kabob Korner across the street. My husband actually only went here to get food because the guy at Kabob Korner was too busy to take our order. Not, \"We're really busy, so the food will be ready in an hour\" but \"Come back to actually place your order in a half hour.\" I have to love the questionable business decisions of Fremont East restaurant owners (see also Le Thai). But I digress.

The hummus was good although I do not think it was accompanied by a sufficient quantity of pita. The falafel were kind of soggy and questionable even before I got to the horrifying hair lurking within. And everything is overpriced. Skip this place."}
{"text":"The Mediterranean Cafe was wonderful!  Good, light but filling, with veggies!!  Much better than the greasy buffet we had been to during our recent visit!  I will be back!  Staff was very friendly and willing to visit."}
{"text":"First of all, very nice and very attentive staff for a small eatery. Food is very good, particularly the toasted cous cous. Prices are reasonable, which is hard to find in Vegas. It's tucked right next to The Heart Attack Grill, so it could be missed. If you're a fan of Mediterranean, you won't be disappointed here. Portions are good, not too much, not too little. Free refills on drinks too!"}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Clean restaurant and nice decor, friendly staff and great food! If you want a healthy alternative downtown this is the place!! Ironically it is next door to the Heart Attack Grill, so make the easy choice and head here instead!"}
{"text":"Poutine like fries for the win! The dude has the pastrami sandwich and was thoroughly impressed. I'm Canadian and love Poutine but am newly convinced you only get the real deal in Quebec. They had vinegar for the fries as well.

I wanted to head back for a round 2 but, it's vegas and we never found ourselves back there."}
{"text":"Cute place in the midst of Fremont street.  They have a small outside and inside eating area.  There were four of us and we all had different dishes.  Tried the hummus, baba ganush, gyro plate, lamb kabob and homemade fries.  All of it was delicious.  No complaints from any of us.  Also got to meet the owner who was charming and helpful with what to try."}
{"text":"We were staying on the strip and decided to stop in this shop and the food was great! It Came out pretty fast and the staff was very kind. The owner came out and talked to us as well as this very nice blond gal who was very sweet and a great waitress. I would def come back for the food and great service! Thank you guys!"}
{"text":"The best gyro I've ever had! Also vinegar and salt on French fries! Amazing never heard of it till coming here!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Amazingly friendly staff. Went there with a larger group that hadn't been there and everyone thoroughly enjoyed what they got. The wraps were monstrous. The shawarma was deliciously messy. The baklava had a great bite to it. Would eat there again anytime."}
{"text":"As a customer and as a person who deals
 With customers all day, Joshua was absolutely phenomenal..to top it off the food was the best fresh and delicious!!!  Will return...."}
{"text":"Everything we had was amazing! Panini? Amazing! Poutine fries? Amazing! I'll definitely come back before I go home tomorrow!"}
{"text":"The salad was fine. Nothing fancy, nothing sub par. Nice healthier alternative to most of the very heavy options within walking distance of this location. It's a walk up and order, no servers, but the young ladies working the counter were very nice!"}
{"text":"Had dolmades, gyro plate, and a glass of wine. Quick service, wobbly table. Ok food. Dolmades were ok, but 2 of the six were coming apart and not wrapped. Gyro plate, nice portions, the saffron cous cous was the large pearl variety different but tasty. I had only had small pearl before and was not used to seeing the large. Good food reasonable price worth a try."}
{"text":"Gyro was smaller in size than expected. 

The lamb shawarma i had was not as good as Ive had at other places. The location was convenient as we were walking around on Fremont Street and needed something filling. 

They had codes on the bathroom doors and yet we saw a homeless person come in use the bathroom and leave which made me think twice before wanting to use the bathroom. :("}
{"text":"Alejandra and Denise are the culinary equivalent of the messiah; when you come here prepared to be transported like the zip line above your heads. Matt Pharis, Michelin 4-star eater, loves the shawarma which is better than the end credits of the Avengers. True Dat! Get here. The best thing about this place is the personal touch and friendly atmosphere. When you're on Fremont street, this is a place you can not afford to miss!"}
{"text":"Nice and cozy place right in Neonopolis next to the brewery. Friendly staff, many healthy options on the menu which is a little bit hard to find in the area. I had the veggie bowl an it was really good. Prices quite reasonable too."}
{"text":"Great food and the lady's stayed open late to serve everyone after the life is beautiful festival. Appreciate their great attitude! :)"}
{"text":"My wife and we're just walking and decided to take a chance. I had the falafel dinner and my wife had the lamb. The food was tasty and came out rather quickly. It's a small place but they get it right. There's a code on the bathroom but just ask. Great food great place."}
{"text":"Awful experience. Put a to-go order in about an hour ago and still waiting. While waiting, watched one person send back their order because it was wrong. They waited another 20 minutes for the revised order. Just watched the cashier get 'fountain drink' for a customer...she cracked open a CAN of diet soda and poured it in the glass. Shall I go on? I could have gone to the mediterranean and gotten a meal there faster than waiting for this place. How hard is it to make a wrap???"}
{"text":"Hidden away off to the side in the Fremont Street Experience area. I was so relieved to find a healthyish option for food. 

This place was great and the folks working were sooo nice! We arrived to a homey little environment that was surprisingly empty. The menu had a nice selection of Mediterranean dishes- ordering is fast casual. We had an order of hummus to start, my husband had the gyro with fries while I had a falafel with pita. I ordered an unsweetened iced tea and they brewed a fresh pot just for me!! :)


Our meals were brought out to our table- everything was delicious which was great bc we were so hungry! Lol. 
The hummus was a generous scoop. They don't skimp on portion sizes here. One of the employees would come refill my drink every so often. I really can't say enough great things. I would certainly choose this place over all the fried, generic food places in the area. 

Also, you will have to ask an employee for the code for the locks on the bathroom. As a courtesy to the restaurant I won't post that here."}
{"text":"The food was good and reasonably priced. The owner is super nice and the service is really impressive. Great spot!"}
{"text":"This place is ideal if you want to take a break from the Fremont  Experience craziness and not into gorging at buffets.  Though Fremont Mediterranean Cafe advertised their food as being healthy, it's a 180 degree departure from what the Heart Attack Grill was selling just next door!

I came here for a late bite and not really in the mood for anything heavy or big.  The place was near closing so there wasn't that many people there.  However it's a rather small eatery with very sparse decor with none of them anywhere near Mediterranean.

Got myself a Chicken Shawarma pita pocket which had marinated chicken strips, tomatoes, pickles, lettuce, slivers of red onions, and a touch of tahini sauce.  It wasn't all that big but big enough to fit in the palm of my hand.  The chicken was nicely seasoned and delicious but I prefer having a bit more veggies in my pita.  At nearly $9, it was a tad on the pricey side for what I got but the cafe is located right smack in the middle of the Fremont Experience area.  I asked for a cup of water and was charged 25 cents for ice.

In short this place was not bad at all.  It served rather delish food and you can't beat the location.  The restaurant itself was fairly clean and the only interaction I had with a worker was at ordering at the counter and having my food brought to my table."}
{"text":"Great little Mediterranean place on Freemont Street. It's authentic Mediterranean food and the atmosphere of the restaurant is in sync with it's food offerings. I loved the falafel & the hummus!"}
{"text":"Unfriendly staff. Ordered the chicken shawarma, ate about a third of it and found a long hair in it. Took it back to the counter and wasn't even given an apology, just simply oh I'll have them remake it for you. When they brought the new plate to my table again no apology, the girl just sat it on the table and turned around and walked away. You would think at the very least they would give you a free dessert or offer to give your money back...nope!! Again unfriendly staff. Won't be back and will make sure I spread the word. On another note the food was very disappointing. The only thing that I enjoyed was the pita bread. Hummus was nasty and their rice had a strange taste to it. Thought it would be good based on their stars. Gross, simply gross."}
{"text":"As an avid medditeranean food consumer, I was not impressed by this establishment. My spanakopita was not the flaky triangles of spinach delisousness I am accustomed to, instead it was like fillo dough layered on top of spinach. Their medditeranian salad isn't bad, but I'm not sure what's medditeranean about it... iceburg lettus, bannana peppers, feta cheese and onions. I was sad they did not have tabouli on the menu, a legit medditeranean salad made with parsley. They also were lacking baba ganoush and stuffed grape leaves, which are two things that I expect to see in a medditeranean restaurant. This seems more like an americanized version of medditeranean food, similar to Zoey kitchen. My husband enjoyed his gyro and I don't regret stopping here, but I don't imagine I'll be doing it again."}
{"text":"I never plan on coming here in advance, l  but whenever I find myself hungry on Fremont Street this tends to be my go to spot. The baba ganoush is fantastic. Prices are a little high, but in line with what you would expect in a touristy area."}
{"text":"Ordered two lamb shwarmas and got two chicken shwarmas, asked for what we ordered and got a sneer.

Waited 35 minutes in a moderately empty restaurant and asked for our food again. It was delivered cold without the extra sauce we asked for.

Asked for our money back and got approximately  50% of it back. Dont waste your time."}
{"text":"Awesome. Great atmosphere and decor. The steak kebabs were good. Chicken kebabs weren't as impressive, just OK."}
{"text":"This place is great. I had a chicken kebab with a side of cous cous. I could barely finish it all (and I showed up starving). The food was excellent. The guy at the register was extremely nice. The prices are cheap for Vegas. Plus, if you show up late enough, you'll meet some interesting characters. I will definitely go back next time I'm in town.  It's a gem in a town filled with chains and overpriced restaurants selling atmosphere."}
{"text":"The place is well decorated and the food looks great. I ordered the beef kabob and substitute the rice for the Greek salad. Beef came out very rare instead of rare but I stopped eating when I found hair in my Greek salad."}
{"text":"It was delish!!!!!   Been to Greece and this was wonderful. :) Greek salad, gyro, and tatziki were top notch.   Tatziki was nice are garlicky and pita nicely warmed. On my recent trip to Vegas I ate there twice. Owner was nice and we all loved our food."}
{"text":"Wow this place is so bad. The rice was stale and the shawma meat was so bad. My friend had the chicken kabab and it was like rubber. Not to mention the poor customer service from the owner him self. The cashier said something to us about the meal and the owner was arguing with her about that. DONT EVER COME HERE. IM WARNING YOU!"}
{"text":"It was Friday afternoon and I think I just wanted a steak in a stick! So.. to be honest I was a little disappointed! :/ beef kabob was tough!! Like you have to pull it w your hand and teeth kinda tough! So I ordered medium and this thing was cooked well done to the bone! My only constructive criticism is to put your cook back in training! Because I asked them to re cook the meat and it still came out well done! So disappointing.. anyway.. the girl in the front had attitude because I sent the food back! Well, if you don't know how to cook medium meat maybe you shouldn't ask \"how do you want your meat cook\" #sigh 

Hummus is okay! Nothing special. Definitely won't come back even if it's given for me for free! 

Oh one more thing! Nothing in the menu is available! Everything is like \"we don't serve that anymore\" hmm. Then update your menu. 

Ok over and out!"}
{"text":"Jessica recommended an item on the menu and my New favorite is the chipotle chicken wrap!!!!! Any chicken/healthy eater/ spicy lover this is what you want!"}
{"text":"Got the chicken shwarma. The vegetables were good, the sauce was bland and the chicken was ok. The place was very clean and orderly, I may give it another shot at a later date."}
{"text":"The baba ganoush was absolutely not what I was hoping for. It was awful, I 
threw it away. I did not complain because somebody was already at the register
complaining about their food! I was ready to leave because I was mad and hungry.
Never going back again."}
{"text":"Great service and food! What more can I say. If you like Mediterranean food you will love this gem on Fremont."}
{"text":"For there prices  they need  to not burn the onion rings and learn how to make a gyro  3 small thin pieces  of meat  it all feta  that they charge you more for no sauce very  dry and pita  was hard."}
{"text":"This is a solid place to grab a bite. I enjoyed it, but overall didn't wow me. The chicken was good, but I personally wasn't a fan of the cous cous. BUT, i will say that this place has THE BEST HUMMUS I have ever had. That alone is worth going back!"}
{"text":"Very refreshing experience on Fremont.  They serve burgers and fries, but honestly if that's what your looking for then go to any other of the 50 restaurants down here that serve great burgers. If you are looking for something different and like Mediterranian food, this is your place.   If you've never had Mediterranian food,  this is a great entry-level option.  The chicken and salmon kabobs were grilled to perfection, mildly spiced but still very flavorful.  The cous cous was cous cous, you can't screw that up,  and they don't.  The hummus was pre-made, not from scratch, but still really good.  We know good Mediterranean food, and we know bad Mediterranean food,  and this is good Mediterranean food.  Cheers and bon appetite."}
{"text":"Worst place. Meat is expired. Please don't go. We went and they called security on us because we wanted our refund and the manager started to fight. Very unprofessional and the meat is sour and not fresh. Try not get poisoned."}
{"text":"The dolmas and tzatziki were absolutely amazing. I can't wait to come back. The gyros were awesome too."}
{"text":"Super bomb! Big portions of food and friendly service. The pita is so soft and delicious. Not a whole lot of places to sit"}
{"text":"During our nightmare Fremont experience (see my review for Fremont street experience for details), we stopped by this place for lunch. 

Ambiance: 2/5, it embodies the vibe of Fremont street: old and unkempt. It looks more like a fast food joint than a restaurant. They need to turn up their AC because it was still warm inside. 

Food: 3.5/5, overall tasty but nothing special. It would be nice to get crispier fries though. The food came out in a reasonable time after ordering. Decent prices ($7.95 for a burger and fries, $11.95 for a chicken kebab plate with cous cous and hummus) given Vegas restaurants jack up their prices. They serve Mediterranean salads, pita wraps/kebabs, burgers, and panini sandwiches. 

Service: 2/5, the young lady who works both as the cashier and waiter couldn't care less about being there. She interrupted us ordering our food to go serve food to other guests seated and did not smile, say hello or ask us if we need anything else."}
{"text":"This is my favorite place to come to for lunch! Especially when the worker Elizabeth is working the front. She always greets you upon entering and exiting and always has a smile on her face even when it's busy. The food is delicious and always brought out to you in a timely manner. I suggest the lamb shawarma! It's great place to escape the Fremont crowd outside or you can still be apart of it by sitting outside in the patio area. It is definitely a place you have to visit while your downtown."}
{"text":"Tried it for a second time and took my mom.  We are both fans.  I got the dolmades (canned but serve their purpose, wish they were homemade though), gyro meat (yum), and their awesome beet salad.  My mom got a turkey and avocado wrap, which she thought was great.  Their level of busy-ness is variable--we hit it while six or seven other parties were there, so we waited about 20 mins for our food.  You can't have the guy taking orders and working the cash register also running the food!  Also, for our meal, it was about $35, which was pretty pricey.  Still, I like the freshness of the food, I like the location, and I'll be back."}
{"text":"There weren't many visible options for a quick bite late at night down on Freemont Street, so I was happy to find this Mediterranean café. You order at the counter from very kind and attentive staff. They helped guide me in the direction of my craving for something bready with meat by suggesting their gyro. It was tasty - like you would expect a gyro to taste. I also had the sweet potato fries which I found was odd for a Mediterranean café. They were also good, but not as crispy as I prefer them. While the place appeared clean, it was a bit run down and in need of repair. The décor was mostly French inspired."}
{"text":"Experience:  My second time here, so it deserves a review. I came here once before on a Vegas downtown food tasting tour. This time a group of friends met for dinner. It was 6pm on a Wednesday. 

Facility:  This is more like a fast food type spot. It takes a little bit to make, but you order at the counter and food is fairly cheap. They do have some bottle beer and boxed wine. They have a few half bench half stool seats, and a few traditional table and chairs. I love the giant rustic chandelier and the metal wall art, but otherwise it feels very fast-foodish. 

Service:  The lady working was neither nice or friendly, but she was fairly attentive. However, her manager did not teach her the golden rule about customers in person take priority over the phone...she stopped in the middle of taking my order to answer and help the person on the phone.  She could have answered and put them on hold, but whatever.  

Food:  We ordered the sampler platter to share, and I got the Lamb Shwarma with rice as my meal. The food on the platter was good. It had warm pita bread 4/5, tzaziki sauce 5/5, tahini sauce 1/5, falafels 3/5, hummus 4/5, and baba ganoush 3.5/5.
The Shwarma plate was decent. The lamb was good and moist 3.5/5 served over the rice 2.5/5.  I typically love Mediterranean rice, but this was short grained and had spices and saffron, which was a little different than I'm use to. I like the long, white, buttery kind more. There were a tiny bit of grilled veggies 3/5 on the plate too. It was also served with more hummus and pita.  

Overall: I like this place, and would probably stop again if I'm downtown having drinks and in the mood for gyros or Shwarma."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some Gelato for my nephew since it was so hot out. I understand this stuff melts, but why did it seem like it was melting before she scooped it? the gelato did not look appetizing one bit."}
{"text":"Hidden gem located in Downtown Las Vegas! The gyro was unfortunately smaller than expected but the ingredients seemed really fresh and the meat was flavourful.

I appreciate finding quality Mediterranean food especially in Las Vegas just because it isn't that common here. 

The service was extremely polite and they were really helpful in helping me pick what to have in my beef gyro. They were also really fast in whipping up my order. 

Atmosphere in here is casual. Pretty decent place to coke get a  plate of some Mediterranean food!"}
{"text":"The food is always amazing here! I love it but the last time I came in the cashier was a straight bitch taking orders with a HEADPHONE in her ear the whole time and being rude and impatient with customers who had a thick accent, obviously she works on Fremont so she should know she's dealing with tourists... extremely unprofessional."}
{"text":"My husband had the gyro and thought it was the best he'd had.  I had the lamb shwarma and liked it.  The meat was moist and nicely seasoned. The rice was good.  My husband had the cous cous and thought it was good.  Nicely priced, too."}
{"text":"Such a crap exsperience. I love Greek food and had been wanting to try this place so I finally did. 
Took about 30mins for me to order after 3 people ahead in line...I was hoping the food would make these wait worth it but no way! 

The brunette at the front playing cashier and food delivery has zero customer service skills and moves slower than a turtle.  She didn't apologize for the wait or for being out of rice..I didn't want rice but she was telling others who stood in line for 15-30mins they were out...ummm, put a sign up or let the line of customers know maybe; especially when you're taking 10 years to process orders and such.

I'm not a hard person to please because of my extreme passion for food but this was THE WORST GREEK APPETIZER PLATTER EVER: pita bread was super hard which sucked, the falafel was over-cooked and they replaced what was supposed to be the babaganoush with some tastless weird red mayo mix..
The hummus and taziki was not aweful and prices were pretty good but I will never reccomend this place. I hope they get it together; it's Vegas and there are so many options for food! They really should step it up considering they are the only Greek available right on Fremont."}
{"text":"I love this place.
It is exactly what you think it is, a healthy place to grab a bite to eat. 
The staff is awesome, always friendly and patient with my take out orders 
I pick up later than I say I will most of the time. 
If you are eating in it has a great little vibe. Its small and cozy. 
The food is exactly what I want every time and delicious. I never get tired of it, even though I order the chicken chipotle wrap almost every time. If you are looking for a quick healthy bite this is the place."}
{"text":"I researched this place before our trip, and based on the positive reviews, my wife & I stopped in for a late dinner this past weekend.

She got the salmon kabob plate, and I got the chicken gyro.  Both were just about the best we've ever had, including our stay in Athens several years ago!

We were jonesing to try other menu items after a show the next night.  She got the Greek salad, while I got more salmon kabobs to share and the chicken gyro.  It was a LOT of food!  We ate ourselves into a stupor, but what a way to go!

We went back for breakfast the next morning before our trip home.   She got the Fattouch salad with grilled shrimp & I got the chicken kabob plate.   YUM!!!   

The prices aren't cheap, but the staff is very helpful.  I believe the owner & her Mom waited on us the first two times.  They were very sweet during our visits.  The salmon kabobs are AMAZING!!!  Actually, everything we tried was better than most places we've been to.  The tzatziki is creamy with chunks of cucumber, and the hummus tastes homemade.

Given that the heart attack grill is next door, this is the much better option."}
{"text":"Poor food unless you love extra salt rice wasn't washed I got the gyro bowl and I could count the veggies involved 5 pieces 2 pieces of broccoli 3 carrots slices. Also got a pastrami sandwich and yet again extra salt. I asked for tahini sauce and she gave me something orange then made up a name for the sauce I wanted either way it wasn't what I asked for and I'm From the Middle East soooooooooo please don't correct me unless your middle eastern \"halal with alcohol and pork served?????\""}
{"text":"Absolutely great place to eat, clean and very friendly staff, above all very tasty food. Definitely worth giving it a try. Perfect location as well."}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious. The gyros are HUGE.  I can eat a lot, and I could barely finish. Food was fresh and hot too. A true gem. Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"The restaurant gem of downtown Las Vegas! Love their many menu choices and always appreciate their friendliness."}
{"text":"Meh. That's the best I can come up with for this place. I really wanted something other than Mexican food or burgers so this was a welcome option. The falafel pita sandwich was a pita filled with questionable lettuce, very tahini rich sauce and overly deep fried falafel patty. I expected more but didn't get it."}
{"text":"Barely ok.  They started out by yelling at us that the bathrooms were for customers only.  Almost got me to leave the line to order.

They screwed up my order, so I got two things.  Both completely flavorless.  Chicken plate.  Lamb Sharma.  I can't believe they made it flavorless -hard to screw that up.  The gyros my kids got were very good."}
{"text":"Great dinner!  Cane here on our first night in Vegas.  We did not want to walk down the strip because we were pretty tired.  Found this place here on Yelp.  My husband and I had the chicken shawarma, which is always a favorite of mine.  I forgot what the kids ordered but they loved  their meals as well.  Friendly gentleman behind the counter who wanted to make sure we had a great experience.  My only regret is that we did not cone a second time."}
{"text":"Ordered a veggie burger it fell apart in my hand tasted gross. French fries were cold and soggy even though asked for well done. Be aware nothing is fresh. Disgusting...."}
{"text":"We love this place! Go to Fremont street just to eat here whenever we come to Vegas. :) great tzatziki appetizer, and you gotta try the rice bowls! My partner said the gyros are the best she's ever had!"}
{"text":"This place is disgusting even when you're wasted. It's the most disgusting place on fremont. Wouldn't even give me a refund when I ate 1 ........that's right 1 bite of a terrible falafel wrap. Everyone that I ate here with hated their food minus the sweet potato fries. I would give this a negative if I could. Ughhhhhhh terrible!!!!! DO NOT GO HEEERRREEEEE EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"This is a nice place for a fast and yummy food. it was my last day that I discovered this place.  The have many dishes to choose from.
Prices are very reasonable, there is outdoor sitting as well inside. 
I had the bowel dish chicken with rice and fresh veggie in tomatoe sauce. it was do delicious."}
{"text":"This place has AMAZING food,  huge menu and very generous portions-best kept secret in town"}
{"text":"It's like \"fast food type\" Mediterranean place where you order your food and they bring it to you.   I would not considered this place a real Mediterranean joint....far from it.  I can say it's LESS SALTY than a lot of places out there, that's a plus in my book!

I've had better in Southern Cali, but when you are in the mood for this type of food and don't want to drive far from downtown Vegas to get some....this place will do until they closed their doors because most businesses close their doors within 5 years. 

The girl that took our order was polite and checked on us.   The food was ok, not great or something for me to shout to the world about. It gets the cravings satisfied. Not too bad.

We order the chicken and beef pita and 1 order of fries.  Came out a little over $22 bucks, sorta on the pricey side. 

If you are nearby and don't want Dennys, this place might work for you. Otherwise....it's not a place I would go back."}
{"text":"It's time for an impromptu dinner session with a close friend.  We just got through watching a friend's internet show cast at The Beat and wanted to grab a bite to eat.  I've been to Fremont Mediterranean Café before and wanted to bring her here.  She was up for a clean meal so this was a perfect match!

When you get into the café, it's exactly that.  A few tables, a long counter to order and a small seating area outside.  It's a nice, quaint size.  The staff is super friendly.  Our cashier initiated some conversation with us and made us feel welcome.  

For dinner, I got the Turkey Avocado wrap for $8.95.  Pretty affordable, in fact all wraps are $8.95.  My wrap included a spinach tortilla, turkey breast, avocado, provolone cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, red onions, banana peppers and a pesto spread.  I liked this combination a lot.  The mix of mild red onions and the tanginess of the banana peppers really makes the Mediterranean flavor.  They packed the wrap with turkey so it ended up being super filling.  Avocado and pesto brought the dish together.  It's a huge wrap and you will love it!

This place is exactly what they advertise:  Fresh, Natural and Healthy.  Ironically, it's located right next to the Heart Attack Grill.  Choose to be healthy and you will certainly love this place!  Come check them out."}
{"text":"I would leave this place a zero star review if I could. The french fries were limp, undercooked, greasy, and cold. The falafel was rancid, presumably because it was cooked in old oil. The sampler plate came with tiny, little, condiment size portions, none of which tasted like they should. The pita was soggy and flavorless. The lamb was strangely spiced so as to be inedible. The mozzarella sticks did not come with marinara. We had to throw out our entire dinner. I will never order from them again."}
{"text":"Sitting at the restaurant now, food has very small portions for the price, no flavor and fries are burnt. Very bland food. Tastes like meat has no seasoning..somewhat a metal taste.  Wouldn't recommend to anyone, by far the worst mediterranean food I've has so far!"}
{"text":"This place blows, which is such a bummer since they have vegan options and meat options, I thought a nice place we could all dine together. The only thing my party didn't complain about was the poutine. The falafel pita was pathetic, only one falafel, really? The wrap my friend had was so over saturated with dressing it fell apart. My beet salad had pure balsamic syrup drenched on it, no oil, no vinegar, no lemon, even after they added more lettuce I couldn't eat it. Such a disappointment, I hate leaving negative reviews but I had to warn future hungry people."}
{"text":"Lamb shawarma tougher than a Zappos shoe sole and flavorless as fuck. Was that really lamb?  Don't even get me started on that flour concoction they call pita bread, they must be made by Whammo, because I am still using it as a frisbee to this day. Pure shit. Staff and service fine."}
{"text":"We stumbled upon this place when looking for somewhere affordable for lunch. What a great decision! 

My husband and I both got the gyro plate (for $9.95), which comes with fries. The fried were crispy and delicious. They look like McDonald's fries, but taste much better and less greasy. The gyro is warm and delicious. The pita bread tastes very fresh and is warm. Very good gyros! 

The workers are also very kind. We got a bottle of water, which they forgot to bring us. When they realized their mistake, they brought us both bottles of water instead of bringing just the one. 

The place is cute and very clean. Nice atmosphere right on Fremont!"}
{"text":"Very awesome customer service...as Joshua was taking orders and serving but made sure every customer felt welcome even though he had to deal with a rowdy couple...who he treated with respect and tended to their gripes...as they had to much to drink....they thanked him for everything....even if the food wasn't that great I would return because of Joshua..... but lo and behold the food was great"}
{"text":"The Greek Salad is to DIE for. I don't know what they put in their vinagrette but it's amazing. I work downtown  and when we need something healthy and fast, we go to Cous Cous... It's delicious and it's quick, delivery is on time, and the prices are fair. My boss gets the Mediterranean Bowl with Gyro Meat. Everything I've tried here is delicious."}
{"text":"A quick, healthier option downtown is much appreciated! Granted, it might be a 3-star place if it weren't downtown and if they woman working the counter didn't have some fun, dry humor that we found entertaining. We came in a little tipsy, and I felt compelled to say, \"I promise we're not drunk tourists,\" and her reply was, \"Actually, locals give us the hardest time.\" Well played. 

We ended up here because the wait was forever at Le Thai, and the hostess there did not appreciate our attempts at sneaking in the front door. We had to retreat quickly, and when we saw the sign that said \"Fresh and Healthy\" (or something like that), it was like an oasis. 

Pro tip: The bathrooms have a code to enter, but even so, don't forget to manually lock the door like I did. Otherwise, you may have a visitor (like I did).

On to the food! They offer a vegetarian sampler plate which I love just in theory. I don't know why it's so hard to find in this town! It came with falafel, hummus, baba, a small salad and some pita. Everything tasted fresh. I wouldn't say the falafel were the best I ever had, but they were completely respectable!

The husband had the salmon skewers, and they looked super impressive. Huge chunks of fish, and the flavor was great as well. I had a little bite. 

They sell wine in to-go cups! That feature may be worth a visit by itself. 

If you're downtown, definitely worth a visit if you're hungry and need something quick!"}
{"text":"Came here after flying in and was very hungry. After wandering, this place caught our eye. the women behind the counter was hustleing and very friendly, made suggestions which was nice.  I got the falafel wrap which was tasty and a great price. Beers were dollar off on weekends. This place is great on the tsate buds and wallet, highly recommend."}
{"text":"I'm in love! And I'm just talkin about the buffy cashier from Canada ;b 

The food here is delish!! I recommend the sampler plate if you haven't acquired a taste for Mediterranean food. Have to point out that it's probably the most healthiest spot to eat if you're on a diet or simply eat well- not too greasy or fried foods. And veggie meals, wraps, salads etc as well. The staff is super friendly. Small seating area but all the more to get to know the people you're sitting next too :b"}
{"text":"Not very fast for counter service, but my meal was almost worth the wait. The girl who took our order last night could have smiled once or twice. I didn't get the warm fuzzies, or felt like my business was particularly valued, but I guess that's what you come to expect from a fast food joint on Fremont St. The restaurant was clean, however, and I value cleanliness. 

The Beef Shawarma was good. The beef was barely warm, but had great flavor. You can tell it would have been amazing had it been fresher. The vegetables were mush, but had good flavor - I'm just big on texture, so I didn't go for a second bite. The cous cous was really good (as I was hoping, considering the name of the restaurant), and I thoroughly enjoyed the hummus and pita. It was nearly 10pm, so I could understand why some of the food wasn't as good as it should have been. 

My partner, unfortunately, didn't enjoy his dish as much as I had enjoyed mine."}
{"text":"Very clean & friendly staff. 
Fast was given to us fresh and fast. 
I ordered a Greek wrap and it was delicious I enjoyed the freshness of it. 
My boyfriend ordered a hot sub it was hot in temperature how'd you'd expect and spicy ! Very good combo. It's a small place good for a quick lunch or late night munchies. Something out of the ordinary burger and fries that's at every corner on Fremont and Las Vegas Boulevard. I highly recommend this place and the sub is good enough for two people there stuffed pretty good!"}
{"text":"Several items are pricy for basic vegetable and meat dishes. My order was completed nearly 20
minutes from start to finish. It was not packed. When I got my order, my wrap was drowning in hummus. I have eaten better truck food than as this Vegas eatery."}
{"text":"Food was good.  Owner would keep checking on us and recommended dishes.  Nice atmosphere and a good change from the normal Vegas buffets."}
{"text":"I love Mediterranean food... I recently move to downtown area I decide to try this restaurant, as usual I order half & half bowl. Took me by surprise that they told me we don't do that is either a gyro bowl or a chicken bowl... This is a restaurant that not give options to make their costumers happy."}
{"text":"Been here twice..just had the pastrami and Greek wrap with homemade fries..last time got the chicken wrap and Greek salad and everything has always been delicious. Staff is friendly and welcoming. Most importantly it's healthy and has great taste. Me and my fiancé are happy campers once again, we will be back!"}
{"text":"OMG this place is so good, the food so fresh and cheap and so conveniently close to my job. Go if you love middle eastern food this restaurant is awesome!!"}
{"text":"Wowwww.  Okay, so - five star rating, not easy to get from me.  But this place HAS to be on my top ten favorite restaurants in Vegas as of this moment.  Their hummus is out of this WORLD.  I actually liked it more than the wrap that I had (which was definitely tasty!).  Seriously.  You have to go and try it for yourself.  It's a hidden gem.  You can easily miss it, even looking for it, as my date and I did.  The service is also good.  The people who work there are really nice, so that's of course part of the five star rating.  It's Mediterranean, so it might go without saying that there are vegetarian options aplenty, but I won't let it go unsaid.  Please, just do yourself a favor.  Go here and try it out yourself.  If you're a hummus lover, as I am, your life is not complete without trying the hummus HERE.  (You can thank me later.)  ; )"}
{"text":"My husband and I are on a staycation downtown and during our exploration of the area we discovered tucked away in a corner of an empty shopping center, the Fremont Mediterranean Cafe.  Right in front of the entrance, scaffolding and counter weights for the zip line, what an unpleasant view. but inside, the seating is close and comfortable with cushioned benches that are group together for intimate conversations.  The colors are jewel tone and rich.

The menu is huge with everything from wraps, burgers and kabobs, to salads and subs.  We started with an appetizer, the sample platter, which includes falafel, hummus, baba ghanoush, and tzatziki.  It was delicious and generous in portion sizes.

For our main entree, I got a beef kabob.  They marinate the kabob in grated onions, herbs, and add a special house seasoning.  It was tender and very good.  The roasted veggies that came with it included zucchini and summer squash, egg plant and there was side of hummus, saffron rice and a grilled pita.  I was getting too full from eating the appetizer, but the food was really good.  What I couldn't eat, my husband finished.  Would recommend to everyone."}
{"text":"I'm so glad hubby and I chose this location for a quick lunch. They are located only a couple doors away from the Heart Attack Grill. Hubby got the chicken shawarma and I got the chipotle chicken tortilla wrap. We also got an order of poutine. The lady that took our order was friendly and our food was done within 15-20 minutes. 

What a great lunch! And super filling! I kept eating my wrap even after I was full. It was packed full of fresh ingredients and the chicken was thick and flavorful. His chicken shawarma was amazing too. I had never eaten poutine before, but this was a great place to try it for the first time. The prices are good and the service was quick when we went. They serve beer and have indoor/outdoor seating - perfect for watching all the action on Fremont."}
{"text":"My husband and I made our way down to Fremont street after spending the majority of our time on the strip. We figured we would find a bite down here but when we started to explore Fremont Street nothing looked good until we stumbled upon Cous Cous. Cous Cous is located near the Heart Attack Grill. I refused to eat at the Heart Attack Grill for multiple reason so greek food it was. My husband ordered the gyro supreme with fries and I ordered a gyro with onion rings. The difference was his gyro had cheese and mine did not. I thought for an extra $2 it was sort of a rip off but who I am to judge a cheese lover.

The gyro was decent and really hit the spot to help soaked up some the booze I drank earlier. Our order did take a few minutes to come out and there was only one other couple inside the restaurant. The fries were more than enough for one person and I would suggest sharing an order. The onion rings could be also enough for sharing but honestly I polished them off myself since I was quite hungry at the time."}
{"text":"Ordered two gyro Supremes with fries and a bottle of Perrier. The lady at the cash register was rather grumpy. the menu was a bit too long and lacking in details. food took a long time to come out but once it did it was delicious! it was at time that I realized the cashier was also the cook, bussed, and dishwasher so kudos to her. no wonder she was grumpy. the seating provides great people watching on Fremont, and the price was good. All in all its an average dinning experience. Nothing unique or special."}
{"text":"My friend and I are no stranger to gyros and dolmas, and we can confidently recommend this place. Very well seasoned food, came out quickly and good portions. Sit on the porch in the shade and enjoy the people watching on Freemont st."}
{"text":"I have had lunch here 3 times now and every meal has been perfect. The lamb shawarma was full of flavor and was so tender and delicious. The cous cous that it was served with also tasted amazing. The pitas here are warm, soft, and chewy. The hummus is tangy and very flavorful. The classic gyro was better than any gyro I have ever tasted. The falafel was hot, and had a good crunch... I am not a big fan of falafel but this was great. The French fries and onion rings are hot, crispy, and are generously portioned. The poutine fries were also crisp and were not soaked at all by the gravy and feta cheese. Last but not least the baklava was sweet, gooey, nutty, with nice crisp layers of fillo. The only complaint I have is everything on their menu should be one dollar cheaper. Other than that everything is great. 4.5 / 5"}
{"text":"Ordered the chicken schwarma. The chicken tasted rubbery and the wrap was overall dry so I asked for some sauce. The sauce they gave me had absolutely zero flavor... it may as well have been water. My husband said it was like eating air. The food in general had no flavor. Not even salt could help. The Pita bread also seemed old and stale. My husband had the same experience with his falafel wrap. I give 2 stars because the fries weren't bad... but also nothing special."}
{"text":"Got a gyro bowl here last night.  Large chunks of salty meat.  Made me think this dish is how they get rid of the end pieces.   The restaurant had run out of rice at 8 pm on a Friday night.  They replaced with couscous.  Vegetables in the bowl were broccoli and carrots.  Not great, but staff was friendly and hard working."}
{"text":"This place has upgraded itself, possibly even changing owners, and the schwarma is improved.  The eating area is small but the gal at the counter was able to handle multiple customers and still clean the empty plates off the tables.  The pita was thick and tasty as opposed to the small flat crunchy pita at other places and the couscous were like little pearls.  It wasn't super overpriced either considering it is in the most crowded part of freemont.  I had the gyro plate.  It came with an ample but not too large portion of schwarma and 4 quarters of a pita with some raw onions, cooked peppers and cous cous.  The schwarma was tender with a subtle flavor.  All in all, a solid 3.5 stars."}
{"text":"Just happened to walk down Fremont with some family members with no idea to eat. We stumbled upon this place and saw gyros in the window. We stopped in and got 2 gyro wraps to go. They came out quickly and were full of flavor when we got back to the room. I hadn't had a gyro in quite a while so I will definitely stop there next time I'm in downtown Vegas!"}
{"text":"The Royal Burger and fries was very good.  My wife enjoyed the Supreme Gyro. Get plenty of napkins because it can get messy.  The employees were fast and friendly."}
{"text":"We enjoyed the food and the prices was very reasonable. The menu has a wide selection and the service was quick and good. Recommened!!"}
{"text":"This place ROCKS! I came to Las Vegas for a business trip and had to check out Fremont street and behold a mom and papa gyro shop. I tried the sampler platter and the supreme gyro and they were badass if you ever make it to sin city I highly recommend this place you won't be disappointed!!"}
{"text":"I got the chicken shawarma plate. It wasn't bad, but you can get better Mediterranean food in Vegas. The tsitziki I asked for in place of my hummus was more sour than cucumber-y. The cous cous was good, but I prefer a more chicken flavor to mine. The chicken shawarma was definitely the best part of the meal. I didn't care for the grilled veggies."}
{"text":"I've tried the Beef Kabob, Lamb Burger, and the turkey sub. The food is very affordable and the portions are large. Yes, order fries with what ever you get. :)

They hook if up for Zappos employees!

{"text":"Slightly disappointed that the Moroccan tea was not authentic after having already paid $11 for two cups for my boyfriend and I. They literally just put the bag into water. I am used to places using real mint instead of the tea bags. I also ordered the Baklava which was not tasteful either. It was very soggy and tasted like raw brown sugar. ;("}
{"text":"Very good place but avg food - not bad but not over the top.

What I did strongly appreciate was the service and cleanliness of the place - very very good service and spotless.

If you're in the area and want Gryo's then it's worth a stop."}
{"text":"Had lunch here during vacation. I ordered the kabob plate and had two chicken kabobs, rich, hummus and pita bread.

Unfortunately I did not care for the chicken or the flavors used on it. The hummus and rice were not good either. Pita bread was fresh and good.

Price is about $15 per person and the service was average."}
{"text":"This place has amazing gyros I suggest adding the feta cheese. 
The thing is they push their fries on almost every order like its a great deal for $2 More. However the fries are extremely soggy and under cooked. 
They were out of lemons I asked for when ordering a U sweet tea. Those are the two star deductions for my
1st Visit. 
I want to try the lamb plate next time."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the cuisine at this cozy little restaurant. Authentic spicing on the chicken shish kebab plate. Good Greek salad. Very reasonable prices for downtown Vegas. Friendly and efficient staff. Would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Amazing service and hospitality. Honestly the best service I think I've ever had. Food was amazing! Really reasonably priced. Yummy Gelato too."}
{"text":"This place is great. The lady that took my order was super friendly. She also delivered my food and it was hot and delicious. I got the Gyro Supreme with sweet potato fries. The portions are generous. Not a lot of indoor seating but I sat outside and people watched the crazies on Fremont. Two thumbs up!"}
{"text":"I was walking down Fremont Street with a friend and this place looked appealing.  I ordered the Supreme Gyro with falafel.  You can order beer with your meal, but the selection is extremely limited (I think they had Bud Light and Miller on tap).

Nonetheless, the food was pretty good and the service was friendly.  A nice, quick place to have dinner if you cannot wait to get back to the slots."}
{"text":"Stopped in here from the Fremont experience to truly have an authentic exceptional experience from the flashy tacky environment outside. The owner greeted us and pointed out his personal favorites. All dishes are homemade and made to order. The tabouli is exceptional as well as the baklava (not too sweet). The fries are fresh and the veggies are cooked to perfection. Stop in to this gem!"}
{"text":"Good sandwiches--they hit the spot after eating way too much junk food. They have the usual Mediterranean specialties (wraps, falafel, salads, etc.) plus regular American style subs."}
{"text":"I work downtown and eat here occasionally. The food is decent and reasonably priced, perfect for lunch or late-night eating. But when I go in, there is rarely anyone at the counter to greet me, often sauntering out from the back a few minutes later. As a person who has eaten here a few times on my lunch break and typically knows what I want to order, this can be frustrating. It seems to be a little slow and the cashiers often seem bored and disinterested. The staff isn't especially friendly, so I recommend taking it to go. I will give them props that the food is normally hot, fresh, and pretty tasty. The service and atmosphere is just lacking."}
{"text":"Just order food ... They completely butchered my whole meal because they didn't have food in the back so I figured they had to butcher something ... Almost $30 for a pita with spurts of meat an lettuce complete waste of time"}
{"text":"I believe the name has changed to Cous Cous.  I think they have new owners & chefs.  the lamb burger spices have changed for the lesser .  doubt I will return.  I don't like the last 2 new cashiers I've delt with."}
{"text":"I was walking down Fremont Street, anxiously looking for something to eat. I spied upon a brewhouse pub. I asked The door man if they had food. He said, \"no. But they have excellent food right here.\" He pointed to this unassuming Mediterranean restaurant. 

Since I am trying to lose weight, I was trying to avoid the hamburgers and greasy fried food that is everywhere.  The menu at Cous Cous is fairly simple with the obvious mediterranean   food. It also includes salads, wraps, sandwiches, and burgers.  I ordered hummus and a chicken gyro. Both were delicious! The pita bread was warm and soft the chicken was deliciously seasoned and not overcooked and the hummus was tangy flavorful.  I will definitely be going back

However, my favorite part of the restaurant was the people. Our server/host/entertainer, Joshua, was absolutely delightful! 

In summary, this was an excellent dining experience for not a lot of money.  Oh, The beer next-door was really really good too. But I'll save that for my next review :)"}
