{"text":"I've been here a few times.  I've had the gyro meat twice, tried a pork chop, and was given a small sample of the chicken.  The first time I was there, the meat was a little dry.  The other times I've tried the food, it was delicious.  The pork chop was kind of amazing.  Service was very friendly.  The meat is a bit salty and I could do with more flavor in the rice.  All in all, though, I like the Sultan Grill and will be back.

Also, they serve two types of tzatziki sauce.  I recommend you ask for the thin version."}
{"text":"The service from the phone to the Delivery was fast and courteous. But the food was sub par.  The Gyros tasted like day old meat. Very tough and chewy. And the amount of onions on it was enough for two.  I will try it again but something else on the menu."}
{"text":"What a great discovery! The wife and I dropped in for a quick lunch and it surpassed my expectations! On the outside,  it doesn't look like much, but inside it was nice and clean, not busy at all, and the food was very fast and one of the best gyros I've had. I chose the gyro sandwich (it was a basic gyro but delicious) and my wife went with the gyro bowl. I was pleasantly surprised with the portions and even happier that a small place like that didn't try to charge me $10 for the gyro. Quality food, even better experience.
We'll be back for sure!"}
{"text":"Went there and ordered waited 40 minutes for my meal so next time I ordered ahead to pick up my food. Drove all the way down after they told me if would be 15 minutes and they didn't even start my order. They said they misplaced it and there was no one even in the restaurant. Consistently highly unorganized !!!!!"}
{"text":"My wife and I had a horrible first, and last experience here... Hummus trio, while colorful lacked taste and had a strange consistency - and if you're going to charge that much for hummus more than a half-pita worth of dipping bread would be appreciated. Wife had a chicken Caesar sandwich - meh to that, but better than my choice... I had the Chicken Schwarma sandwich that had chickent that was so unbelievably dry and overcooked, with little to no sauce, that I couldn't even stomach swallowing half of the sandwich. Almost $30 spent on this visit and it was an abysmal experience."}
{"text":"Great Gyro sandwich. A bit pricy and owner said when they are busy food takes a while but worth it. He made a suggestion to my son to order the Valley of Fire Gyro, and he LOVED it. Will come again, salad was really good too."}
{"text":"Food was great! Their hummus is delicious - probably the best hummus I've had in town. Also really good grape leaves, gyro meat, and salad. Their mixture of spices made it unique, too. We'll be back!"}
{"text":"Decided to finally try the fairly new Greek place near me. I was happy to see they offered delivery. 
This is where it all goes wrong. I called and the, very distracted sounding, girl told me there was no delivery. Oh well, I'll just drag myself over there. I finish placing my order and am told it will be ready in 20 minutes. I arrive closer to 25 minutes later, and walk into a restaurant full of very annoyed looking people...none of whom have food. 38 minutes later I walk out with my food. 
Great food would make up for this. However the food was cold, the gyro meat was horribly dry, and everything else was so-so. 
I'm disappointed. Would love an excellent Greek option in my area. I just don't think this is it. 
I would have given 1 star but gave them an extra pity star because they seemed surprisingly shocked at how busy they were on a Sunday eve around 6pm. However, dry, cold food and at least an hour wait just isn't worth it."}
{"text":"Very very good. Fast, large portions, and great customer service!! One of the best Mediterranean places I've been so far!"}
{"text":"So I have been 3 times.  The gyro is pretty good.  I like the salads but each time the pita has been overcooked and hard.  This time I bought a piece of baklava and it was bone dry and hard.  If given the choice, I would go to Stephano's.  Given the location of my work, this is the closest.  Not sure I am willing to give them another try unless just getting salads."}
{"text":"I tried this place in December of 2014 and I really liked it. Ever since then i would always get the chicken kabobs and rice or a chicken Caesar salad but last month in July I had a chicken Caesar salad. It wasn't as good like it usually was but I didn't think anything of it and it was also the only thing I ate that day. That night I threw up the salad every where. Within 24 hours I had thrown up 15 times. It finally stopped the next night but that wasn't it I had diarrhea after that for 2 days non stop I couldn't even sleep or eat/drink anything. So I went through hell for 3 days and I have never in my life been that sick and my throat and ribs hurt for a week after. I don't know if it was the dressing or the chicken or maybe dirty lettuce? I don't know but I won't be eating here again and I can't eat salads anymore because all I can think about is how horrible it was to throw up a chicken Caesar salad."}
{"text":"Excellent service. Very helpful with recommendations. We got red hummus and chicken shish kabobs. Dinner portions were more than enpugh. We took some home for the next day. We would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"Henderson, NV has very few good restaurants around, Sultans grill is definitely going to be your better bet if you're in the area. Every time I've walked in I have felt very welcome, the employees are so nice! And the food is great! Love Mediterranean food and it may not be the best I've had, in my opinion it's the best on this side of town."}
{"text":"Excellent taste, good value, great customer service, these guys really want to do everything they can to please the customer.  If your looking for some mederteranian food look no further.  This is the place!  Easy access just off the freeway. Great job Sultans grill."}
{"text":"First time here for lunch today. It was well worth the drive!  The staff was friendly and helpful, which is always a good sign.  

The food was really good.  It's difficult to find healthy, tasty and delicious 'fast' food, but Sultan's grill has done just that!  

I had the gyro and my husband had the chicken shawarma.  Both excellent choices and we decided we would definitely visit there again.  Thank you for the great service and healthy lunch!"}
{"text":"We wanted to try this place since we love Mediterranean style cuisine, it's close to home, and it was quick and easy. 
We walked in to the girl at the counters back facing us. She was too busy on her phone she did not even hear us walk in. We were standing behind her for far too long before she finally acknowledged us. We ordered the chicken plate and the turkey burger. For how long it took them to cook our food I would expect it to be hot when it got to my table. It definitely was not. The rice especially was cold and hard like it had been sitting forever. I was completely dissatisfied with my entire experience and woukd never recommend this establishment to anyone!"}
{"text":"First time today and we ordered two gyros to go. Only thing I didn't realize is they don't put lettuce on it but I'm sure they would have added it if I asked. Just added my own at home. Delicious! Tender and tasty meat, soft and sturdy pita bread. Looked like a lot of good options on the menu and we will go back to try some out."}
{"text":"Terrible!! Everything was way over cooked and dry, dry, dry. (Meat, rice, pita)  Tzatziki was nothing more than sour cream with small pieces of cucumber, no flavor! Untrained staff. Our small order was messed up.  Save your money and travel to a better Gryo location!"}
{"text":"I ordered the falafel and my husband ordered the chicken shawarma. Both of our meals were dry and not very good. The customer service was great which makes me feel bad for leaving them a bad review. They are trying, but their food is disappointing."}
{"text":"Went to sultans grill in Henderson nv.  Thought the service was great! The food was awesome I would I would definitely come back again.  I went with friends so we kind of shared so I got to try the Gyro which was really good I had to kebabs I loved and we got to try the chicken swarms. Plan to go back soon!  Fast service if your short on time but I didn't feel rushed.  I give this place 5 stars most meals are around $10"}
{"text":"Craving Mediterranean food so gave Sultans a try. Didn't blow me away, was just okay. Chicken kabob meat was close to being not cooked completely, close, ever so slight pinkness to it. Favor of meat was okay."}
{"text":"So thrilled to have a good Greek food restaurant near my home! The owner and staff are awesome, they even remember our favorites when we come in. I highly recommend the Gyro Platter and you have to have hummus with a side of their homemade hot sauce! The price point is well worth the quality of food and they deliver within a four mile radius. Can you say \"yum?!\""}
{"text":"Wish I had known about them sooner! The food is great and the staff was quite friendly. I will most definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"First off let me start by saying that I haven't even yelped in years but I recreated my Acct because I'm so disappointed of the food here.. Got the beef and chicken kabob combo... Taziki sauce tasted wierd.. Chicken was dry and plain.. And the beef was horrible and tough.. I mean really tough though... If the food was ok at least I wouldn't  leave a bad review I just wouldn't  come back... But employee that was working gave me an attitude when I open my bag to check if my order was right.. Shorter white heavyset male.... Then when asked for hot sause he just stared at me before getting it... Worst Greek food I ever had.. Dead serious... Don't even know how there still open....id imagine if I decided to cook it my self for the first time with no recipe it would be better..."}
{"text":"Try this again... First time here.. Togo mind you. Got the Valley of Fire kabob sandwich with small Greek salad and roasted red pepper hummus. All I can say is I AM definitely coming back here to eat. The price is reasonable and the portions are a bit above normal. So if you are in the area and need Mediterranean food.. This should be your first and only stop!!"}
{"text":"I've ordered from this place several times and I've never been disappointed. I haven't been able to order much because I can't get past the appetizers & salads. The gyro & peasant salads are awesome! And u can't go wrong with the hummus or cheese & olives. Give this place a look!"}
{"text":"Very cool there is now a Mediterranean/Greek/Middle Eastern joint in my area. Even cooler, they have delivery service 4 miles out! This place is in the strip mall where Naga and the yogurt place is. 

What I'm loving here are the non meat options that I had so far. 

Say yes to Eggplant Salad! Warm eggplant on bed of salad greens sprinkled with seasonings and almond slivers. The small size bowl was filled up plentiful of eggplant and perfect serving size for lunch.

My other favorite; the Vegetarian Combo Platter. It had many of my Greek and Middle East favorites,Baba Ganoush,Hummus,Grape Leaves, Falafel, and seasoned flat bread.  I enjoyed this dish! Although the hummus doesn't measure up to Bon Chef Cafe's version (I so miss Chef Ash!)

The Zatar seasoning that chef makes and uses in a lot of the dishes here is awesome!!! It was meticulously sprinkled on each slice of my flatbread. I had to comment and ask what's the deal with the spice blend he used because it's different from the Greek and Middle Eastern places I've been to. I learned from Chef Manny that his spice blend included thyme,sesame seeds, and ..I forget..but whatever it is, I was diggin it! Also he said he uses mint leaves and mentioned that he used it in the Eggplant Salad that I had couple weeks ago..(whoa dude remembered me??... xtra cool point!!!). I have to note from talking with him, he really takes pride in what he makes. I so appreciate that it's all made from scratch. 

The Shrimp Kebab was also delish. A little confused though as to why it wasnt on a skewer. No biggie. It's nice that you can order it ala carte. And you can order the Beef, Chicken and Lamb kebabs too ala carte. 

The only thing I wasnt too crazy about is the Tzatziki sauce...I want to say it's sour cream based. Kinda bland and consistency was just too thick and rich for my taste. It's all good though because the spices used in the gyro meat made up for it. But still a tad disappointing. But with the many menu choices that there are I can live without it. 

They did a great job renovating the dining area. Smart use of space seating wise. Seems like a few more tables added than the previous tenants. (Fix8, Cino's, Lucca Deli)  Big plus to the TV  playing sports channel. I caught part of the baseball playoffs when I had a dinner break here.(Yay Giants!) 

Price for lunch I found reasonable. It's fast/casual dining. Order at counter and they'll bring your food out to you. Service was good.  I found the staff pretty friendly and was impressed that Chef remembers his customers. The times I was there, there were quite a few regulars already coming and going to this fairly new place. Easy going dining experience. Ive got no major issues. For sure in my lunch/dinner rotation. Imma Fan!!! Four Stars!"}
{"text":"This is my fav gyro place, the burgers are awesome as well. Friendly atmosphere and staff. Always going that extra mile to make your day. Thanks, Robert, Eric and Amber. You guys are the best!!!!"}
{"text":"Not enough flavor going on. the seasoned bread was good though!"}
{"text":"Came here for lunch today and I had the Sultans Sampler (baba ganoush, tabouli, hummus, and flat bread. 
Being Middle Eastern, I think I'm a pretty good judge of the above mentioned foods. :)
The hummus was good,the tabouli was good & lemony,but definitely could use more bulgur, the baba ganoush was pretty salty and not as \"whipped\" as I'd like..
The bread was okay but a little too seasoned. Overall the food tasted a bit to mass-produced and not very authentic or home cooking like. i've had the most amazing baba ghanouj and flatbreads at some mom-and-pop shops, was hoping since this isn't a large chain to have that similar experience.
Service was very good, the man behind the counter (I'm assuming is the owner) was very nice and gave me options since I am not a meat eater. I would bump my review up to four stars because of the service. But as for the food alone I give it three stars.
Café was clean and it smelled fresh inside. Plenty of options, and fresh baklava to boot. 
While my experience was not amazing, I will be back to try more vegan friendly menu items and get a better idea of my overall opinion on this place."}
{"text":"The tea was old and bad
The lamb was sour and tasted off \"not sure if it was rotten or maybe a sauce they used?\"
The lettuce was brown 
The gyro meat and rice came out cold
The entire place looked as if it hadn't been cleaned in weeks

I don't like to write bad reviews but i feel like people need to be warned about this place"}
{"text":"The Valley of Fire Gyro is sooooooo so good! If you like spicy then this is the dish for you!

I just moved to the area and stumbled on this place and I will ALWAYS go here when I need to get my Greek fix!"}
{"text":"Holy heavens, the best food ever!!! Love this place. Great service, amazing food, and awesome prices!!!! Love that they take such pride in the food that they serve!!!! Love it! I can't wait to go back his week!!!!!  

I get everything, everything is amazing!!! My favorites are the salads. The eggplant one is my absolute favorite."}
{"text":"Very impressed with the gyro seasoning. The chicken kabobs were excellent. I did see the cook wipe his face with his t-shirt and continue preparing meals. Other than that brief gross-out, the food was good. Buy some aprons and kerchiefs."}
{"text":"I'm always looking for a good Gyro. This place is probably my favorite. I love the pickled veggies too that come with the dinner platters. Also try their hot sauce. I'm surprised this place is not ALWAYS Packed. The service is AWESOME & really fast. We Really, really appreciate it! Me & my boyfriend will be back ( we work near by) ps i get the gyro platter, extra pickled veggiees& my boyfriend gets the gyro. The grape leaves are great too."}
{"text":"When it comes to food, I love fresh and not frozen. This establishment has fresh and delicious food. I recommend it highly."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite place! As well as a few of my friend's. We get the Valley of Fire Gyro. If you like spicy this is the way to go! The owner and workers are super nice, have great customer service, and always come to check on us to make sure everything's good. A few times they've even brought out a new feta cheese dip type tray with pita chips for us to try, which isn't on the menu yet. Soooo delish! This place is always fresh, has a large menu, and super decent prices. Highly recommend! =)"}
{"text":"This is a great place for a Greek fix. The Henderson location is new and they want to please. Counter service needs to become more knowledgeable of preparation of menu items, otherwise he was quite helpful. The cook delivered our entree and later came out to dining room to make sure all was well.
  We shared a combo plate, fries were seasoned and tastey, Chicken Shawarma and Gyro with fresh pita. They offer two types of taziki a thick and thin, make sure you order what you prefer. Hummus and Tabouli appetizer plate, Tabouli is different than I've had elsewhere, more green than wheat, made great compliment to meats on pita.
  Give it a try"}
{"text":"Originally trying to eat at Naga in the same complex we ended up here for lunch.  We were short on time and starving.  Sultan's Grill took care of us.  We both ordered the chicken schwarma with fries.  Food came out fast and tasted great.  I'm looking forward to coming back and trying a gyro or one of those hot dogs Gregg W. just posted."}
{"text":"First-time here and ate the chicken shwarama sandwich. Not knowing how much food I'd get and curiosity I added roasted red pepper hummus. The sandwich was so good I got lost in it &  forgot about the hummus! I then tried it and the rice that comes with the combo.  I was very happy with all the flavors and will definitely be back to explore more of the menu."}
{"text":"This place is great. Seems very clean and the staff was polite and attentive. My kids had the chicken strips/french fries while I had the gyro. Best gyro I've had around here. My husband had the valley fire gyro and we traded half way through he couldn't handle the heat but it was delicious. I'll definitely get that one in the future. We will definitely be going back, I whole heartedly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"Was excited for this place to open as we live middle eastern food and can walk here. Came in on a Friday night just before six. A few people were sitting down and there were two people ahead of us in line to Oder to- go. We ordered the gyros sandwich and gyro plate which says it comes with salad , choice of  fries or rice, and home made pickles. Can't believe we did not walk out as  we waited over 35 min for our two items. During our wait the cashier actually brought over someone else food as ours- honest mistake and she was nice about it- however it appears they are not prepared for even this small traffic. On top of the long wait- when we got home the gyro plate only has a salad- no rice or pickles. Also as others have noted the tsasiki  sauce was really bad as it rated like onion dip. The food selection is good but these folks need to get their act together if they are going to make it in an area where there are already many options"}
{"text":"We have been talking about trying Sultans Grill for a couple of weeks. Tonight we called in an order for pickup. They had our order ready in 15 minutes and were very helpful both on the phone and in person when we picked it up.

We both had the gyro platter. The meal was tasty and we will be going back to try additional items."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times and the staff has always been very friendly and welcoming. The food is great and the place is usually not too busy. However, I went yesterday on a Sunday and it was packed. The staff kept their cool though and still gave great customer service. Overall, it's a nice, family owned restaurant. I'll be here more often."}
{"text":"I try to grab a bite here at least every other week, it closes early so when I find time I come. I get something different every time I order and I've been very pleased with the food. I love their house dressing. It's so tangy I  have to get a salad every time! Their serving sizes are good too. You never feel hungry when you leave here but it's not an over abundance of food either. It's nice to have this type of food on this side of town."}
{"text":"Their web page ad looked interesting so we went last night about 7pm.  Ordered and paid at the counter...about 15min later a young man came to our table and said two of the  dinners that we ordered we not available....LAMB and BEEF ... we could have chicken.  We said we would try the restaurant at another time and just refund our money...he said we can't do that...we had a discussion about that and he gave us a receipt noting could be used when we come back....which was not acceptable but that was the most he was willing to do....BUT, he added...\" I don't know if it will be honored\".  When we called prior to coming to the restaurant, we asked if we could bring our own wine since they don't serve it....they said yes...BUT, when we got there they said they had no opener.....THE GOOD NEW IS...we left and went to the PASTA SHOP a few miles west of Sultan's on Horizon Ridge....WOW!!!!  beyond wonderful AND they had a wine opener.  In my opinion....this is not even worth a try even if you got  to dine there...absolutely no ambiance AT ALL...no friendly greeting...very brightly lit in neon lighting...two steps from busy parking lot ..just not appetizing."}
{"text":"Wanted to like this place because they deliver but cant. Delivery was super fast but the quality of food is not good. Chicken shwarma was more jerky than anything and loaded with pickled radish and diced onions. Gyro is beef only and had just tomatoes and onions and was meh if meh had a meh.  Fries where soggy. Only thing i enjoyed was the hummus.  Wont be ordering again sadly."}
{"text":"We visited for the first time today and we were impressed!! The gentleman at the counter was amazingly friendly and knowledgeable. The gyros were the best I've had in Vegas and my daughter loved the turkey burger!! So happy to have found this hidden treasure so close to home!!"}
{"text":"Today was my second visit there. I ordered:
-Shish Kafta
-Lunch Gyro Combo Platter
-Grape Leaves
-Sultan's Steak Style Fries

EVERYTHING was DELICIOUS!!
EVERYTHING was FRESH!!

The last time I came here, which was my first time, I had ordered the Vegetarian Combo Platter and a Turkish coffee...And it was also INCREDIBLE.

Customer service is EXCELLENT. I've only spoken to the cashiers--I've never met the owner--but the  cashiers are sweet, friendly, and conscientious of my time.

Back to the food though----WORTH EVERY CENT!! The Turkish coffee is especially good here. I'm looking to try their teas next time :)

UPDATE 5/29/15
Okay, so I'm officially ADDICTED to their food. Today I picked up a Lunch Gyro Combo Platter and a side of Grape Leaves. I'm about to slip into a delicious food coma, but before I do, let me update this real quick...

I must've come at a good time because a lot of the reviews from like six to seven months ago suck. I'm assuming that's when this place first opened here in Henderson. Either way, the establishment must have worked out most or all of the kinks by now because I seriously can't relate to what the older reviews say (must've been accurate at the time, but it's not the same now, trust me). I recommend the naysayers give this place another shot. I never eat in the restaurant--I usually order online via GrubHub, and it's ready in less than 15 minutes. The food I pick up is RIDICULOUSLY GOOD. Forreal, like I wouldn't be surprised if crack cocaine was one of their secret ingredients, cuz it's seriously delicious. If I ever do eat in the restaurant, I'd give their Snickers Kabob with Vanilla Ice Cream a try...That thing literally sounds like sex on a stick.

Also wanted to reiterate that customer service rocks! The cashier today double cupped my Turkish coffee (cuz it's always piping hot once it's ready) and included a couple sugar packets (I had bought their Turkish coffee before and he remembered I had asked about its sweetness). Seriously can't beat great food and customer service!!"}
{"text":"Yum! Super good food! The Shawarma and gyros are delish. My kids aren't big fans of Greek food, but they love their chicken and fries. Oddly good for a Greek place! Plus they let us have the remote to the Apple TV, so we turned on a kid movie. It was like we were home enjoying a meal I didn't have to prepare! The service is friendly and fast. Good for a quick weeknight dinner."}
{"text":"Love Love love gyros so I thought I would give Sultans a try.  Of course I ordered the gyro combo and was a little surprised to see it served in a toasted flour burrito which the ends were crunchy.  The cucumber sauce was also served on the side so I had to unwrap gyro to put spread on.  Meat was actually very tasty and if they go to the authentic pita with spread inside they will get a 5 star"}
{"text":"We order from here monthly and 50% of the time we wait 40 minutes plus for a \"10 minute\" pick up.  Seems like the help doesn't show and leaves a \"non cook\" cooking and one young lady running her self all over, mainly apologizing.  I noticed during these long waits the food isn't as good and usually under cooked gyro.  
After 6 experiences, may give one more and then done if things don't improve."}
{"text":"I work down near by, have for the last 2 months.  An when I get hungry I Yelp different foods like most people do.   So today I decided I would leave the office an get some Greek!  So glad I did!  If you like traditional Gyros they got a great one and on a large pita not the normally small ones.   Very good serving sizes on my combo, so much that I still have my piece of spinach pie that I haven't touched.   An if you like some spice in your life they have a Valley of Fire Gyro that has a kick of habanero and jalapeno that will leave your mouth doing flips.  Worth a stop to see what they got."}
{"text":"Ordered delivery on Sunday night at about 7. An hour and a half later, my food arrives cold and in a state of disarray. No drink and no pickled veggies. All in all I was missing about $8 worth of stuff. Third and last time I'll grab to-go or anything else from this spot."}
{"text":"The place just looks so unsanitary and the food wasn't good at all. The cashier wasn't friendly or anything!"}
{"text":"Got the dinner plater and there was enough food to feed a small army. The meat was tender and delicious, the rice was good, and the salad was crisp and fresh. My only complaint is the amount of raw onion in the tomato/onion salad mix. Little too much for my liking."}
{"text":"Had a coupon and visited tonight.  
Ordered a salad, gyro and sampler. 
Chicken shawarma had good flavor but was very dry, lettuce was crisp.
Gyro was decent, but as others have previously mentioned, the tzatziki was like sour cream not yogurt-y.
Didn't have very good flavor.
We also didn't care for the baba ghanoush, not enough garlic. The hummus was just meh, as was the tabouleh.

It would've been great if they were good, as not too many places to go around Henderson for Mediterranean food.

Not likely to be back."}
{"text":"I went here on the day it opened.  I was happy to try a new place and some great Greek food.  Overall the food was very good - shish kabobs were fabulous.  The meat was very tender and the price was very reasonable.  The only thing I would change is the pita bread.  It tasted sub-par.  If they would get better pitas - this place would get 5 stars from me!  Welcome to the neighborhood Sultan's Grill!"}
{"text":"So glad we finally got around to trying this place. It is so delicious!! The people working were so nice and helpful. They checked on us a few times during our meal and were so kind. The food was amazing! We ordered the stuffed grape leaves, gyro sandwich combo with fries and the gyro bowl. We had a $5 off coupon that came in the mail so our total was $17 and change. Well worth the money! The grape leaves were so good and not dry at all. They came with pickled beets and cabbage that was fantastic! I'd come back just for the beets. I ordered the gyro bowl which is all the fixings of the gyro sandwich but without the flat bread. I love that they offer this since I have had bariatric surgery and can't eat the flat bread. They gave me so much food! I ate it for three meals! The cucumber sauce was delicious. My only recommendation would be to put the sauce in a bigger cup. The sauce cups were a little small and I felt like I needed two since I planned to take most of my meal home. The hummus that came with the grape leaves was very large and we didn't end up eating it all. Maybe switch those two cups and it would be perfect. They gave warm pita with the grape leaves which our two year old loved. I have already told people about this place and I plan to return often. Delicious!"}
{"text":"This is a pretty good place to get delivery! Any time there was a mistake it has been corrected. I've even accidentally ordered it cash when it was supposed to be paid with card, and we were able to get it charged to my card at the door. Chicken kabob is delicious,very flavorful. Also I really love their cheeseburgers for some reason lol. Service and food are excellent."}
{"text":"Awesome! They deliver where we live. Great food. Amazing quality. Exceptional service"}
{"text":"Went here for their vegetarian options and I'm so glad I did. Their hummus is amazing and I eat it at least once a week. The pitas are fresh and delicious and my husband raved about his gyro. Plus, the prices are fantastic."}
{"text":"Stopped by to visit an old friend.  This place is super clean and friendly.  Robert took really awesome care of my family and made great recommendations.
The humus trio is to die for and the specials are definitely a pleasure to the pallets.  Best hummus in Nevada!
I will definitely return again."}
{"text":"I am super disappointed in my first experience with Sultan's Grill. Kinda to the point where I wish I could get my money back. I ordered the lunch portion shish kafta to go and added their small side of hummus. The total came out to almost 12 dollars which seems a little high to me, but i figured it'd be worth it if the food was good. Well it wasn't. When I got home I realized they didn't put utensils in the bag, not a huge deal but definitely irksome, especially for someone who isn't going home to eat. My first bite was of the rice and truthfully it was nothing special. Not very fluffy or flavorful but I sprinkled some salt on it and called it a day. I moved onto my pita and hummus and realized my pita bread was incredibly hard and chewy. The hummus kinda tastes like sabra store bought hummus. Not to say that its bad hummus, but I definitely expected more. The kafta is what is causing me to write this review. I went to go take a bite only to find that it was raw....for those of you who haven't had kafta, it's made from ground beef. So essentially Sultan's Grill served me RAW. GROUND.BEEF.  At this point, I didn't want to waste the $12 I spent, so I nuked the ground beef in the microwave and tried eating it. Bad idea, I probably should have just taken it back. The kafta itself had an off flavor to it and whether or not it was cooked properly, I have a feeling it would have tasted bad anyway. The only thing I actually liked from this place was their house salad dressing. It was really creamy and had great flavor. The lettuce was crisp so I ended up just eating the side salad. 

All in all, I don't know if I'll be back. There are good reviews for this place and it's really close to my house. But there are so many other Mediterranean/Greek restaurants that have much better food."}
{"text":"My coworker and I decided to visit this place for lunch since we were both craving some Mediterranean food. The service was fantastic. The guy at the register was super friendly and came to our table to make sure our food tasted good. The hummus was okay, I've had better but the Gyro was good. They had big chunks of red onion which I was a bit intimidated by since red onion is usually very strong. But when I bit into the gyro the onion was just a nice back flavor and very mild which I loved. The meat was tender and the pita bread was fresh. I will be going back to try some of their other dishes. The only other thing was the tzatziki sauce was mostly just yogurt. It didn't have the strong cucumber taste that tzatziki usually has. Other then that this place was very nice. I'll be going back to try some of their other dishes."}
{"text":"I have to start out saying I was planning on getting tropical smoothie when I randomly remembered this place and came here instead! And while it wasn't an awesome, knock your socks off experience, I'm still glad I came!

So I really wanted to love this place but my gyro just seemed a little off. It was super full of onions, which I hate; and kind of dry like it needed more yoghurt cucumber sauce. Additionally the pita seemed a little too dry (maybe old?) and hard on the edges. Regardless, the flavor of the beef was delicious as was the sauce. The steak fries were meh for me. 

The cashier, as noted, was super friendly and I want to like this place so I'll give it another try."}
{"text":"The customer service is great! And it's pretty much the only up to standard Greek place out here. It's great if you're really craving a gyro which is sometimes the case for me, but it's definitely not the best. The pits is not a great texture and the tzatziki sauce is really bland and watery like most people say on here. It really compromises the whole meal in my opinion but it gets 4 stars because it actually has really good food."}
{"text":"Outstanding!
The vegetarian platter was so full of flavor.
The pita bread was superbly seasoned and the pickled vegetables were an unexpected treat.

The gyro was good, the pita was hinner/more dense than I am used to but the sandwhich was good too. The meat was very well seasoned/cooked.

The gentleman at the register was very pleasant to deal with.

The prices are very reasonable for the portion size and quality."}
{"text":"Amazing!! My kids loved the Chicken Sharwarma with Rice!! You must try this for yourself to really appreciate the good food! The lamb chops are to die for and the beef Kabob is tender. Best gyros too !! Overall yummy food"}
{"text":"We wanted to try some place new so I took to my trusty pal Yelp to find a dinner spot. Jessie and I decided on Sultans Grill. 

It's located in a busy strip mall with a bunch of other restaurants and businesses. Henderson especially older Henderson lacks different restaurants that's why  I'm so happy a Mediterranean spot has turned up. 

Upon entering we were immediately greeted by their friendly staff. Jessie and I perused the menu and decided to split the Sultan's Sampler and we both got the standard Gyro. The Sultan's sampler was great! It had a little bit of everything. The babaganoush and hummus were excellent and had tons of flavor. Plus, the pita bread was super tasty too. It had pickled beets on our sampler plate as well. I loved the pickled taste with the pita and hummus! Great combo. Our Gyros were huge and full of meat. The  tzatziki sauce was different then I've had before it had more of a sour cream base. It was the only thing that I didn't like. 

Now what made me love this place even more may not be a big deal to most, but is a huge deal to me. They actually have two different diet sodas!!! Diet Coke & Diet Dr Pepper! This is a rare thing!! Kudos to you Sultans Grill!

Over all if you enjoy Mediterranean food you'll enjoy this spot! I can't wait to go back and try other items on their menu. Yummy!"}
{"text":"This place was terrible. The guy at the front got my order wrong, cause i wanted the beef and lamb kabob but got served chicken. Decided to try the chicken kabob and it was dry like the desert and pretty under seasoned. The pita bread was like chewy and hard. The rice served with the kabobs were pretty bland but cooked throughly. It came with a salad, romaine lettuce and cucumber (like you cant mess up a salad). WRONG! My salad came with an extra  something... A metal scrubbie wire. (Check the photos of proof) I didnt make a complaint as i already ate most of the meal but they didnt even bother to apologize.   

This place is like somewhat of a fast food restaurant but they use table cloths which is absurd to me. Beware that most if not all menu items are ONLY listed on the little takeout menu. Everything on the TV screen is LIE.

This plAce is truly 1 star only that the food is edible but i wouldnt even serve it for a school lunch. The prices for each item is also not justified by the amount of food they give and especially the TASTE. $11 for a chicken kabob dish is extreme but i like to give local businesses a try."}
{"text":"Always on point! Love that this place is a mile from home. Never had a bad meal. Greek salad with chicken Delish! Grape leaves awesome... I stop here prob once a week on my way home.."}
{"text":"Had an enjoyable experience here that will bring me back again. Plenty of food for not too much money, friendly service, casual atmosphere. Order at the counter and delivered to your table. Food was very tasty and fresh."}
{"text":"This is very close to where we live so we came in and gave it a try a couple of times. They have a huge menu and so far we have only tried a few things. And with what I've had I'm not all that impressed. I didn't like the flavor of the chicken but the lamb chops were delicious. The rice I got with it was bland and dry. We might come back and try something else since its close by but I've had better at other Mediterranean places."}
{"text":"Ok, so we ordered here tonight for the 3rd time.  And for the third time they screwed up my order.  The last time we ordered a hummus and tabouli sandwich adding chicken and they forgot the chicken but charged us the extra $3, this was the same thing that happened the 1st time we ordered from here.  They gave us a free sandwich each time they screwed up, but ended up screwing up what was supposed to be the fixer.  Anyways, tonight they messed up again.  Won't be going back.  The owner is the cook and said he was sure he didn't screw up the order and I told him I'd take a picture and send it to him to show him.  All he said was sorry.  Too bad, because besides from the constant order mistakes, the food is pretty good."}
{"text":"What I love about this place? Family owned and they deliver on grub hub! Great choices and the rice is yummmmy!"}
{"text":"Ehh it's alright definitely not authentic greek food , prob won't go back very blan, and they use sour cream to make tzatziki blah"}
{"text":"This place is very tasty! I always get the falafel sandwich which tastes fresh, I can't say anything for their meat dishes. Also their babaganoush is awesome! I tried using the 5% coupon shown on yelp, the cashier didn't know what it was but gave us a $5 off coupon instead which is better. Friendly service and they play Disney movies in the dining room ."}
