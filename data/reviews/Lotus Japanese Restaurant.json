{"text":"My family comes here often because it's cheap and quick. We usually come for lunch and get the specials like the chicken teriyaki for $7 ish.

Food here is just average.. not very authentic Japanese (the owners are Korean I think) but really there aren't too many places to get Japanese food in this area. The service is decent and attentive since there aren't usually other people in the restaurant.

Not a bad choice if you're looking for something cheap during lunch time. 

p.s. they are closed on Sundays!"}
{"text":"I used to love this place when I'd commute from Scarborough to Newmarket or when I had a car. It was your standard mom-and-pop shop with the sushi chef having worked behind the counter for many years, knowing his craft.

The portions were always great and the staff was accommodating, especially when for my ex-boyfriend's birthday in which the owner's daughter played \"happy birthday\" on the piano.

I'd have skipped the tempura, but the fish (especially the tuna) was always fresh and nicely portioned. Will definitely miss this place."}
{"text":"Good, fresh food (if a tad sweet at times) and excellent sashimi make for a pretty satisfying bite. The service is beyond reproach, very friendly and professional. The place is now cozier after a bit of remodeling not to mention spotless. It is one of my favorite spots in the neighbourhood, especially when I need my sashimi fix."}
{"text":"Aweful food! This is a Korean owned Japanese restaurant. Worst spicy salmon roll I've had. These were salmon rolls with a squirt of sweet kimchi tasting chilli sauce. It just tasted wrong. Rice was cold.
Bulgogi was dry. Salad was wilting. Soup was watered down. There was only one other table here at dinner time.  I will not come back here."}
{"text":"So i've noticed this place a couple of times, but have never gone. Did today and turns out it's non descriptively existed in the same spot for 6 years.

So my true test of a place is how good the quality of their sashimi is. I ordered a lunch bentox box sashimi combo.

What upset me was that it was not a bento box by any means, and i paid $15 with taxes for my lunch (steep).
But the sashimi was damn good. Top notch quality of salmon and tuna. 

The staff were friendly and accommodating for my mere take out order, but 
then again, it was lunch time and the place was empty.

While waiting, i checked out their menu which seems decent. Other lunch deals were a good price. Dinner was a little bit more (not a deal, but not that out there for regular sushi places). 

I've been to all the sushi places in the area. None are actually that good. Lotus feels a little better than all of them (except for maybe Mi-Ne) but it's location at the edge of the plaza makes it exactly how it's going to remain. non-descript and not out there making money.

I would or would not go back. It would have to depend on my mood. I would go back for take out."}
