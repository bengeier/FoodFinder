{"text":"Wonderful setting with outdoor seating on the Jacque Cartier Place. Good happy hour deals. Distractingly attractive staff. And amazing food!

Highly recommend the Jacque Cartier Poutine. Melt in your mouth short rib, enough rich, flavorful gravy to melt the (mild) cheese curds, and perfectly done fries. The Panda was not so happy with the lobster roll. Too much celery and the baguette used to cradle the filling just doesn't give the same experience as a New England lobster roll.

If I lived in Montreal this would be a regular haunt. C'est la vie..."}
{"text":"If it were possible to give zero stars I would. This is the first review I have ever written and quite possibly, ever will. Despite having had amazing meals, and some bad ones, I have never felt inspired to write a review...until now.
I visited Harlow on Monday, September 7th, for lunch and was astonished by the service, or lack thereof. We ordered the cheese curds to start which, in Harlow's defense, were quite good. The burgers we ordered were overcooked but I am willing to look beyond that.
The issue that I have is that the waiter never bothered to check in with us after taking the order. If he had, then I would have been able to tell him that there had been an insect in my beer for over twenty minutes. Furthermore, our waters had not been refilled in over thirty minutes.
It was not until a woman came by to refill our water glasses that I was able to ask for our waiter to bring the bill over. As far as I was concerned I did not want to stay there another minute than necessary. 
The woman that refilled our water glasses kindly brought the bill over and asked if everything was ok. I started explaining the situation to her, at which point, I made eye contact with the waiter who came over just long enough to say \"I'm sorry\" then walked away, leaving this poor woman with the mess that he caused.
Do yourself a favor and patron a restaurant where your money is valued."}
{"text":"Wow! What a gorgeous place! Everything is pink. Who doesn't love that? 
I work next door and often complain about the music levels being ridiculous and kind of give them a hard time about it... so I figured I had better try it out before telling my clients that they were dead to me if they stepped in that techno pumping pretentious pink douche hole. Turns out, the place is pretty snazzy. The food is good, the staff is great, the drinks are lovely. The music is still terrible, but I guess that's what people with spray tans like to listen to (an animal I can't comprehend). There's definitely a lot of luxury in this pace and there are certainly a lot of beautiful people. This is a pretty great place to go to show off, eat great food, drink expensive, delicious drinks and be sexy with all the other sexy Montreal socialites. It's a fun extravagant time."}
{"text":"We walked out.

  25 minutes and we hadn't even gotten our overpriced wine we had ordered. We didn't even get a glass of water.

The family behind us also walked out.  They are the most expensive in the square and you would think they could afford the staff to man the place."}
{"text":"Amazing dinner after being here a previous afternoon. Started with the porn star (belvedere, galliano, passion fruit & champagne. So decadent and delicious!! 

The service was impeccable. The young wait staff eager to please and knowledgable. Yellow fin crudo so fresh from the sea with Thai chiles, coriander sesame. 

My main was the Saffron black cod with caramelized onions & fennel, red pepper & smoked paprika pur√©e.  Indescribable!! So much better than it looks."}
{"text":"Beautiful space and excellent people working at Harlow. Cauliflower soup and trout were perfection. Had the Monroe and Jean Harlow cocktails and both were perfect as well. Great for a group or intimate dinner. Attracts a stylish crowd, good music."}
{"text":"Great eats for a crazy touristy area: 
-chic black decor
-beautiful staff 
-people watching without being elbow to elbow
-excellent lunch specials: crab cakes and trout on a bed of fresh salad greens for $24

Skip: iced tea, drenched in sugar 

Watch out for the bees.  Such a nice comfortable area to lunch, felt removed from the rest of the fanny packs and sneakers."}
{"text":"Beautiful crowd but the whole experience is not on point... Last time it ruined our evening. The food is good, but the service / organisation needs fine tuning.

I tried the place a few times.

Good : The tomahawlk & the pinnaple expresss
Bad : the pastas were... Mehhh."}
{"text":"Just had drinks, good beer selection and a nice vibe, a beautiful place."}
{"text":"Visited Harlow on a winter excursion to Montreal on a recommendation from our hotel. We arrived around 9pm without a reservation and they were able to accommodate. The decor was dark, really groovy wallpaper and collectibles. Our server was super attentive with what seemed to be server attendants supporting her service. I opted for a selection off the cocktail menu, the honey bear, and it did not disappoint. I went with one friend and we opted to order many small plates. We started with six oysters from Washington state that were okay, but the rest of the meal was really enjoyable. We ordered the side of Mamma's meatballs, served four medium size meatballs with marinara. The grilled veggie plate was also cooked to perfection, not too soft and well seasoned. The cod croquettes were my favorite, well paired aioli included. One of my most favorited parts was the great selection of hip hop and R&B that was played throughout dinner. I would for sure return here if I ever come back to MTL."}
{"text":"Bad Service and average food. Limited menu (brunch) - shrimp roll (shrimp salad in a hot dog) the most below average shrimp salad. Supermarket quality. The salad tasted bitter and was sent back, the server didn't come back to take the order! The table next to us waited for 15 mins with just 1 menu card between 6 adults. The manager did come by the table in the end to apologize and didn't charge for the salad, but by that time the server had done the damage. Sorry but would not recommend,"}
{"text":"*** DISCLAIMER *** I came here for the official launch party, not a regular evening.

The event was by invite only, you had to RSVP. I waltzed up to the door on a pretty darn cold night, gave my name, they checked their list twice and then I was in. The lovely ladies wearing fur coats at the door told me to saunter up to the bar and get myself some champagne.

Seemed strange to me to have an 8pm start time and people were scrambling to the coat check to leave, still, I offloaded my coat and went to get that champagne that I was told to get. I noticed that the place was full of some very fashionable folks but also a very high number of overly spray tanned, Mafioso-types that tend to frequent places like Cavalli...not really my crowd, but nonetheless, champagne conquers all!

I talked to the bartender about getting me that champagne and she asked me if I liked raspberries...umm yeah, who doesn't? She then said that she'd make me something nice. 3 minutes later, 2 raspberries and a blueberry were put on a skewer with some kind of juice, a small dollop of champagne and gin and voila, I was handed a bill for 28$!!! Are you freaking kidding me?

I will never, ever come back here. The space itself is lovely and well done, it's really a great respite away from the usual touristy junk that is Place Jacques-Cartier, but I'd rather drop 15$ at the W for a good cocktail and not worry about ruining a dress because someone with spray tan bumps into me and my 28$ cocktail at Harlow. 

I kind of have trouble blaming the restaurant fully for this, I think that the PR for the event was extremely poor and misleading as it made it sound like this was going to be an evening with a lovely dinner and champagne; I attend a lot of events and have no problem paying for my dinner and drink, but don't misrepresent your event as it reflects poorly upon your business and makes me not want to give you a second chance, recommend you or hold large corporate events in your space."}
