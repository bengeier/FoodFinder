{"text":"Not bad for a local pizza place. Pizza was ok, gyro was ok and fries were pretty good. Nice local atmosphere. Bar is connected. Nice meeting spot for friends."}
{"text":"When the owner is working this joint is spot on, lunch seems to be the best. When he is not around it tends to be a bit hit and miss. Good grub to go with the good beer selection next door."}
{"text":"Ordered 12 wings and they are so good! They let me get all flats and made them extra crispy for me! They also delivered me beer! It only took them about a half hour to bring my wings and they were super hot and yummy!"}
{"text":"I have ordered pizza and wings from Big Fella's a couple of times. Every time I do they are helpful when I place my to go order with the wing flavors and popular pizzas. The food is always hot when it is delivered and pretty fast. Also they deliver beer so how can you go wrong? I will continue to order!"}
{"text":"I haven't had anything on the menu that wasn't fantastic!!! The vegetarian pizza is to die for thro some feta on it and look out you will be hooked!! Great wings also try the
Jalape√±o and honey!! Off the  hook not to hot not to sweet right on the mark!! I could go on all day cause we order like twice a week from there and haven't been disappointed yet!!!"}
{"text":"Stopped by to have pizza and wings.  Waited in the bar area for our food.  The pizza and wings were good, but couldn't get past how that place wasn't clean.  The floor and restroom area are deplorable.  You can hardly see in the place due to the glass being so dirty.  This was my first visit and it's a shame that the food is really good but it's just a dirty establishment."}
{"text":"Been coming here since the beginning, AWSOME PIZZA...LOVE the WINGS and BLT HOAGIES. When I order food for delivery, it arrives VERY FAST and HOT....My GO TO place in town. Sean & Bob run a GREAT business with COURTEOUS and AWESOME employees. Fan for LIFE...."}
{"text":"The pizza I'g give 2 stars at best... I like the square-ness of it but that crust is just so thick!! I have yet to find a nice, thin, crispy crust anywhere in the Pittsburgh area. It's like eating a loaf of bread with a little sauce & cheese. The Hawaiian itself wasn't great anyways; weird, thin ham covering the entire slice. Sauce is good. Cheese is even better. But the wings were great. I'd even give them 5 stars. I ordered them extra well done, I just prefer it that way. The honey garlic sauce was awesome. And the Jamaican jerk rub, after a little getting used to, was surprisingly good as well. So 3 stars total. Yes on wings. No on pizza."}
{"text":"This place has really gone downhill. They used to have great pizza and wings. Now they serve cold pizza and dried out wings. We went into the store, ordered, and sat an waited for carry-out. The food was cold by the time we got it. They just let it sit on the counter and forgot it was there. When the manager was confronted by this she was defensive and unapologetic for the service."}
{"text":"I enjoy going here for the food, it's very good and the staff is very nice.  I think the wings are great and the pizza is too.  As other's have said, the menu is huge, something for everyone www.bigfellaswings.com"}
{"text":"Big Fella's is a popular lunch spot for my coworkers and I during the work week. It's quick, cheap, and pretty tasty. The inside is pretty bare, some older looking tables and artwork on the wall, & 2-3 people rotation between cleaning, taking orders, and cooking. 

They are a pretty standard hoagie, wings, pizza place. The lunch special is pretty popular, a hoagie with fries and a drink for $7.99. Their breadsticks are my favorite, so I'll sub breadsticks for fries (a little extra cost) when they let me! Sometimes the food doesn't taste the freshest, but they are a solid spot to stop for a quick, cheap, and filling lunch!"}
{"text":"Stromboli was pretty good, wings ok. Mediocre prices."}
{"text":"Awesome antipasto salad!! I suggest getting the Greek dressing with it! We also got the Cajun chicken hoagie and the meatball hoagie and they were delicious!!! Big Fella' also offers delivery, which is a rarity in Canonsburg!"}
{"text":"I came here for lunch the other day with my girlfriend and I was not impressed at all. To start I wanted the Ruben turns out they don't make them anymore. So already there menu needs updated. Next off I ordered the gyro and she got a small pepperoni pizza. And a side of wings to share. The gyro came with three slices of meat way overload on the lettuce and the sauce tasted old. The pizza was very plane the sauce had no taste to it. This place says to have \"the best buffalo wings\" well that's a joke the wings where so tiny and way over cooked. I was not happy with my first experience here and I will not be returning."}
{"text":"The food here is good, and the prices are pretty much average.  They do have a wide variety of different menu items.  In fact, it is almost over overwhelmingly awesome the amount of choices they have on their menu.  The cheese on my garlic parm wings wasn't the best I have ever had, but they were still pretty good.  The pizza and salad was good also.  If you want some bar food or pizza and wings, stop in here rather than going to a franchise.  I think you'll enjoy the local stop here more."}
