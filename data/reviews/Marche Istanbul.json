{"text":"this place has been around for a while. we used to go to the one in montreal, and now that they have one in toronto, i'm very happy!

this is purely a turkish imports store. and they do a great job at that. it's all the tastes i grew up with. both sucuk and pastirma are delicious. so are the cheeses. however they are a little on the pricey side.

if you're looking for authentic turkish ingredients, this is your place."}
{"text":"My Turkish husband was told about this place and it's the only place we like to go to get his favourite foods and teas such as sucuk, great selection of cheese, and other imports, spices etc. There are also many packaged foods that can help the cook who is not so familiar to the dishes.
The owner is so friendly and helpful. The store is small but well stocked and very clean.
If you want authentic ingredients this is the place to shop and you will enjoy the experience."}
{"text":"This is a nice grocery with various goods and food from Turkish cuisine. Space is clean. Prices are okay. Staff is kind. I definitely recommend it."}
{"text":"I like the place, almost every turkish thing that you may need in your kitchen can be found here. Kashar cheese, turkish seasonings ( although i could not find otoman seasing), simits are delicious."}
{"text":"This used to be my go to place for Turkish groceries till an alternate opened up in danforth that is more accessible.
Good variety of Turkish items and decent selection of cheese. Their selection of sujjuck (Turkish pepperoni) is somewhat limited as they had only two options on my last visit. They have a dedicated freezer for house made batsrama and sujuck which is a great thing.
Good options for olives including some prepackaged ones which I enjoy quite a bit. They carry the some stove top Turkish tea and coffee makers. 
A decent ethnic store IMO though I wish they had a bigger store."}
{"text":"Just took a Turkish friend of mine to this nice, clean well-run place. It is close to Yorkdale, and features almost exclusively Turkish imports. They claim that they have 'authentic' soujouk (my friend bought some), but the reviews are not in.

They have the best Turkish kefta mix to flavour ground beef, or better yet a mixture of beef and lamb. If you are a jam or Honey lover, you should try some of the Turkish Jams, as they are almost as well known as the Attiki Honey from Greece and just as delicious.

They have a good selection of both olives, and olive oils and their prices are reasonable. They also sell a few turkish gift items, the most known of which is the ceramic 'eye' that chase bad fortune.

They have a sister store in Montreal which I have never visited."}
