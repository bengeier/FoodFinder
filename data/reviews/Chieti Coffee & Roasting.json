{"text":"I have this cafe on speed dial!  I call them on my way to work all the time and make my order to pick up -- way better than waiting in line at those other coffee places.  They have great prices and a great selection of coffee and tea. They offer a breakfast and lunch menu, and they deliver when they have the available staff. Their mocha lattes are the best I've had anywhere, and I always get one of their awesome muffins."}
{"text":"Delicious decaf Frappuccino\"s and Latte's! The muffins are to die for...especially the Butterscotch Rum and the Apple Muffins.  The staff and the owner is friendly. The owner offered us two complimentary muffins because we had to wait longer to get our coffee drinks due to them being short-staffed. Great place to relax and enjoy your coffee...enjoy a meal or a treat...chat with friends...study or just bum-off their wi-fi. They do have their busy times so...just be patient and you will be deliciously rewarded."}
{"text":"NOPE! NO NO NO NOPE!   This was an absolutely horrible experience.   My friend and I stopped by here out of curiosity. Well, that's the last time we let our curiosity make decisions... No, just kidding. Then how would we ~live life~?   So, you know how it says \"bakery\" on it, right? When we went in, there wasn't much in the baked goods. The guy's excuse at the counter? \"Uh, well what time is it? Like 6pm? We make all out stuff in the morning. What do you expect?\"  Snarky, eh? Well, he didn't get a tip.  The coffee. Cold cold cold. It wasn't good at all. The cream was empty and the sugar and milk area was unkempt.  Ice tea? I think I ordered the \"Passion Fruit Iced Tea\". He didn't even know what bag to pull. Seriously, man? I know you were joking about smoking a little somethin' on the side, but REALLY?  On top of that, there was another man that ordered coffee. The other employee just kind of wandered around the store holding it. He gave up finding him (THE PLACE ONLY HAD LIKE, 5 PEOPLE IN IT) and set it on the counter. The man was upset, his coffee was cold also. So they brewed a new one just for him.   Please avoid this place. It was not worth it. There's a Del Taco in the same mall. I'd rather have a taco over this place any day."}
{"text":"I went here to see the coffee roasting equipment and green coffee beans. The owner was very friendly and took the time to discuss the roasting techniques used and had some green coffee beans available for purchase which is very difficult to find locally in Las Vegas.  The owner went out of his way to provide a variety of different coffees for me to taste. I ended up going with the Guatamalan coffee beans over Columbian or Brazillian beans but Columbian was good as well.  The muffins there are made fresh daily and very tasty. I've roasted the coffee beans twice already and it has turned out wonderful with no bitterness and goes down smooth.  They are moving to a larger location soon which I have not seen yet but would like to recommend based on my experience so far at previous location.  A+"}
{"text":"I always forget about this place, probably because it's in such an unassuming location. A friend and I had lunch there today and she is a regular patron so she ordered. We split a 12\" eggplant sandwich Pannini style and shared a pot of oolong tea. Awesome! We sat in those cushy chairs which probably isn't a good idea for lunch. Way too comfy! The staff was very helpful and stopped by to apologize for the wait - but we already knew that making a good eggplant sandwich from scratch takes a little while. Having our own little pot of tea on a warmer and served with nice cups was a real treat. I love tea so I could spend a day there working my way through the menu. If you're looking for an alternative to Starbucks where you can relax, chat, work, study, or meet friends this is a great choice."}
{"text":"Nice whole in the wall place I found after my Burlington shopping.  Walked in and diner music playing. Great vibe. Wifi weak or just not strong enough.  Great selection of eats, tea and coffee.  Even ice cream. The also roast coffee and grind fresh. Muffins are moist. I would come back again. They are closed Sundays.  Clean and spacious."}
{"text":"I came here on a weekday morning for coffee and a muffin. The coffee was good but the muffin was too sweet. The staff was really nice. I personally did not like the seating area; it feels too dark."}
{"text":"Went there this morning and their coffee is so deep and rich tasting with a hint of chocolate. Seriously some of the best coffee I have tasted. I also tried the croissant which was hot out if the oven. It was buttery and light very flaky. It melted in my mouth. I very much enjoyed this place and look forward to trying their lunch menu!"}
{"text":"Wow, I really hate to have to update reviews and especially when it is to provide negative input on a previously positive review.  I just got back from Vegas (again), where I visit frequently, and as promised in my last review, made sure to stop by Chieti's.  I really wish I had not.  Being that I am on a strict, no carb, no sugar diet, I went in and asked if I could get a sugar free frappacino and was told I could get one in hazelnut or regular coffee flavor.  So I ordered a regular coffee and was super excited.  However, as soon as I took the first gulf off the straw, I knew there was no way that drink was sugar free, because it was sweet and I hadn't added splenda yet.  I went back and told them so and they said, \"Oh, what you're tasting is our frap mix.\".    \"So it's not sugar free then?\" I asked,   \"No, we can't do them sugar free entirely.\"  WTF.  What if I had been diabetic?  Are you trying to kill someone?    Unfortunately for me or them, or whomever, I don't take idiots well, and that's what that entire situation was.  Idiotic and lazy.  Three girls working the counter and none of them know what they are doing.  Sigh.....I should probably give them another try, but honestly, they are so far from where I stay in Vegas that I have to make a special trip and I just don't know if I'm willing to do that since there is a Starbucks a block from my house.  What happened to the cool helpful guy with the ponytail?  Lame."}
{"text":"Writing this review from the cafe itself- loving the free and fast wifi, which will be excellent as I wait for my home internet to get turned on later this week.   I'm not a huge coffee fan, but my skinny caramel vanilla latte gets made quick and hot and I love the huge selection of food here! Breakfast sandwiches and paninis, toast and jam, yogurts and parfaits, along with smoothies and pastries-- and that's just their breakfast options! Various subs, sandwiches, soups, salads, and even pastas are available for lunch and dinner. Heads up, the sandwiches are huge.  Services is friendly, wifi info is on menu board by register, and seating/dining area is spacious and well decorated-  I especially like the couches and leather chairs, and the potted fake cactuses in coffee beans on the tables! Very cute.  Will have to come back here and try foods, then update my review accordingly."}
{"text":"If you didn't know where this place is, you might miss it. I didn't know it even existed until I saw it on a magazine as one of the best coffee shops in Las Vegas. I just had an flavored iced coffee with Colombian beans and it had a great flavor. They also had some pastries but didn't get to try them. Will go back to check them out.   Their space is really good also if you need to get some work done. When I went, it wasn't very busy. Clean and relaxing."}
{"text":"Cute and unassuming.  I wasn't blown away by my cappuccino (any place that offers 16 oz and 20 oz sizes makes me suspicious) but it was better than I expected, cynic that I am.  My coffee wasn't bitter, but it didn't have a memorable zing to the taste.  Maybe too much milk?  I was actually famished, as I had just biked 30 miles and my ham sandwich was devoured in seconds.  It was good.  The decor is nice, nothing to write home about, but the place is large with a goodly amount of seats and is clean.  Bonus points for roasting their own coffee, but I'm hesitant to give this place a full 5 stars, if only because of my average 16 oz cappuccino."}
{"text":"Fantastic coffee and tea. Service is slow (mainly due to being perpetually short staffed) but always cheerful and helpful. Comfy chairs and arrangement of space is great for group meetings for school.   The muffins and pastries are made in house and are perfectly moist and flavored.   If you are interested in quality, I have yet to find a better coffee or tea place. If you are in a rush go somewhere else and come back when you have a little time to savor."}
{"text":"Staff are all very friendly, good traditional muffin. Those pastries looked good too, but I'd save them for my next visit. Their iced coffee is Amazing! Very smooth, sharp yet rich tasting. Can't wait to go back! This place is my new AM Joe go-to possible."}
{"text":"Ok this place has a certain cozy charm and the coffee is pretty good but service is SLOW. The place was empty when I ordered a panini. It took almost 15 mins to get it. The three employees behind the counter were nice but in no hurry to make my order. The food is good, but don't come in a rush or you will be frustrated."}
{"text":"Fast Wifi, good food, fresh roasted coffee, all types of caffeine drinks, desserts, and lots of space to spread out and study or chat with friends.  One of the best coffee houses in Vegas that I have found."}
{"text":"Every. Single. Time. I come here the service is AWFUL! Not exaggerating. Not once, not twice, not three or four but multiple! If I didn't come to this shopping center I would never come back. I don't know who runs this place but they hire the same idiots over and over again. I'm not too picky but when I order a bagel and cream cheese I don't expect you to put it in a box right out of the case and give it to me. You toast it first then put cream cheese on it, right?? Wow. I'm utterly dumbfounded by their inability to offer any sort of service. Its always slow. Consistently slow. Maybe if you hire compitent  people your employee turnover wouldn't be so high and you would have more business! Just sayin.."}
{"text":"Waited 15 minutes for my iced cafe mocha. On top of that took another 15ml minutes for my sub & bread bowl soup to come out. Were they busy? Nope. Was it worth waiting? Not quite. I really wanted to leave and I usually would but I paid already so BOO. But food and coffee was decent enough to feed my starving face. Tummy is full and I guess it wasn't all that bad after all. They just need proper training. That is all."}
{"text":"Four of us met here last night for our Yelp Book Club meeting.  This was a very pleasant place to have the meeting.  We had a large table with comfortable chairs to hold our books and our drinks.  There were enough chairs and tables that we could have added more space if more readers had attended.  The only drawback was getting the drink I wanted which is an important thing.  I ordered an iced mocha and the young man behind the counter had this blank expression on his face of, \"What?\"  Eventually, he got the manager/owner(?) who was seated with some people with whom it appeared he was discussing business.  My drink was eventually ready and it was tasty.  A bit more pricey than some competitors, but good nonetheless.  The same routine played out during the evening as more people came in.  An order was placed, a blank look ensued, and the manager had to come over and help with getting the drink done.  It was a hoot!  I would have given this only 2 stars but it was such a good spot for our meeting that I award the extra star.  I may stop by again because the sandwiches on their menu board looked good and it is probably a great lunch stop."}
{"text":"Amazing place!!!!!!!! Great place to study, they give student discounts!!!  Coffee, pastries, sandwiches, smoothies, ICE CREAM, and DESSERTS... How can you go wrong? Plus, free wifi!!! And they roast their own coffee here! This is awesome! Cute set up, comfy atmosphere, and mellow music. Love this place!"}
{"text":"They have a siphon brewer for coffee, if you haven't tried this method before they are worth checking out just to try the siphon. Roast beans in house too. If you happen to be near by it is better than going to starbucks.   Good coffee and plenty of space to sit. This is a coffee shop that harks back to the 90s, with a menu to match. Traditional flavors and drinks.  Despite what the large signs oustide say, they no longer serve food."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a coffee while my car is being worked on at the Nissan across the street. The outside is deceptive.It's an older part of town, not bad, not sparkling new. The inside is gorgeous. Tons of chairs, tables & couch seating areas in warm colors. I got a caramel macchiato & it was seriously perfect even through my sniffle-dulled olfactory issues. They have a deli & sitting back with my java I got to watch the chefs go about making the day's bread & pastries. The toasted croissant couldn't have been luxurious draped in Godiva. They cater, deliver & stock bulk cafe items. Great place to start the day."}
{"text":"Well, I came here for breakfast with my children, I had hoped for sandwiches along with our drinks,  alas, I was advised they stopped serving sandwiches 2 months ago. I think they are understaffed. Son loved his croissant and it was very tasty, but their bagel looked like it might dislodge my daughter's loose tooth. The bagel looked like store bought. Peach smoothie delish, caramel frap surprisingly not sweet enough on its own.  My praline latte, meh.  I'll be back to try more and for croissants."}
{"text":"First time... Was very impressed.  The atmosphere is amazing.  Was there for a presentation & the staff were so accommodating & very friendly.  My cappuccino was delicious.  A friend had a lychee tea & said it was good.  Another had butter pecan ice cream & raved about it.  Wish it was closer to me but I'd definitely go again!"}
{"text":"I came to this location after a quick stop at the Berlington Coat factory next door. I honestly wasnt overly impressed with this place. I felt the staff was friendly, but the only bottled water they carry is sparkaling water. The staff seemed unaware that sparkling water and flat water are not the same thing. I ended up getting a hot tea which was WAY too hot to drink for over an hour in their cups. I paid $3, which is the average tea price. But, they had no honey.   I dont think I would head back for tea, but maybe I would try another drink there."}
{"text":"Great coffee house with food selections and wifi."}
{"text":"I've never noticed this place before, until a recent trip next door to Burlington. I came for some libations with friends after shopping.   I got a soy ice chai latte. It was fine, just a bit heavy on the cinnamon spice in it so I wasn't a particular fan of this chai, but it was prepared well enough.   The one thing that is cool about this place is they have a selection of whole coffee beans and can fresh grind coffee by the pound and also had a good selection of whole leaf teas for sale. Of course, you can get these same beans and teas in their drinks so you get a lot of selections in that aspect compared to most coffee shops.  This place is rather large and wasn't busy. It's a good quiet place for those looking for a work study place away from the popular crowded spots.   I'll probably try it again and give a chance to more of their drink selections involving the said coffee or teas. The chai wasn't my particular jam, but perhaps something else on the menu will be wonderful."}
{"text":"Love this place.  Delicious food, huge servings, great tea and coffee, nice staff. Simply good place to stop by.  It is so romantic and I love to stop for tea with my wife."}
{"text":"It's a quiet spot, but plenty of table & chairs for groups. Yet, it has comfy chairs pulled up to coffee table, just the right size to eat your sandwich or use it to bring your laptop to work/study."}
{"text":"We wandered in after dropping the car off at the dealership.  What a charming place - very unexpected for the neighborhood.   - Coffee is rich and full bodied.. We had a dark roast and a medium but they offer many types of coffee and tea - The freshly baked pastries were heavenly. We tried a hazelnut and sour cherry  Try this place out!"}
{"text":"This place is great! They have so many different coffee drinks and tea combinations.  The staff is really friendly and go above and beyond when it comes to customer service.  I work near by and can't get out of the office much to get there but they're kind enough to bring me my favorite coffee and a delicious croissant.  They have great muffins and other food items all made in house as well.  Happy to have found them:)"}
{"text":"Chieti is a fabulous find! Tucked away in a little corner of a sleepy shopping center.... I've lived around the corner from it and never knew that it existed!!  They have great coffee... roast their own beans.  And the barista's are so friendly!!  My Cycling group use it as a start / ending place for some of our rides and they ALWAYS greet us with smiles and great service.  LOVE the big, comfy chairs, too!  VERY sweet on the tush after 35 miles!!  We're already planning our next ride from there... Just so that we can enjoy the coffee!"}
{"text":"Some of the best coffee I have ever had in my life! It's delicious without an overpowering [bold] taste. I tried it once and have been hooked ever since. My co-workers and I drink the latte's and frappucino (is that how you spell it?) at least 3x a week. They will deliver with $15 min if your are in close radius. The pastries and bagels are amazing and the croissants are so buttery and flaky! What a sin to be so delicious"}
{"text":"I am so happy this place came to our neighborhood! We needed it. Everything is so fresh and delicious. I stopped in at 6 a.m. today and they were roasting the coffee right on site and baking the bread! It is so warm and welcoming. What a great place to just sit and read a book with your coffee and pastry. My husband and I ride our bikes there on Sunday mornings for breakfast."}
{"text":"As far as coffee goes, this is the best coffee I've ever had! Wish I lived closer! I love the Toffee Nut Latte iced. Delicious"}
