{"text":"This is one of the places we were taken to when visiting Pittsburgh and trying to decide whether or not to move here. I can't claim that this place is the reason we're here, but we certainly do love it. They have great Challah and seasonal breads. When I lived in Seattle my mom would actually send me Challah from Loafers and all my friends would be jealous :-)"}
{"text":"This place used to be my favorite. But the staff is not friendly at all! They don't even great you when you walk in. They just stand there and look at you. 

It's like you are troubling them! 

Sandwiches are ok but expensive.


Bread is good but not bursting with flavor. When getting sandwiches make sure you ask for thick cut bread. Otherwise you may get paper thin bread. 

It's just a shame because they have such a great location and I'd go here once a week. But I'm just so turned off by the poor rude service!"}
{"text":"Absolutely delicious and unique assortment of fresh baked bread, muffins, scones, cookies, you get the idea. They're also a mill so they mill their own flour!  Salads, soups and sandwiches too. Pumpkin bread and cinnamon swirl are must try's!"}
{"text":"A-ok. Came here on a Saturday morning while we were waiting for our car to get inspected across the street. This place reminded me of a small-time Panera Bread. They have a variety of breads, pastries, and sandwiches. 

While I have no complaints, I also don't have any compliments. I ordered the breakfast sandwich and the hubby ordered a turkey bacon sandwich. We also got a lemon blueberry scone. The sandwiches were okay, nothing I couldn't make at home and the scone was just alright. 

Everything was just average for me."}
{"text":"My favorite find since I moved down here! The staff is always friendly and helpful! They are knowledgeable about their products and are quick to offer suggestions when I'm unsure of what to get. The breads are always fresh and delicious and sweets always hit the spot! Definitely a great local business. You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"The bread was fine.  The customer service at the Freeport Road location left a lot to be desired.  I made a point of saying that I had never been there before so it would have been a great time to make a sale.  The person who waited on me just stared at me and could just barely be bothered, so I bought a loaf and left.  I would like to go to another store at some point, but I won't rush"}
{"text":"I've gotten lunch from here a few times .. never disappointed. Tuna and chicken salads are yummy and freshly home made. The breads are fresh and wonderful. Sandwich might be a little more stuffed..but I come from NY and am used to deli sandwiches. I will keep coming here and getting lunches"}
{"text":"Love this place! The bread and pastries are amazing. The chicken salad sandwich is just delicious. The lunchtime staff are so nice and accommodating. Excellent customer service at this location. Can't wait to try breakfast."}
