{"text":"I am thoroughly impressed by this exotic Egyptian cafe. Has catering and in-house menu."}
{"text":"I'm in town for work and stumbled upon Luxor Emporium Cafe on Yelp.  It's a cute little spot on the southeast corner of 7th and 9th.  The chicken kebab and rice was delicious and the perfect portion size.  The side of taboulleh was very fresh and accompanied the kebab perfectly.  The only downside was the temperature in the dining area.  It was quite warm, but not enough to prevent me from enjoying my meal.  I'd really like to go back and try a few other things on their menu!"}
{"text":"Fabulous food with skimpy portions is the fare if you choose to eat in. I always leave feeling hungry. Howver, if you are looking for take away with bang for the buck, then they are it as far as Middle Eastern food downtown is concerned. If you are willing to spend the extra money for a good fill, you will be amazed at the quality of what graces your table. The service is excellent to boot. This is not a place for coffee, what's served is abominable.  I miss the Brentwood location which was within walking distance for me."}
{"text":"I've never stayed for a meal, but their hummous is the best I've found in Calgary.  I used to drop by once or twice a week for a medium container (way better value than a large container); sometimes I'd get some fresh pita bread as well.  If you've been buying pre-packaged hummous from Safeway, Superstore or Costco, make a point of picking some up at Luxor next time you're downtown."}
{"text":"I'll be honest with you. I've been to Luxor about 5 times and 4 out of the 5 times, I went there for their baklava. What I love about the baklava at Luxor is that it's fresh and you can buy a box of it to go. I usually go there when I'm headed over to someone's place for dinner and I want to bring a creative dessert/gift along with me.  I did go to Luxor once for their falafel. It was alright. it wasn't the best I've ever had. Since though, I've been back for their baklava and will continue to do so."}
{"text":"The first time I went to the Luxor was on an awkward sort-of date - he wanted to go on a picnic in the park, I wanted to just be friends, and dragged him to the closest \"least romantic\" place that still looked decent that I could find. I was really impressed, actually. It was completely business with nice neat tables and a clean, colourful atmosphere - no romance in sight. Excellent.   The baklava were sweet, flakey and delicious. I got some hummus and pita, but everything looked tasty. The kebabs looked fresh and delicious, and because it is also a deli it is super easy to take things to go! All in all, I'd go back for coffee or an informal business lunch, and I'd definitely drop by for snacks on my way home."}
{"text":"My friend introduced me to this restaurant and once the owner found out it was my first time there, she made it a point to acquaint me with Egyptian and Mediterranean food.  We started off with an eggplant dish and had some very tasty chicken kebobs.  She frequented the table often and was so personable; I swear I would like to go back.  She had such pride in her family's restaurant and was very insistent that I come back.  There is also a takeout section of this restaurant and they are very open to catering your private party. You just have to call before hand to make the reservation.   Definitely the winner of all the food items there is the baklava, this I took home in a box.  Expect delicious exotic meals, with great service and good prices.  Luxor is also downtown so it's very easy to get to."}
