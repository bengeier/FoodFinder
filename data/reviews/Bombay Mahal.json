{"text":"Vraiment bon, le poulet Korma absolument délicieux! Avec une bonne bouteille de vin c'est parfait!"}
{"text":"Just a warning for vegetarians: the Vegetarian Biryani I ordered had a big piece of chicken in it. 

I also wasn't at all impressed with where we were seated. People kept on bumping into my arm as I was eating and having people who are waiting in line stare at me while I eat isn't at all pleasant."}
{"text":"We ordered the butter chicken. Creamy and rich and one of those things with a deceiving name. Butter chicken contains no butter, like the chickpea, where it is neither chick nor pea, but unlike Chop Suey, chopped and busting with suey.


Lamb Korma. Not gamey at all as the yogurt marinade probably cuts most of it out even though the bone is still in.


Chicken Jalfraizi. Really really fragrant and a bit tangy. The chicken was a bit dry as I can imagine white meat was used, but would have probably tasted a lot better had they used dark meat."}
{"text":"Great food. The balance in flavors is really delicious. Really friendly service too. Would definitely recommend this restaurant."}
{"text":"Tasty and cheap Indian food. I had vegetables jalfrezi and butter chicken. The butter chicken was tender and sweet, the vegetables were spicy enough. And they deliver! I will definitely order again!"}
{"text":"Well. I've heard soooo much about this place, so I was super amped and brought a friend with me before we headed off to a party. What a disappointment in every way.

Ambiance: None. It's loud. The decor is tacky, and dirty. There's two rooms in which everyone is squished like sardines. Sidenote: I wouldn't mind this if the food was delicious (see Kazu for example).

We were asked in line that if we are out in less than an hour we could be seated because there was a reservation at our table. We agreed as we had somewhere to be. We sat down and I got the chicken thali and my friend got the lamb vindaloo. I am a newly formed still-rare occasion meat eater, but I do know what good meat tastes like. The chicken in all my dishes was dry, rubbery and without flavour. The chicken tikka was dry and tasted like it was frozen for years before coming out of hiding. The sauces were boring, metallic tasting and dulled the palate. The rice was the only thing that was edible. I didn't even finish my butter chicken (?!) because it was that disgusting, and I'm poor so I never want to waste food and will usually eat people's leftovers. My friend's vindaloo was also questionable and he was pretty disappointed I took him to such a dump.

I will say that the pakoras and their sauce was delicious, even if too greasy, saved the night.

Seriously, how do people give this good ratings? I grew up in Toronto where I ate at many Indian homes and have a plethora of delicious Indian restos to consume, so maybe that's why?

I went to another place on Jean Talon that has high reviews, and it was much better than this but definitely forgettable and not worthy of repeat visits. 

Oh, and then there was a line up to pay. Seriously."}
{"text":"Best Indian food, period.  We drive all the way from Ottawa for a piece of this authentic experience and often bring some of it home to freeze for later.  We've tried the other top rated Indian food restaurant in Montreal, and none even came close.  We've loved every single dish we've tried there, but with our top favourite being the Chili paneer, followed by (not in any particular order) the Palak, Shahi (A bit too sweet, but still delicious), and Mutter paneers, Baingan Bharta (oily, but very flavourful), Veg korma (YUM), Chana Masala, and Daal Makhni.

Oh, and the prices are very reasonable! $7.99-10.99 per curry dish, with most dishes being $7.99. (I speak for the vegetarian curries, I am not sure about meat ones).

If you don't know what to order, try their Thali's which come with 3 different curries, naan and salad.  The Naan is always fresh and piping hot.  Service tends to be quick.  What's not quick is waiting in line and getting a table - it gets jam packed on weekends, with the line sometimes going out the door.

You can bring your own wine here too.

Tip: Order ahead and pick up to avoid the long wait for the table and super crowded/noisy restaurant on the weekends."}
{"text":"Love this indian restaurant. Service is great and food is astonishing. Prices are alright you do eat a lot for what you pay for."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant Indien, bon, pas chers, mais pas très beau. On y manque collez sur les autres tables, le service ce fait seulement en anglais, mais  sa fait le charme de l'endroit ! Et en plus ces apporter votre vin !"}
{"text":"Last night our 'kids' took us out for a birthday dinner to this wonderful and very very busy Indian restaurant on Jean Talon in what is 'unofficially' India Town in Montreal.  I have to admit I am a huge fan of this cuisine and was looking forward to trying this particular restaurant.  It is BYOB so we arrived bottles in hand but were disappointed to find a long lineup almost out the door. The owner assured us it would not be more than 15-20 minutes so we waited and he was true to his word....and it was well worth the wait.  The menu is long and varied and we ordered from almost  every section of the menu. The Daal soup was only okay but everything after that just got better and better.  The pakoras, bhazi and samosa were all excellent as was the yogurt based sauce.   We tried 4 different chicken dishes, one lamb, and two vegetarian dishes.  All were absolutely wonderful but the standout dish was definitely the Baingan Bharta which is a smoked eggplant dish.  All 6 of us at the table are serious carnivores, so this dish was a surprise to all of us. It was incredible!  The naan bread, both plain and garlic, was tender and delicious and the Biryani Vegetarian was fried basmati rice with vegetables and spices and completely yummy.  This was the first time we did not have plain basmati and again this dish was a wonderful surprise. The service is fast and efficient and the server described each dish as it was put on the table.  
They offer a $20 'all you can eat' option which we did not take because we did not want to over order or overeat.  We were right.  There was so much food on the table and we took home leftovers. The only thing 'wrong' with this place is the noise level is over the top but that is because it is so busy. Don't go there for a romantic dinner for two but if you are a group and want to eat well and have a great time, GO!"}
{"text":"I think this restaurant is great, but the owners are sneaky. I have been a dozen times, a noticed something VERY interesting - hear me out. 

IF your party is visibly drunk, they will totally decrease the meat-to-sauce ratio in all the dishes thinking you won't notice. It has gotten really bad, I mean two small pieces of chicken in a Jalfrezi swimming in a giant bowl of sauce. For TWO PEOPLE. So you wind up getting full on wine and Naan soaked in sauce, which is kind of how I like it anyways. 

Also, I know two people on two separate occasions who ate at Bombay Mahal and got violent bacterial colitis (ie. shi-----tting blood for 10 days) from that place. My stomach is iron clad - I've eaten street food in Delhi, India with no problem, so I couldn't care less, but beware!"}
{"text":"Meilleur restaurant indien dans Montréal. J'y vais régulièrement et je n'ai jamais au grand jamais été déçue par la nourriture. Elle est toujours excellente. 

Le poulet au beurre est incontournable ainsi que les vegetarian samosa, le mango lassi et le pain naan. Sinon le Mahal pulao rice est  mon préféré. 

Finalement, les gens sont adorables et se souviennent de nous. Ils ont un bon sens de l'humour et sont toujours très courtois. 

Les deux seuls points négatifs sont les suivants : 
- Les gens ne parlent pratiquement pas Français.
-Les files d'attente peuvent être longues.


Mais sinon, la nourriture compense largement pour ces deux petits points."}
{"text":"the first time I ever tried indian food was at Bombay Mahal for my best friend's birthday. and I haven't looked back since. I've since tried other indian restaurants and they just don't compare. I used to regularly visit Bombay Mahal because it was close to my work at the time. I quit last year and I still keep going back for more. My friends now go across the street, and although it's pretty good as well - I refuse. The staff here is so nice and they remember you which I think shows good customer service and that they value their customers. My favorite dish is the Butter Chicken Tali (switch the Tandoori leg for a Vegetarian platter). I think I just convinced myself to go tomorrow... so good. 

also, it's BRING YOUR OWN WINE ;)"}
{"text":"Un midi seule poulet au beurre 9$ salade pas fraîche point négatif mais le reste parfait et délicieux"}
{"text":"The best food and the best service in Montreal. I've lived here almost 2 years and no other restaurant can compare. I would recommend this to everyone!"}
{"text":"I've ordered chicken biryani from here a few times in the last couple of months and I am disappointed with how the portion size has decreased over time, even though the price is the same, and the quality has also declined considerably, as the chicken is very dry and the flavor lacking. Their restaurant in Parc Extension is pretty generous with the portion size, for the same price, so it appears as if this downtown express restaurant is trying to skimp. I won't be ordering from here again. I would recommend other restaurants in the neighborhood that do takeout chicken biryani, which tastes much better and for a much better value for price."}
{"text":"I waited 2 hours for a spot... Yes it was Saturday night BUT the food was way better at Chand Palace next door. Yes less room than Bombay BUT better customer service and level of spices and tenderness of the meat way better than Bombay Mahal. They will never see my money... Never again!!!"}
{"text":"My favourite restaurant in Montreal hands down.

If you go and don't like it, it's because you're not ordering the right thing.  My boyfriend and I have gone every 6-8 weeks for the last 4 years and we have tried a variety of dishes, but now, we always order exactly the same thing.

Chana Samosa - crunchy, spicy, saucy. 

Baingan Bharta - velvety pureed eggplant with a kick

Chicken Korma - creamy dreamy yogurt-y sauce with tender chicken.

garlic naan - amazing to dip in the bharta and korma.

Buy yourself a bottle of wine, grab a friend, and try the above mentioned  menu next time, (all for about $35)."}
{"text":"Le serveur s'entête à parler uniquement en anglais, bien qu'on lui parle visiblement dans une autre langue. Il converse pourtant très bien au téléphone en français, dans la même pièce, tout au long du repas. Le ton est méprisant et je ne me sentais pas respecté, ni comme client, ni comme citoyen, ni comme personne. On parlait français à la majorité des tables assises de la petite salle à manger. Aux propriétaires, un peu de respect! Quel malaise d'y venir avec un invité. Heureusement, pour les prochaines fois, le quartier offre de très nombreuses tables similaires et savoureuses."}
{"text":"Excellent restaurant indien qui ne perd des points que sur le décor très ordinaire (dans le genre resto à pizza avec pointes à 2$) et le service un peu pressé (on n'a pas vraiment le temps de relaxer à la fin du repas, les serveurs s'arrangent pour que vous partiez rapidement - mais c'est compréhensible, à voir les files énormes qui se forment à l'entrée !).

C'est un restaurant très populaire. Il faut être prêt à faire la file, à moins d'un coup de chance inouï. Dès qu'on goûte à la nourriture, on comprend pourquoi. Que ce soit le pain naan parfaitement cuit et bien chaud ou les oignons baaji avec une petite sauce piquante savoureuse, tout ce que l'on mange chez Bombay Mahal est délicieux, le poulet tikka, le poulet au beurre, les plats de légumes, etc. Il faut faire fi du décor, cela vaut vraiment la peine."}
{"text":"I'm not a huge fan of Indian food. It's often overly sauced and too rich for my arteries. With that said, eating at Bombay Mahal changed my attitude pretty quickly when it came authentic Indian cuisine. I'm no expert, but I'm no food dummy either. Butter chicken, palak paneer, baingan bharta, curries, tandoori, samosas, and garlic naan bread should taste like that and are all happening at this place! It's a little ghetto and a little dirty, but the food is top notch and you get to bring your own booze! That has gotta make up for the lack of decor and ambiance don't you think? I usually go with a group of buds and we share a variety of meat and vegetarian dishes. It's the best way to get your tasters in and you'll end up only paying between $10 and $20 for your meal. If you're craving Indian food, there is no other place to venture into in Montreal, but go fairly early or you'll surely be hanging out at the door waiting for other patrons to soak up the last of their creamy sauces with garlic naan. Don't say I didn't warn you - especially about the looks of the restaurant which can easily be ignored if you're focusing on your food - which you should be!"}
{"text":"Nothing fancy but the food is authentic and delicious the best in Montreal quality/price
Enjoy ;-)"}
{"text":"Great food here. I had Paneer chili, Chicken kadhai; both were good. Mango lassi seem original made of fresh mangoes which is very rare in North America."}
{"text":"This place used to my favorite cheap eats Indian in town. The food is reliably tastey and the BYO aspect is a plus for sure (grab good beers and Marche D'Afrique down the road). 

HOWEVER, a few years ago, they expanded their dining room and lost all quality control. The meat to sauce ratio is now so low that the last time I went I had three (THREE) tiny morsels of chicken in my entire dish. And we weren't even drinking (See Dean A.'s review for more info on that one)! Now, I go across the street to Maison Indian Curry House were I usually get 5 - 8 morsels per dish. Still pretty stingy, but better by a long shot. 

What the hell happened to Indian being a great value for the $? Sure, the prices have stayed roughly the same, but the amount of food has tapered off significantly. And I really hate to pay for rice. That's just cheap.    

My overal verdict of Indian in Montreal (having eaten at eight or so different places on multiple occasions) is that the food is just decent, is no longer a good value, and that the owners pay little attention to the notion of eating as an \"experience.\" I'm not referring to pretense or fancy presentation, but just some pride in the damned product would be nice. The city is ripe for a new contender. 

Rating Scale:
1 Star: Avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe.  
2 Star: With so many great places to choose from, why risk this one?
3 Star: I'll try it again or consume here in a pinch.
4 Star: I go here regularly if financially and/or calorically feasible.
5 Star: I look forward to taking my wife or friends here."}
{"text":"Went there on a Saturday night. Over crowded. Couldn't put my purse nowhere I had to keep it on my lap. Food is horrible and over priced (7.99 for 4 extremely small pieces of chicken drowning in way too much sauce) frozen vegetables are served too. The only positive is that the staff is nice."}
{"text":"Tout simplement délicieux! Le poulet au beurre est le meilleur que nous avons mangé, on a littéralement liché l'assiette avec le pain naan. Les beignets aux oignons et les samosas aux légumes sont très bons, mais très épicés. C'est un apportez votre vin ce qui est super pour la facture. Le service est rapide et efficace. À adopter à tout prix!"}
{"text":"Ouest of Parc Ave on Jean-Talon you'll find a plethora of indian restaurants. If you are a stranger to this part of town I can understand your anxiety towards choosing the right indian restaurant to wine and dine at. Fear not, Bombay Mahal is the light at the end of this tunnel of eateries. 

I've been going here for years, and I can say that it is one of the most consistent restaurants with the quality of their meals. So maybe it gets pretty hectic (Friday and Saturday nights tend to have a line up out the street - white folks love their naan) and sometimes service is slow but the wait is sooo worth it. I've seen my mother-in-law lick the butter chicken bowl clean, that's how good it is. TRUST ME! YOU WILL NOT BE DISAPPOINTED.

On an authenticity level, I can't say how similar it is to Indian food found in India since I've never been but I can tell you right now that it's always a good sign when you see Indian families enjoying a meal here. 

Bombay Mahal is vegetarian and vegan friendly and also BYOB (woohoo!) - they also have a great menu for larger groups (5+ people) where you can get whatever dishes you want on the menu all you can eat for $21.95 per person. Not bad if you want to indulge or are eating with a bunch of ogres ;)

Recommended dishes: aloo gobi (cauliflower dish), shani paneer (paneer in a tasty orange sauce), and baingan bharta (roasted eggplant). Yum!

Side tip: buy your booze at the SAQ or the Loblaws on Parc and Jean Talon. The liquor selection in this neck of town is weak in the depanneurs, unless you like drinking Red Stripe or Labatt's Blue then it's all good!"}
{"text":"J'ai demandé au jeune serveur s'il y avait un plat comme du poulet au beurre et il m'a chargé 12.50$ pour un petit pot où il vidait son poulet au beurre et un pain naan. Il n'y avait même pas assez de poulet pour 5$ et leur poulet était sec. Le menu affichait pourtant 7-8$ pour des plats avec du poulet, du riz, des légumes et un pain naan. 

Le prix de la facture a été gonflé et on indiquait seulement \"non-vegeterian\".

Le seul point positif était que le pain naan était bon."}
{"text":"Overpriced and stale food. The curries are sweet and watery. Shahi paneer had maybe 10 micrascopic pieces of paneer and the vegetables in the other curries were too old. 
If you plan to eat here be ready for a stomach ache in the morning."}
{"text":"Vindaloooooooooo! The red tangy and fiery spicy sauce of the beef vindaloo hits you hard on the very first bite with a blast of flavor you' expect from authentic indian cuisine. 

Recommended by one of my friends at work, a few of us decided to satisfy our craving for some indian on a Thursday night. Wow... boy were we in for a treat. For those of you who care more about the taste experience than the \"décor\", this is the place to be! The samosas were delicious packed with heat that builds up as you eat more. The chicken saag was not too leafy and soft to the palate. The braised lamb korma was probably my favorite with its complex and layered flavors blending spices, yogurt and meat juices. To help keep the heat down, the mango lassi did a great job!

This is a great little BYOW indian restaurant that's been around for more than a decade... add this place to your checklist! Come and say hi to owner Prasheen..."}
{"text":"excellent food although their dishes are *spicy*. well-priced. small and cosy. always a joy to come here."}
{"text":"Well, understanding how indian food's authenticity, this is by far the low level standards that an indian restaurant can achieve. To top it off the owners attitude pretty much defines their food too. They are just money minded pricks and have no regard for customers. I would highly unrecommend and suggest try other better restaurants who know their food and also their customers well. 
Good luck. !.."}
{"text":"This is the best indian place in Montreal that we have tried so far and we've tried many (hence the 5 star rating). My wife comes from Malaysia and Indian food is a big part of their food culture over there. I also lived there for 2 yrs and had indian food almost daily.. Bombay Mahal is the closest to that food that we've had so far outside of Asia. Her parents came over recently from there and also gave it their seal of approval!

I think what makes their food so good is that they don't skimp on seasonings and especially not the spiceness. It makes you sweat and makes you want to eat more.

The only miss we've had so far in 3 visits were their chicken curry, which apparently was \"meh\". Everything else has been great. My favorite is the Idli entree which comes with 2 out of this world sauces.."}
{"text":"In appetizers had the papdi chaat and samosa. The papdi was stale where as the samosa was undercooked. In the main course we had a veg thali and butter chicken. Both were quite decent. ordered plain naan instead we got a heavy dose of butter naan."}
{"text":"Awful. My friends and I made a reservation. We got there and they just pointed us to a table and let us sit there for at least 30 minutes before we had to call someone over. We asked for menus and the guy said that there were no menus (even though we could see them at other tables) and said we would get the \"group special.\" We had to choose random Indian dishes and one friend ordered chicken tikka masala and rice for herself. When the food came, she got naan (she is allergic to gluten) and the waiters refused to bring her rice because she was not a part of the \"group special.\" Many times throughout the night we would call to waiters because no one ever came over to our table and many times they just pretended not to hear us. Finally, by the time we were dying to leave we tried to pay and they only took cash or \"Canadian debit\" which was not posted or made clear to us. Beside the poor service, the food was mediocre."}
{"text":"I have been to both locations for Bombay Mahal
Here are my highlights of this location:

Pros: location is great because it's located centrally downtown next to the Concordia Campus; BYOB so there is a SAQ located right across the street! No corkage fees either! I found quality of food was better- especially in terms of presentation. 

Rating on five stars :
I ordered the butter chicken ****(generous amount of white meat good for 2 people); shahi paneer **(mostly just a heavy cream sauce - with really small pieces of paneer/cheese); tandoor Roti ***(slightly greasy, came in two pieces); garlic naan ***(very well seasoned and salted - still greasy -came in two pieces); papdi chaat ****(fried tortilla pieces garnished with chick peas, yogurt, tamarind, cilantro, and various chutneys). Each item cost less than 10$. This meal complimented nicely with a white wine : Pinot Gris

Cons: this place has a more of a fast food vibe compared to the other location. Service was kind of off- lacking speed, or was hard to flag down the waitress at times. You had to walk up to the cash to pay - another offset.

Overall, good downtown find for a quick Indian food fix and drinks on a budget!"}
{"text":"Just went for the bajillionth time (okay, it was actually the quintillionth if it's specificity you're after) on Saturday night and I still adore this place. Maybe it's the fact that I have a perennial soft spot for Bring Your Own Wine restaurants. Maybe it's the fact that their food is absolutely delicious, fresh and rather inexpensive. Maybe it's the fact that I get my eyebrows done at Dee's across the street and Bombay Mahal is great comfort food when my entire forehead is throbbing in pain. Whatever it is, I keep going back.

My favourite dishes include the palak paneer, which has a brilliant, strong flavour to the spinach, the creamy lamb korma and the vada sambar, which I had for the first time the other night but will definitely be ordering as an appetizer in the future. Their garlic nan is also a treat!

If you're heading there for lunch, they have a $5 veg thali that is not only to die for, but surprisingly filling despite appearances. I definitely looked at it with uncertainty when it first arrived, thinking I might have to order an extra side, but I soon discovered it was more than enough.

On Friday and Saturday nights, it does tend to fill up, so you'll want to head over with about ten-to-fifteen minutes to spare. Besides that, the service is quick and friendly and it's a great place for a casual BYOW meal."}
{"text":"Delicious! 

I ordered the Oignon Bhaji and Lamb Korma. 
The bhaji's were really nice! Very mild but well seasoned and warm. I wish there had been some kind of yoghurt based sauce on the side but I didn't ask so maybe they did have one.
The lamb was perfect. It came in this really sweet sauce. I also got to taste some naan bread from other people's order and it was really good as well.

The location was big and we had a good spot given that we were a group of about 15 people. The service and the location were great! Air conditioning, food was served warm, and it was clean.

The only thing I didn't think was great was that, unless you ordered the Thali, most of the meals don't come with rice or naan on the side. You pay 10-12$ and you only get the plate you ordered. It can get quite expensive once you add a side and an entree. 

This place is indian fast food but decent indian fast food! Would definitely come back and try their thali for lunch."}
{"text":"Nothing wrong with this place - polite staff, quick service, decent pricing, but the food is just ok and not 'wow!'. I came in with three ladies, two of which are Indian. We all agreed that the sweer lassi and mango lassi were not spiced enough, but were  pretty good. The butter and garlic nan were good, as well as the tandoori roti. We tried the dahl makne which was ok, but got better when we sprinkled some lemon on it. The malai kofta was a disapointment - especially the kofta which was no very fresh and not very flavourful. The sauce was nice but way too sweet. We also tried the chilli paneer which was good.  There's lots of different choices for Indian food around here, and this is as good as any of them. I have a nasty habit of coming to Jean-Talon for late dinners and I'm often among the last tables at closing time - this place is relatively more gracious about it compared to one of the places across the street where they started vacuuming the carpet around us while we were still eating the main coarse. I really like their 'express' franchise on St. Laurent for take-out."}
{"text":"So here's the thing, I am not a stickler for great service, especially when a restaurant is in the thick of it and you're calling in an order for delivery. However, over a few orders I noticed a couple of things: 1) whomever takes the orders seems not to enjoy their job at all, 2) putting someone on hold multiple times is not ok, and 3) it's important to check the accuracy of an order before it goes out. The food itself ranges from good to great, with my favorites being the Chaat Papri and Channa Samosa. I am a sucker for a good appetizer or snack, and they really hit the spot. The combination of textures and flavors makes them addictive. 
Is it worth it? I can't help but think that there may be other options if you want better service and good food."}
{"text":"If you are looking for an authentic indian resto then bombay mahal is definately the place to go to. This resto serves up some of the best classic indian dishes. It's a great spot for groups as they have a reasonably priced tasting menu. Their pekori's and butter chicken were delicious. Although the resto decor is quite simple it is the flavorful dishes that keep customers coming back for more and it is a BYOW resto! For less than 30$ you can get to try a wonderful array of classic indian dishes which can be shared. The only recommendation I have is that you avoid going on a hot humid night as there is very little air conditioning and feels like a sauna. Otherwise will definately go back!"}
{"text":"Food is good, setting is basic. Nothing is spectacular but it's fine Indian food for Montreal."}
{"text":"SO GOOD! And not only good food, but a very pleasant dining experience. Everything arrives in small bowls that can be shared between all party members and encourages a lively discussing.

I would suggest arrving around 6-7 pm, though, because when we left at 8:00 p.m. it was absolutely packed, to the point where they asked strangers to share tables and there was a 15-person lineup for a place. One of the dangers when you're a really good restaurant, I suppose."}
{"text":"I'm going to start out by admitting that I was scared to death to try this type of food. I'm a very picky eater and ambiance helps me feel comfortable. This place has zero ambiance to speak of. None. Zero.

You walk in and there is a tiny room that maybe seats 6 people, they take you behind a door to a larger dining room that is cramped but jam packed. If the place is jam packed its a good sign to me.

The waiter noticed our hesitation (we were 8 girls, first time for 7 of us) and he basically gave us what I call a \"white girl sampler\". He asked what our preference was for meat and how much spice we could handle and then brought an assortment of dishes and sauces to the table.

Everything was DELICIOUS. The spices wren't too over powering the flavors were all very good and the service was great. We had a funny waiter who loved to interact and talk with us. 

My only issue was I had googled Indian food prior to going to get an idea of the menu and their somaos were very different than any I had seen online. It was still delicious but I hadn't seen others smothered in sauce.... (and don't tell anyone but I wanted that sauce on EVERYTHING!) 

I would go back again but in a few months. I don't think I can handle too much of that food too often. 

Oh and its bring your own wine which is great. Google told me Pinot Gris goes great with Indian food and I can't lie, it went down smooth!"}
{"text":"Pas le plus bel endroit de la planète mais c'est définitivement le meilleur shani paneer de la planète! Je vous le recommande fortement !"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the food tonight! 

Because we were a large group, I felt like the waitress was slow and didn't have common sense in how she delivered the food... but she was really nice. 

My main meal was delivered to someone else at the table and sat there for a few minutes before I asked where mine was and it was passed to me. I loved the food (Chana samosa, chicken tikka masala and naan were all excellent). 

The fact that it's BYOB is a bonus and the restaurant is pretty new looking with AC. Good for fast food Indian and groups looking for affordable BYOB places in the heart of Downtown!"}
{"text":"Can't say that I am an expert in Indian food. I am really craving for Indian food lately, the store is clean and food came fast. Staffs are also very friendly. I liked the nam a lot and ate the whole plate.The chicken however is too fatty."}
{"text":"Butter chicken take out or sit in the back of their restaurent very nice ambiance and food always good. Delicious Indian food!"}
{"text":"Some how these folks swindled $3.50 for a side of rice, and the food was third rate. There are a lot better options around to get authentic Indian food."}
{"text":"This restaurant has the most authentic Indian food in Montreal. I lived in India for 3+ years and this restaurant is the closest thing to being there. I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"Best Indian food I've had in Montreal...(so far)...

This place is not at all in the running for decor or ambiance.  It's a big room, industrial type floor tiles, cafeteria style tables...but come here for the food!  Wow, it was great.  I went for lunch on a Saturday and there was no line up so I am not sure how busy it gets for dinner, but the food will not disappoint.
Service was fine, nothing great but what you would expect in the atmosphere.  Again, it's all about the food here!

I ordered the Vindaloo Chicken, but also tried butter chicken and a thali dish.  All good."}
{"text":"I really love indian food and this place is really worth it! We had butter chicken (a must), goat curry, eggplant dish, spicy shrimps... all of them were good! The service is also nice, they glad you inform you about everything. The naan is delicious... It is a really nice place to introduce people to indian food!"}
{"text":"Not as I expected of an Indian restaurant. They were really stingy when it came to the servings. Quantities are not enough to feed a duck. Unlike other Indian restaurants I've been to where you get stuffed! The salad isn't Indian, the lentil was more like a soup, 4 small cubes of chicken and the rice had no spices. Won't go again."}
{"text":"Man!!!!!! From a tourist who just ate here... it was complete crap of a thali- watered down Butter Chicken- Punjabi Kadi no tangyness to it. The only good thing was the warm naan."}
{"text":"Don't be scared off by the line that snakes out the door, down the stairs and around the corner - this means the food is amazing (and it's worth the wait). 

If the wait is not your thing (you'll wait a bit even if you have a reservation), order takeout, and you'll be in and out in just a few minutes flat. 

Order the chana samosa, baighan bharta, and the shahi paneer (these are all my favourites). It's hard to go wrong, though, so peruse the menu until you find something that strikes your fancy. 

Go at lunch to take advantage of the $5 vegetarian thali. Pair it with a mango lassi and you've got a stellar meal. 

This is a hole in the wall spot so don't expect linen tablecloths and a fine dining experience. What you'll get instead is great food, a friendly server and some stellar people-watching moments. 

BYOW."}
{"text":"For someone who can't really stand spicy food, I still cannot say no to this place when it comes to butter chicken. Desserts are worth trying. Tea is a must."}
{"text":"We went to visit Montreal from US and we had dinner here on one night. The food is not great compared to restaurants in U.S. We ordered dahi vada and the vada had bad smell because it smells like bad oil where they cooked over and over with the same oil, did not cook properly. We ordered chicken biryani with very mild but they gave too spicy though I mentioned to them that I have 2 little kids. They did not put a board outside that they only take Canadian dollars and Canadian debit card. We had only US cash and U.S. Debit card. So we paid extra 11 dollars for the amount we owe. 

I got sick after eating dahi vada. 

Owner seemed to be a big CHEATER. And money grabber. We don't know if the cashier is the owner but he is very rude. 

At least visitors from US should not go here."}
{"text":"It is so disappointing that this place brings such a bad reputation to their original mother restaurant in parc extension. I've been going to the one in parc extension about a decade ago and even though I lived downtown I would do the drive to go there. However , not too long ago , I was very excited that they had opened a location downtown . To my disappointment , this place did not live up to expectation. The service is extremely slow here and every time I've been here I've had some issue with the front end of the house. The food is good, hence why I gave 2 stars but the service makes this place unbearable. The employees don't seem to care at all about their customers and sometimes stand around and talk to each other while you're there waiting to be served. I'm quite easy going and the first time It had happened , it was right after their lunch break , I was a bit in a hurry but it was fine I get it people need breaks. I didn't speak out on a bad review just yet because I didn't feel like it was representative of what they were capable of. There were other incidents too. However , yesterday was the final draw. We had called for pick up and the lady said 20 minutes and the food would be ready. We took precautions and showed up 25-30 minutes after the call. To our disappointment , we ended up waiting another 25 minutes idled on St-Catherine which is really not the most ideal. Overall , food is good if you're willing to put up with bad service."}
{"text":"Ok, so I'd been coming here for years and years, and then I stopped. I don't remember why this stopped being my go-to for Indian on Jean Talon, but I think it had something to do with trying Mahli Sweets, Chand Palace, Punjab Palace, Halal 786 - I broadened my horizons and didn't look back to my undergraduate haunt. Until now. 

Bombay Mahal is the one place in town that two of my favourite people feel like regulars. They walk in and get hugged and feel at home, so when they wanted to celebrate a big birthday there I was dropping everything, changing plans to spend it with them, all the while wondering what my experience would be all these years later. 

We had a lovely time, I'll say that. It was about what I expected, tasty but it's honestly not my favourite. The chicken korma was delicious, the naan was excellent, the chana samosa were good though not quite hot, and the sag paneer and butter chicken were kind of flavourless. The stairs to the bathroom were slippery and I slipped pretty hard, so that was a bummer, and the slightly moldy smell down there was not ideal. The thali is ~$10 which is cheap, but almost twice as much as other bigger, and in my opinion better, thali's nearby. 

But yes, it's relatively inexpensive, BYO, and the staff are super friendly and funny and dear. I think there are better things to order than I did and lots of reasons to go back, but keep adventuring in the area if you're interested in discovering exceptional Indian food in Montreal."}
{"text":"1 star for nan

the rest...awful.  hair in menu then hair in app then hair in main. WTF. curries are watered down like soup. walked out. never again. worst resto I've ever been too"}
{"text":"Une amie me propose de manger indien, pourquoi pas je n'ai pas encore essayé. On se dirige vers Bombay Mahal, vu d'extérieur ça ne paye pas de mine et l'intérieur est très ordinaire (style fast food), et quelques places assises. 
Nous voila devant les réchauds, tout a l'air très appétissant, nous ne y connaissons pas très bien, nous demandons donc quelques explications au serveur, il ne parle pas très bien français, mais nous explique correctement en anglais. J'opte finalement pour le poulet au beurre (pour emporter), et ce fut une belle découverte, j'ai beaucoup aimé, le poulet était tendre, la sauce délicieuse et en suffisance pour la quantité de riz basmati. 

J'ai payé 13$ environs, ce qui me parait tout à fait raisonnable vu la quantité et la qualité.

Bref, j'y retourne sans hésiter et si vous êtes de passage ou la recherche d'un bon resto indien, rendez-vous chez Bombay Mahal."}
{"text":"Not really sure what all the hype was about. The food is alright, prices average, decor plain, and service adequate. Definitely not worth a special trip. And the buffet is not offered all the time so make sure you check on that before you arrive."}
{"text":"I came here with a friend for dinner. We both got the vegetarian thali. The thali came with a appetizer, a plate of three curries, rice, naan bread, salad, and a dessert. They very accommodating when I asked them to switch out one of the curries that had cream in it with one that doesn't because I don't eat dairy. But beware that the naan bread has dairy in it. The thai was very good, the spices and flavors were great, although it can be a bit oily. My friend is obsessed with their desserts, the gulab jamun and ras malai."}
{"text":"I've been here a couple times and it was decent to good. This time however.. I ordered the chicken curry thali and a few papadums. I got the thali. It was decent, though the salad was more of a bland decoration. 

But where we're the papadums? I asked the waiter once. Later on I asked him again. Later as he was picking up our plates he asked me if I got my papadums. I never did!

I believe this place is known for ok to good food and bad service but how often should one have to ask for papadums. Oh yes, and they tried to charge me for them."}
{"text":"I've been here like 5 times sine my review. Always a good time, and good meal. I just want to add a couple pointers I've noticed.

a) The food/curries can be exceptionally filling, tread lightly. Stop when you start feeling full. 2-3 times, I have over eaten and stayed bloated for hours, when I should've stopped and just taken the rest home.

b) The prices seem to have gone up slightly. What used to be $40 for two ppl for starters/mains, tip included, is now $50. Still best deal in town though."}
{"text":"J'ai vraiment passé une soirée sympathique dans ce restaurant. De l'extérieur ça n'a vraiment pas l'air de grand chose il y a assez de place assise pour une trentaine de personnes, et il a y un comptoir au fond de la salle pour les commandes à emporter. 

Nous étions un grand groupe de 14 personnes et ça ce voyait que la serveuse avait pas l'habitude de service des groupe de cette taille. Je suis arrivé avec un peu de retard et j'ai du demander de l'eau deux fois avant que finalement elle nous amène un pichet. 

Pour la prise de commande ce fut assez efficace, le menu est vaste il y en a pour tout les goûts et il a beaucoup d'option végétarienne. Nous avons attendu environ 20 minutes avant que nos plats arrive, ce qui est un temps raisonnable mais malheureusement elle ne souvenait plus qui avait commandé quoi donc il y a eu quelque switch à l'arrivé. J'avais pris le Thali végétarien, qui vient avec du riz, de la salade, du pain naan, et trois curry à base de légumes. C'était vraiment bon et assaisonnée à mon goût.

Pour payer il fait ce rendre au comptoir. Je dirai que la location est vraiment pratique vu que c'est en plein centre à côté de l'université Concordia, les prix sont très raisonnables mais que c'est plus plus un comptoir qu'un restaurant."}
{"text":"We went there twice because although the service was bad but the food was good enough to give the place a second chance. The second time the service was awful. Even though both times we went for and late lunch and early dinner and the place was almost empty (3 tables). The appetizer came on time even though the waiter gave our to the next table, however we ordered 3 main dish 2 of them came , from which one belonged to the next table and my wife gave it to them, but the 3rd dish came when we finished our food and teas!!! so we said we don't want it and the owner acted like he did us a favor but not charging us for it!
In a nut shell the food is decent but nowhere near as good to make up for awful service, specially when IMHO the second best Indian restaurant in Montreal is just cross the street"}
{"text":"Cheap place
Good food
Was never disappointed

It is small and very packed though :)"}
{"text":"This is my go to Indian restaurant BEST in Montreal.
Food is to die for, If i could i'd eat there every night!!"}
{"text":"My family and I found out about this restaurant from family who had previously visited Montreal and we desperately wanted to feel somewhat at home so we went there. It was really crowded and lively there. Being Indian ourselves, we thought this was one of the best restaurants we've been to so far. We loved it so much that we had dinner there two nights in a row while we were in Montreal."}
{"text":"After coming past all the good reviews, I decided to take my Asof out for lunch. Having come from indian background, i do have good idea and experience about indian food. The chana samosa was decent but no way it will cost 5 bucks in any other place. My lamb plate came with dry out salad from yesterday and the lamb was too dry and dull. My wife's lamb biryani was nothing but white rice mixed with regular lamb curry. People, biryani is something made after a lot of effort and hardwork, fuming the rice with spices overtime rather than the so called lame biryani i had. Last words, food is made completely for dudes who have never been into indian places before and are completely ignorant about indian cuisine. Trust me, i have had better indian food in Montreal"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic for a quick meal and you're craving a curry. They were very accommodating with my vegan questions about the menu and allowed me to swap naan for roti. Some places can be nerve-racking because you aren't sure if they understand what is/isn't vegan or care. The server here was super upfront and friendly. The food was great. Not too greasy or salty. But tons of flavour. Definitely a new favourite. 

The only reason I took off a star is that I wish they labeled vegan dishes. They had vegetarian very clearly labeled, which is awesome, but things like ghee and milk and cheese get tricky in Indian food."}
{"text":"Continuing in my quest to find good Indian in Montreal that rivals the stuff in England (where I'm from!) I ordered a delivery from this place. 

It arrived cold...but that's not the restaurant's fault, so I'll let that slide. 

The main issue is that everything was so SPICY. I feel bad complaining about this because it's an Indian restaurant but even the papadums were spicy! I like spicy food but I also like to be given the choice, and if even the sides are spicy then it's a bit much for me :(

The garlic naan was great - not stingy with the garlic like most are - as were the vegetarian samosas. But the paneer curry was a bit watery, and was just sauce + cheese, which was a little disappointing when I was hoping for something a little beefier (not literally, I am (mostly) vegetarian!)

I guess I will keep searching for the perfect Indian restaurant, but unfortunately this is not it for me :("}
{"text":"After being in Montreal for a few days and missing Indian food, we decided to visit Bombay Mahal based on Yelp and Urban Spoon recommendations. Quite a mistake.

Food is decent and very reasonably priced, but the restaurant is shoddy and grimy, which ruined my experience. If you are up for a quick no-frills bite and can stand the mess, pop in but I wouldn't recommend going out of your way to eat here."}
{"text":"Excellent à chaque fois que j'y suis allée ! Restaurant apportez votre vin que j'adore. Le poulet au beurre est le meilleur que j'ai mangé à ce jour. Les samosas aux légumes sont vraiment très épicés, par contre les beignets aux oignons le sont un peu moins et très bons.  Le service est toujours rapide et efficace. Un must à essayer absolument! Un coup de coeur !"}
{"text":"Been going here for years. It's a great bring your own wine place. There is usually a line, but don't let that influence your decision to go there... the staff is hilarious and quick. I've tried 90% of the menu and its all pretty awesome. My typical order: samosa, pakora, chicken jalfraizi (great level of spice), basmati rice and garlic naan."}
{"text":"I frequently have very naughty dreams about the Butter Chicken at Bombay Mahal.

In them, I am alone at the restaurant with a giant tub of Butter Chicken. It's just me, the tub of butter chicken, an endless supply of garlic naan bread, some rice, and maybe a few cold beers.

And some vegetable pakoras. And some samosas.

What happens next is too hot for Yelp but let's just say in the end, I have to be carried out of there.

True story, I have offered 1000$ to the owner of Bombay Mahal (Jean-Talon location) for their butter chicken recipe and they refused.

I will agree with the other reviewers that this place is probably a disgrace for the true, incredibly amazing Indian cuisine, but the butter chicken is so good, once it touches your lips nothing else matters."}
{"text":"Went there with friends on a Saturday night, ambiance was busy. Barely any space between the tables. Very crowded. The buffet experience was very disappointing as the waiters we're not providing enough food for the amount of people that were there and were constantly forgetting the side dishes (rice, naan). We left from there unsatisfied and still hungry. The price ou pay for the quality of food you get is just not worth it. The butter chicken was watery not creamy. Last time I go there."}
{"text":"Amazing rotis! Great place!

Their handmade rotis are great! Served warm, they're incredible and beat the quality of both Biryani House and Star of India (Etoile des Inde). Besides that they have good food, a variety of dishes, with outstanding quality.

I got the veg thali, and my friend got the non veg thali. All the curries, the naan, and rotis were consistent and 'on point' with what you would expect at an Indian place; and it easily beat out Thali (the restaurant) in price and quality.

The chai is made to order, and the lassi, while thick, is delicious and not too sweet. However, their samosas could use some help (they're not bad, they're just not that great, although even there, the filling beats out most other indian places downright!)

Ultimately, though, and this is worth the whole post, is about their kheer (rice pudding). I didn't want to get it at first, because most places mess up either the sweetness, the consistency, or both and then water it down.

Well, on a whim, I got it. I was skeptical until I opened the container, and I was supremely astonished from this point on (because this is supposed to be 'fast food'). Not only was it good, but it was probably the best I've ever had (and I'm a bit sad to say it was better than what I'd get at home)....so it was completely worth the $1.96 haha!

Low prices help! It was almost $10 per person for everything. Service was great too!

So hands down, gotta check this family-owned and operated place out!"}
{"text":"Place de choix pour les amateurs de Thali!!! Service rapide et courtois! l'endroit est propre et inspire confiance! Les plats végétariens sont relevés sans être trop salé comme certains restos indiens du même genre!! Pour un lunch rapide à environ 10$....c'est une place à mettre dans sa liste!

La livraison à domicile est aussi impeccable....tout est arrivé chaud et surtout très rapidement!!! définitivement un bon choix pour rassasier votre \"craving\" de bouffe indienne à la maison!!!"}
{"text":"I was in the area, which is filled with amazing Indian places. I never been to this one so we said we will try it. First thing I see is the place is packed with people from India, always a good sign that we will get great Indian food.
We ordered the Vegetarian Thali (each), which was only 8$ (!), it came with a few side dish options. All were very good not too spicy (you can always add that). Bottom line great and cheap Indian food that will keep you full and satisfied."}
{"text":"Wow! Ça sent trop bon dans ce restaurant. Cuisine authentique Indienne dans le quartier Parc-extension, il s'agit d'un des plus populaires avec un important achalandage. Beaucoup de place disponible pour accueillir des groupes également : c'est toutefois bruyant et ce n'est probablement pas une place pour date romantique à la chandelle. N'oublions pas qu'il s'agit d'un BYOW.

Pour la bouffe... succulent! Chaque plat est très goûteux avec plusieurs épices. Le poulet au beurre est un classique à ne pas manquer. Que dire du fluffy pain Nan!

Je le recommande fortement à tous!"}
{"text":"as was previously mentioned, this place is nothing fancy but has some of the better Indian food that I have found outside of India. Always very busy so plan on waiting but worth every minute spent in line.
Another great feature is the fact that it is a BYOB"}
{"text":"When you have a craving for Indian food, Bombay Mahal will deliver. We got there 30 minutes before the kitchen closes and the restaurant was full packed! As soon as you walk in the restaurant, you will be hit with all the aromas this wonderful cuisine has to offer. We ordered wayyy too much food for two people! We were very hungry after our Ali Wong show lol!

Dal soup
Chana samosa
Fish pakora
Lamb vindaloo 
Shrimp curry
Chicken tikka
Some eggplant dish
Rice pulao
Lamb thali
Naan 

Everything was DELICIOUS! Salty, oily and so spicy we were sweating like if it rained on us. We had so much food that we had another dinner with the leftover :)  All that food for 100$ taxes and tips included. Dirt cheap!!! It's also a BYOB. Service is very friendly and fast. It is out of my way (about 35 minutes) but so worth it!"}
{"text":"Après habiter dans Parc Extension depuis plus qu'un an, je peut dire définitivement et sans hésitation que Bombay Mahal est le meilleur cuisine indien qu'on peut trouver sur la rue Jean-Talon et possiblement dans tout de Parc Ex - - il reste deux ou trois restos de plus que je n'ai essayé encore.  Je n'ai jamais manger quelque chose ici qui est moins que délicieux.  Oui, quelquefois le service est un peu lent -- mais si tu regardes toi le resto avec attention, tu vas probablement marquer qu'il y a seulement deux serveurs au maximum! Bravo Bombay Mahal.  Apportez votre vin ou bière ou n'importe quoi!
-----
After living in this hood for a little over a year, I can say with assurance that Bombay Mahal is the best Indian cuisine that one can find on Jean-Talon and possibly all of Parc Ex...there are still two or three Indian restos that I have yet to try.  I've never had a bad exerience here.  Sometimes the service is slow, but those times are probably a Friday or Saturday night and there are probably only one or two waiters!  Bring your wine or beer or whatever for an added bonus."}
