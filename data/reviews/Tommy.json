{"text":"Wonderful location and ambiance. Coffee was great. Nice local coffee house if looking for something beside Starbucks."}
{"text":"Very expensive. Espresso is $3. Cookies start at $3.50.

The service leaves something to be desired. After being told \"it won't be long,\" I stood at the counter for five minutes while three employees idled behind it, before giving up and leaving the cafe. I have no idea why no one asked me what I wanted or offered to explain the delay.

The space and its decor are beautiful.

Very poor first impression, though. I don't really want to go back."}

Montreal has one of the best cafe scenes in North America in my humble opinion. The island city (yes, Montreal is an island - bet you didn't know that!) always has new cafes sprouting up, and when Tommy Cafe first opened a few years back, it definitely became one of my favourite spots in Old Montreal.

Hubby and I visited the cafe during date night before heading over for dinner at Bonaparte a few blocks down. You can read my review on their tasting menu here. Anyway, Tommy Cafe is in a historical building, so it has many features of the old classical architecture left which gives it a lot of character.

What took my heart away was the ceiling.

Definitely one of the hottest instagram-worthy spots in the cafe! With classical architecture, hip interior decor, and fresh plants hanging off the ceiling, there wasn't anything that I didn't like about the cafe!

Onto the important stuff: the caffeinated drinks and food.
The coffee was okay- to be honest, nothing too extraordinarily good or special that left hubby or me wanting to come back for more. The cafe itself was very nice and its vibes drew us to the cafe more so than the coffee. Though we didn't have food at Tommy Cafe that day, I went back by myself on another occasion to get some work done and I ordered a sandwich to try with my coffee. I had lunch here that day.

First, I found the sandwich to be a little oily but that was okay-I didn't mind too much. Again, the food wasn't anything fancy or special... it was a pretty plain sandwich that met my hunger needs. I definitely recommend the coffee more than the food at Tommy Cafe.

Though Tommy Cafe has a killer vibe, being in a historic building and all, the actual coffee and food can use some improvement. Tommy Cafe is a nice cafe to stop by to get some work done, to grab a bite to eat, or for catching up with a friend. It's definitely a great place to stop by if you're touring Old Montreal, but it isn't the best place to come for the 'best' coffee in the city, so if you're a coffee drinker that takes coffee pretty seriously, this place will probably wouldn't please you the most in that department. I'd still come to get my daily fix of caffeine and take a nice Instagram picture though."}
{"text":"This was the first café spot I went to after arriving in Montréal and it definitely did not disappoint! They have a good selection of breakfast/brunch foods, like savory croissant sandwiches and avocado toast, but my favorite things were the sweet treats. I had the chocolate pistachio croissant and it was amazing. At first I thought it was a little expensive at $5 but then I remembered it was $5 CAD, which is about $4 USD. And after tasting it I felt it was so worth it. I so badly wanted to buy all of their sweets because they looked so good, but if you can only get one like me, I highly recommend the chocolat pistache croissant. Days after having it, I'm still thinking about it. The egg croissants were also really, really good and I recommend them as well.
The matcha rose latte was okay. I'm not sure how it's supposed to taste, but to me it just tasted like creamy water with a thick layer of matcha powder on top. My sister liked it but I personally wasn't a fan.
The employees were nice and welcoming, but they somehow didn't ring up my croissant (the incredible chocolate pistachio one) so we ended up waiting 15 minutes before they told us that they didn't put it in the system. They also didn't apologize for the mistake, but since it was so delicious I wasn't even mad about it. I did however take one star off because of that, because it says something about their customer service.
The café itself is gorgeous. Being in Old Montreal, the exterior is gorgeous. The buildings are historical and just are incredible to be around. The interior was cozy but felt very open as there was a loft area, with seating along the walls going upstairs. They made use of the space by adding seats everywhere they could, which I thought was a great idea, although tables are limited as the place can get quite busy."}
{"text":"This place is so lovely! We saw it after close on our walk around Norte-Dame yesterday, and just had to come back today. The greenery hanging from he ceiling is magical and there's lots of cozy seating and tables although it was pretty much constantly full. There's glasses and glass water bottles on some of the tables which is very nice, especially if you're sitting upstairs. The lighting is lovely, all coffee drinks imbibed did not disappoint, and the almond croissant was delicious. The avocado toast was sublime and the soup of the day was carrot and potato, also amazing. Do yourself a favor and stop by, maybe even stay a while, we certainly did!"}
{"text":"On ne peut pas la nier, le cadre du Café Tommy est très agréable. L'espace aménagé en plusieurs mezzanines est aéré et joli décoré de plante et de mobilier un peu vintage. Pour boire un bon thé, faudra par contre repasser?! La dose de thé était trop forte pour la petite tasse d'eau que j'avais, le prix était en plus très élevé pour un simple thé. Le WiFi était lent et ne permettait pas de travailler correctement (j'ai utilisé le WiFi gratuit de la ville). Le café est situé à côté de la Basilique de Notre Dame, je pense que ce café est à voir une fois, mais pas deux?!"}
{"text":"Excellent coffee shop with great variety of croissants, breakfast toast, and a friendly atmosphere."}
{"text":"Solid coffee and breakfast snack shop in old Montreal, just down the street from Notre Dame cathedral.

Drinks and snacks were good, but service seems a little spotty and terse.  Also, we found them closed on several occasions when we would have expected them to be open.  Which caused us to go elsewhere and find another, excellent, coffee shop instead.

We'll go back for the atmosphere and location, but if they aren't open, no serious loss."}
{"text":"An adorable little cafe close to the Notre Damme Basilica. The coffee was good and the food was fantastic. You have to try the Nutella cronut! The yoghurt parfait was also delicious."}
{"text":"What a cafe should be! They got all the aspects right.
- The decor is very inspired - taking an old space and making it an inventive multi level space. You have space on your own, space to share with friends, sofa of chairs.
- The service is smiling - they do! they are helpful, nice, and their happiness makes the experience perfect.
- The coffee and pastries are on point - good selection, and well made coffee.

Was worried it would be a tourist trap so close to the Old town and the Cathedral, and it's actually a very nice place to be and spend time - some people are working, but other are just chatting and having a good time, an atmosphere a cafe should create and Tommy aces it."}
{"text":"Finally made it to Tommy cafe after all this time...

I'd heard about it from a friend of mine whose name is actually Tommy, lol.

The place has a lot of character, very hipster, come have a drink lounge around for a bit, read or browse on your device, they have free wifi.

I had an avocado toast with egg on top. It was delicious, they had some hot pepper flakes in it which gave it a nice kick.

Their chai latte is excellent. Love this place, it's peaceful and cute, just like my friend Tommy :)"}
{"text":"This place is a breathe of fresh air! Charming little cafe with an organic flavor :) good job!!"}
{"text":"I stopped here for coffee and a place to relax and wasn't disappointed at all.

The latte was delicious and well-made, and the service was very friendly. If you're looking for a full breakfast menu, I wouldn't suggest this cafe, but would recommend for a pastry and cup of coffee."}
{"text":"Cool atmosphere and building, just dont come here only for the drinks or service. You'll also probably have to fight for a seat with the people who are studying without drinks."}
{"text":"Beautiful interior, indifferent service, average coffee and way below average pastries."}
{"text":"Came here on a Sunday afternoon with a friend. I have to admit, I had seen a picture of their cafe on Instagram, and that is why I was intrigued. The decor was incredible - I believe they had restored the British Empire Building, so all the original architecture and moldings were in tact. They also had a top floor with a couch area and fun trinkets. And the ceiling decor was gorgeous! That's where the praise ends, unfortunately. I had a mocha with soy milk. It came up to about $8 with tip. way overpriced, in my opinion. The washrooms were clean, but neither stall had any toilet paper left...which just shows the upkeep.  As well, my friend and I had met up for lunch (I had seen on their social media that they do serve food and they have a lunch special marked on their menu). They told us that they didn't have any sandwiches or salads that day... hmm. I didn't want to eat any baked goods for lunch, so we enjoyed the architecture for a bit with our drinks and then headed to the next door cafe for food. Soo promising, but unfortunately, disappointing."}
{"text":"The interior is simply beautiful. The white walls create a calm atmosphere with the hanging plants.  The menu was confusing as some items were on the blackboard and some were placed at  the counter. Other than that, the prices were a bit overpriced, but the food was amazing. The nutella cronuts is a must-try! Best 4$ I have ever spent."}
{"text":"Good coffee. Ham and cheese croissant :) Due to the rain pouring weather, there were a lot of people taking a rest. It means it was so comfortable to chill out nearby cathedral for the tourist. Good location to visit!"}
{"text":"Really, really cute space. Everything about this place was stunningly beautiful and creative; from the mirrors on the wall, to the marble surfboard, to the genius music playlist . While the coffee wasn't the best, the atmosphere at this shop makes it ideal for short hangouts with friends or long study sessions."}
{"text":"Great place to visit! Really friendly cashier! I've been multiple times and its the kind of place where a tourist will walk in and then right after that someone will walk in to buy coffees and pastries for her staff at work. (diverse customers) Great place to sit down because of the view, its such an iconic building! There is limited choice on food (like most cafes) but there was a mix of pastries and fresh/healthy options! (juices and salads). Vegetarian and Vegan friendly, they have almond milk and I think soy! 
Keep in mind this is not the place to go and study for hours and hours. It's a high traffic area with tourists, plus the seating is limited! 
They also have a \"night life\" during after hours."}
{"text":"Cafe Tommy is a lovely cafe with great drinks and food in Old Port. I would recommend going on the WEEKDAYS because on the weekends it becomes the hunger games of trying to get a seat. Perfect if you are into people watching basic girls walk in and out trying to find a \"cute place to study\" in old port where they can take their snapchats but also plug into an outlet. 

As a study cafe, I would say Tommy can be a bit loud. The wifi here is UNRELIABLE and extremely slow so if you are bringing work, make sure you can get by without it. The best times to come are in the afternoon where you can take advantage of the amazing light that streams in through the windows. 

The space is undoubtedly gorgeous. the planters hanging from the ceiling and the decor make it feel like your cool aunt's workshop/lounge. Even though it's small, it is still one of the largest cafes in old port."}
{"text":"went with a friend on a Sunday it was pretty busy there weren't many place to sit but we found one the mika was good the music was perfect and the deco was cute would definitively go back!!"}
{"text":"Tommy is a very cute coffee shop! Be careful the steps going up to Tommy are pretty steep but once you pass that your next challenge is to find a place to sit. It was a cold day so we went in to get a drink but had to get it to go. There was no spots free (even upstairs), I don't blame the customer it is very warm and cozy. They have a good selection of food and bake goods (a bit pricy). But we only ordered a Hot Chocolate and Chai Latte. The hot chocolate was bold like dark chocolate but with the warm milk it was well balanced. The Chai latte on the other hand taste like cane sugar and warm milk and had no Chai tea flavour or spice to it, but it was warm =) Maybe it was an off day for the Chai Latte."}
{"text":"Dites-le pas trop fort, mais ce café est parfait ! Le décor est superbe et l'utilisation de l'espace est spécial (dans le bon sens). La musique est vraiment inspirante pour travailler, ou simplement comme bruit de fond pour avoir une bonne conversation. La nourriture est DÉLICIEUSE en bouche et jolie dans l'assiette. Le choix est assez grand, varié et santé (ok ya aussi des options moins santé si vous voulez), mais bref ça vous satisfera !"}
{"text":"I popped by for some coffee on a nice Saturday and decided to give their cronut and grilled cheese sandwich a try as well.  I ended up getting a small mochachino with almond milk instead of coffee.  
(FYI for my lactose intolerant people - they only have soy, almond and coconut milk. No regular lactose free milk.)
The small is really small.  They served it in a nice glass cup and it was flavourful.  The grilled cheese was good too. I ended up adding prosciutto which had a nice kick, but it wasn't great. The cronut was also nice. Overall though be warned it was pretty pricey though. 
The atmosphere was nice. It was really busy when I was there but it was to be expected as it was a Saturday at noon and the weather was gorgeous.  Tons of tourists it seemed which makes sense as it is right beside Notre Dame.  It also has an upstairs area which was really nice and was good for extra seating. 
This place lost points because of how expensive it was and the food was just okay. I've had better but the decor and ambiance was nice."}
{"text":"Service was very disappointing. Coffee was not bad, but still expensive for what we got. 

We were told after we had bought and been served our coffee that they were closing early for a special event."}
{"text":"I was quite surprised to read the negative reviews. We've been to Tommy a few times and have had only fantastic experiences. Both the food and staff were lovely. Plus, the atmosphere is super pleasant, it makes you want to bring a book and hang around for a few hours.

Also - their cronut is delicious!"}
{"text":"I was looking to try a a new place for a while. Looked at the reviews and it looked really good... the thing is that I was not going to Tommy's with any expectations but still got a little disappointed. I'm giving 3/5 mainly because of the venue and the fresh ingredients, but not for the quality of the food. Everything was really blend. It felt like the chef was cooking while having a cold. 

I had the avocado toast, salad of the day and the pear-fecto juice. 

The toast was really blend. I mean, avocados itself is delicious. But when you do an avocado toast, you need a little flavour balance. Which was not there in this case. 

The salad was like the chef just mixed the ingredients with a little bit of oil and that was it. No salt, no lemon or vinaigrette. I mean, it's a salad, how complicated can it be. 

For the juice, it was good, freshly juiced. So nothing to say on that one :) 

So... overall. You want a beautiful venue to take beautiful photos. You got it. 

You want a place to be impressed by the food. Do not go there."}
{"text":"Such a cute cafe! The price is okay but the environment of the cafe is the reason I went! A lot of green vines around. Very aesthetic"}
{"text":"Décor incroyable et juste pour cet attrait, ce café en vaut le détour. En terme de qualité des boissons, l'espresso et le latté sont bien mais sans plus. C'est également assez cher (même pour le Vieux-Montréal)  et lors de ma visite, les patisseries ne me semblaient pas des plus fraiches.  Concernant l'environnement, on y travaille bien, c'est plutôt tranquille et très bien aménagé (tables longues, plusieurs comptoirs, Wi-Fi efficace et des bouteilles d'eau disposées un peu partout). 

Je reviendrai certainement si je suis dans le coin du Vieux-Montréal."}
{"text":"I've been waiting to check off this stop on my coffee crawl for a while now, so I'm super exited to have finally gone to this insta-famous location. I went with a friend on a Saturday afternoon; it was pretty crowded, but we still found a table upstairs. The cafe has good lighting and overall amazing decoration - a nice reading or light studying place with outlets available and diverse seating (there were couches upstairs too). When we were ordering, one of the staff brought out a plate of discounted pastries, so I got a 40% off croissant. Would not recommend: it tasted like a 40% off croissant. I got an iced latte, which was amazing, and my friend's iced matcha was less sweet than I expected, which was nice since I usually don't like sweet drinks. Overall, nice drinks, nicer ambience. If you're looking for the wifi password, look on the cute little blackboard signs!"}
{"text":"Coffee and food were ridiculously good.  The place itself is really neat how it is set up for seating.  The staff was amazing- so nice and just gave off a very chill vibe (but still got everything out quickly).  We went there three days in a row while we were on vacation, and it was consistently great every day. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"We have now been waiting for 30 minutes for our order. Other guests who ordered after we had are now leaving after having their meal. Food is not so bad but their system of tracking ordered needs some work. If you are in any rush at all go elsewhere. The four of us received our orders at about 5-10 minutes apart. At writing, still waiting......."}
{"text":"My boyfriend split the quiche and tomato mozzarella toast and we both loved it! The staff was really friendly and the cafe had good music and a cool atmosphere."}
{"text":"I went to Café Tommy twice for breakfast while I was in town a few weeks ago, as it was just a block away from my rental apartment. The decor is Instagram worthy. The hot tea came in a large mug with your own teapot, which I much prefer to having to keep asking for hot water refills. The quiche was more crust than eggs and fillings, but still delicious. The first floor can be a bit drafty of if they are busy but they have a second floor (where the small bathrooms are located). Unlike other reviewers, I found the staff nothing but pleasant and helpful to a tourist."}
{"text":"One of the best menus and interior designs I've ever seen for a lunch/coffee spot. Love everything they did here. Wish I lived in the area and could come back more"}
{"text":"Really cute place to grab a coffee, sit for a few minutes while exploring Old Montréal and take a couple #instagramworthy photos. The atmosphere is very bright and fresh. The baristas were super friendly and quick. The seating area was tight when we arrived around 2-3 pm but if you can't find a spot inside, the front steps are pretty wide and a great place to plop down for a minute. 

I got an Iced Americano and it was super yummy. It's a really fun place to stop by if you're in the neighbourhood and need a little caffeine boost."}
{"text":"Nice environment and cozy. The matcha latte is good. It's perfect for reading a book or chit chatting with your friend. Love the cute decoration"}
{"text":"J'ai vraiment apprécie l'accueil dans ce café par le personnel. La jeune fille qui était à la caisse était vraiment au top :) j'ai adore mon combo : tartine a l'avocat et salade! Je reviendrai avec plaisir!"}
{"text":"I couldnt taste the expresso in my latte properly. It was too milky for me. I had higher expectations. The location is great though, in old port."}
{"text":"Worst Worst service possible. They didn't let my family enter and lied saying kitchen was full although there were plenty of seats. The group right behind us seated after they refused us. They are racists."}
{"text":"They have soymilk and make an awesome iced coffee (cafe glace with le lait soja).

Fun seating with lots of space and light.

The only problem I had in Montreal was wanting to eat everywhere twice!  Tommy's is no exception.  I want to come back to try the avocado toast."}
{"text":"A very cute, casual, hip environment but disappointed by the food. Chai tea latte was watery, we ordered three sandwiches for take away and one was wrong and the chocolate croissant was dry. It's unfortunate that the food was so bad considering the environment and location."}
{"text":"This is essentially a nice coffee shop in a very cool space.  Food selection was VERY limited and service is not good.  Very slow and they don't seem to know what they're doing.  They gave the wrong item then tried to heat a croissant in a microwave which makes it soggy?!?!?  My expectations were probably too high for the place which is why I walked away quite disappointed..... Come here for a coffee, hang out for a few minutes then leave.  Don't expect any real/good food."}
{"text":"Seeing some of the lower star reviews was interesting for me because I only have ever had great service at Tommy! 

This cafe is located in Old Port, one of the only cafes within the area. It has a beautiful all white/classy decor. The drinks are always delicious, I can't speak for the food as I have never order any yet. I have read that some people find it expensive however you have to remember that this cafe is located in one of the biggest tourist locations in Montreal and you are also paying extra for the ambiance. 

Tommy is a great place to relax or chat with friends! 
My only compliant is that it is extremely hard to get seating."}
{"text":"In love! I'd like to transplant this local Montreal coffee shop and bring it back to NY with me.
A co-worker and I walked in and immediately see a million delicious pastries to our left, and two our right two levels of seating and ceilings draped with lush green plants. The menu had a good list of coffees, teas and fresh squeezed juices (I ordered the pear juice and when I saw it I felt like I was at a tiki bar!) We ordered drinks and avocado toasts (+egg and prosciutto) and took our number up to a table. 
The first floor was all mirrored walls, making the space feel like it went on for infinity, but it's actually pretty small. The tables and seating was all mismatched going for a cool found objects kind of theme. On the upper floor we were able to claim the corner with mismatched couches and an antique coffee table. Our food was brought up to us by their super friendly staff and we enjoyed a quick breakfast here before making our way on for the day!"}
{"text":"Beautiful cafe with high ceiling and plants. It's very airy when I arrived since they opened the front door. On one side of the stairs to the entrance they put cushions for people to sit on. Good latte and croissant with coconut inside, although it was a bit packed and not easy to find seating."}
{"text":"J'adore toujours autant l'endroit du point de vue de l'ambiance, mais le personnel semble de plus en plus s'asseoir sur le succès de la place. Le service s'est vraiment dégradé tout au long de mes dernières visites... Triste. Aussi, ils offrent des muffins sans gluten, mais les contaminent avec les mêmes pinces qu'ils utilisent pour les pâtisseries avec gluten... Pas fort."}
{"text":"Stopped here before checking out of our hotel down the street. Got a latte and avocado toast. Both were fantastic. The shop is super trendy and beautifully decorated, it was fun to sit and eat the meal if only for a few minutes!"}
{"text":"I've walked by the original location of Tommy's Café in old Port many times. This second location I came across spontaneously after running a 5k. We had no reservations and they were quickly to accomodate our group of 3. 

The decor reminds me a lot of the current Lov, café Parvis styled restaurants. Is it nice? Yes! Orgininal? Not really. 

I enjoyed the menu - since I was having dinner that same day I kept it light. I ordered a bloody orange mimosa which was great (5/5) along with an order of Greek styled avocado toast (3/5) that came sprinkled with Chili flakes, raw onions, baby tomatoes, lemon and feta. Afterall that - the dish was still very bland. Still filling. I ordered an English tea after my meal. My bill came out to 30$ with tip.

This is definitely a nice summer spot, but just for a drink."}
{"text":"Good food...nothing unique or spectacular. Tourist prices. Cute quirky ambience. You order from the counter and they bring the food to your table."}
{"text":"Chrissy is fantastic, she was very helpful and soooo funny. This cafe is amazing and much better than Starbucks. We will be back here for sure. Great ambiance and a lot of young people. Love it. 5 stars."}
{"text":"Very cute little café and I use the word \"little\" in a literal term. It's quite a small place. Atmosphere is nice and welcoming. A little pricey in my opinion, but the coffee and moka were good and the avocado toast with salmon was delicious(my toast was a little more crispier than I like) but never the less it was good! The place fills up very fast so I suggest you go there early and get a seat! Its close to the old port,so I would defiantly suggest checking it out instead of your average Starbucks!"}
{"text":"This place feels a bit too overpriced to me. I had a salmon bagel which was tasteless and was a very small portion (for 9 bucks). Coffee was ok - nothing outside of what you would expect for any cappuccino. This is a pretty touristic area as Notre Dame is very close to it so you are mostly paying for the location and the environment - which has a nice personality btw. I really wish the food could catch up with the rest."}
{"text":"Highly recommend this cafe. The decor is beautiful. Coffee and food were very good. It's located in a nice area of Old Town right near Notre Dame with a good amount of seating, and washrooms. Overall dreamy place! We felt like we stumbled on a treasure after finding it! Definitely instagram worthy."}
{"text":"Great tasting coffee, excellent customer service and the cutest coffee place I've been too!"}
{"text":"LOVE this place. It has a basic manu, toast avocad, salmon and Eggs. Yummy pastry, great coffee, great ambiance and just lots of fun. Wi fi doesn't always work so if you are thinking of bringing your laptop to study I wouldn't rely too much on their connectivity. This place is 2 floors but it's packed most of the time. I recommend for a fun and casual outing with friends in the old montreal."}
{"text":"I've heard great things about Tommy, so I visited it on a Friday evening with my girlfriend. If you're looking for a nice little café, there's a lot of those in Montreal. Like Crew Collective and Café, Tommy offers that quaint café experience in a historic building.

It's a cute little establishment, with mirrored walls and small tables and window facing seating. It's quite small, so it's not ideal for large groups, but you can find seating if you're 1-3. 

I ordered a macchiato, and it was delicious as expected. If I lived closer, this might just be my new coffee stop. Can't wait to come back and try their avocado toast with an egg!"}
{"text":"Great way to start the day! Food was good. The decor is relaxing, pretty and green. It's a great corner location, right next to a church. You order at the counter then pick up your drink. Your sandwich/breakfast will be delivered to your table. Great location to relax or meet friends. I had the avocado Croissant sandwich with procuitto and egg. DELICIOUS. I would definitely get again. Must be able to walk up stairs to enter the restaurant and then to seating."}
{"text":"Tremendous cafe, the best -- some people say. Coffee is excellent and so are the pastries. Good service. Wifi. All that stuff."}
{"text":"This is my favourite cafe by far! I'll be coming back as a regular for sure. It's a pretty recent location that opened only two years ago. I am a very health-conscious eater and was pleased with their selections on their menu! First time around, I ordered a multigrain toast topped with an avocado spread and topped with cayenne pepper flakes. It was simply delicious! I really adored everything about this place; the interior layout, decor, food, service, lighting, coffee and their music most of all. Really good selection in music. Definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a cafe to work from or simply grab coffee or lunch with a friend."}
{"text":"I am madly in love with our Montréal's cafés. Tommy is another one to get on my favorite list of cafes. It's situated in the heart of old Montreal. From outside, the place seems humongous, but when you are inside, it's a two floor café, and it occupies 1/4 of the building. The decor inside is absolutely lovely. It feels you are in the tropical, with plants, pineapple as decors. The place is very well illuminated by the natural light coming through the big windows. The color scheme (principal ones white and green) brings out the theme of nature. There are small couches on the top floor, few benches here and there. I placed myself by one of the window seat. The counter to order our food is cute, as mentioned earlier little tropicana. From the cashier, to the barista girl, to my server...their services were friendly, helpful and very nice. I took a toast with avocado, chili flakes and smoked salmon. It was excellent. I also got a latte and chocolate pistachio croissant. It was decadent. I was at the café about three hours, working on my project. It was nice; the background was music was good. They also have free WIFI, and you will find password written everywhere. Before leaving, I took a chai latte for take out. Delicious! Will definitely be back."}
{"text":"J'ai pris take-out, mais mon allongé était très bon et le croissant au choco était très généreusement fourré de Nutella, alors j'en suis très satisfaite."}
{"text":"Love this place! Their crounuts is amazing! It's nice to come and do study, meet up friends and quick take out. Their decoration is so cute and clean. They are always busy but still give food and drink without delay and mistakes! Been this place since they opened and never made a mistake on my order despite how crazy busy it can be! Tastes A+. Cleanness A+. Friendly A+. Overall, A+++++"}
{"text":"Beautiful decor and great drinks & food. Price is a little high but its definitely a must if youre visiting montreal. Great ambiance."}
{"text":"Tommy is really more for the atmosphere than for food. As a \"tourist\" from Toronto, we were very intrigued by the interior of the cafe when we were passing by and decided to give it a try. Food and drinks were okay, nothing special, so it was a bit overpriced for what it was. It would be a nice place to chill for a few hours though - and i saw that they have all you can drink simosas for like $24!"}
{"text":"Super espace et bouffe à la hauteur de mes attentes!
Un peu brillant à certains endroits mais cela vaut la peine d'aller en haut ou en face de la caisse dans la section plus cachée.
J'apprécie l'esthétique et le design intérieur.
Le London fog était vraiment très gouteux. J'ai rien à dire!"}
{"text":"Oh, Montreal!  You're making it harder and harder for me to name my favourite café here in town!  This is now my faaaaavvvveeee café ever!  Come alone, or come with a gf, or even bring a date!  Just walking to the door will put a smile on your face.  During warmer months, there are pillows on the steps for you to sit and just people watch.  Grab a seat inside instead and just bask in the glories of this place.  There is a balcony, or mezzanine like, floor as well, and that's where the washrooms are. 

So funky, so fresh, just simply welcoming.

No filtered iced coffee, but have tried their iced americano, and a donut topped with nutella.  The americana was on point and refreshing.  I shared the donut, but should have gotten 1 each ;).

There is wifi, and when I came here on St Jean Baptist holiday (June 24, 2017), there was an English sign that said \"All you can drink mimosas for $25\"!

Each seat throughout the place really gives you a good vantage point of all the details that makes this place so unique.  There really is so much character. 

If posting pics is what you like to do with your hot beverage, then grab a pen or Sharpie and fill in the blank on your stamped cup - sometimes there's a box for you to write in it ;)."}
{"text":"Sandwich and soup were warm, fresh, & delicious. Latte could have had a little more flavour."}
{"text":"Not the greatest coffee, also very pricey for what you get. Don't think will be going back. Start bucks still better imo"}
{"text":"Mon Dieu qu'est-ce que j'aime cet endroit ! Tommy est un coffee shop qui a ouvert il y a seulement quelques mois et il est déjà un lieu incontournable de Montréal ! Et c'est EXACTEMENT l'idée que je me faisais du coffee shop de mes rêves ! (oui oui)

Tout est parfait : la déco, l'accueil, et en plus, il y a du choix ! Pâtisseries, boissons, café, thé, salades... Je me suis laissée tenter par un thé chaï latte et un cookie à l'arachide et au chocolat : un pure délice !

Effectivement, les prix sont assez élevé mais la qualité est bien là ! Courrez-y :)"}
{"text":"We were in Montreal for a weekend and ended up twice here for coffee, the I had the Cubano both the times and my wife loved the selection of teas nice little sitting place that I would hv loved to hang around and read !!!!"}
{"text":"Vraiment \" instragramable \" comme café mais il n'y a jamais de place pour s'asseoir. De plus, les prix sont un peu exagérés pour ce que tu as côté quantité et qualité. Toutefois, il est très bien situé."}
{"text":"I was looking for a good breakfast place when I was in Montreal. This is definitely one of my favourites!

I usually don't eat a lot for breakfast. A cup of coffee or tea, and a little snack will do.

According to the reviews, the 'cado toast is definitely something you need to order. So I did just that! 

I had a chai latte and brought it to my seat. The chai latte was pretty good. I liked the cinnamon on top. 

A few minutes later, the avocado toast graced my table. It was bigger than i thought, which was great! Considering you can get a smaller piece of avocado toast in Toronto for the same price (or even more!), this was a steal. My plate was taken up by most of the toast. It had sesame seeds that provided a little crunch and texture. The bread was soft but toasted. The avocado was creamy and fresh. The flavour was extraordinary. 

Listen, you can make a really crappy avocado toast or a really good one. This was the best. The crushed red pepper flakes and the salt made it perfect. The lemon wedges and rosemary (?) on the side was delicious. The lemon cut the creaminess. And the olive oil brought out the creaminess in the avocado. 

The service was delightful. The atmosphere was amazing! High ceilings, rustic furniture, sofas, many designated seating areas, and plants + flowers made it a great experience. 

Truly relaxing."}
{"text":"A good breakfast place! A little on the pricey side. We spent about $30 on 2 toasts and a latte. I ordered the sweet toast with glazed peaches, goat cheese, and honey and my husband ordered the more savory avocado toast. Heads up, you have to pay extra for any other toppings other than avocado.

The location we went to was pretty small. It was a little difficult to find a table but we did manage to snag one after waiting for some people to leave. But most people there had their laptops and looked like they were planning on spending all day there.

My toast was good but I was still pretty hungry after. I don't think it was worth the price. It was unique, though. 

A popular item on the menu that we saw everyone else order was the croissant breakfast sandwich with egg and other toppings. It looked very filling so I think that should be the item to order if you come visit!"}
{"text":"Sweet cafe on the corner just by the church, friendly staff and upbeat vibe.  Service was quick and the pastrys delish. There's an upstairs loft area that you can linger and relax, listen and ppl watch !"}
{"text":"Concerning the breakfast, its a kind of \"café\", if you are a type like me that love to have eggs, bacon and those regular breakfast stuff, skip here, as the maximum of eggs that you can get is an egg into your croissant or toast that already is costing you 10$ for it.
Place is beautiful but I love here for happy hours, got really disappointed for the breakfast... :(((
Cost us over 46$ for a breakfast with only 2 toasts, a cronut, a danoise, one juice and 2 coffees!!!
 
Service was slow and they even forgot to prepare for our coffee, they also never got us any napkins or utensils"}
{"text":"I found this place to be overhyped. Not quite as amazing as everyone says, but definitely a place to get a solid coffee and take some pretty social media pics.

It is decorated nicely in the hipster modern whatever with marble, white, hanging plants, etc. 

Warning - this place is actually quite small. That is a big mirror over there on the wall. So before you walk into the mirror thinking you will go sit far from the door, think again. Typical trick to make a space seem bigger and brighter. It works. It looks HUGE in here. Just don't get confused...

Caffeinated drink I had was good. You can get alcohol here too if you want. 

Service typical of Montreal - adequate, never that friendly. If you ask them a question, their response is like it took a lot of effort to reply."}
{"text":"Beautiful cafe with high cielings, lots of light, potted plants and marble tables. My latte and bagel with salmon and goat cheese was delicious. Service was friendly."}
{"text":"Its nice big coffe shop in the old port, good cappucino and interesting pastries. Crowd was mostly young students/traveleres stopping in for the wifi. Definetly worth it!"}
{"text":"Wonderful cronuts...  but their coffee situation is a mess.  Ordering in?  They serve your steaming hot coffee in a GLASS that conducts all the heat.  Ordering to go?  The lids don't fit, the coffee spills everywhere with each step you take.  Almost ruined a nice pair of pants because of this place...  Also there were grounds in my coffee.  My wife's quiche was tough and had grill marks in it.  Good ambience and music though.  Would come back ONLY for baked goods."}
{"text":"The cappuccino was excellent and the decor and vibe inside is beautiful. I had the almond croissant which was good but I've had better, hence only 4 stars. But overall worth a visit while in Montreal. And there is free wifi which always helps when visiting another country!"}
{"text":"Cute small Cafe near the Notre-Dame Basilica of Montreal. Their coffee is great and the food as well. Only thing I didn't like that much was the fact you had to carry your own drinks to the table and sometimes it's a very heavy cup to the upper floor."}
{"text":"Located at the edge of Old Montreal, it's a small, picturesque place. 
They had a good assortment of sweets. I tried their matcha latte, brioche, and Nutella cronut.
The pastries seem to be store-bought, at least the brioche is as I've seen the exact same thing at another place. Regardless it was good, same for the cronut. Matcha latte was good too, I'd order it again! They make it fresh with matcha powder on the spot. 

Their prices are definitely not cheap, but affordable for occasional outings.

Super cute, cozy comfortable environment, friendly service."}
{"text":"Situated in a historical building (British Empire Building in old Montreal) Tommy cafe looks very appealing.

The cafe presents coffee classics such as croissants, sandwiches, juices and of course different types of coffees.

I personally tried a large Cappuccino presented Italian style in a glass which I found really nice. Good coffee, perfect milk combination.

My 11 year old son tried a beautiful French croissant that he found was good, not too crusty, not too soft. He also tried a Dose fruit juice named \"Zest\" - of course he enjoyed that.

The setting is a mix of a European look with a kind of madman touch - the mix works.

So all in all, Tommy Cafe doesn't reinvent the cafe, but does make it very appealing."}
{"text":"Beautiful interior. Lovely space to be in. Their pastries look fresh and delicious - am yet to try. Sadly, their coffee is not my thing at all. Milky and flavourless. I willed it to be better as I love the place and would want to go back. Perhaps I'll order a pastry next time."}
{"text":"Best Latté we've had yet in Montreal, and they also do tea right (loose full leaf in a filter pot)"}
{"text":"We ordered the breakfast sandwich of the day, salmon bagel and two chocolate croissants. We washed it all down with a couple of hot chocolate, a mocha, and a cappuccino. Great breakfast in a beautiful spot. Free Wi-Fi to plan the rest of our day was a plus."}
{"text":"Annoyed and disappointed by the lack of customer care. I won't go back."}
{"text":"I love this little shop. The decor is gorgeous and the service was prompt, friendly and welcoming. I ordered an egg sandwich and was informed they were out of prosciutto so would be replacing it with other ingredients which turned out to be totally fine and lol I don't even know what they replaced it with but it  was all delicious. I also ordered a chai latter and YUM. It's such a cute place to sit, drink, eat and read or do work. I would love to return here."}
{"text":"The café is beautiful, I won't belabor that point any further.

The cons, for me:

- Seating. If you don't want a seat with your food and coffee, great. If you do, get those elbows ready! 

- Other patrons. Clearly people needed seats and yet a lot of people had their sh*t in seats next to them. ...good to know you think your purse and coat are more tired and deserving than your fellow (wo)man. More dick-ish than DC even and that's saying something.

- Pastries were okay, but not great.

- The drink I ordered was really small, especially for the quality and price.

- The music. I liked it, but it was a bit schizophrenic volume-wise and genre-wise. Suddenly it was twice as loud and some pseudo-angry Germany-esque screamy song. My only guess was that maybe it was some sort of clearing technique to get the \"been here 5 hours and counting\" crowd to clear out and make room for more patrons with more money to spend?

Not sure I'd come back...now that I've gotten my IG picture. ;)"}
{"text":"What a fabulous little café! Really gorgeous refurbishment of a beautiful old building - what is it? A former bank? The foliate woodwork around the ceiling is accented by a massive chandelier of leafy vine plants hanging over the main interior. Multiple levels give you plenty of gawk-space for people watching, and people-watching you will do! Excellent vintage blues playlist and delicious espresso. Tattooed beauties of all genders are the prominent feature amongst the clientele. Also, can it get more hipster than AVOCADO TOAST? 
Seriously, though, we were super happy to find this spot, open early, right in the heart of Vieux Montreal. Revved on a double shot, I'm inspired to go get more ink, like, today!"}
{"text":"Unfortunately we weren't able to get a seat at Tommy either time we went because it was so packed, but it was right up the street from our Airbnb so we hit it up twice while we were in town. The lattes were creamy and delicious, and the cronuts and canneles were to die for. If I lived near here I can imagine spending lots of time relaxed at one of their tables overlooking the street, provided I could get a seat!"}
{"text":"Nice, bright and spacious cafe. The chai latte was nice but a tad too sweet. The grilled cheese sandwich was awesome though and the lemon cake was lovely. If you're in the area, definitely stop by."}
{"text":"It's a nice coffee shop in downtown montreal next to the iconic notre dame church. Coffee is a bit strong to my taste, they also have a selection of pastries. 
I like their mezzanine, as well as the pending plants coming down from the ceiling , and the wooden stairs."}
{"text":"Very cute cafe in Old Port! There is background noise but it's not too loud so it's a good place to do work or sit down and chat. They also have super tasty breakfast menus and pastries, but the price is a little more expensive than a usual cafe. Also, beware if you're going on a weekend because it's a small space and can get really busy. I still come here regularly and I love the nice atmosphere, music and design but the business&price is something you could look out for!"}
{"text":"Customer service is key with any business. The staff at Cafe Tommy have proven to be careless based on experiences of myself and friends. It is not enough to have a well decorated space with IG appeal. There is only one Batista who makes proper coffee and is kind. The others are unapologetic, gossip behind the counter and require basic customer training. In the photos, I've shared an example of this disrespect Cafe Tommy showed via social media to a friend of a friend. 

I have never been compelled to write such a review for any business. However, I don't support this attitude. Especially when my drink costs almost $5. But more than this, because the attitude reflects the management's mentality. Dear Cafe Tommy, You won't survive without customers. 

#NoAssholeRule"}
{"text":"Super cute cafe located in Old Montreal district, very close to the Notre-Dame Basilica. I loved this place's historical architecture. It is a great place for brunch. I recommend their avocado toast and matcha rose latte."}
{"text":"This place is awesome!

*The Coffee a tasty
*The space engaging, decorated, and unique, clean(checkout the marble surfboard on the top floor!)
*The staff friendly and genuine
*The music(when I was there) was a mix of slightly off the beaten hip-hop and trapy rnb 

I co-worked with friends for a good couple of hours and it was time well spent. Really couldn't ask for anything more tbh"}
{"text":"Amazing location. Amazing prices compared to other coffee shops around the basilica. The most inviting garden-like atmosphere. And very friendly accommodating staff. Excellent all around."}
{"text":"Adorable little coffee shop- one of the best cappuccinos I've ever had. If you can snag a table, it's a perfect place to watch the city with a cup of coffee and a pastry."}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere, great food, excellent service. Very close to notre dame basilica. Highly recommend eating breakfast there."}
{"text":"Reasonably priced good strong coffee, fresh juices, delicious pastries, lovely interior. Front staffs are nice too. 

Only downside is that they don't serve hot drinks in a mug, they serve it in a round glass cup so better watch your fingers when you grab them!"}
{"text":"I really really really love this cafe. The food didn't tempt me, the latte was lovely but not the best I've had in town, but the energy is freaking wonderful. The room is so beautiful the way it lifts upwards with its twisting stairs, incredible old moldings, bright plants and so much light. Mostly what thrills you when you are here I think is to see an historic and gorgeous piece of architecture used in such a smart, modern, welcoming way. There are lots of different kinds of seating and the cafe is full of lots of different kinds of people, not just hipster coffee snobs, all kinds of cultures and ages seemed tucked throughout working, talking or cuddling over coffee. Tommy is part of a shift that is happening in Old Montreal, away from a dangerous and boring slide into tourist traps, and into a flourishing of bars, cafes and restaurants that actually speak to local tastes and rhythms. There are some weirdo bits of decor that feel like someone checking off a list of pinterest hipness: bike! typewriter! Danish modernism! But whatever, I do like a lot of those things so who cares."}
{"text":"Ok so this place, besides being in a very touristy neighborhood, is awesome! Food and coffee are good, and the staff is great. The verdant decor is very very enjoyable, and the top floor is so cosy that its surprisingly easy to get some work done!"}
{"text":"Came here a while ago and really enjoyed it but it seems to have gone downhill lately. Still one of the coolest designed spaces to sit and have a coffee, but unfortunately the coffee itself wasn't great."}
{"text":"Only went once because the decor was enticing me after having seen it on Instagram. Have yet to return because well, there's nothing really that's bringing me back. The staff was okay, but maybe that was because we arrived an hour before closure. 
My chai latte was way too sweet and had way too much foam but I guess I should specify these things?
The decor, which is what I came for, did not disappoint. But like I said, it's a sort of one time thing for me."}
{"text":"Nice, chill ambiance with a cosy feel. Staff is courteous. Lunch menu is rather simple, there are only 4 sandwich choices with the top three being most popular. Hence, there's not that much traffic during lunch hour. 

I really enjoyed the vinaigrette and the bit of heftiness to the leaves. Sometimes, there's just too much spring mix salad served in restos. 

I ordered the Cordon Bleu sandwich for $13. It's pretty filling due to the portion of chicken breast."}
{"text":"One of my favourite spots in Montreal! 

I got a chai latte when I was there a few days ago, and it was pretty small, but also really tasty. The menu is on the pricey side (only reason why I give it 4 stars), but I'd honestly be willing to pay for the atmosphere alone. The decor and building itself are beautiful, and their playlist was perfect -- as soon as I walked in they were playing one of my favourite SZA songs!

The place was super busy even for a Monday afternoon, so you might want to come at an earlier time to get a good seat. Service was great and really fast, and I liked how my latte wasn't extremely hot so I could drink it right away.

I'd definitely recommend this place to anyone who's in the area, or who wants a cute Instagram picture :)"}
{"text":"Trop trop en amour avec ce café du vieux-port! L'endroit est tout simplement parfait! Accueil chaleureux, employés charmants, et café délicieux! Et que dire de la décoration épurée du café ! Simplement pour voir le dedans vaut le détour! On se croirait en voyage, ailleurs! On oublie l'empressement de montréal et on se laisse bercer par la musique alternative de l'endroit ! vraiment mon top 1 de cafés à Montréal :) !"}
{"text":"On a snowy Thursday, I stayed here for 3 or 4 hours to read. The prices are definitely on the higher side - a sandwich costs $10, a quiche $5.75 - but it has a really comfortable vibe with music that is at just the right volume so its not oppressive. There is some serious competition for the booths and window seats, you might have to wait a couple hours for people to leave, and the seating is not all that plentiful. People seem to camp here for the day. 

My espresso was sharp and flavorful, not the best I've had, but certainly up there. My girlfriend had an 8/10 regular coffee and she can be picky about her caffeine consumption."}
{"text":"Le local est super mais le café est juste bon et le service loin du super... J'ai malheureusement été déçue alors que j'avais de belles espérances d'enfin voir un café de type \"chouette café de quartier\" dans  le vieux. Hélas, les pris sont trop élevés pour la qualité."}
{"text":"Tommy: the ultimately photogenic café. This place is perfect to stop by if you want to grab a coffee to go in the old port, and it has a beautiful interior--which is why I gave it a four. You can also grab some great pastries, and a small snack to go, only problem with this place is that also its got two floors, its always crowded and you'll struggle to find a seat. Otherwise, definitely stop by and check it out!"}
{"text":"The bathroom situation needs improvement. No hand paper to dry your hands or air dryer in the sink area.No toilet paper in the actual bathroom but they did have hand paper INSTEAD. The barista wasn't welcoming at all."}
{"text":"Tommy was one of the cafes that was suggested to me by my cousin. She had visited this cafe when she was in Montreal and boy was it a good suggestion. It is a very beautiful cafe with 2 floors and greenery everywhere. Absolutely delicious coffee and food here too.

Mum got the nutella donut and I had the avocado toast. She had been on a cappuccino spree since we got to Montreal so that's what she had ordered. I got the matcha latte with the pretty leaf design on the middle. Food and drinks were very good. I loved how they add the chili pepper flakes on the avocado toast. It was filling and added good heat to a wonderful toast. 

Sad that we couldn't sit more in the cafe because there were not enough spots on the 2nd floor. But we got some cute seats by the window which was nice. The cafe is conveniently located a block away from the Basilica of Montreal. Since this area is a popular tourist spot, the cafe can be popping here too."}
{"text":"This is my personal favorite of the coffee shops I've been to in Montreal. I typically will get a cappuccino which is usually very good. Last time I was here the espresso drinks were VERY dry. I think there may have been a newer girl on bar. I prefer my drinks dry so it wasn't TOO bad but... There was a LOT of foam. Definitely more than there should have been without specifying. 

The esthetic is really as good as it gets. The greenery, the layout, the seating on the stairs. Just perfect. Id do work here all day if I was local.

We also got the avocado toast and the goat cheese toast which may have been a special that day. Can't remember, but it was delicious. Expensive... but honestly quite good. 

This will forever be a regular stop for me when I visit Montreal. I recommend it to everyone."}
{"text":"I've been so many time to the Old Port and never noticed this café! Everything is good and the place is pretty, but the price is a little bit expensive..."}
{"text":"This cafe is really cute. It would be great if the music wasn't so loud. I'm sure it's on purpose so you don't stick around for too long."}
{"text":"By far the most beautiful cafe in Montreal. Ditch Starbucks and start studying at Tommy! The coffee is very decent and the staff is friendly. Lovely experience, will go back.

--Update 9/09/16--

This place has unfortunately become such a scene :( The coffee also isn't quite right...overall quality has gone down, but the decor is obviously still gorgeous. Ahhhh, just when I thought I had a go-to spot nailed down!"}
{"text":"I died and went to heaven when I walked into this beautiful cafe!

I was in Canada for the extended holiday weekend and as we're walking around the streets of Montreal, I found this beauty. 

Stunning is all I can say. The decor was magnificent! My rating is only on the decor. Unfortunately, we were in such a rush I wasn't able to try the coffee or sit down. I wish this was in NY. I'd love to come back again."}
{"text":"I planned on spending the day in Old Town, so Cafe Tommy was a convenient and photogenic spot for a quick breakfast before a busy day.

I ordered a Croissant déjeuner and a soy cappuccino. The croissant was light, crispy and flaky, and the egg was cooked perfectly over medium. The cap was so-so but helped me recover from mild jet lag.

Solid spot!"}
{"text":"Really cute coffee shop with nice decor and an upstairs area with a variety of seating. Stopped in for a quick breakfast before a day of sightseeing. Had the acai bowl which was good but slightly overpriced. My fiancé had the smoked salmon bagel but was also overpriced for the amount of salmon. Overall, solid, decent food but maybe slightly overpriced."}
{"text":"I saw that in 2016, Vogue recommended this cafe to be one of the best places to get coffee in Montréal. I will first admit.. I forgot to get coffee! I was entranced by the chai latte instead and ordered that. I had promised myself to come back for a second round simply to try their coffee, but I didn't have the time unfortunately. I will say that the chai latte I had was really tasty, which I find sometimes chai lattes lack, even though the spice should be a standout in the drink. I also ordered a grilled cheese, which I chose as a result of someone else's review. Hands down one of the best grilled cheese sandwiches I've ever purchased. I should've asked what cheese they used and what they put on their bread, because damn. It was good. It was a bit crunchy, which personally I liked, and the cheese was thick and filled the sandwich. 

To be honest, however, it's Tommy's aesthetic that got me. The care looks like the inside of someone's brownstone in NYC, white with a staircase and all sorts of decor. There's a variety of furniture for desk and seating spaces. I even sat between a candy machine and a bookshelf, there are also outlets if you could spot them. It is a really great place to work, seeing that half of those inside were on laptops, typing away. The natural light is also really lovely, and there are bathrooms, which is always a plus in my book. I really wish I could return, and bring my camera to snap more shots of the beautiful interior. I'll end with a shoutout to the staff here, who switch flawlessly between french and english for customers while remaining attentive and kind. Will I return? I hope so."}
{"text":"beautiful place love the ambience and the coffee is very good been there 2 times, First time was late didn't know the time they close and my friend and I order a soup and a bottle of Bubbly to pre drink before going to a event. After paying and serving us at the table the girl told us they are closing in 15 min ....... and gave us attitude because she want it to leave so we had to chug the bubbly.... let s just say i will never do that again. Second time in the morning was a different girl working she didn't look like she wanted to be there.... when i ask about the menu she said look at the board... i would go back because it s good and so nice but people working there seem to hate it"}
{"text":"I never imagined I would be discriminated in Canada. Owner refused to give me a seat (lied and said kitchen was busy although there were plenty of seats available) and offered seats to the group right behind me."}
{"text":"Don't fall for the picturesque food. Just get the coffee as the wait for the food is 30 minutes plus on average and it's overpriced too."}
{"text":"I used to like this place a lot. The last time when I visited here, i had 3 allongé because the espresso was so good. 

However I visited here on a Saturday afternoon. I had an allongé and my friend had a matcha latte.
My allongé lost its charm and my friend's matcha latte tastes like hot milk. 

The environment is still 5/5 for being so beautiful. But with the inconsistent drink quality, I would call here a tourist attraction rather than a coffee shop."}
{"text":"Tommy, located in the expensive and often tourist trap filled Old Port, surprised me with its' stellar service, affordable menu, and very good food. The interior is fantastically decorated and with windows the open to the street it's perfect for people watching. I only tried one light dish (a smoothie bowl very elegantly served) and although I enjoyed it, I can't say it was fantastic. What makes Tommy worth the visit is the amazing service and charming interior."}
{"text":"Great little cafe for salads and sandwiches on beautiful croissants. The BLT with white cheddar was light, and perfect for a late afternoon snack. 

Try the Jardin d'Eden, with lovely spirals of unusual radish, perfectly seasoned lettuces, edamame, avocat, and fromage de chèvre with red onion. Both are enough to share if dinner is a few hours away. 

Tommy is open all day, while many others in the area open only for dinner."}
{"text":"A great café for catching up with a friend or a casual meeting. Its best quality is it's design, because the space is absolutely beautiful! As a staple for day-to-day though, the coffee is not quite there, at least yet. It is still very new, so the baristas may be new also, but I hope that Tommy can someday become a staple.

My recommendation: sit up the stairs in the loft, get a couple of lattes -- one for you, one for a good friend -- and enjoy the beautifully designed space."}
{"text":"Awesome place. Good coffee. I would recommend both carpaccio and mocha here. Now I am just type so Yelp lets me complete my comment and not bugging me about the comment being short. Anyways, the coffee is good"}
{"text":"This is a great little coffee house in the heart of the Old Montreal district. Even though there seems to be lots of seating, the place was pretty busy, but me and a couple friends were lucky to find a few stools by the window, which is the perfect spot for people watching as you enjoy your coffee.

I had an Americano coffee, which was bold and had great flavor. I paired that with one of their pastries, which looked like a small cinnamon roll, but was more flaky and brittle than what I expected. File this one under, it looked better than it tasted. 

For anyone visiting the city, this is a great place to take a break and enjoy some of the local culture before heading back out to see the sites."}
{"text":"Nice cute place right next to the Notre Dame with excellent breakfast and well laid out. Would definitely recommend the avocado toast with everything on it"}
{"text":"Absolument rien à redire de ce café aux allures de resto-bar branché. On est déjà impressionné à l'entrée par la porte massive, les escaliers regorgeant de plantes et le charme de la bâtisse du vieux montreal dont on a respecté le cachet historique. À mon arrivée, je suis impressionnée par la luminosité des lieux tant en raison de la décoration, des murs blancs que des vitres laissant passer la Lumière extérieure. Je me dirige vers le comptoir pour commander et j'y vais avec mon choix de prédilection un chai latte. On peut tout dire d'un établissement qui réussit ou pas son chai :) et dans ce cas ci je suis bleuffée, a bonne température il est également parfaitement parfumé et savoureux. On y a su comment doser les épices. Vraiment un délice !!! Puis je n'ai pas pu m'empêcher de tester une de leurs douceurs. J'ai failli prendre leur cookie au chocolat qui semblait beurré à souhait et rempli de pépites de chocolat, puis mes yeux tombèrent sur un financier aux framboises!! Aucune résistance de ma part, mon choix était fait hahaha et encore une fois pas de regret. Rempli de beurre, de poudre d'amande et juste assez sucré. Une merveille. L'endroit est agréable, on y resterait des heures, les sofas confortables et on y a disposé des bouteilles d'eau pour la clientèle. Tout à été pensé pour fournir un service de qualité. Ils méritent leurs 5 étoiles largement."}
{"text":"Some of the best coffee I've had in Montreal! Such a great French bistro vibe with great lounge areas! Food was superb"}
{"text":"Fantastic atmosphere, but I was not very impressed. My friend and I came here for lunch on a Saturday around 2pm. They ran out of tomatoes, raspberries, and peaches, which were three of the key ingredients on the toasts we wanted to try. It was surprising to me that a busy restaurant in the heart of a city would run out of essential supplies on a weekend like that. The toasts themselves were expensive as well, around 10-15 Canadian dollars for one small piece of bread. We opted for a croissant as well because it was less money, but it too was not impressive. Very cute decor and nice interior but menu was disappointing."}
{"text":"Confession: yes I did come here after seeing pictures of the beautiful interior on Instagram. yes I have was super basic and ordered a cronut and chai latte...

Tommy is cozy with a beautiful aesthetic. Their drinks and food are pricey, but it's vibe and location in Old Montreal (not to mention free wifi) make it a great cafe. The cronut is a bit sweeter than those in New York but the texture is pretty on point."}
{"text":"I stumbled upon this place, wasn't even aware that Tommy was opening a second location. 
I'm not entire sure if I caught them at freshly launching/opening period or not, but there seemed to have been a bit of a \"struggle\"

The place is very cute, I really like the decor. Hobo chic, or whatever we call them now, seems to be the trend as of the last couple of years.

The staff was friendly, courteous and a little  \"confused\" at time but nothing that would ruin an experience. 

I ordered an americano & an egg bake with grilled halumi cheese. I memtioned that I would like to have gluten free bread, as it is mentioned that they have the option. 

The coffee wasn't great, it was quite watery. Whatever! I want food! The egg casserole came out, looks good! Apparently there was no more gf bread so they replaced it with a hashbrown instead. Awesome!

I dug and dug \"hmmmm... where is the halumi cheese...?\" So I asked the waitress if it was chopped up in very tiny little bits (LOL!) Oops! Nope, they forgot it. So obviously I was told they will bring it right away (Me: \"huh... don't they have to grill it...?\" Whatever! Bring it on!) 
The waitress came back w a little plate with the cheese slices on it. Not grilled. The poor girl, placed it a bit too far out on the edge, and walked away, n I in slow motion, couldnt save it. The plate fell and shattered. No problem, she came right back with another one!!!! But at this point, I am almost done with my eggs and the not-grilled halumi , well, is just salted rubber tbh. 

They apologized and gave me a cookie on the house. Too bad the cookie wasn't gluten free LOL!

I don't think I would purposely come back just because the food wasn't great. I would go again if there was nothing else around."}
{"text":"Our food guide told us about this place, so we decided to check it out for breakfast during our visit. While it's beautiful with all the hanging plants, the place was a total cluster. There was really no space for the line at the counter, which snaked up the stairs (too cold to spread out the door). They were out of bagels when it got to my turn to order so just got two cronuts and two coffees. The coffees were kind of weak, and like previous reviewers said were served in glass cups filled to the brim, and perhaps to make them easier to carry, the coffees were not very hot. The cronuts were nothing special, they were more like strangely shaped donuts than legit cronuts. Yawn."}
{"text":"This cafe was so cute! The interior is designed so beautifully with seems like 3 floors. There is free wifi and restrooms. The drinks are really good and I'm impressed with the artistic skills making the latte art, especially since both drinks were made with non-dairy milk! I do wish the size of the drink was larger like in a round mug. Their pastries also all looked delicious! I got the chocolate croissant and chocolate chip cookie. Definitely recommend the croissant!"}
{"text":"Great avocado toast.  A bit expensive for what it was.  Service was fine but menu was only in English on some menus that weren't easily found, which caused a bit of a mess-up for us."}
{"text":"Slick design and a good vibe greets you right away. The pastry were nice and the fresh juice was exactly what the doctor ordered after drinking in Vieux Montreal. If you find the time pop upstairs and hit the couch. It's a good place to meet up mid day."}
{"text":"First time in Montreal and just had to go here twice. They have a small selection, but their coffee is great, their baked goods are delicious (try the almond or chocolate croissant ) and the Instagram worthy ambience alone is worth it. Staff is super nice and it's smack in the middle of landmarks like the Notre-Dame and Old Montreal."}
{"text":"This is a really great spot in old Montreal for coffee, brunch, desserts, or just if you want to chill. 

Situated right near the Notre Dame is Tommy - a cool, hip  cafe with soaring ceilings and very aesthetic plants. 

They have a small menu but they'll definitely be something for everyone - from their kronut to their avocado toasts to their ice lattes - you'll definitely find something you enjoy. 

If you're in a hurry you can get takeout, but it's a really nice atmosphere to sit in. I've been multiple times and have had various things - but their baked goods are quite good I have to say. 

This is one of that fewer places which has matcha lattes in Montreal (matcha presence is slowly growing), so I had to get an iced matcha latte here. I also tried the brioche and kronut...

The latte was not overly sweet and good quality matcha...and the brioche was very tasty! 

I'd definitely recommend this cafe when visiting old Montreal!"}
{"text":"Je dois l'avouer j'ai été agréablement surpris. Le Tommy Café est un véritable plaisir pour les sens. Son décor éclectique chic convient parfaitement pour ceux et celles qui veulent prendre une pause dans le vieux port. Avec un menu limité en ce qui concerne pour la bouffe, il ne déçoit pas en terme de goût. Par contre attendez-vous à voir beaucoup de va et viens, on se retrouve quand même  dans un coin touristique. Je le conseille fortement si vous cherchez un endroit pour papoter devant un café ou bien échanger des idées ( l'architecture qui vous entoure est tout simplement inspirante!)."}
{"text":"Le café Tommy vaut le détour pour sa décoration principalement. En effet, l'endroit est superbe avec un beau plancher au sol et une dominante de blanc que ce soit aux murs ou dans les objets décoratifs. Il y a aussi une profusion de plantes et de bouquets de fleurs, mais le tout n'est pas oppressants bien au contraire puisque le café est assez grand et avec une sorte de mezzanine. 
Le café est bon, le thé aussi mais tout est cher comparativement à d'autres endroits. Bref, c'est un café à voir, je suis contente d'y être allée, j'y retournerai peut être pour le faire découvrir à des amis, mais je n'en ferais pas mon endroit de prédilection."}
{"text":"Le café est génial pour y être, la décoration est au top, je pourrais dire top 3. Le seul hic le latte aurais pu être meilleur mais ambiance fais tout. À recommandée"}
{"text":"Magnifique intérieur, un des plus beaux cafés à Montréal à mon avis, je le côte bien dû au niveau architectural & design, les prix sont chers (expresso + biscuit = 8,05$), variétés de café, expresso/lattés/cappuccinos/chais/macchiatos/cubanos, ils ont aussi des viennoiseries & sandwichs. L'endroit était remplit de gens autant des touristes que des montréalais. Service ok sans plus. Le wifi est gratuit. Bonne pause café ^^

4/5 visité en août 2015."}
{"text":"Such a cool atmosphere! The decor and overall comfort of this place is unmatched. I could have sat there for hours. The pastries are like eye candy and taste even better. The service is optimal and even a long line will move quickly. The only downfall, as with most popular cafes in Old Port, is finding a place to sit without people breathing down your neck. But the food, service and atmosphere make it worth it."}
{"text":"For anyone who has been to Tommy Cafe on Notre-Dame West, which is infinitely beautiful and chic, well Tommy St-Paul is the sister branch that offers great brunch and cocktail and coffee! This new Tommy is so well decorated that you feel like taking pictures of this fairytale-like cafe at each second, there are so many plants and retro style decorations inside the cafe that I just feel mesmerized by its extraordinary and magical beauty. Despite the fact that it is located on St-Paul street of Old Port, it is not so crowded in the week and tourists haven't discovered it yet. The price of the brunch is so reasonable (a few options under 10$!) that I was super surprised. The quality of food was amazing despite the affordable price and their matcha latte always amazes me since it's as beautiful as tasty. They are also vey well known for their mimosa and Cocktail, so please try them out! I tried their smoked salmon bagel and my friend told bacon Benedict bagel, both were excellent! I cannot praise this magical place enough! Gotta love Tommy!"}
{"text":"Their decor is one of the main features, it's very pretty inside. The place is popular spot for getting your morning coffee and pastry. It is a little bit more pricey compared to other coffee places, but the coffee I got was good so it's definitely worth a visit. The service could be improved, that being said, I'd put it on the list of cool coffee places to check out in Old Montreal area."}
{"text":"Loved this place! I came here two times while in Montreal as it was close to my hotel. I absolutely loved the ambiance and the coffee they serve. The avocado toast and the grilled cheese sandwich are also a must if you're into more than a coffee for breakfast. The price point for the food is exceptional; you can't even get a cappuccino back in New York for what I paid for a whole breakfast here. 

If you're nearby, GO! It'd totally worth it. Also, the fact that I could only hear French being spoken around me made me realize locals also love and come to this place. 

Shoutout to the great staff! Keep it up guys!"}
{"text":"Super cute café for studying or hanging out! Great food and coffee. A little slow and no outlets, but super pretty and nice ambiance. Definitely recommend."}
{"text":"Beautiful cafe with great view and decor : ) so close to Notre Dame and lots of people will go there"}
{"text":"Very cool interior! The open space on three levels and the hipster decoration make up for the fact that wifi wasn't working well and snacks are slightly overpriced. The grilled cheese was a little boring but the soup of the day was good. They counted it as a combo so I paid a reasonable price of about $9. They have yummy looking pastries which I'll try when I go again."}
{"text":"The interior is a beauty, perfect place to study. BUT. PRICES. I guess it's simply explained by the art that we call coffee! Quality is good! The mocha was yaass and the cronut (a croissant donut!) was crunchy and Nutella all over and oooh yes! A delish! But beware! IT'S A COFFEE SHOP, SO EVERYTHING IS OVERPRICED, except for a kiss, which the menu says it's free. So yeah, neat and cozy, good food, warm drinks, beautiful neighborhood, everything is spot on! OH AND THE MUSIC THERE!!! OLD SONGS!!! STUDYING THERE WAS PERFECT! Simply a stunning place. If you decide to go to the Starbucks nearby, DON'T, THIS PLACE IS COZIER AND SAME PRICE, FANCIER AND BETTER MUSIC AND COMFY!!!"}
{"text":"First off, the decor, vibe and ambience of this cafe are so nice. Lots of plants, light colours, just a very overall calming and open aesthetic. We had looked at the menu beforehand to see if there were any vegan breakfast options, and it looked like the had an acai bowl and avocado toast. However when we ordered apparently the acai bowl was only served at another location and somehow they were already out of avocado. The lady behind the counter was very nice though, and when we asked if there was anything else vegan she pulled out some vegan banana bread that ended up being really hearty and delicious. I also got a matcha latte and it was great."}
{"text":"This place is am absolute jem! 
It is located right next to the Cathedral and it is an absolutely  gorgeous building. Once you come inside the devour is super cute! It is a mix of old a new. 
More importantly when we came in the girl at the counter was very friendly and helpful, very pleasant even before I had my coffee in me (When I am not at my best). I ordered avocado toast (yes basic white girl I know) and a croissant; they were both delicious!!! The prices here are very reasonable for what you get! 
I definatly recommend this place to everyone who comes in the area!"}
{"text":"Endroit original pour son design , chaises et tables eclectiques, verdure , fenestration et miroirs presents. Presentation des assiettes appetissantes. Place tranquile à part ca :)"}
{"text":"Very overrated by tourists. Not a good place for people who are looking to get things done (students or professionals) or have a casual coffee with friends because it's so loud and the wifi doesn't work. They also ran out of everything around 5pm when they close at 8: there are 2 items left out of all the items on their menu. Most people go there to take photos for their Instagram instead of enjoying the coffee."}
{"text":"Adorable coffee shop in Old Montreal. The place is beautiful-- it's right on the corner with big, cement steps leading up to huge wooden doors. The inside is all white, which gives it a clean, crisp feel, and the decor is so cute. They have a huge hanging plant in the middle of the room, which gives this place so much character. 

I got the chai tea latte which was really good, and the croissants are delicious-- especially the almond croissant. The americano coffee portion is very small-- it's basically just a shot. We had to get another coffee from a Starbucks later on because the small serving didn't get the job done. 

Cute coffee shop to catch up with friends, grab a light bite/get your caffeine fix, or get work done. They have free wifi and comfortable seating. I definitely recommend trying this place out."}
{"text":"Best music! Tall ceilings and tall windows and plants hanging from cooking !! Coolest space"}
{"text":"What a nice little coffee spot! The interior is beautiful with crown molding and very rustic chiq. The tomato bisque soup, quinoa salad, grilled cheese are tasty! Most of all I love the assortment of pastries- the Nutella cronut is delicious! Came back daily many mornings during my Montreal stay!"}
{"text":"I liked Tommy, and would definitely put it up there amongst the best cafes in the \"tourist\" area of Old Port. I unfortunately can't say I \"loved it\" from a menu perspective, even though i LOVE avo toast. Definitely worth a visit if you're in the area, but not worth the trek across town. 

The Pro's are similar to what everyone's saying: decoration (even was a bit decked out for the holidays!), pastries, delicious lattes! Once you order, service is pretty quick!

However, my experience there was sub par...I went on a Saturday morning, and the line was massive! I think they could use an extra cash or a new ordering system. There were many empty tables available. Prices for toasts were as follows:
*$9 for a plain avo toast, extra for tomato, egg ...
*$11-$15 for goat cheese, mushroom etc toasts

Personally, I find this to be fairly overpriced. I was expecting a beautiful plating or a heaping portion, but it was rather \"basic\" in my opinion."}
