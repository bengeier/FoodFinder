{"text":"I am a huge fan of the Falafel King but, I am rarely downtown.  One day in between clients I needed to grab a quick lunch, so I was in the Evergreen area and decided to check out the Donair Grill.  It was definitely a good decision, I ordered a regular falafel sandwich and it sure was great!  Lots of veggies, great falafels and a decent price!  Definitely will be going back if I'm ever in the area again!"}
{"text":"Little bit on the expensive side but it is worth the price for the quality never fails. The chicken and beef donair delicious we also tried their tazikei and hummus both heavy on garlic ( probably wouldn't buy it again). Customer service was excellent and the restaurant is very clean and tidy."}
{"text":"Super shawarma and donairs- my kids always order the extra large just to be assured of having left overs and have been doing this for at least 7 years.   They also sell fresh pita bread.   The owners are very hospitable which makes it a great place to stop into."}
{"text":"Best Donair in town!  Super friendly team and never disappoints"}
{"text":"I don't see what's the raves are about , average at best . The pita is so tough that I literally hurt my teeth trying to chew it , and they are cheap with the meat ( especially the chicken )  I went twice to give them the Benifit of the doubt ( and I love donair) and it kinda sucked both times  The staff is super friendly and nice that's why they got three stars instead of two ."}
{"text":"My first Donair experience was in Barcelona, since then I've had a hard time finding donairs in Calgary that don't make me really sick... I don't remember my first experience at Donair grill but my Second has been amazing.  I got a regular sized beef donair with sweet sauce, tzatziki, and garlic, for veggies I got the works. This was amazing. I mean seriously I usually dread getting donairs in Calgary but this was the best one I've had since Barcelona.   The fries and gravy were something I wouldn't get again though, they were your average Mccains style Crinkle cut fries with subpar seasoning and the gravy was about the same... They could improve a lot on these with wedge cut fries and a house herb seasoning (like Opa fries and a higher quality, lighter, more liquid, less salty gravy or tzaztiki sauce on the side) which is why I dropped a star...  HOWEVER the donairs (which is really why you're going there anyways) are pretty darn good. I definitely recommend trying this place out. We went at noon and luckily they weren't busy...  I hope you enjoy yours as much as I enjoyed mine :)"}
{"text":"Good food!  I enjoyed my dinner from Donair Grill. I had a mixed Donair consisting of both Chicken Shawarma and Beef Donair meat. I didn't think the chicken was all that tasty, it was a bit bland. The beef however was quite good, juicy and well seasoned.   The sizes are a bit weird, the REGULAR is small, the LARGE is a very average size. Just be cautious. I will put a tip as well.  But overall quite good, made fast, fresh and friendly."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Donair spots in the city. Everything is made fresh and tastes amazing! Huge portions and great flavour, I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"My husband and I had lunch there today and it was delicious. I am a huge fan of donairs and I have to say that theirs were extra flavourful.  I love their garlic sauce. The place is really clean and the atmosphere is casual. We will definitely eat there again."}
