{"text":"Their Chicken Biriyani is hands down the best Indian/Pakistani dish I have had in Madison. That taste at about $6-7 is incredible. The Shawarma was good too.
It's a modest place with a limited menu, but the food is amazing."}
{"text":"Reasons why I love Madistan:

The restaurant is super clean.

It's a family run business.  The owner is there daily and takes pride in serving his patrons delicious, authentic food.  He was very friendly and personable.  The owner's wife is the main cook - she makes everything fresh from scratch.

The food is delicious.  We had the chicken biryani, a gyro and beef samosas.  The samosas were to die for.  The beef was seasoned perfectly and wrapped in a thin, crispy wrapper, then fried until golden.  I would order a whole basket of those things.  Just amazingly good!

The prices were very reasonable.

Definitely one of our new favorite places in Madison to grab a quite bite.  Thanks Amin and Naheed.  You are wonderful!"}
{"text":"Came to Madison for work and randomly found this gem, the biryani is fantastic for the price, very well seasoned. The chicken is little dry, but where else can you get biryani for so cheap? AND they have beef samosas which I hardly see at south asian restaurants, the chutney they come with is pretty splendid."}
{"text":"Great place. I have tried the shawarma, gyros, tikka roll and beef samosay, all good! The staff if friendly too."}
{"text":"My wife & I had the chicken tikka, shawerma, somosas & chicken biryani. Wonderfull food for a very reasonable price. My wife says it tastes home made. I agree. Please open in Milwaukee!!"}
{"text":"Decent food that is priced well.   Yummy in our tummy without a big dent to our wallets.   The staff are very friendly and helpful to any in need.
Wish the dining area was more friendly to the buttocks. And the restrooms a tad cleaner..."}
{"text":"GR8 food and reasonably tried. We got the chicken biryani, burger, chicken tikka roll and fried chicken. I would pass on the fried chicken since it had no taste, but everything else was good.

Would like to try their shawarma and falafel next time!"}
{"text":"Honestly, I wasn't expecting much when I saw the humble exterior but I was VERY pleasantly surprised. The staff was super friendly and the food was extremely good. Yum! I would definitely go back."}
{"text":"We drove from Chicago and needed a halal place to eat. The food was delicious!! BEST cheeseburger!!! Awesome chicken tikka role, chicken biryani, fries, shawarma, falafel! We basically ordered everything off the menu. Super cute restaurant."}
{"text":"Madistan is simply, great!  They have really good food, and the people there are so nice.  I came in one morning right when they opened and the lady was super nice in helping explain what everything was, and giving recommendations.  I ordered a Chicken Biryani and Chicken Qorma.  Both super flavorful.  The rice that came with the biryani was delicious.  The chicken was well cooked, and nice and tender for both dishes.  The chicken Qorma was a bit oily for my tastes, but still quite delicious.  Their samosas are also OUT OF THIS WORLD!"}
{"text":"Amin greeted me as I walked in and made me feel comfortable right away - not that I needed much, the awesome smells wafting were already working their magic...

I had heard numerous people tell me how good the food was and they were spot on...

Of course I can't remember the name of the special I ordered - it was that good, my senses were the only internal functions operating at peak  performance (at the expense of my memory!) - but I can tell you the gulob jamun was the best I have tried, by far...

Make a point to stop in and try Madistan, you won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Food was great, the people were even better. People were kind and welcoming-made recommendations that didn't disappoint. Almost completed my order without ordering a Mango Lassie. Glad I was encouraged to try it, delicious. Would be happy to experience this again."}
{"text":"Awesome place! I've only been once and had one of their home-style vegetarian specials. It was super yummy. Well spiced and lovingly prepared. Can't wait to go back to try more of their delicious offerings."}
{"text":"One of the few places in the area to offer halal meat.  Presentation is minimal/basic, but the entr√©es are delicious and inexpensive.  Occupies a specific but welcome niche in Madison cuisine."}
{"text":"Try their specials. Lentil soup was delicious. I usually get the gyro and it never disappoints. Samosas are bomb too."}
{"text":"Came in for a pit stop on a bike ride. 

Shawarma platter was fine. For ~9$ I felt like there should be more protein. This could have been forgiven but the meat and rice were pretty plain. 

The green chutney was the highlight of the meal for me. I was told this normally comes with the chicken tikka so I might come back to give that a try. 

I can't help but compare this restaurant to the Pakistani restaurants in Milwaukee and the Chicago suburbs, and madistan does not compare favorably. 

Order at the counter and the order is called out when it's ready. Bottled water to buy or room temperature tap water for free."}
{"text":"Loved the chicken shawarma and the gyros!  Just delicious! My Sister was able to order mixed dal and this was easy vegan and gluten free.  Was not that impressed with the samosas and falafel,  but the rest was amazing!"}
{"text":"Madistan is a newbie but a goodie! It is a cute little place featuring a small menu of Pakistani/Fusion fast food. The food is cheap, quick and there is no skimping on flavor. For about $5 you can get a nicely seasoned and surprisingly large falafel sandwich with all the right fixins (I always ask for extra tzadziki because I'm a glutton, you prob should too) including pickled vegetables that add a refreshing bit of tang. 

The food here is great but the real draw is the owner, who is wonderfully friendly and welcoming every single time. His energy, mixed with the food quality, has turned me into a repeat customer--and a happy one at that. Cheers to good old-fashioned kindness & falafel!!!"}
{"text":"Bland, uninteresting food.   I am not sure why most people think the prices are good.  I think it's overpriced for what you get.  $5.99 for a meal is well and good, but if you are going by the actual amount of food your are getting for the price, it's not a good deal at all. Much better tasting Mediterranean food (and better price per quantity) at both King of Falafel and People's Bakery.  Avoid."}
{"text":"Just tried it out today as a takeout dinner option and I was very impressed with the cheap prices and the food was much better than expected, it was great really. Especially the bread and amount of meat they give you in the sandwiches. However, if you are thinking about grabbing a bite really quickly it should be noted that from the time I ordered it took about 20 minutes until I got my sandwich and I was the only one in the store. But all in all great food and prices."}
{"text":"Not bad.  The Shwarma was good,  the chicken Tikka less so, and the gryo was fairly generic (but good) but the fries were tasty, and the falafel wasn't overly greasy.  The chutneys were also good.  Now the daal was really nice, as was the fresh made flat bread.  The fried chicken was microwaved to reheat and I'd pass on it.... also expect to pay for water as cups of water are warm tap.  

Having said that the pricing was very reasonable (even though it didn't match the menu or the sign in the restaurant for all item).  The service was very friendly.  And while there is no parking, ita an overall good pick if your nearby, on foot, and hankering for some decent Pakistani and Indian fare."}
{"text":"This little place was a pleasant surprise. I stopped by for a late lunch and got butter chicken which I was told was the best seller. The portion is a bit on the small size but is ok for lunch and the naan bread is filling too. The staff was helpful with answering my questions about the menu. The place was empty which had initially made me hesitant but the food was good. I spoke with the owner a bit and it was nice to hear him gush over how good a cook his wife is, that she cooks with love, and that the restaurant would not exist without her. That was sweet."}
{"text":"Madistan seems primarily oriented as a takeout place serving Pakistani and Mediterranean food. A few daily specials (3 on my visit) and a limited regular menu--e.g., Pakistani rolls, gyros, falafel and fried chicken--round out the selection.  Food is served in styrofoam boxes with plastic utensils.  Limited indoor seating is on backless stools at a counter or high table.  Counter service is friendly.

The dal special served with naan was very tasty and satisfied as a quick, relatively healthy lunch.  The spicy sauce with the chicken achar was flavorful but the three small chicken pieces were very pink near the bone and did not appear to be cooked enough.  This definitely put me off on the dish.  

Overall, Madistan seems to fill a niche for ethnic food aimed at students but is not a place one would go to have a sit down lunch and chat."}
{"text":"Went to Madistan early morning last night... as expected the restaurant was filled with fellow bar goers hungry and slightly rambunctious. Some people were upset by the 5-7 minute wait time. For me the slight wait was not an issue, I wasn't expecting the food to be \"fast food\" and could see my order being freshly prepared behind the counter. A bus boy delivering orders could solve the \"wait\" issue. Although it wasn't a big deal for me. I ordered a Gyro with fries and a Beef Kabob. Both were absolutely delicious.

The Gyro came in a fluffy pita, which made me pleasantly surprised, as middle eastern pita tends to be more tortilla-like and less greek fluffy. The tzatziki was on point, and complimented the flavors of the meat perfectly.  

The Beef Kabob had a slight spice at first tastes, but was not overwhelming or with an unpleasant aftertaste burn. 

I would skip the fries for next time. They were below average, which is my only complaint. They were over fried and burning in temp. 

Foodies in Madison, please go to Madistan. It is the type of local, family owned restaurant that has fantastic food and prices. Perfect for a college town :) 

I will be back!"}
{"text":"Super sweet girls helping their parents (?) run the family restaurant. Yummy biryani. ..portions are a bit small."}
{"text":"Nice Pakistani eatery for a quick grub. Perhaps your best options after a long trip to bar Saturday night. He food is okay but owner was very welcoming and nice."}
{"text":"Ooo, this may be my favorite Madison restaurant on Uber Eats!

I got a falafel combo, and it was spot on. The wrap and fries were delivered crispy and hot. The falafel is crushed down, which I've never had before, but was a nice touch. Sometimes falafel wraps are swimming in tzaziki sauce, but not so here, the ratios were just about perfect. There was even maybe a third-the-normal-width pickel skewer down the middle. Again, never seen that before, but I like it! They even crisped the bread, which is my new favorite thing in a falafel sandwich.

So yeah, lots of love, local place with great flavor. Will def order again."}
{"text":"Was in the mood for some fried chicken so I stopped into Madistan on my way home. Fried chicken was so undercooked it was actually bloody. Their gyros are good, but don't compete with The Parthenon a block away. But they have really good shawarma and falafel for very reasonable prices. Overall a pretty good restaurant with reasonable prices for decently large portion sizes."}
{"text":"Great new spot. As ppl have mentioned, the owner is friendly and funny. Food is phenomenal for the price. Had the chicken biryani special and loved it. Good takeout option for those in the Bassett area. Will definitely return to try another one of their lunch specials!"}
{"text":"Loved the chicken Biryani with a mango fruit juice on the side.  The seasoned rice was memorable, the chicken was tender, and the sauce was delicious and a great contrast to the slightly spicy dish.

The chef was friendly and Amin is one hip and modern restaurant owner.  Sounds like he's got some new things in the works, like a coupon in the cap times and a tandoori oven to make nan bread."}
{"text":"Good food, good prices, fast service even when busy, nice staff. Couldn't ask for more. 
The best thing, in my opinion, is the shawarma. The fries are also better than not only fast food places, but a lot of expensive hipster gastro pub fries. Just the right amount of crunch to core, a good size, and there must be something special in the oil."}
{"text":"Tasty! Big thumbs up for a casual bit to eat! I like that they have specials that sell out quickly, maybe next time!"}
{"text":"My gyro looked like a mess by the time I got it home but it tasted damn good. Also got an order of beef samosas that were good but a bit smaller that I expected."}
{"text":"You will really get mad after eating at this place. When we entered here, we observed that menu options were minimal but then we thought it would be home made like food. We ordered chicken korma + mango lassi =$11. We were hoping food to be good. We get food in a carry box..we open it darn a scoop of rice.. Little bit of salad and chicken korma full of oil. 1 frozen chapathi. Korma tasted stale at least 2-3 days old. I asked for additional paid rice, owner gave one more scoop in a small bowl but did not charge. Looks like they had limited rice and he wanted for his other korma orders.


Big disappointment. 

People - please avoid."}
{"text":"Finally got to Madistan for some great food! It's kind of a strange mix of homey ethnic food and fried things (think spring rolls, samosas, fried chicken), but it was all good enough to work! The chicken tikka roll had excellent quality shredded meat with a yogurt sauce and two decent dipping sauces-one spicy and one sweet. My friend loved his chicken biryani special; he said the rice rivaled Palmyra's! The samosas and spring rolls were both good, not great, but improved with the sauces. The man who took our orders (I think the manager?!) came over to check on us after the rush died down, which was super nice! Be warned that this place is small and fills up quickly. Definitely go for the low prices, flavorfully spiced food, and lovely service."}
{"text":"I am going there again for sure. I had the biriyani, beef kabab roll and the Golap jamun. 
The biriyani was good, portion size is slightly small. But taste wise very good! I think there is still some room for improvement. 
Still I am giving the 5 start specially because of the Golap jamun and the beef  roll. These two are mouth watering. Beef is moist and juicy, very well seasoned and delicious. 
For the gulap jamun I believe this is the best Golap jamun I have tested so far in Madison   

Altogether price wise taste wise I would love to go there again."}
{"text":"I don't get the hype. The food wasn't that expensive, but it was greasy and the portions weren't that big. And right around the corner is Kabul Restaurant or Mediterranean Cafe or any of many Mediterranean/Indian restaurants that serve equally priced food that's better. Sorry, but I don't see the appeal. :("}
{"text":"This place has delicious, authentic, and affordable food. Ive been looking for a good place to get curry downtown and this place fills the need. Order from whatever they have for specials that day and You wont be disappointed. Even the vegetarian dishes are great! Also the staff are all friendly."}
{"text":"I give them credit for trying. It's ok. Rice and chicken were ok. Space itself is clean but lighting is downright terrible. Owner and workers seemed eager to please and seemed like good people. I wish them luck."}
{"text":"Cheap isn't always the same as value.  Yes, Madistan is cheap but I was less then impressed with the quality of the entrees.  The falafel sandwich fell flat as the falafel balls were tough and the pita chewy.  The chicken biryani was well spiced but it was a tad greasy and the chicken rather dry.  Service was great and friendly.  Be warned that this is not \"fast\" food.  I have no qualms about waiting as long as it is worth it.  On my visit, it wasn't.  Maybe an off night so if I am in the area, I'll give it a second try."}
{"text":"Excellent food, friendly family business, and reasonably priced. Good vegetarian options as well."}
{"text":"Falafel was like rocks, tasteless hard charcoals.
The roti was stale.
The \"shawarma\" tasteless.
Awful food. Never again.. much better options in town."}
{"text":"Five stars because:
1. DELICIOUS food
2. Super reasonably priced
3. The nicest staff

1. My beef kebab roll was outstanding. The beef was perfectly juicy and flavorful. The lamb shawarma and fries also taste great.

2. I don't know where else you can get a meal in Madison for 5.99. One of the best values in town.

3. The friendly folks behind the counter are really why I am rooting for this spot. They were polite, smiled and were really helpful.

It's not fast food, so don't go if you need to be in and out in 5 minutes (or call ahead). I really hope they start offering delivery and late night food!"}
{"text":"Overpriced.  They charge you an absurd amount for not a lot of food. I'd recommend Naf Naf or Parthenon instead."}
{"text":"In town visiting the University of Wisconsin and Madistan is right next to my hotel. Amin greeted us with a big smile and great food! Not expensive. Great service. Vegan options! 

I had the shawarma and my fiancee had the falafel sandwich. Both of us were very happy. I admittedly went back for seconds... 

Thanks, Amin! We'll definitely be back : )"}
{"text":"Been here a handful of times and everyone that works there is always very kind and happy to explain the specials. I always end up getting the chicken biryani. It's a great price for the quality food!"}
{"text":"The food is simply amazing! Not to mention super cheap. Also BEST owner ever. Dude is super friendly."}
{"text":"Excellent place. My husband and I both had the Chicken Biryani plate-I wish I took a picture because it was delicious! It's basically 3 small pieces of chicken, rice, and a side salad, so definitely filling. I highly recommend this place and I'm glad I got a chance to wander away from the typical State Street line up of food."}
{"text":"Our group of 10 had a great meal at Madistan. Quick service, although they were out of a few of the daily specials. They took good care of us and even surprised one of our party with one more serving of a special they had said they were out of. All of us enjoyed our meals. Would return again and try a different daily special!"}
{"text":"Stopped in for lunch today. After living in Turkey, I was looking for a place in Madison for some good shawarma like what I was used to. The chicken shawarma was well seasoned and tasty. Workers are very friendly and service is prompt. I'll definitely be back again to try some of their other items."}
{"text":"You can never go wrong with this place, the quality of the food and service is phenomenal."}
{"text":"Big portions and reasonable prices. Everything tastes great! One of the top choices for a quick lunch."}
{"text":"Wonderful fragrance of spices combined with the very energetic and enthusiastic welcome provided by the couple behind the counter!"}
{"text":"Jumped in because it was next to my hotel. Looked good and good yelps. Nice. Mediterranean and Indian select choices too. Indian music to boot. Namaste Baha'i."}
{"text":"I see a lot of good reviews here. I agree with two points. Good staff and good price. Unfortunately for me it ends there. The food needs a lot of improvement in terms of both, quality and taste. The chicken tikka roll had shredded chicken. When I asked why that was, the answer was that was quicker to cook. Not the answer I was expecting. Also, the falafel seemed to be cooked in stale oil.  If they get away from daily specials and focus on perfecting the core menu, it might get better. Good luck!"}
{"text":"Hands down, the most delicious Pakistani food in Madison!! I make sure I go here whenever I'm in town because it outshines all of the Middle Eastern restaurants I've been to in Milwaukee! Owned and operated by a local, experienced family who make high quality, mouth-watering, from-scratch dishes at (very) generous, student-friendly pricing. They're quick to bring out your order and maintain a clean, comfortable environment. Try their mango lassi, samosas, and literally ANY special (all are fantastic). A great place to go if you've never tried Middle Eastern food before - the staff are so friendly and welcoming, and will answer any questions you have. I have so much respect for this business - Madison is lucky to have them."}
{"text":"Great option for a quick dinner or late-night snack.  I tried the falafel platter and was really happy with the chewiness of the falafel and the huge serving size!  The place is very small so I definitely recommend getting the food for take-out."}
{"text":"I haven't tried the food yet but I have been in here for 45 minutes.  It took 15 minutes to get through the 2 person line and I have now been waiting a half an hour for one gyros.  I have no idea what's going on but none of the food requires a lot of prep or should necessitate this kind of wait.  It's not very crowded it just seems super dysfunctional."}
{"text":"Best and authentic Pakistani samosas in town. Their food is very close to real Pakistani home cooking. I tried Chicken Qorma and it was great. The owner is not Mediterranean so don't expect great shawarma or falafel. Love this place and definitely will go back."}
{"text":"Went in for lunch between classes and was very impressed. Food was amazing- fresh, very well spiced, and tasted homemade. The cooks are clearly very proud of their food & they should be! The special (chole puri) was AMAZING. 

Overall amazing quality food for very reasonable prices (~$5) and excellent service. We will definitely be back often!"}
