{"text":"I have been going to Nun Such for years.  They were previously located at Kennedy and Lawrence in the White Shield Plaza. Best oxtail in the city. None of the weird sweetness that some of the Jamaican places in the city do their oxtail.  Daily specials are always creative and well priced. Roti's are made fresh to order.  MUST TRY their jerk pork poutine!  They always have a wide variety of food everyday and a different soup.  Beef pumpkin is awesome!  Some of the nicest guys you'll ever meet run the place. When in the area,  try it.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"My heart aches for these guys.  Nun Such Jerk has been an outstanding little spot in the area for a long time. It was a go-to place for jerk pork sandwiches and more. Hard working brothers, giving it their best shot. The food was delicious. The service was friendly. I will miss this place terribly. One of the brothers had heart problems and that was hard on the business. Either he wasn't there or he wasn't able to work as much as he would like. Its hard for a business like this to just hire new staff. I am sure the business suffered in the last few months. I don't know what triggered the final closing of the place but you could see the battle they were facing. I wish them all the best. You and your restaurant will be remembered."}
{"text":"Best jerk in chicken in the city.  These two brothers provide friendly service. Not really much of a dine in place. If you're in the area, definitely gotta check them out.  Heck I drive into Scarborough from Durham just for their jerk chicken."}

{"text":"**this place moved recently along kennedy in between ellesmere but closer to lawrance.**  When I use to go to Winston Churchill, I frequented this place regularly.   This is probably my favourite Jamaican fast food take out spot in Toronto.  The Jerk chicken sandwiches are to die for!!!!!!!1 My goodness, if the doctor told me id have a 2% chance to live after eating one more Jerk sandwich from these guys, I would take my chances.  Love it.  The guys behind the counter are brothers, one in the kitchen one up front.  They are nice, soft spoken people who cook amazingly well haha.  Whenever you order the dinners from them, they pack it up with food.  I use to order medium Ox Tail and Chicken Stew dinners and they loaded it uppp with chicken.  You get your choice of steamed rice or Rice and Peas, Plantain or coleslaw, and then a meat item of choice.  If you prefer a different type of gravvy (sauce) you can let them know, and they will top it off for you.  They are very accomodating and worth the trip.    If your hungry and you know it, clap your hands.  Than hop into your car or TTC and go visit Nun Such Jerk.  This place roxxors my boxxors lol.   but yeah highly recommended!

{"text":"One of my favourite Jamaican places in the city.  Whatever the soup of the day is, have it.  The jerk pork is always moist and tender.  They often have specials; today were coconut chicken and ackee & saltfish fritters. Yum!"}
{"text":"I had the jerk chicken with rice and peas. AWESOME!!!! Nice amount of taste and spice.... can get real busy so get there early before the lunch crowd gets there....they only take cash so make sure ya gots a pocket full. It cost me about 8 bucks but we'll worth it"}
{"text":"Cash only .. not much of a dine in place mostly just take out .. had spice patty and plantains .. they don't make their own patties which were ok and their plantain portions are big more than the 4 pieces for a dollar .. next time will try jerk pork entree"}
{"text":"Run down hole in the wall places can sometimes hide some delicious treasures.   Woman at the cashier was SUPER shy and had a difficult time with some of my questions, couldn't tell if there was a language barrier or if she just didn't know the answers.  Settled on : - Small order of Curry Goat with rice and peas and a slice of sweet plantain. Curry goat was tender but salty and gamey tasting. - (Fried Basa) Fish Tacos - large crispy panko covered filets topped with a sweet brown sauce then a mayo based sauce, diced onions and red bell peppers and a small sprinkling of cheese served with a wedge of lemon. Peek underneath the filet and you'll see a yummy surprise of curried lentils and potatoes. I hate fusion food with a passion (except Chinese and Indian fusion) but this single dish just might change my mind. My taste buds were confused at first, trying to categorize it: definitely NOT Mexican but can taste Japanese, Chinese and Jamaican influences. I gave up trying to pigeon hole it and decided to enjoy all the different textures and flavor profiles instead. The only thing that I didn't care for was the fish itself (too soft, not firm enough) and the price point: not sure if two tacos are worth $9. - Thick slice of home made pineapple banana bread. Dense and sweet but not overly. Best eaten warmed up with a nice cup of coffee or tea."}
{"text":"I have driven by this place countless times and not noticed it.  But these days I've been more attentive and couldn't help notice what, at first glance, appeared to be a place that sold nunchucks.  After realizing that it was actually a Jamaican Jerk spot, I quickly made a pit stop to sample some of their jerk chicken.  I was greetly by a friendly Chinese Jamaican gentleman who asked me what I wanted.  I told him that I wanted to try the house jerk chicken, and he asked me how much.  It came to exactly $10 including tax for one pound of jerk (just the chicken).  I took it home a happy customer and eager to try the food.  The chicken was surprisingly tasty, and reminded me of the jerk I tried at Negril Jerk Food (up at Middlefield & Markham).  The meat was dark and flavorful.  Since Nun Such Jerk is so close to my home in Scarborough, I have a feeling it will become my go-to Jerk spot."}
{"text":"Wow, what a find! Was randomly in the neighbourhood & saw some good reviews from my fellow yelpers. I had the small jerk pork with rice n beans + goat patty ($10 total) ... very tasty and HUGE portions on the jerk pork (can't imagine what a large looks like). I am a bigger dude and even I didn't finish the entire portion... looking forward to tasty leftovers later tonight :)  Will definitely be coming back here soon & often!  Friendly service. Cash only."}
