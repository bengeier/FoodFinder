{"text":"While on a trip to see my grandparents, we went to Asi Es Mi Tierra for a quick bite to eat. The food is typical for a small mexican restaurant, but the quality and taste is top notch for the price. I had a 2 dish plate with a chicken enchilada and a beef tamale. The tamale was delicious, with pretty much a 50:50 ratio of corn exterior to beef filling. The chicken on the enchilada was breast meat, and it came with beans and rice.

My grandma had a taco salad, and the shell was fried just right. I didn't taste the fillings, but it looked like it used the same beef as the tamale. Also, they have tamarindo juice, which not a lot of places seem to offer.

The meal cost about $13, and I will probably suggest the place to my grandparents the next time I am in town."}
{"text":"Very attentive service.  Simple traditional food.  The waiter noticed my Bills T Shirt and turned on the game for me.  Very accommodating and we're grateful."}
{"text":"This is a diamond in the rough! I had the mole chicken and my friend had the mole enchiladas. Both were delicious. The staff was a little stand-offish but pleasant. The complimentary salsa and chips were great. I will be back."}
{"text":"This is one of those great home made mexican food restaurants that tend to get over looked due to being sandwiched in with a lot of other businesses in strip mall. Google says it's on Main Street but it's also called Apache  Trail. Friendly staff , fast service and very cold beer. Glad We found it."}
{"text":"Very good food, humble surroundings, good customer service. Little joint in an AJ strip mall, feels kind of suspect when you pull up. Don't judge. I had the chilaquiles breakfast plate and a bowl of menudo. I'll be back."}
{"text":"Being from Minnesota, we were looking for some real authentic Mexican cooking. We certainly found it here. We almost didn't go in because we thought it would be a little more upscale, but glad we didn't pass this by. Best chimi I ever had and the prices are less than half of what I would expect to pay. Service was super fast and with a smile. Wish there was something like this back home."}
{"text":"We were sooo happy  when we had lunch at  this restaurant  today.  We've been trying to find a really good Mexican restaurant since we moved to Apache Junction. We had fajitas with chicken & beef.  DELICIOUS, made fresh & served sizzling hot just how we like them. Service was excellent too!  Will be regular customers, and will tell all our friends & neighbors about this great restaurant."}
{"text":"Wow. What a find.  We had dinner here last night and it was fantastic. The food was expertly seasoned and flavorful, the service was spot on, and the prices were (quite frankly) probably too low for the value received. 

I can't wait to go back as I have already identified several other dishes I need to try. 

They have everything from breakfast to dinner - and it all looks good."}
{"text":"Fresh,  authentic Mexican food served promptly by a courteous waiter. It's in a kind of shabby strip mall but don't let that deter you from trying this place. Prices were reasonable, beer very reasonable. We were here on vacation but if I lived here, we'd go there again."}
{"text":"We tried this place because of all the good Yelp reviews. Wow are they wrong! I can think of a dozen better Mexican restaurants in the Valley.

The food was bland and not flavorful at all. Their red sause tasted like thin tomato soup. The meat in the Chile Colorado was tough. And they were out of chips! At lunch time on a Saturday! What kind of Mexican restaurant runs out of chips? Poor management. 

The atmosphere is pretty grungy in a sad, run down strip mall. And that would be OK if the food was any good. The server was friendly enough, which is the only reason I'm giving this 2 stars instead of 1."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place on my first visit. Great chips and salsa, chicken enchiladas and tacos. Mother in law loved her taco salad and husband his chimichanga. Interior needs an uplift/clean, but a great find for the price. We'll definitely be returning! Love these authentic little holes in the wall."}
{"text":"I've been eating at this restaurant since I moved to E. Mesa 16 yrs ago and I have yet to be disappointed! My son and I frequent Asi Es My Tierra at least once a month, sometimes more. Do not let the \"hole in the wall\" atmosphere keep you from trying it."}
{"text":"Delicious food! Very reasonable prices ($3.75 for a margarita, standard cost), great enchilada sauce and guacamole, plus their beans (which taste amazing) don't have lard in them. Lucky to have found this place. Definitely recommend for vegetarians or vegans who are into authentic Mexican food."}
{"text":"Really enjoyed my meal. Just good old Mexican food. Helpings were large enough and tasty. The price made it a definite value repeat. I had three items (soft taco, enchilada, Chile rieno) for $8"}
{"text":"Place was just so so, service was kinda slow and the  food didn't impress, was kinda bland"}
{"text":"If you claim to have the best margarita in the area, shouldn't it NOT be a mix? Cheap margaritas from a mix and pretty small. Joe average food. Salsa had little flavor and no heat. Burrito, beans, rice all okay but nothing special.  My taco shells were thick and hard, not particularly good. All the lettuce was on the plate and would not fit in the shell. The meat was also pretty greasy. Pretty disappointed. I was hoping for a diamond in the rough but it did not materialize. However the cost for 2 people  was under $20."}
{"text":"If you want a fancy fake Mexican restaurant then don't come here. This place is as mom and pop as they come. The restaurant is decorated very simple, it has a home feeling to it. You feel like you're eating in a Mexican home kitchen. 

I was impressed that they hand make their Hochata, not many Mexican restaurants make their own. A lot of them use premade. 

I had the Menudo it had good flavor, it could have used a little more red chili sauce. But that's just me. 

The prices are very very reasonable. The staff is very friendly. I'll come back here again"}
{"text":"If you like Mexican food - this is the real deal.  The Chili Verde with Pork is to die for! Friendly family staff, and lot of locals in a clean, simple restaurant. I'd go out of my way to go here again, as would everyone in my dining party."}
{"text":"Unassuming little place but the food is amazing & it has a full bar.  My husband had the menudo & I had the Mexico enchilada.  Both were great & the beans were just like my abuela used to make.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Love this place!! Combination plate with three items is only $7.95 that includes rice and beans. Very happy to of found this place."}
{"text":"Had the asada taco with salsa and almost fell out of the booth it was a soooo good. Folks, this is a hole in the wall, no ambience whatsoever. Who gives a shit, this food is authentic mexican- not this chain bland crap food served all over Phoenix! Delicious!  Got the pollo mole to go, can't wait to come back to try the nachos with chorizo or the chilaquiles with eggs as recommended by my friend who brought me here."}
{"text":"Good food and service
 Had rellenos  shredded 
  Beef tacos and a cheese enchalda.  All were great! Remindes us of Rocky point..."}
{"text":"Wow this is it! Family run with authentic Mexican food. Unbelievable flavor, we haven't had anything that wasn't good or great. Reasonable prices, great service, and truly authentic food that you can taste was mage with love and passion. Great place for weekday casual meals."}
{"text":"This place has the best chilaquiles I've had in a long long time. Best with fried eggs on top. The service was a little slow but good and I also like that they make michaladas. I've tried a couple other things on the menu but the chilaquiles are the best."}
{"text":"This is not your American Mexican food, this is the real Mexican food!  

We do not eat out Mexican too often since we are Mexican-American, but two busy nights in a row we were too busy to cook.  

We tried Asi Es My Tierra after a clear miss with another place that served canned beans and canned enchilada sauce.  

Asi Es My Tierra, the guacamole, rice, enchilada sauce, everything was topnotch and I would assumed not overly processed canned food.  

The prices are excellent, and we will return for more on \"lazy\" nights."}
{"text":"Good mexican food at a good price!its bit hard to see cuz it hidden in a lil strip mall but if you give it a try you will definitely not regret it lol"}
{"text":"Found this place in yelp and definitely met yhe standards. Good authentic mexican food. Would definitely go back. My husband had the steak picado taste homemade forsure. I had the garlic camaron (shrimp) very delicious. Chees crisp was amazing!!!"}
{"text":"First visit , pass on the margaritas just get a beer. Food was really good. Chicken fajitas, steak picado, ground beef enchiladas and ground beef burrito. Everything was delicious."}
{"text":"I hate writing bad reviews and I usually don't but after seeing all of these 5 stars I'm suspicious. I went in recently for lunch. The salsa was bland. Thick, hard chips. I ordered a cheese enchilada and chicken flautas. Boring. Bland. And my stomach hurt after. I don't know what people see here but I won't be back. If they can't wow me with a few basic items I am not wasting any time or money to try anything else. Plus the service was eh. I had to go up front to pay after sitting there for 10 minutes."}
{"text":"Great little dive Mexican restaurant. Its a little Mom/Pop place and the food was really good even my parents enjoyed it!"}
{"text":"So glad we found this place!! The food is excellent. The staff is very attentive & friendly. We usually get the huevos rancheros.....but everything is delicious."}
{"text":"We really liked the place. Great horchata. OK chips and salsa. Fabulous shrimp fajitas. The service was good. The only downside is the location. It's a bit of a dive. The inside though is pretty cozy, so don't let it drive you off. This place, with its great food, low prices and good service is definitely worth it!"}
{"text":"Love this place. Great family owned Mexican restaurant. The sons are taking orders while the parents are cooking in the back. It's real Mexican food. So the soups are out of this world. The best part is it's so inexpensive. You can eat like a king for under $10."}
{"text":"Great find for Mexican food, hidden in a shopping center.  Albondigas soup , menudo, chorizo and eggs and great ala carte combo....we were impressed.   Margarita and Bloody Mary are also worth every penny.  Nice spice and plenty"}
{"text":"The restaurant was clean, the staff was friendly and attentive, and the food was delicious.  We had the carne asada and chicken fajitas, both of which came out fresh and hot.  The shrimp ceviche was a steal at $2 and was scrumptious.  Fantastic prices for authentic Mexican food.  We will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Worth a try

Thought I didn't absolutely love it, tastes vary and - like most Mexican restaurants - Asi Es My Tierra is worth a try. Their food is good and prices are reasonable. The service was excellent."}
{"text":"Sorry, very disappointing. The Salsa was ok, very mild and watery. The chips were decent, no complaint there. My wife ordered beef tacos and I ordered a Chimy. The beef was absolutely tasteless. 

The red sauce was pale and just as flavorless and didn't even cover the chimy . If you really want flavorful Mexican food.. This is not the place for you. If you cant stand spicy Mexican but you want to see a plate that looks like it has mexican food on it, then this is the place for you. 

The real tell tale sign was when i saw a couple with a toddler that were feeding her spoons of the rice."}
{"text":"Stumbled across this gem while traveling. Craving Mexican food and turned to Yelp. Great Meal. Very fresh ingredients. Will definitely return again when I am back in this area."}
{"text":"Gave this place a try due to other yelp reviews.  I was not dissappointed! What they lack in decor they make up on food.  For $24 my husband and I had chips and salsa, 2 big chimichangas, drinks, and I also had a marguerita."}
{"text":"Not your every day Mexican fare, went with my reviewing 15 yo twins. They eat everything. Must be honest, I had Tamales they looked nice but thought they may have come from a can.  Immediately thought \"where's the beef\" bland taste, refried beans were ok, salsa was ok, thank God for the margarita.  For a strip mall Resteraunt, not the best value for your buck."}
{"text":"Needs a lot of renovation. Nice service. The food is just ok. I grew up eating nothing but crappy taco shop food in San Diego. This was sort of a sit down place so I was really disappointed that the food was worse than filibertos."}
{"text":"If you haven't been here then I don't know what you are doing with life. Looking for an authentic Mexican restaurant? Well here it is. This place hits the spot. From the atmosphere, to the friendly waiters, and to the awesome food. My favorite food there for me would be the shrimp cocktail. No other restaurant that I've been to can beat the price and flavor. Jumbo shrimp! Around 6 dollars for a regular size. The civeche is also amazing. Around 2 bucks for 1. This is by far the best Mexican restaurant I've been to. I'm from California so every time I visit Arizona I always stop by. Im serious everyone check it out. You won't be disappointed!

Ignore the people leaving bad reviews. What I don't understand is that they don't understand why it has 4 stars. Obviously because people love it. Common sense! :)"}
{"text":"The food is sooo good here. The customer service is great they are friendly and always helpful. I enjoy the environment its a good family place. You have to try it for yourself and you will be a fan."}
{"text":"We were not welcome in this restaurant.  The host  claimed they were full but there were obviously open tables.  On a side note...a wonderful family offered us their table and said they had good food.   They obviously need a much more welcoming host, that wouldn't pass up a five top of hungry diners."}
{"text":"good food but their salsa leaves a bit to be desired"}
{"text":"I have been going to this little family owned restaurant for several years.  I try to get there at least once a month.  Portions are large, prices are inexpensive. The menu is fairly extensive.  Saturday and Sunday lunch is very busy.  Don't let the decor fool you. The food is delicious.  Worth a visit!"}
{"text":"Fantastic ! Cheese enchilada with green sauce and hard shell chicken taco (loaded with awesome white meat chicken). Hubby had chicken enchilada with red sauce and chicken taco and loved it. Oh and the beans are great too!"}
{"text":"Decided to try this place after looking at the reviews. Nothing fancy, but the food is amazing. I couldn't believe how inexpensive some of the items were. Kids menu rocked! This is definitely going to be my go to place now on!"}
{"text":"I'm really not feeling this place. I ordered the shrimp cocktail, Carne asada with a cheese enchilada and gucamole.  It was just bland!  Everything was bland."}
{"text":"Hole-in-the-wall greatness in east Mesa of all places.  Chile Colorado and carne asada were both awesome.  Great prices and great service.  Found our new Mexican restaurant"}
{"text":"Love this place! The service is great, food is great, atmosphere is great, prices are great! Its just a win-win. We spent $20 (two meals, shake, and tip) and left extremely full and satisfied! We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Visiting from CA - came here based on reviews posted.  Not good.  First of all, we came at lunch time and they were out of chips even though they say they make them there.  I ordered fish tacos which were very oily, both the fish and the tortillas.  I actually couldn't eat them because it made me nauseous.  Neither my husband nor my daughter like the food, which means it wasn't just me being particular."}
{"text":"Don't believe the positive reviews!  If this is the best Mexican food any of those people have had, then they've never had good Mexican food!  It wasn't the worst place I've eaten, the food was edible, but not good by any means.  Nothing was fresh, the chips tasted like they'd been cooked in burnt oil and then sat out way too long and were WAY too thick, the salsa was ok.  I had two chicken tacos, rice and refried beans.  The rice was dry and tasted like it was a day old, the tacos were nothing to write home about.  My husband had cheese enchiladas, and the red sauce tasted like Campbell's tomato soup.  Service was alright, we came at lunchtime and there were only two other people in there.  Food came within a couple minutes of ordering, so it's pretty obvious that everything is already prepared and just thrown together."}
{"text":"Awesome. Taste like real Mexican food. We got the queso fundido with chorizo, and it was awesome. The salsa isn't that great, but our meals were great. If ever I'm out here again, I'll be sure to stop. Don't expect the most attentive service, but it will do for the small size of the restaurant."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican food I've ever had in Arizona. The portions are reasonable and so are the prices. The food is fresh and they don't overdo it on sauce and cheese. My kids loved it. Looks sketchy from the street and the decor is outdated but I would definitely come here again."}
{"text":"This place is located on an old strip mall. If your not looking for it, you will miss it. 
The inside is bigger than the outside looks,
Older decor. Nothing fancy. Has a jukebox playing Mexican music.You seat yourself. Mario, our server was nice and accommodating.
This is a family owed restaurant. The parents are the cooks. The 2 young men and sister work up front.  The 2 young men that are waiters talked very softly and seemed kinda shy. It was hard to hear them. But nice guys and good service.
The soda machine was broken, so I just has water. But they do have a full bar.
The menu was extensive and the prices were fair to lower than normal.
We waited about 15 to 20 min for our food, and it was worth it. It was made to order. We were giving chips and salsa and our drinks while waiting. The salsa was good. Not too hot.
We ordered enchiladas beans and rice. They were freshly made and the sauce was great. Beans and rice were fresh. Yummo. We are coming back.
I'm giving them 4 stars because, 1) I couldn't hear the waiters, I had to keep asking them to repeat themselves. They need to be a little more outgoing and smile. 
2) the soda machine was broke.
3)the inside decor was.. well, depressing and dark.
4) A long wait for food. It was worth it, but no one came and told us the eta of the food. Plus all other tables were served already so a little too long of a wait in my opinion. But again. Great food, just know you will wait about 15 to 20 min for your meal."}
{"text":"Great place to eat. I enjoyed the authentic Mexican food. Clean and courteous service. Food was delicious."}
{"text":"The reviews were right. Carne Asada street tacos are amazing. Refried beans are definitely the real deal along with perfect rice. In an older strip mall. Bars on the windows but don't let that scare you. They are busy. Families. Couples and lots of carry out. Clean inside. Nice waitstaff. I will come back again."}
{"text":"The food was pretty yummy! The place needs a little TLC...  You might be put off because the place is run down but the food seems authentic and taste good!"}
{"text":"I grew up on Mexican This place is close to my heart.  I even asked the waiter if my Mother or Grandmother were cooking.  It was great!!!  homemade food from scratch.   It brought a tear to my eyes truly.

I have gone back 3 more times with my granddaughters and they love it as well."}
{"text":"Perfect. Fresh ingredients and good service. Really lovely flavors in the sauces and marinades."}
{"text":"Being Hispanic, I'm extremely picky about my Mexican food. This place is fantastic! It's a small hole in the wall place that we found on Yelp. The food tastes home cooked. For appetizers we had the Shrimp Ceviche and the Nachos Supremos with chicken. They were both delicious! For dinner I chose the Steak Picado and my husband had the Carne Asada and cheese enchiladas. Both plates came with rice and refried beans. We enjoyed the savory carne in both dishes. The flour tortillas were homemade and very tasty.  This place will be added to my very small list of good Mexican Restaurants!!"}
{"text":"Best tamales I've ever had! Not dry, and full of flavor. You also can't beat the prices and the $3.50 margaritas all day. My boyfriend and I ordered a couple drinks and tons of food, total came to $26 - we were amazed!"}
{"text":"We have been coming here for more than 10 years and the food is fantastic. Our favorite is the chorizo and eggs it doesn't get better than this! Homemade tortillas, chips and salsa start every meal. The carne asada and the whole fish dinner so good! 
Great food priced right!"}
{"text":"How could I not have known this place was down the street???
Asi es my Tierra is located at the east end of Lipovec Plaza, next to Jacob's Carneceria. The hours are horrible, which really is the only bad thing. During the week, they close at 5, so you can't even go in for dinner. Weekends are 8 or 9. 
This is a small place that is family owned and operated. The menu is small, but includes some seafood and packs lots of different flavors.
The pork tamales are decent, as are the beef tacos. The rice and beans are perfect. The pollo en mole was the best! Tortillas accompanying the food were fresh, homemade and free-flowing. The Carne Asada was hot and flavorful. 
We enjoyed the chips and homemade salsa so much, we ordered a cup of salsa to go! I also thought that the Jamaica beverage was good - not too sugary or overpowering. ..just right.
The bill came and was around $25 for dinner with some salsa to go, so very affordable.  Take out us also convenient! 
We will certainly be back!"}
{"text":"We had the best breakfast this morning. Menudo, chilliquies, Machacha and huevos rancheros. Horchata and jamicha were the best."}
{"text":"Some of the best Mexican food we've had in the Valley. The enchiladas were pretty good, but the carne adovada was the the real star of the show--OUTSTANDING. The tortillas were homemade, tender, and delicious."}
{"text":"OMG! This place is absolutely awesome! Everything we ordered was simply outstanding and the service was excellent! We had queso with chorizo for an appetizer and then Enchilada Oaxaca and Carne Asada for entrees.  Everything was perfectly seasoned and exceeded our expectations. The mole sauce on the Enchilada Oaxaca was the best I can remember. The menu is pleasantly extensive, but our order tonight was so good it'll be hard not to repeat :) The portions were ample and the prices about half what they should probably be. 

My girlfriend and I eat out quite a bit ..,and we can never remember a meal out in which we both took our first bite and laughed because it was so good. We will certainly be coming back sooner rather than later. My advice is to visit this place as soon as possible ...the experience was exactly the authentic local Mexican place we've been looking for ...this place is food porn."}
{"text":"Had the three combo, their tacos are delicious; both hard and soft shell. The enchiladas are amazing. Excellent service from my servers. Do you want oddly attractive bearded guys serving you tacos? A tequila bar to get plastered at? Well I've got the place for YOU."}
{"text":"Stopped here after spending the day outside. Great food in a quiet atmosphere. Attentive service, great prices. Great place for families. Smaller business...14 tables. Check it out! Credit cards accepted. No Amex."}
{"text":"Im not sure where everybody who gave this dump over 2 stars were eating.  Bland, awful food.  Had the steak with cheese enchilada, med rare.  They should rename it shoe leather and mush.  It was terrible.  Burnt beyond recognition with a greesy tiny mushy mucky guess it was an enchilada next to it.  We also got a chicken burrito.  If you boil a chicken in plain water and shred it there would have been more flavor than this tasteless meat in a tortilla.  Beans were paste the only flavor was the salt and pepper I put on them, which I never put salt and pepper on anything but had to do something!  The only thing fellow yelpers got right was the decor was hideous.  If they are going for a look of actual Mexico they nailed it minus the flies and dogs on the floor, however, I would go to Mexico and sit in a dump that looked like this if the food was even halfway decent. The candle on top was the worst bathroom ever.  My pic of the bathroom sums up the entire eating experience here.  I won't be so quick to trust yelp reviews ever again because apparently they have no idea what good Mexican food taste like"}
{"text":"One of the best authentic Mexican places in AZ! OMG! It's a must if you are visiting and if you live nearby this place will become your default go to place of so many amazing food places in the area! ZOMG!"}
{"text":"Just discovered this place and the food is yummy. I had the Carne asada plate and my friend had the fish tacos, he said they were very good like home style."}
{"text":"Seriously good food. Went \"shrimp themed\" on our visit today. Got the large shrimp cocktail and then shrimp fajitas.
Zero disappointment level"}
{"text":"Beats anything in AJ.  Nice, hidden away.  Mexican comfort food.  Great food when ya just wanna eat cause your hungry food. Nothing fancy, but yummy good.  Started out slow with the three item combo plate for $7.50. How good could it be?? It was delightful.  Got the chili relleno, taco and tamale.  Just like mama would have made if she was a little Mexican lady.  The young man that served us was very polite and our food arrived in a timely manner. 
Now let's talk margaritas.....these are no wimpy margaritas.  These will put hair on your chest.  We will be back and we are bringing relatives. Great find."}
{"text":"This is a nice little place, not too fancy but you don't come here for the decor.  This place serves some great \"real\" Mexican food. 
First go round I ordered the comarone de diabla.  Was a great dish with some real heat!  Couldn't feel me face when I finished that one, but boy was it good!  
Second time I came here I ordered the ceviche tostada and a beer and it was much better than expected, plus it was only a couple bucks. 
Now, the wife and I are pretty much regulars. We order ceviche tostadas and a beer to start then move on to a full menu item. 
Be sure to try the camarone ranchera style.  The onions and pepper red sauce is to die for!  This place has some surprisingly tasty seafood dishes.  
All in all, most of the dishes are pretty great.  The staff is friendly and the service is great. I don't think I've ever been here and had a bad meal!  This is a great East Valley Mexican restaurant that is worth the drive. I actual hope it stays our East Valley secret as it is one our favorite Mexican food \"go to\" restaurants."}
{"text":"We have been coming south for 3 years now and go almost once a week. Great people waiting on you and super food."}
{"text":"My favorite new Mexican food place!! I'm not one for spicy food, but I love good flavor and this place did not disappoint. Salsa and hot chips were delivered with our menus. I got a chicken chimi. It came with beans, rice, guacamole, lettuce, and sour cream (red or green sauce if you want it). Portions were great. Food was hot and fresh. Service was quick. This places appears to be family owned and the people were friendly."}
{"text":"Most authentic mexican food around! Bring your friends here if you want to show them what real home cooked mexican food tastes like. A little hidden, but LOVE IT!"}
{"text":"Chips and salsa was good... bummer they ran out of chips.. the three item combo is best value in the valley.. possibly the state.. can't find this quality of food west of the new mexico border. The relleno rivaled some of the better ones I have had at home. The taco was filled with genuine shredded roast that was tender and hot. A tiny point off for the premade taco shell. The enchilada sauce lacked some zip but was hot and filled with cheese and onion. 

The chimichangas were loaded with quality shredded  beef or delicious chicken either was great.. the green sauce on the chicken was tomatillo based.. I would opt out of the sauce and let the gucamole shine. 

This place is a ridiculous value... I will be back sooner than later."}
{"text":"Delicious! I asked for the hottest salsa, they brought the most perfect, hot, smoky, dark red salsa. The enchiladas were great too. And the horchata was on point! All for $10. Eat here!"}
{"text":"I was kind of disappointed to find lots of rice in my \"Arizona\" burrito. Why would anyone want rice in a 5$ burrito? I don't think even Taco Bell puts rice in their burritos. It's cheap filler material of the worst kind. Asi, send me a message that states you will never stoop so low as to put starchy, white grain in a burrito and I will give you 5 stars and revise this review to tell the world about how great you really are, deep down, before you descended so far. 
Once again, rice in my burrito is an affront to decency and earns you no points. 
Furthermore, you damaged my credibility with the two mexican workers that were helping me that day. They were like , \"huh.\" And I had to try and convince them the food came from a legit mexican food place. 
In actuality the atmosphere was great and all of the bits of food surrounding the rice were pretty good."}
{"text":"I would give 0 stars if possible. This place was filthy and the food had no flavor. Either I went when the normal cook wasn't working, or everyone who gave this place a good review has never eaten real Mexican food."}
{"text":"Best Mexican food in east Mesa. The decor is not overly extravagant but the food quality is miles ahead of the local competitors. I highly recommend this place for a great casual Mexican dining experience"}
{"text":"Just a basic mexican food place, nothing special. Food is bland needs more seasoning. Maby they tone it down for the winter visitors. Or maby people really do not know what mexican food should taste like. If you want bomb mexican food in the east mesa side go to dos los gringos or Elviras."}
{"text":"All I can say is WOW. 4 of us went for dinner this last Saturday night. Based on the previoous reviews we didn't expect much from the outside, just a little storefront in a strip mall in AJ. The inside isn't anything special either but the smell was off the hook! We started with a large shrimp cocktail and a cheese crisp. The shrimp was fresh and delicious with a great cold \"broth\" is was served in. The cheese crisp was perfect. We all had something different for our entree. Barbacoa, tamales, enchiladas, tacos, all were super tasty. Add three margaritas and the bill was only $66! Service was fast and efficient. No question we will be back!"}
{"text":"The most authentic Mexican food I have ever had in the States! And the people are so friendly and attentive.; a real family run restaurant. The guacamole was made right there and then fresh and natural after I ordered it, the fish in the 3 tacos was grilled, the taco around the fish a real corn tortilla, the beans and rice real tasty, and the price great as well! I also wanna try their breakfast one day soon. And of course, you can always ask for the spicy \"salsa de la casa\" if you wanna be on fire. I will definitely be back, when I go hiking in the Superstition Mountains! Thank you!!!"}
{"text":"Divey location (old strip mall), but appearances are deceptive with this restaurant. Visited for lunch with hubby & a girlfriend,  who was really hesitant to go in. But we did & were not disappointed. We were the only patrons there (a takeout order was leaving as we came in), and service was fast & professional. We ordered enchiladas, carne asada & camarones al mojo de ajo. The salsa was wonderful & the spice was just right. The asada was really good & not dry at all. The garlic sauce for the shrimp was sweet & tasty. The enchiladas were melted & felt like  comfort food. And the tortillas were yummy! Definitely worth the trip!"}
{"text":"It's been a while but this place is still the real deal. If you like Mexican food you can taste the spices and love put into everything."}
{"text":"Wow, this place is a real find!!  Without Yelp We never would have found this little gem.   It's in a lower end strip mall, but don't let that fool you, the food is excellent, the staff are attentive and friendly, and the value can't be beat.  I am always on the search for great chili relleno and I found them the day we stopped in here for lunch.  We are snowbirds in the area and have been back to this \"treasure\" many times."}
{"text":"Quality mexican food & very affordable. Fajitas, enchiladas, shrimp cocktail & house margs are all bomb. Family owned and operated. Take my family here at least once a month. It's our East Mesa mexican food restaurant of choice!"}
{"text":"This place is a great hole in the wall Mexican restaurant. The salsa and chips were delicious, and our meals were good. We got tamales which I am very picky about and was really good. The masa is the key and the shredded beef inside was moist.  Enchiladas were yummy with the cheese melted (I seem to never get melted cheese). 

The wait staff was attentive and friendly. 


This was our first time here and found on Yelp, glad we came it.  This was worth the trip.  So glad we found It."}
{"text":"In Mesa for a swim meet, we relied on our trusty pal Yelp to show is the way for lunch. 

After surveying my family, we decided on Mexican food for lunch. Yelp guided us to Asi Es Mi Tierra and we had such a great experience there. Yelp, you are such a great buddy!

The establishment is very cozy and is located in a business plaza. Upon entering, we were greeted by staff and immediately seated. The restaurant was busy for lunch. Music played and added to the ambiance of the restaurant. 

Chips and salsa were brought to our table and they were fresh and delicious. Our server was attentive and allowed us to order two things that weren't on the menu, a bean burrito and bean tostadas. 

Our food was fantastic and our server remained friendly and attentive. We loved and food and would definitely recommend and go back next time we are in the Mesa area."}
{"text":"Excellent little place to grab some amazing Mexican food. From the shrimp cocktail the combos to the barbacoa, the food we had was all excellent. Great menu with lots of choices. 

Simple decor and its in an older strip mall so don't expect anything fancy but it's totally worth it as the food and prices rock! 

Will be going back many times."}
{"text":"Came with my dad while in town since he said that this food and service were the best he ever saw- the lady who served him treated him like family and the food was to die for!

When we came in, neither of the two servers so much as smiled at us, spoke too quiet to hear, and were generally pretty rude. When I asked to substitute the beans in the meal with extra rice, I was told \"no, that will be too much rice,\" and the server walked away after demanding us to \"give [him] the menus.\"

When the food came out, it didnt look good. My plate was laughably small, with a few pieces of cut up shrimp that were underseasoned, and less than 1/4 cup of rice. It looked like a child's portion, which is the reason I asked to substitute the beans with extra rice. It didnt taste that great either- no better than what I could make at home.

My dad was the most surprised, since the atmosphere, service, and food changed so much from his first visit. Unfortunately, there are other restaurants in this area with better food and better service that we'll be visiting instead."}
{"text":"Wow I don't get these reviews. We tried this place because of the 4 star reviews - it is far from it. The server was nice, food was just alright, the place was a dingy dive. I hate giving poor reviews but they should be real, accurate and helpful. I really wish the place was a 4 star :("}
{"text":"I went in here on a whim after searching for lunch. Found it, it had good ratings, so I popped in. Very simple little place but the food is FAR from simple!! The prices indicated that the food may be rationed small. Boy, I was WRONG. The tacos are perfect sized!! Also, they use real Mexican cheese. Not that cheddar crap. Good amount of rice and beans! Now I am super picky about my chili rellanos. This were THE BEST IVE EVER HAD. Fresh hot, covered in red sauce!! So fluffy and delicious!! They also included chips and salsa! The salsa was fantastic. 
Point blank if you want authentic, fantastic Mexican food stop in!! 
I loved it!"}
