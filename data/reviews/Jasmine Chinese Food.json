{"text":"Went there during lunch hour recently due to the high ratings. But noticed most of the items on the take-out menu were crossed out. The food were ready-made  in those fast food warmer buffets. Some fried rice and meat items seemed to be dried out from warming in those steel container for a while. People used to run  the place might have sold it and moved on?"}
{"text":"This place is okay.  They have a steam table deal... 1 Rice or Noodle + 1 item for $4.00 OR 1 Rice or Noodle + 2 Items for $4.60.  Should warn you that the food can be a hit or miss... recently its been a hit!"}
{"text":"Really cheap Chinese food. Very tasty and the portions are huge. Two portions of meat and 1 rice or noodle for 5$ with tax. Not bad at all. They also have a-la-carte ordering which is also fairly inexpensive. The chicken chow mein is delicious!"}
{"text":"My go to food place for some grub food. It's always fresh and if it isn't the person in front is always attentive to let you know.   They give great portion sizes, usually one dish is enough for 2 people. And the prices are amazing, nothing is sold for more than 10$. The person in front also makes sure you're aware of th ingredients which is really helpful and thoughtful. She let me know me know when certain foods had beef and pork."}
{"text":"My all time favorite food during high school. I go there almost everyday; even now, after i graduated,  some times i go back for their food. Very affordable, very yummy, never get bored with their food, always that good! If u want your food to be fast, you can just order from their 2 kind + noodle/rice. If not, u can try any of the food thats on the picture, OR grab one of their takeout menu and order from there, most people don't know they have more dishes on the takeout menu.   My favorite:  -????/?? Chicken with Noodle Soup (you can alternate meat/noodles, chicken/beef & rice noodle/egg noodle/vermicelli)  -?????/? Shrimp with egg on rice/noodle (same with this, you can alternate the meats, shrimp/chicken/beef) -???? black bean & green pepper beef rice noodle -???? stir fried beef rice noodle -???? cantonese fried noodle -???? fujianese style fried rice Man! I can go on and on with the list, but i'll you guys discove the goodness.  Obviously, i'm comparing it to all the other food courts, not like high class restaurant food."}
{"text":"Great food. Hefty portions. Ordered the shrimp with cop suey and steamed rice. Very friendly staff. Great price. Food was made to order so very fresh. Would recommend ."}
{"text":"I am not a big fan of take-out Chinese food, but this place is great.  The owners are very nice and always willing to make fresh food for you, and as another reviewer mentioned they give you a ton of food and condiments.  A lot of people at this mall choose to have their food rather than the big fast food restaurants downstairs in the food court.  I highly recommend their fried fish, which are absolutely delicious and only $2.  Since the first time I've ordered it, they would load up my plate/box until it was crammed with fish.  My friend absolutely loves their stir fried beef rice noodle, which she said was way less greasy than most Chinese restaurants without skimping on flavour."}
{"text":"This place has been open for many years and both the morning and evening lady that work there are super friendly. If you are a frequent customer, they load up your order until they can't put no more. You wouldn't think much of anything of this place if you pass by since burger palace closed down, and they are the only store left in the upper food court area of the mall so it can be quite dead. However, this place is a hidden gem! If you order from the \"cook to order\" display menu and not the food that sits on the steamers, you will find that they serve fresh, hot and delicious large portion Chinese food for a pretty reasonable price ($5-6). My all time favourite is their Mapor tofu. Although they use beef instead of pork like traditional Mapor tofu with rice, the flavour is rich and super spicy, so it is super satisfying. Other great value lunch/dinner boxes would be the pork chop with rice and their curry chicken with rice. Basically their rice with sauce is their best! Fried rice/ noodles are alright but kind of has the manchuwok style which I'm not a fan of. If you're in the mall and want a quick, affordable and large portion Chinese food for under $10, you should definitely come here!"}
{"text":"I've been wanting to try this place after reading reviews in yelp.  I must admit I was prejudice. At first glance, I didn't think that something good  could come out from this place. I feel guilty and bad at my easy judgement. To make up for this I hope this review will caution everyone  to think twice before turning away from this place. FOOD was delicious.  We were looking for a place to eat, not a lot of choices as there was a snowstorm out and I was not feeling anything that was in the mall and well known. So I finally convinced my partner in crime to try this place out. You see seeing this place made hubby think of going elsewhere (see I wasn't the only one).  We ordered the Fujian style fried rice, fried chicken and fried fish (total $20, debit/cash only). 3 people came out full and happy  plus a little leftover. all three dishes were good in its simplicity.  There are dishes in steamers but you also had the option to order from the kitchen. Of course fried chicken and fried fish are good, nothing could go wrong there. Well yelpees you are wrong. My King and myself own a very particular set of taste buds that even a simple batter, cooking oil, texture would matter. Yes, I know this because I get reminded that I overcook hard boiled eggs by a few minutes. we had to reheat the chicken wings because it got cold when we got home but it was still very crunchy. sweet and sour sauce we had asked to be put on the side  and yes this was also good. There was a good ratio between batter and fish and meat. Not like other commercialized place that has more batter to taste than the actual fish. You can tell it was good home cooking from this place. I am surprised not a lot of people have tried and reviewed this place, I guess because of the decor.  I had anaesthesia on me when I started eating but I made sure the numbness wore off and my palate was in good working condition prior to writing this review. One of the good ones I have tried by far. I'm shaking my head for almost missing this place. Now I am excited to go back and try more dishes. I read that there is a take out menu, I didn't see it but I will definitely be exploring soon."}
