{"text":"Although expensive I must say the quality is there if you're looking for unique items you will definitely find that here as well"}
{"text":"I skew pescatarian.  Sometimes go vegan for weeks at a time.  Feel better slugging almond milk.  Like taste testing any veggie burger I can get my hands on.  So, it's rare that I find myself in a butcher shop, but (you were expecting that \"but\" right, Yelpers?)  ...Kloster's makes me want to get my meat on.  There.  Said it.  This is a top-notch butcher shop in Newmarket.  Need clarification on \"top notch\"? Top service, top quality, top prices: triple top (alliterative WIN!).    My favourites: meat pies in the winter, stocks, and wrapped/stuffed chicken (cordon bleu is a fan fave).  In the summer?  Chicken and turkey sausages with no filler, beef, and the most flavourful ground chicken that truly gives your hypothetical* aunt who only eats poultry burgers something to cluck about!    Do your BBQ proud with some product from Kloster's.    *or not so hypothetical.  Whatevs.  Yelp note: I've called ahead (things move fast during BBQ season) with great success.  Worth noting: I've driven up from Toronto to source a chicken cordon bleu from Kloster's.  WORTH IT."}
