{"text":"Review only based on the bar experience here: they have a good selection of beer cocktails but I especially love their crown float which is Guinness and somersby, definitely a must try. Waitress was honest and friendly - will be back when bar hopping DT"}
{"text":"Typical bar food on the menu but the food was good.  We had the wedge salads and the spinach and artichoke dip.  The dip was very good for a pub- above my expectations.  The wedge salad was good but not great."}
{"text":"I had an amazing hamburger (comes with fries and onion rings which is a nice touch) here on a recent rainy Sunday. It's a very nice space they have in a former bank, with incredibly high ceilings and lots of space. There are also daily deals on various beers. Really nice service from our bartender, too. Not sure what it's like on busy evenings, but I think I will come and check it out again soon. All in all, a great place considering it is a chain."}
{"text":"Ordered Calamari, half of it came with only crisps without squid inside. Server wanted to take the dish away when we were half finished, also took our plate without even asking. Worst place, never going back there again."}
{"text":"This is a pub which tries really hard to be typically British and while it does do a fairly good job of it, it is located in a bad area of town.    It's got a fair menu, the beer is pilled well but I wouldn't dwell here for very long."}
{"text":"Despite the somehwhat negative reviews I had an enjoyable experience. As one of those out-of-towners it was convenient and had some appeal.  We were seated right away despite how busy it was. Our server was prompt and polite.  It was surprisingly large inside. I was a little apprehensive that I wouldn't be able to find my way back to my table after a trip to the bathroom (which was clean). I had the Chicken Pot Pie which came with mash potatoes and they accommodated my dislike of green beans with some steamed vegtables. I thought it was great, nice and hot and there was lots of food. My buddy had a burger and said that was good. Our cidars and beers were fresh and delicious. And the price was reasonable, maybe a little more than you might find elsewhere but certainly not expensive."}
{"text":"Food was good, service was too however they were a bit pushy with bringing the check and card-reader for paying. The restaurant was decorated pretty cool and the restrooms were your typical pub-standard.Good for getting a nice meal for a pretty cheap price. I'd recommend this to a friend!"}
{"text":"A bit too large to feel like a local pub. Beer selection OK but missing some that I thought would be on tap due to the name of the pub. Service just OK as well. Did not try the food based upon the other reviews I have read. Not a place I would say is a must place to go in Toronto."}
{"text":"The Elephant and Castle is located in an old bank, which makes for an unique atmosphere in which to have a bar, and I felt that the service and noise levels were reasonable for a Saturday night.  I didn't have any food here, just the beer, and they have a decent beer menu.  I'd consider coming back here during a future visit to Toronto."}
{"text":"Best poutine I've ever had. I ordered the \"Works\" which included fresh tomatoes, bacon, and sour cream. What made it so awesome was that the fresh ingredients made the poutine delicious and feel healthy. That's right, I'm giving it five stars for poutine."}
{"text":"Ahh, how to describe the Elephant and Castle?  It's a British Pub that doesn't feel anything like a British Pub, it's a restaurant that doesn't feel like a restaurant, and it's just plain vanilla boring.  The food is sub-par, and the drinks are expensive, and perhaps the only saving grace is it's a great location for out-of-towners. I find myself listing all the things it's not, it really didn't evoke much of an emotional response, it's fairly forgettable.  I wish they had at least a small selection of actual British beer on tap, there wasn't anything except the standard macrobrews you can get at any corporati-bar.  The building itself is nice, and has some nice architectural elements, but the layout is awkward. It was difficult for them to accommodate 7 of us without us always being in the way of the serving staff.  I had a great time, but it had very little to do with the venue."}
{"text":"Burgers were awesome! A little over cooked on the patty and the bacon but still, well worth the money! Service was awesome and so was the atmosphere. I'm here on vacation and I'm already planning to go back tomorrow! Well done, Elephant & Castle."}
{"text":"This place has recently been renovated and I love the new layout and design! It looks much more modern and they also revamped the menu as well. I was here for a company lunch. There was probably about 60 of us there and they situated us all in the middle of the restaurant just right behind the bar which was plenty of space.  I love the new menu items offered as well and they was all at around $7-$15 which imo is pretty reasonably priced. There are a number of fingers foods that are shareable size or a great option if you are not too hungry. The burgers and entrées are great portions as well. We order pretzels to split between the table (~$9), they were pretzel sticks and were are bit too oily but nevertheless delicious as it just came out of the oven. I ordered hummus and naan (~$9) as my entrée and there was plenty of hummus left to take to go.   Also be sure to ask your server what the daily specials are. Service was excellent and our server was very attentive as she often came back to check if we needed anything. Like most places with a group this big, 18% gratuity is included on the bill. I would highly recommend."}
{"text":"I like this pub better than most. The restaurant is nice and bright, the servers are all very friendly, and they have lots of cute British photos hanging around. They have a different $5 pint every day of the week, which is nice, and a great selection of beers on tap. The food is typical pub food. I had the vegetarian stir-fry, which was nothing that spectacular, but better than the usual veg offer of nachos or quesadillas. The pub pretzels seem pretty popular if you want a fun bar snack - they come with three large soft pretzels and mustard to dip."}
{"text":"I'm surprised this doesn't have higher reviews. Love their speckle and hen beer. They have a vast venue. Reasonable prices!   I've had their fish and chips and I can't remember what else it is. for around 10 bucks you can't go wrong. Like the ambience and they have an awesome beer selection. Better than Earls anyday."}
{"text":"I find myself coming here because of the convenience. This place is a British pub/restaurant but feels like neither. It's generally clean, spacious and cozy feeling, especially with the warm coloured interior.   The service at Elephant & Castle has always been good and the staff has always come off as friendly- at least when I was there. Their menu is pretty interesting; they have things like pot pies, Thai salad's, chicken curry, nachos, burgers etc. The food is nothing too special and the portions are good. They have an interesting selection of beers, scotches, wines and can make practically any cocktail you want without giving you a blank stare that says \"what's that?\" However, the drinks are rather pricey.  The Elephant & Castle is an okay place if you're looking for an informal dining experience. Just don't expect anything special."}
{"text":"This bar claims to be open until 1, however, the past two times I have been there they have had last call before ten and kicked us out before 10:30. I felt extremely unwelcome at the establishment and I think it's a bit ridiculous for a bar to be having a last call when the place still has many customers inside. I wouldn't recommend this place to any of my friends because there weren't any redeeming factors as the food was just alright."}
{"text":"What a pity. I think this place has potential. But the service...  Oh well, let me start from the top. We (a group of 15) went to this elephant and castle branch last Saturday to enjoy ourselves. We had a table for 15 reserved for 6pm. As always for big groups, some come earlier, some later. We ordered dinner and drinks.  No one told us that our reservation would expire at around 9pm until just before 9pm. They obviously wanted to make some more money of the big UFC fight.  I can understand that they want to make as much money of this night as possible, but there are better ways to do so.  Firstly, someone could have mentioned it when we placed the reservation. They did not. Secondly, a waiter or waitress or the manager could have let us know when we entered or ordered. They failed to do so again. Then when they finally did tell us, they had quite the attitude. Even talking to the manager didn't get us anywhere. They actually 'allowed' us to not give any tip. That was all. Even though the food wasn't bad and the drinks were okay, I cannot imagine ever going back to this branch."}
{"text":"Decent restaurant! I tried the slumdog sandwich and it was great, but too big for me."}
{"text":"What a joke !!!!!  This place is a ripoff!!! guess what? They advertise \"A perfect pint every time\" and they even take it a step further and say that \"you always get 20 imperial ounces\" of beer but, but. buuuutttt.... you don't !!!!  Can you imagine how dumb did I look when I ordered a \"Perfect Pint\" of Stella and got a 40 CL chalice  !!!! What is this ???? a beer for ants ?????? I was so pissed !!! everyone was making fun of me !!!!  So, dear Mr. Elephant and Caste, 40 CL = 14.07 UK fl Oz    Just for informational purposes, a Pint is equal to one-eight of an Imperial gallon, which means it's equal to  568.26 ml that is,  20 imperial ounces.  20 !!!!! got it??? 20 !!!!! not 14.07 !!!!!  how is 14.07 equal to 20??? I don't understand !!!! Unless..... unless.... unless they are making a fool of me !!!!!!!!!!  I wont' stand for this shit !!!! Am I not worthy of an actual Pint ?????  I immediately proceeded to make a scene and demand that the manager came to our table to apologize !!! however he pretended he didn't know what was going on and tried to convince us that a Pint just means \"a glass\" !!!! Can you believe this clown ????? By this standard any container qualifies as \"a Pint\" so watch out, watch out, waaatch ooouuuttt !!! Next time you go into this place they may serve you \"a Pint\" of beer in a coffee cup, or \"a Pint\" of beer in a shot glass, or \"a Pint\" of beer in a disposable solo cup !!! WTF !!!!!  Long story short... This place is now forbidden !!!!"}
{"text":"We decided to eat here before a Jays game since we were running a bit late and all of the regular spots were packed.  I was surprised, this place was fairly empty considering it was a Friday evening before a game.  Anyway, this review is more about the quality of service, not the quality of food.  I ordered a veggie burger, like I usually do, because I do not eat meat.  Nothing out of the ordinary there.  So about 30 minutes later we all get our meals, I should mention that I'm the only one that got any type of burger in our group.  I take a great big bite of my veggie burger, chew it up, and swallow the first bit down.  That's when I realize, \"Wait a minute, something isn't right here, this burger is a little too greasy to be fake\".  I set the burger down, lift the top bun, and closely examine the patty.  My fears are confirmed...this is a beef burger.  Now, to a lot of people this wouldn't be a big deal, but it was huge to me.  Without getting too into it, I chose not to eat meat for ethical reasons.  So we call the server over, she tells me that the veggie burgers that they serve are new and everybody really loves them.  I say, \"oK\", but there was no way I was touching that thing.  A couple minutes later she comes back and says \"Maybe its not cooked right, I'll get the cook to make you another one\", and she takes the plate away.  A little suspicious, don't you think?  Ten minutes pass, she brings me another plate with a burger that looks absolutely nothing like the first one.  Impossible to confuse the two.  I tell her that the first burger was real, and that this new burger is, in fact, a veggie burger.  She offers no response.  I found no reason to be rude to her as I did not see this being her fault.  I watched her write down \"veggie\" on her little pad.  In the end, I had to eat the meal as fast as I could so we wouldn't be late, they actually charged me which I was surprised about, they offered no apology, my wife was giving me the gears for not standing up to them and telling them the meal should have been free, and the jays lost.  Sheesh.  I can't even imagine the horror the meat eater endured when he took a bite of my veggie burger!  I will never eat here again.  If you do, check your burgers!"}
{"text":"Great service! Food was pretty good as well. Me and my best friend took our girlfriends and had a great time. Only suggestion is more Draft beers"}
{"text":"We had this waitress name Rachael. We each ordered a burger and as we did, she would ask which sides we would like to go with our burgers. We didn't know it was extra charge so we ordered it. When our bill came, each was charged $2.50. It sucks that this sly trick was used on customers. I don't know if the manager enforce this attitdue of 'tell them to choose and not let them know it's extra so we charge them for it and make money' idea. Either way, I lost my confidenec in this place and won't be returning. The food was good, but I can find better in the same area."}
{"text":"Not a great pub, decent food. Meat loaf was excellent. Dessert wise there's only one choice 'The Big Ben' and probably wise to share it."}
{"text":"Terrible service, server didn't know what a Pabst was. It's on their menu as PBR- waited 20 minutes to hear they don't have it. Then picked an Estrella tall can, I had to remind the server it's a CAN before she opened the bottle.   Our food was served to the wrong table, we had to wait for them to figure this out.   Also their credit card machine was 'broken' and couldn't accept my American Express.  Rough experience, I've been here a few times and won't come back."}
{"text":"This is the second time I've been here and I really wasn't impressed. The crowd isn't as laid back and casual as I like (was it just me or did everyone look like they went out clubbing?) but the prices for beer are pretty average.  The first time I came here was pretty decent. They have a large selection of beers on tap and the sweet potato fries were ample but a bit on the pricey side. Didn't stay for too long as I felt it just wasn't one of those warm and inviting places.  The second time I came here was right after midnight on a Friday night. We were  served by a pretty cold, if not pissed off waitress. Funny to say this, but I almost felt pressured to order something quick for fear of pissing her off any further. Within about a half hour it was last call, then when we were sorting through our bill she came over with the portable credit card machine and insisted that we fix up the bill right then and there while she waited. Talk about wanting to get us out of there quickly.  I probably should add that the layout of the interior was quite nice; high ceilings, overall clean look of the bar, but the bathroom is in a very inconvenient location way in the back, down a flight of stairs, around the corner, etc. Ladies, bring a friend for company for your long journey!  I probably won't go in there again. There are tons of better bars in the city with cooler vibes, much better atmosphere and friendlier waitresses."}
{"text":"They just renovated and the place looks great. Sad that their beer specials are now restricted to certain timeframe and are no longer available all night . Also don't order the calamari it was lackluster in how it was cooked and the portion size.   Staff there is great though.. fun and attentive.. I'm there every week and you can tell they enjoy having regulars there."}
{"text":"The food is not the best (unless you are getting the yorkshire pudding) and a bit overpriced, but it is in a great location and they have a good beer selection. For being right in the downtown core, it's not a bad choice for lunch or dinner."}
{"text":"Very nice location, we always have some drink before the concert in Roy Tompson Hall."}
{"text":"I stopped here to have dinner and a beer. I was intrigued by the name and the outside of the restaurant.   I really liked the inside atmosphere. This is both a casual and semi-dressy place. Either way you'll fit right in. The lighting is on the darker side- so if you're tired this place may not be the best.  We had a excellent waitress. She recommended excellent beers for us to try and gave some suggestions on what to pick from off the menu.  We got both our food and drinks timely- hardly any wait. And the restaurant was fairly busy.  The price range is decent- not expensive not cheap. The menu has a good selection.  You'll likely be able to find something off the menu that you would want to eat.   I gave this 3 stars because I don't want to be misleading. Am I happy with my experience- yes. Was the food good- yes. I would say this is close to a 3-4 star restaurant. If you're visiting the city this is a nice place to stop in at."}
{"text":"I haven't been to Elephant and Castle in years. My friend and I do lunch on a weekly basis but this was the best lunch I've had in a very long time. I had the beef dip. REAL AU JUS !!!! Friend had the stuffed yorkshire pudding. REAL ROAST BEEF!! Not that package crap. Luved the new menu and will be back next week Great renovations. Gotta try the beer margarita thingy next time."}
{"text":"3.5/5  Good service and reasonable menu. I recently held an event here for around 20 people and they accommodated me well. They also have their $6 drinks before 6pm special on Fridays which is a steal for that area. Good for after work drinks. Not a great menu for vegetarians and kinda pricey for food (small portions)"}
{"text":"Sucky food, small portions. Expensive. Disappointed. I will drink more to make up for it... Damn, they win."}
{"text":"We have been 4 times and each time it has never been a disappointment. The service has been great and the food very consistent. We have taken out of town guests here and they agree it's a great place to eat. The servers have always been happy to serve you and are truly concerned you enjoy your time there. It is very clean and just had an amazing make over. Give the place a visit I am sure you too will find it a warm inviting place."}
{"text":"First impression, confused... had nothing to do with the decor and everything to do with the music being played. Considering they are billing themselves as a british joint, their taste in music (pop and hip hop) was something odd and definitely noticed. That being said onto their main attraction!  I've been here twice, both during the playoffs and they have a great atmosphere for catching the great game with friends. Their specials are reasonable and from what my friends told me their food is fairly good.  I'm a fan of the layout for those only interested in grabbing some quick grub and a pint ( or a few).  Their specials are what have brought my repeat business and what will continue to bring me back down. $5 pints of sleeman, and okanagan is a deal considering their location and the atmosphere.   Their servers are good, special nod to my server the second time around. very knowledgeable and has officially turned me onto okanagan!   They earned their 4."}
{"text":"Decent priced food, drinks. Tasty & filling portion. Had the stuffed Yorkshire, was done well. The only unfortunate element to my dining experience was they forgot my appetizer. A manager I believe it was did come over and apologize for the error, but I believe the place was not 'slammed' so it was a surprise. My server was apologetic as well over this. Combined with a well poured pint of Guinness, I was mostly satisfied. I'll try it again, hopefully my order gets done proper and I can raise my rating."}
{"text":"Visiting Toronto for a few days and stopped in with my wife for dinner.   Traditional English Pub fare served.  Shepherd's Pie, Yorkshire pudding etc.  Food was very good.  The cook even came out to personally ask about our meal.    Our server was extremely helpful and patient with us.   They serve several different kinds of beer, though a bit surprised they did not serve IPA."}
{"text":"I went here yesterday.  Nothing special, typical pub fare.  I had chicken curry on rice and my friend had the fish and chips."}
{"text":"Dinner here after a long day. Jay game on the TV. Other screens held other sports. Modern pub style. Good pub food (recommend the steak and mushroom pie, and the fish & chips). Decent beer on tap. Overall good for a chain restaurant."}
{"text":"After-work drinks?  Stop two on what turned out to be a far more exciting birthday weekend than I could have imagined was an after-work pint with a few friends at this British-style box pub at Yonge and Gerrard.  It was about 5:30 on Thursday and the after-work crowd was just starting to trickle in (there's an old man sitting next to me...).  There was a private party at the back end of this giant one-room pub and the first thing I noticed was the kind of din and racket for which I had just vetoed Pogue Mahone.  Notwithstanding the fact that I had had a very stressful day at work and just wanted a quiet place to guzzle a pint, I knew I couldn't get away with back-to-back vetos, even on my birthday.  So here we were.  In fairness, the noise at the Elephant and Castle is largely attributable to the fact that the pub is about a hundred feet long, thirty feet wide, forty feet high and constructed entirely out of limestone.  Everything echoes, but if you like massive limestone rooms, this is a nice one.  We were seated promptly, and met our server shortly thereafter.  Good start.  And the service was generally what you would expect form a box pub:  OK.  However.  There are only a few things I absolutely insist on from my server.  They don't seem to me like much to ask, but they are make-or-break matters for my impression of a server's competence and professionalism.  One of them is this:  Know your beer list.    If I ask what you have on tap, it's because I'm genuinely interested and because I haven't decided what I want to drink yet.  It's also because I want to know if you know what the hell you're talking about before I get your opinion on food.  Don't ask me what kind of beer I feel like, don't tell me it's on the back of the menu, and don't even think about pointing at the chalkboard at the other end of the bar lest you raise my full ire.  Please, if it's sixteen taps or fewer on the rail, you should be able to remember them all.  And I promise, I'll order one of them.  I was starving, but trying to save my appetite for our next stop (dinner at Harlem, review to come).  Had I known what was in store for me there, I probably would have abstained from eating at the E&C altogether.  Absent foresight, we instead ordered a sharing plate ($16) - three finger foods from a list of eleven, with pretty good options (there's a lovely PDF menu on their website).  Our choices were bruschetta, chicken kebabs and chicken picks, all of which were tasty and kept four of us happy while we killed a couple pints.   For some reason I really like this place.  I think it's because it's a really neat space.  I'll definitely make it a target for after-work pints more often.  Special thanks to an old and good friend, Sonya F., for buying."}
{"text":"Went for lunch with two buddies - very nice cozy setting, upscale type of pub. Food excellent, drinks nice, excellent service. Can be a bit crowded during the lunch hour rush but never felt overwhelmed. Nice patio in summer for a cool drink.  Nothing bad to report - a more upscale pub - doesn't get 5 starts because it didn't blow me away..."}
{"text":"We stop here every time we check in to our hotel around the corner. The service is always excellent and the food is always delicious. I highly recommend the french dip as the bread is soooo soft and yummy."}
{"text":"There's nothing special about this place or the menu. Uncreative bar food :(. There are a number of stairs to go up to enter the establishment, something to keep in mind if you have a large stroller or require an accessibility ramp."}
{"text":"The place is decent. Service was okay, not particularly friendly, but they were quick. I ordered the steak with chips and they actually cooked the steak the way I wanted (medium rare), which sadly, does not happen enough (it always gets overcooked)!. The beef itself was not particularly flavourful, but it's not a steakhouse so it's okay. The bacon and bleu burger was also pretty good. The best part was definitely the fries, they were fresh, huge, and crispy!"}
{"text":"A coworker and I come here regularly for after-work drinks. For what it is, we always get friendly service and the servers always seem to recognize us. By now, I think they even know our drink orders. On the occasion that we do eat, I usually play it safe with a burger or a chicken Caesar salad, but occasionally they advertise seasonal specials that seem a little bit off-base for a British pub. Either way, they don't skimp out on chicken for that Caesar. It can get a little bit loud inside, especially if there's a sporting event going on, but such is a bar."}
{"text":"I give it five stars for the staff and food, but please, management, could you reno the bathrooms? Seriously they are beyond their expiration date and need a redo."}
{"text":"This place has been around forever, it was a place I would always passed by when I walked from College station down to the Eaton Centre when I was a teen.  Now living abroad and on a Business Trip to Toronto, I decided to do two things.  Get my fix of Fish and chips and visit this place I always passed by and never went into.  The good thing about this place is that it is a definitely a fancy pub.  Converted from an old building that looks like it may have been a bank in a prior lifetime.  It has incredibly high ceilings and a cool atmosphere.   The bad, the fish and chips were not good and overly priced.  I have been to some epic fish and chips places in Toronto, some are fried to a crisp and at reasonable prices, but this dish was not worth getting.  At $15, you don't get Halibut, but the cheaper Haddock.  Haddock is a fishier piece of meet and is much cheaper to purchase, but in my case I prefer it, but not at that price point.  Also, you get a 1 fairly small piece, mounted on a pile of fries.    The fries are inconsistent as well, some of them are cooked to a great crunch, but there were others that were undercooked and mealy.  They seemed to be steak fries, but some of them were also shoestring.  Maybe I got the leftovers of the day.  As bad as it sounds, this was probably the best part of the meal.  My Haddock was beer battered and it was soggy, not crunchy, like it was fried in an oil at too low of a temperature.  That made the fish stringy, yet limp and it had zero taste, other than oil.  It was the worst fish pieces i've ever had in Toronto.  I am from a smaller town in the  US midwest, where fish and chips often means breaded fish sticks (using Cod) and even those would have been preferred. The fish was also not the prime cut of haddock, it had alot of meat close to the bone, making it tougher than the meat that is close to the skin.    What made it worse is the beer I ordered in a bottle (Mill St. Organic) was not very cold and turned to room temperature in 5 minutes.  I would suggest the owners of this bar visit some irish bar restaurants or other restaurants and get inspiration or hire another chef because while the atmosphere was nice, as was the service, the food was the letdown and isn't that why we go to restaurants?"}
{"text":"We went here on a Friday night to have some beers. We tried the spinach dip (which was good) and the sweet potato poutine (which we had to return due to its burnt gravy). They have a not too bad beer selection. We're visiting them again if we're around that area."}
{"text":"I've been here a number of times for some work functions. I agree with the reviews about the lighting being on the darker side, I've noticed that before too.  I've always received prompt and helpful email responses from their team whenever I've had to reserve tables for large work parties.  Never had any complaints about the staff  It looks like a small bar from the outside but it's actually a large place with pool tables and plenty of seating.  Service has always been great and the food has been pretty good. I'm giving this an average rating because it's not amazing food but if you're looking for a cool spot to hang out after work for a few beers I would recommend it."}
{"text":"Stopped I for a pint and a bite whilst in Downtown TO. Very nice open space considering it is a former bank. Good selection of beer and  tasty pub fare on the menu. All and all an oasis on the hetic streets of TO."}
{"text":"Without knowing anything about the city, we stumbled into the Elephant and Castle because we have eaten at them before and thought that this one might be better. However, while it was ok...it was nothing special. The service was ok. The food was not very good...the chicken was chewy and the cod tasted very frozen, the brownie dessert was stale. However, they did have Strongbow, which was a bonus."}
{"text":"I had the Slum Dog and it was really big and really good. My friend had a Lamb Burger and she was underwhelmed. Guess you can't win them all. ;)   Friendly service as well..."}
{"text":"I come here quite a bit and find the food consistently good. I'm kind of addicted to the beef dip sandwich and they have Okanogan Springs on tap, which is a win for me.  They have daily draft specials as well, the beer varies day by day. Staff are friendly and helpful. Bathrooms are located down a series of stairs at the back which makes for a long trip to the privy."}
{"text":"After walking in, immediately I knew that this place used to be something else..a bank perhaps.  Whatever it was, it's former glory has long gone.  I'm not going to explain how I ended up here, but if you read my reviews you would know that this isn't my cup of tea.  I came here with my sister after a day of shopping, and because she was young, the hostess sat us upstairs away from all the mullet beer drinkers.    My sister is a person of such astronomical discernibility that she would make me seem 'average joe,' so it's no surprise that she found Elephant & Castle to be super shabby.  There's a London style telephone booth at the corner of the first floor, a load of televisions, and the ceiling seemed to house spiders and all species.  The place was dirty no doubt, and the horrendous lighting didn't help.   We were sat by the mezzanine which didn't appear to be structurally sound overlook the huge windows which made the outside look like a post apocalypse abandoned city.  Wow, this place sucked.  The waitress kept referring to us as 'you guys' when it was only myself and a young lady.  I ordered the fish n chips, and my sister the shepherd's pie.  We shared that nacho cheese pita thing, and we managed to be disappointed by all three of the dishes.  I felt bad for taking my sister here, but as much as a snob she is, is she also equally as nonchalant about things.  It is the most confusing mix of traits, but she didn't care whether she was here, or at the Ritz.    I seem to recall a scene from a Michael Caine film explaining the origin of Elephant & Castle, it was pretty depressing.  Maybe this was the nature to all pubs or pub like establishments.  Them damn British blokes don't have a single happy bone in them, and it certainly reflects in their bars.  I mean....elephants don't live in castles.."}
{"text":"Was walking around Downtown and stumbled upon this place. The red telephone booth and door caught my attention.  I love pub food, so I had to try the fish & chips (With beer, of course). To my surprise, it was DELICIOUS. The tartar sauce with horseradish (I believe) is outstanding. Who knew that something so small would make all the difference? Fries was nice and crispy as well. One of my favourite places to go for fish & chips! Will definitely try other items on the menu in the future."}
{"text":"3.5 stars.  Large pub so never any wait to get in. Food: good selection and average quality. Waitstaff always friendly.  Consistent and reliable spot to grab a bite/drink either before or after a show at RTH as it's right across the street.  2 thumbs up for the VEGGIE BURGER: comes on a nice squishy bun with guiness bbq sauce and (gasp!) isn't over-cooked like a dry hockey puck."}
{"text":"The 2 stars is if you are coming for food, if for drinks only it's a 3. Good place for an after work pint but nothing special. Food is average pub food at best."}
{"text":"The meatloaf is a tootsie roll of beef wrapped in bacon. It is primarily sweet rather than savory. It is preposterously expensive for its portion size and quality. A drunken manchild with whom we were required to share the table tried to eat one of my green beans. They were crap anyway."}
{"text":"Pop into this place for a drink and ended up staying for dinner.  We asked for a nice quiet table and were seated accordingly.  Ended up getting two old fashions and chatting with my friend that we lost track of time and decided we wanted to eat.  Chatted with the server to determine what she would recommend for us to get and and she asked what we were in the mood for. We said the perfect dish would be shareable and so she recommended the tacos.   They were so good we got a second order of them.  Will definitely be back here for these tacos!"}
{"text":"Back I go for more comfort food! For a Thursday apres-work drink and appetizer, the E&C was a great pick. They have a great menu selection to chose from, and a decent beer menu as well. Lucky us, Thursdays are $5 Sleeman pint days! Pretty good deal if you ask me!  The service was SUPER fast and friendly. Not super friendly, but friendly enough. They have everything from salads to spinach dip to beef to soup! Todays soup of the day, cream of potato. I opted for the french onion, and although I never thought I'd see the day, I actually found it TOO salty. I love salt, so that's saying something.   So the food was decent, not spectacular, but it's pretty cool inside. Cathedral ceilings, windows to people watch on Gerrard or Yonge. And if you're just looking for a a slightly funkier pub style atmosphere, the E&C is a good choice.   OH, they served complimentary chips with some sort of chipotle mayo dip at the bar. Perfect snacky."}
{"text":"Dani is smokin' hot!  The food is mediocre, bar food, nothing more.  Place was clean and laid out well.  Given the area, I would look elsewhere first.  However, the bar looked like a great, at least better place to be."}
{"text":"Stopped in here late last Friday. Friendly staff, cold beer. We had the chicken pot pie - delish!  Big enough to share. Restaurant was clean and staff friendly."}
{"text":"Very nice and very classy restaurant with great food great service great atmosphere great decor"}
{"text":"Unremarkable food, poor service, fair prices. The environment is pleasant and always busy. Caught the waitress 'restirring' my beer to look like it was freshly poured. It sat for 5 minutes before being picked up. Working for a beer company, this is unacceptable in our trade."}
{"text":"I tried this place to watch UFC as my regular spots were busy. They don't charge cover and were not as busy.  Beer selection was decent as they had quite a few beers on tap. I opted for Sapporo which came in the special glass for it. I asked it to be chilled and the bar tender asked me how to do it? really! put it in the fridge or fill it with ice for few min.I ordered  Roast-Beef Stuffed Yorkshire and it was just down right awful. Tasteless. Worse is the UFC event was being shown in SD even though they have HDTV. Place was reasonably busy but I wouldn't come back here. 2 star is a stretch for this place."}
{"text":"The E&C is a neat (albeit almost touristy) restaurant and pub in TO that fits the bill when you're looking for a nice, but not too expensive place to sit down and eat.  The service was a bit slower that I expected for a place that wasn't that busy.  I don't blame our server (even though I had to wait for my dinner for a bit after everyone else received theirs) - she was very good.  My guess is that they were a bit short on staff that evening.  Prices are a little on the higher side, but the food is good and portions are fine for a major metro restaurant.  Beer selection was also good and our server was knowledgeable of what types were offered.  We skipped dessert because basically we were full.  E&C is the type of place you can rely on being there, and open even on a holiday.  If you're not interested in taking a chance on an unknown, the E&C is a safe bet for a good meal In a nice atmosphere!"}
{"text":"Ordered some pub grub - shepherds pie and chicken fingers with poutine. The chicken was cold, they forgot the poutine and gave fries instead. The shepherds pie was extremely greasy (you could see the bottom part swimming in it), and lacked any flavour. I'd go back for a drink, but skip this joint for dinner- there's better options in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"This place was a great surprise.  I had been a few times for drinks and never thought the food would be anything of note, I assumed it was just another pub with a greasy deep fried menu, I was wrong.  Decided to grab dinner here one night with our drinks and couldnt believe how good it all was. We had this amazing little indian pizza that came on this naan like bread and the jalapeño mac and cheese. Both were so so good.  Prices are fair. Great drink selection and beers on tap.   My only complaint would be that the service isn't always great. There are a couple waitresses who would rather chat and finish personal conversations with co-workers than focus on taking care of their tables. That being said there were other times where the service was friendly and top notch.  All-in-all, very happy with this place and will be returning for the food and drinks."}
{"text":"This is a great pub right in the heart of downtown Yonge Street. It's an a beautiful old bank building that's been lovingly maintained on the inside, so it has character to spare. I like that's it's a relatively upscale pub without being too pretentious or expensive.  Given its location, the E&C can be very busy for much of the year, so it can be hard to find a seat. It's much better in the summer though since there's no patio, so you can usually find a table pretty easily in the warmer months.  There's a great partial second floor that overlooks the main floor. I've been up here for a number of group events, and would recommend it for groups of 20-30. It's quieter than the main floor, but it's not closed off like like private areas in some pubs.  In terms of the food, the menu is quite good. I had the butter chicken last time, and it was really well prepared. I'm surprised that they don't offer more Indian pub fare given how good this was.  The beer list is quite long and the service is very accommodating and friendly. All in all, this is one of the better places to grab a pint in the area."}
{"text":"This place was right up my alley. My wife and I shot in here for a quick bite to eat before the Blue Jays game. We only had an hour and we were in and out in 35 minutes. We made it to the game on time and our waitress was very accommodating. My wife and I make it a point to go to a pub in every city we visit. Their beer selection was great and we enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"Wish I had something like this in this area!  We wandered in on St. Patrick's Day.  Service was friendly.  Beer was cold and plentiful!"}
{"text":"Great place to go before or after a sports game. The place has been totally renovated so if you have been in the past you must go again. Nice modern look. You forget you are in a British pub. The fish and chips are excellent. Service was very good for a party of 8."}
{"text":"It's a pub. It is done in \"funky British style\". I know the guy who used to run the line here. The food is decent pub grub and the drinks are the usual line up of corporate beers and cocktails. It's a okay place for a pint but lacks the character of the Queen and Beaver (upscale) or the Imperial (dive) which are also in the area."}
{"text":"For what it is, elephant and castle is pretty classic. Typical dt pub. However, what I love  about it most is that you feel like your in an old bank and or house while having a pint or meal. Service I've had is beyond friendly and conversational. Prices are standard and they seem to have something on special each time. Locations are great all dT easily accessible by walking or ttc. Classic spot for quick pint or bite to eat."}
{"text":"Very classy place with great food really good prices for the area it is in.  Very friendly staff ."}
{"text":"Definitely prefer the King St location. I ordered a gin and tonic and was served a short glass of tonic with a lime wedge that had some white thing stuck to it. Lime incident--gross, but no gin in my G&T at a \"pub\" is unthinkable. They remade the drink (with gin this time) but I got a lime wedge that had been cut so long ago that it had fossilized. I literally could not get one drop of juice out of it.  Food came... fries were delicious. Burger--ok. I did hear the chef sending back food that came up that wasn't to his standards, so maybe they are making positive changes. Would be a higher rating if my alcoholic beverage had alcohol the first time.   My waitress was amazing, that's always a plus."}
{"text":"My friend and I came here in the mid-afternoon - a little late lunch, and far too early to be dinner. As a result, the place had very few people in it and we easily got undivided attention from the waitstaff.  Ambiance: This place feels like a classic pub, and holds all of the character of one. When you walk in, you will find yourself in a comfortably dim room with beautiful dark-colored wood everywhere.   Food: Pretty good! I had the Shepherd's Pie and it was delicious. My friend had a burger which came with a grand helping of fries. Yummy all around!  Service: It took a little while before any staff came by to pick up my credit card so we could pay for the bill and get out of there. Otherwise, they were perfectly courteous and checked in with our table every so often."}
{"text":"Nice drink menu and decor, but service was a disappointment. Our group was told we were not permitted to transfer from the bar to a table. It was not busy so we weren't interfering with reservations. Given the vast choices in a big city like TO, take your business elsewhere."}
{"text":"A decent English style watering hole with a sports twist.   Everywhere in the world, there seems to be a 'sanctuary' disguised as an English pub, and this is a perfect example. It's the place you can go, completely casual, or even a little formal, and be comfortable everywhere in between.   The food is well prepared at a reasonable price. The service staff is friendly and attentive. The English 'atmosphere' is nice, even with a few big flat screens over the bar. Wherever you are from, and wherever you are going, this is a place where you will feel comfortable with friends, or as a solo wanderer. It may not make the '1000 things to do before you die' book, but it's certainly a good stop over in between."}
{"text":"Went with my brother on Wednesday before the Jays game. It was great! No complaints at all. I felt out of place because of all the business people in there. The food was great! I recommend it 100%."}
{"text":"It's been a month since I last ate here. It was okay to say the least. Honestly, there is not much to write about since it wasn't memorable. Eh."}
{"text":"Go for the pints. Stay for ... more pints.  I had a soft ban on E&C for the last year'ish as they'd hiked their prices, hadn't really done anything with their menu and, frankly, there's no shortage of pubs in the city, but I lifted it for lunch yesterday as I needed a quick pint and patio in the area.  The tap selection is solid, ranging from Bass to Sapporo and they've revamped the menu, so it was a refreshing change. There's nothing life-altering here, but lots of traditional pub fare at reasonable prices.  And to boot, the service was fantastic. Moments after sitting down, I heard my favourite restaurant words, \"Can I start you off with a beverage?\""}
{"text":"This place is not amazing but it is far from bad. It is what I would call a \"polished pub,\" it is located in a great location, very clean, large and with lots of space. It is quite long so if you just want to hang out at the bar, there are two bars to pick from, then there are lots of tables and pool tables to play in.   Normally if I have an event we go to the back and the beers are not badly price for a place on King Street.   Main reason why I used to come here is because it was close enough to work, however most of my co-workers never bothered coming this up north so it was a great place to hang without having to deal with the gossip/etc from my office. However your mileage regarding this might vary. :-P  You will also notice a lot of pre and post TSO patrons as they come here for a snack or a late aperitif before going home.   Honestly, I would recommend this place if you are in the hood and want a relatively nice looking pub where you can sit, have a few and chat with your friends."}
{"text":"Typical Pub establishment. The staff are friendly and personable. I do enjoy the variety on their menu. The prices are fair. It's across from the office so I can get in/out on my lunch break. I visit about twice a month."}
{"text":"This steak and mushroom pot pie is the bomb!! The pastry top is scrumptious and the steak inside is tender. The salad dressing was a bit too sour though."}
{"text":"It's an interesting building. In 1902, the Canadian General Electric Company s bought a section of the old Upper Canada College grounds. The Great Fire of 1904 destroyed the existing manufacturing in Toronto.  The building at 212 King Street West was commissioned by the Canadian General Electric Company Limited.  Canadian General Electric Company Building, designed by architects Darling and Pearson, opened in December 1908. The building is also known as the Union Building.  But enough of  the history of the building. Let's start with some problems (don't stop reading here it's really a very, very nice place). The building isn't mobility friendly. There's about ten steps to walk up to get to the entrance. There is another entrance at street leave on Simcoe St., but those doors were locked.   I was seated at a table in the bar area. The table was very small, about 18in around. It was a table for two but even as a single service there was little room. The other tables that had two people at them were also struggling to keep things from falling off. The other issues with the table was the pedestal. It's a four sided, scalloped shaped wooden stand that I kept bumping into and twice almost toppled the table over.   These issues can all be over looked. The next one was more serious. I stopped into the washroom before leaving (and again going with the mobility issue there were steps to go up and down). The walls in the washroom were marked and damaged in areas. The inside of the stalls had graffiti and tagging on the walls.  So lets be positive now. The staff was very friendly and professional. The inside of the restaurant was beautifully decorate and very clean. It wasn't busy however there were a few people in the restaurant. I liked how they spaced out the guests allowing for privacy and comfort between tables.  It was there a little after two in the afternoon and looked over the lunch menu. There was a nice selection of items to choose from. Not being too adventurism I settled on the E & C Club. The sandwich with fries were very good and the portions were a good size.    One of the things I appreciated most came at the end of my visit. Nothing upsets me more than having to wait to pay for my meal and get out. After I finished the server asked if there was anything more. She then produced the bill, I paid for it and was on my way. I liked that . . . or maybe they just wanted to get rid of me as soon as possible."}
{"text":"This is the first Elephant and Castle I've been in. I was very impressed. The location is and old Dominion Bank. The inside has been decorated in a up scale pub style. The bank value is still located downstairs near the washrooms.  I only had the soup of the day but the menu seemed to have a number interesting items. The prices might be a little more than your typical roadhouse or sports bar but nothing out of line.   The service was fast and friendly.  All and all it was a very good experience."}
{"text":"Oh my gosh.  Elephant and Castle was the best pub-style restaurant I've ever been to.  My friend and I stayed at the Delta Chelsea next door, and decided to try this place out.  We immediately loved the decor, and we were seated very quickly but a friendly waitress. Our order was taken within 5 minutes and we had drinks. I had a Shirley Temple and my friend had a Guiness. My drink was delicious and came with two cherries and an ornge slice as a garnish. It was nice to see the extra cherry, as most places just use one.  Less than 10 minutes later, we had our food. And my God, best fries and chicken fingers I've ever had. My friend had fish and chips and let me try some fish - extremely tasty and not greasy at all which is refreshing.  Waitress came once and asked how everything was - absolutely perfect timing and frequency of visits. When she saw we were done, she came and asked if we wanted dessert. We declined, but appreciated the offer. We tipped nicely. Well done!  Definetely want to come back again."}
{"text":"Just stopped in for a local tap beer. Chris the bartender, was helpful, friendly, and pick out a brew on tap that I totally enjoyed. The pub was beautifully decorated and husky in appeal. Enough said. I like this pub. May go back tonight"}
{"text":"We chose this place for the butter chicken poutine. Oh my god!!!! First of all the French fries were cooked nice and crispy so the sauce didn't make them mushy. Then there was this amazing layer of butter chicken and cheese curd and then a white sauce (not sure if it was a sour cream). Two of us ate this dishes in 10 mins. It was so good. We also ordered the fish and chips but after the poutine not much else could taste as good. Service was ok, waiter forgot my friends drink twice and then blamed it on the bartender. Not so cool. Otherwise, super cool atmosphere and nice decor."}
{"text":"Meatloaf wrapped with bacon! Delicious! Not dry at all! Very flavourful. Had their chicken pot pie too. Pretty decent."}
{"text":"Didn't start off on a good note. Lazy red-head  hostess said there were no booths available, yet we saw at least 5 open. We pointed one out and were seated there. Waitress was friendly. My steak was burnt when I asked for it medium and drinks were empty for a majority of the dinner. Would not recommend."}
{"text":"Absolute crap. If I want to spend $65.00 on dinner somewhere it would most likely be somewhere other than a pub. NOT just two club sandwiches on stale bread with fries that tasted like vinegar, although I had not put any on them. Reusing fries guys??  Really bad service although they were walking all over the place. NO THANKS"}
{"text":"I must admit I found my pre-theatre dinner here really frustrating. If you are anything other than a straight up \"meat n' potatoes\" type, then you're a bit screwed. Our waitress was really apologetic and tried so hard to figure out something to serve us, but in the end, got stuck with steamed broccolini. For a King St location, you sure are closed minded when it comes to dietary restrictions. :("}
{"text":"We went at lunch for a farewell meal and gathering.  It was nice to be seated quickly and the service was quick and lunch hour was on thier mind as well.  Love places that recognize this important fact.  People need to get back to the office.  Food was gorgeously presented.  Amoung our group we had various dishes...fish tacos...butter chicken...chicken wraps...and the burger!  Loved it!  Great space, clean washrooms, the complete package."}
{"text":"Butter chicken wasn't too bad! But still a bit expensive.  They have daily specials! From Wednesday to Friday some beers are at 6$ :)"}
{"text":"Second Time here we came first time in April what a change in some of the menu..esp the salad we were not aware of the walnuts added on we had to tell them about the allergy the waitress and manager were very nice to make a whole new plate without any issues.  we loved the food and location.  we will def be back keep up the good work .  we had fish tacos, steak, and turkey wrap. all thumps up"}
{"text":"I was pleasantly surprised with this place. I got the wedge salad. I have to admit I think the wedge thing where they leave the lettuce in a wedge instead of breaking it into pieces is pretty weird, but it still tasted really nice. I substituted the blue cheese dressing for balsamic and the waitress was really nice about it. The service was also very good and fast. All in all I'd definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Elephant & Castle has a good selection of food and alcohol.  It resembles a traditional English pub and serves pub fare such as shepherd's pie, bangers and mash, and fish & chips of course.  They do these menu items well.  If you ever want to book a big group, they are always accommodating.  Sometimes service can be a bit slow and last time I went there we waited a while for our drinks and even longer to pay our bill.  Overall the staff are friendly.  I particularly like the bread pudding."}
{"text":"Today I tried the blue cheese burger at Elephant & Castle. It was half decent burger for a Pub. However, word of advice, if you're going there for lunch there's bit of slowness with the service which indicates being understaffed. This location is at the university and King, surrounded by thousands and thousands of offices, downtown Toronto...so no one should wait 35 minuets for a burger. But server was apologetic and agreeable to customers dismay. To be fair dinner time is not chaotic."}
{"text":"We had gone to E&C after a Jays game walking up from the Rogers Centre so the area was pretty busy with thousands of people walking the streets and places nearby were starting to fill up with hungry and sad Jays fans... oh and some happy Yankees fans too.  I had been by this place many times in the decades that this place was here and I've actually never been inside.  The space is pretty impressive in that they have 2 large bars, one at the main entrance off King and another at the back of the building near Pearl street.  The dining area seems a little confined though, not as open as it possibly could be but the layout is not as cramped considering some of the booths are made to fit more than 6 people.    The E&C at Yonge and Gerrard is much more open in that they have headroom, being an old bank and all.  Still the feeling is cozy and it has nice decor for a pub.  The service was good and the food was ok.  I had asked if they made their own burgers and I was told no however the lamb burger was made in house.  I was hungry so instead I decided to just go with the double beef burger.  It was good but it seemed a little overcooked.  The bacon and cheese sort of made up for it.  I liked the cut of the fries and everybody seemed to be happy with their food.  My friends ordered the mahi mahi fish tacos, reuben sandwich and my wife had the salmon burger which she enjoyed.  This place would be great for large groups as they have the size, a decent amount of screens around the dining areas and also space for large booths."}
{"text":"Great venue for large groups they are very accommodating.  Food is typical pub grub, hearty and filling. Tried the shepherds pie.  It was presented in a small round soup dish with a scoop of mash atop the ground beef.  The mash was average and could have used some garlic and a dash of pepper.  Same could be said for the filling which was a little bland and lacking in peas and carrots.  The dish was filling though and at $13.00 reasonable. The small side salad that came with it was fresh and tasty.  Drinks selection was decent and I liked that they had a few cider options.  Service was ok."}
{"text":"I alway eat here before I go to an event at Roy Thompson Hall. This will be my last visit. Each time it gets worse and worse. Always packed, never can get a table and then forced to sit at bar, with a cold breeze from outside always coming in.  This time the waitress just threw my plate on the table and walked away... food was cold too."}
{"text":"This is the second Elephant & Castle I've been to and it is ultimately the best one.  The decor is great, as it's like being inside a 1930s British bank.  However, like all pubs, it's loud, so albeit the excellent decor, I would skip this place for date night and reserve it for a night out with your pals instead.  There are two floors, and although you're given a little privacy on the second floor, I recommend getting a spot on the first floor. Next to the IG-worthy telephone booth would be the best.  This is because service can be quite slow at this branch, particularly when you're on the second floor. When you're on the first floor, you can wave down a server, whereas on the second floor, you'll have to wait for a server to check up on you (one only checked up once an hour while I was on the second floor...).    Food-wise, the top choices in my book would be the Yorkshire Pudding and the Shepherd's Pie.  In general, the food here is fairly priced and well portioned.  In fact, the Yorkshire Pudding was massive.  There was so much roast beef that I was in heaven! It wasn't too dry and the sauce it came with definitely upped the ante on the flavour!  What I wouldn't recommend is probably the Bangers and Mash, which was surprisingly the smallest dish out of the pub favourites.  Although it looked delicious, I don't think my company thought it was worth the price she paid.  Go for the Yorkshire pudding and pies, trust me.   Overall, Elephant & Castle provided the best pub experience I've had. Most pubs don't have the best decor and food quality.  Here, they're not bad and with a fair price to boot. When you're done shopping at Eaton Centre, try this place out for some pub grub."}
{"text":"This is a bar first and anything else second.  The atmosphere is kind of nice as it must be an old bank because of the super high ornate ceiling and the lighting is dim.  They have sort of a terrace but I didn't see anybody up there.  It's on top of what is the kitchen I believe.  Anyway we just stopped in for some drinks and we ended up having a couple appetizers: some fried pickles and the pretzel sticks.  The apps were decent but the sauce that came with both seems like it was the same thing because I think they were.  It was some sort of chipotle mayo looking thing but I thought it was supposed to be mustard?  Not sure... it didn't really matter.  They had Innis and Gunn on draught... I was like whaaaat?  Had that... it was good... because it was Innis and Gunn.  Period.  Nice ambiance, friendly server, in and out pretty quick..."}
{"text":"I visit Elephant and Castle after almost every late movie watching at Yonge and Dundas with friends since it is still on the way for us that have to TTC or walk home. Its consistency and location are what keep us coming here. I'm never amazed at anything I've had here, beer selection is just average and their food (which I don't always order) is just sub par typical pub food. But at the same time I don't remember being disappointed by anything I've ordered here either.   It offers a comfy setting for a drink a few TVs if you want to catch a game (but I wouldn't really recommend this Elephant and Castle as a good sports bar and be warned that washrooms are a mighty trek away.  I've never been here for lunch so I can't really comment to how they perform for a solid meal, there are better options available in the area for food.  While it lacks much charm or character, the Elephant and Castle gets the job done if you want a quick pint to catch up with friends."}
{"text":"The server was rude. We came here in our green shirts for some green beer on St.Patty's day. I know that it's busy but let us enjoy our drinks and our food. She came up to tell us that the line up is an hour long and that if we had somewhere else to head down to,we should.Fine with me b****,but let me finish my beer."}
{"text":"The biggest draw about Castle, for me, is it's convenience. It's right down the street from my apartment so it's quick and easy. However, it's not just the convenience aspect that keeps bringing me back here.   First off, the waitresses are very nice. Even when it's a little busy, they're still very attentive and quick to take your order. I dig that about sit down places.   The food is also pretty good. I'm really feelin' the new chicken and brie sandwich. The food also comes out relatively quick and is always on point.   Definitely coming back here many more times to come."}
{"text":"Service was terrible - came here with work colleagues and our waiter William couldn't be worse .  Didn't honour our reservation, was incompetent with our orders, asked for separate bills but failed to execute this since \"he was too busy\", gave our group attitude. To say the least, service was terrible. Walk a bit further down and go to moxies, you'll be much happier."}
{"text":"Great pub food at a reasonable price. Love their Caesar wrap, especially since it comes with a delicious salad. This location is super big and you aren't too close to neighbouring parties. TVs around for sports games and a great bunch of servers. Loved the affordable cocktails as well!"}
{"text":"Great for watching a sports game over drinks. The kitchen is slow and the food is mediocre."}
{"text":"Absolutely terrible service. Came here on a Monday night with my family, restaurant completely dead. Ordered our drinks which we didn't receive for 10 minutes as I just watched them waiting for me at the bar. Received my cosmopolitan with a foreign floating substance in it absolutely appalled. Ordered fried pickles as an appetizer and we waited 20 minutes and still haven't received them and we mention it to the waitress.... what do ya know she didn't even put in the order and was completely dumbfounded. Shortly after that we get our entrees... which were very good ! No complains about them. Halfway through our dinner we get our appetizer.... which were disgusting. The pickles were nonexistent with a thick coating of batter and grease. You'd think the waitress wouldn't charge us for our appetizer not even being an appetizer but nope she charged us. Did I mention we were the only table this waitress had and yet still couldn't handle it. We get our bill from the bartender who took all our plates and our waitress was no where to be seen the rest of the night... hoping for further customers she was fired."}
{"text":"I would come here for drinks, but lunch today was awful. Everything we tried was completely unseasoned, bland and tasted of nothing. The au jus with the French dip sandwich was brown water. The beef had no flavor and a weird, woolly texture. The waitress picked up the plate of barely touched food without asking how it was, and it appeared on the bill at full price."}
{"text":"Good food!! Waitstaff was friendly and their Veggie Burger was great!!! Fries were crispy and crunchy. I would recommend this place to anyone who likes great food."}
{"text":"Has a very cozy, modern tavern interior which I loved. The service is good and so are the drink selections. Had a nice glass of red wine. We also tried the mac and cheese and it was really great. Came with jalapeño and mozzarella baked under a very crispy seasoned bread crumb crust. Price range was very reasonable and includes drink options on both higher and lower costs/quality. Overall quite happy and will return!"}

{"text":"As a member of my office's extremely important and prestigious party planning committee, I can attest to how hard it is to find a place that 1) can serve ~100 people, 2) has decent food, 3) is within our rigid budget. It's one of those 'Pick 2 of 3' scenarios.  Enter E&C, who said \"screw your Venn Diagram restrictions\" and generously bestowed amazing food at amazing prices for a large, hungry crowd of office workers. I wouldn't have believed it was possible if I didn't experience it myself. When you think large-scale department office party, you think chewy pizza and supermarket fries but E&C refuses to stoop to that level.   First up, on the finger food menu were thick-cut truffle fries. Yes, TRUFFLE fries, of the wide, crispy variety. Following that were both vegetarian and beef burgers that didn't skimp out on the toppings. Then juicy chicken tenders, with an emphasis on the tender, and saucy Buffalo wings. Crispy calamari. Cheesy nachos. Delicious little pizza bites. A variety of fresh veggies and hummus for those looking to balance against all the fried stuff. And that's just round 1 of 3!!  I will also say that I've been here a few times for lunch. It was always good, nothing spectacular, but consistent quality at reasonable downtown lunch prices. I never had anything to write home about. The large group catering however, that's where it's at! If you ever find yourself in a position as critical as deciding what the people in your office eat, you'll know who to call.   (7/100) - 2018"}
{"text":"British Drinking Establishment otherwise known commonly as a Pub. Bevvies priced acceptably.  Service not too shabby if I do say so. Decor has a level of grandiose situated in a Historical TD Bank Building. It was surprisingly not as packed as nearby Jack Astor or Milestones. 2.0 - 2.5'd  Country Fried Chicken(Fridays Special $15)  Crisp outer batter envelopes overcooked underseasoned Chicken Breast. Gravy was used to compensate but that left none for the Mashed Potatoes. No Cream Soup left and we didn't want Salad.  Waiter took $2.00 off tab."}
{"text":"Amazing place for a nice bite. I got the make your own gin and tonic and the fish tacos. Super fresh ingredients seriously one of the most tasty fish tacos I've ever had. Waiting staff was quick and friendly. Definitely would recommend!"}
{"text":"I have not been to this bar in ages but when I recently stepped in to take a look, I was surprised that it was renovated. Instantly, I booked the back bar for a party and the managers were very accommodating. All of the staff were very nice and everyone enjoyed the party.  I didn't have time to try any of the platters but it appeared everyone enjoyed the food. We ordered sliders, wings, chicken tenders, and dessert. The sliders were surprising since it was a actually burgers split into 4. All the platters were cleared quickly even though it was an after dinner party. Some mentioned the sliders were pretty good.  The staff allowed us to play games and the best part is that the venue had two entrances. Our party had an exclusive door and we setup the registration table where the hostess would normally be seated. That was a nice touch as it appeared that we had the whole restaurant to ourselves.  I didn't give it five stars as I did order something else before the event started. Thinking that I would have more food later, I decided to try the lettuce wraps. However, I was very disappointed with the dish as the peanut taste overwhelmed the entire plate. I hastily finished the dish without mentioning my dissatisfaction to the staff as my mind was on hosting the event.  I have tried the nachos and wings on a previous visit before the event and they were relatively good. For the wings, you can definitely order the sauce on the side. Definitely will return for drinks and also hosting a party again.   For the holidays, they have a promotion where you guy a $50 gift card (used towards food, drinks and gratuity) and they will reward you with a $20 gift card to be used in January for food only."}
{"text":"Walked into the Pub after a long day and we were just trying to find a place to relax and have a couple of drinks and food. There was no one at the front to greet us so we were standing there for a bit. A couple was leaving so we moved to the side where the hostess greets customers,  so they could walk out. As this happened, the hostess (a woman in her 40s, blonde hair) returned, saw us, asked us to move out of her way in a very rudely matter, and followed to ask whether we were staying or not, and overall she was not friendly at all. Sadly, this was enough for us to make a decision to leave, and found a much nicer and friendlier place. I'm sure the place is not bad, but due to the poor customer service we experienced, we will not be coming back again."}
{"text":"My friend and I sort of stopped here with the full intent of a \"wham bam thank you m'am\" ordeal. One pint then off to our next pub for a whole new adventure.  That didn't happen, thanks to a nice man who started buying us drinks. The decor was \"pubbish\" enough and the crowd seemed to be a bit out of my age range. The barman was friendly (pretty as well) and frankly, I can't remember the cost of the pint!"}
{"text":"Nice restaurant chain.  I've been to the location on king street often and it was my first time at the college location.  This wasn't as great but still good pub food.  The French dpi and their burgers are tasty.  The fries are sometimes a bit too over fried but great with mayo.  When I went this time, they were doing training for new employees and some of the dishes were not available.  I'd still return but hopefully, they will make some changes to make it more like the king street location."}
{"text":"This feels like a traditional British pub, so you'll probably like it if that's your thing. They have a good selection of British beers and traditional menu items (shepherd's pie, anyone? That's what my husband had). I got a salmon burger and I'm pretty sure the patty was from a box in a freezer, which was a bit disappointing. Good french fries though. The service was good and prices were very reasonable. Seems like a fun place to have a birthday party, or to stop for a beer after work."}
{"text":"I came here for lunch during weekdays with 2 friends right at noon.  Due to peak time, the services is a bit slow, but still within the hour.   My friend order wraps and burger, and I order Steak and mushroom pot pie, it's pretty good and I like it a lot.  The atmosphere is really nice & relax, and feels like a classic pub.  Will definitely come back again!!!"}
{"text":"Ummm -- can we say stuffed Yorkshire pudding.  With roast beef and gravy.   I didn't even know such a thing existed.   Good place to grab a drink / quick bite before or after the theatre.    I would go out of my way in the city to go here again.    Great quality food.    Recommended!!"}
{"text":"I went there for the first time with a friend  who loves the E & C and this place surpassed my expectations. The space is spacious, warm and charming, the food great and the service top notch.   I had the rocket (arugula) salad with a filet of salmon as per the server's suggestion and was very happy with it. To drink I ordered a beer cocktail that involved cassis and guiness. It turned out to be a little on the sweet side-- was nice to start but be careful to drink quickly as it's not so good when at room temperature."}
{"text":"This place was LIT UP yesterday for the El Clasico game between Barcelona and Real Madrid. If you are a FC Barca fan, this pub seems to be THE fan club spot for games! Crowd was unreal.  Conveniently located right at King W & Simcoe St, they have a pretty big space with various rooms of tables and seating at the multiple bars. Comfortably spacious and good amount of natural lighting.   They have all your typical pub food favourites and beer selections. We ordered the mahi mahi fish tacos and the fish and chips. I found the fish tacos to be too soggy and drippy but the portions were big. The fish and chips had a really thick batter and the white fish was a bit overcooked and rubbery so I wouldn't be recommending these 2 items.. The sweet potato fries were good though!   However, considering the great atmosphere, I wasn't too picky on the food and the 4 stars is mainly based on the comfortable seating, great Spanish beer and epic atmosphere that day. Will be back for future Barca games!!"}
{"text":"I went with my friend between fashion shows at Fashion Week last Thursday to grab a pint and a bite.  Service was slow but I believe our waitress had a bunch of tables assigned to her and we were not in a huge rush anyway. There were also a group of men being pretty rude to her as well which probably did not motivate her to move much faster either. She was perfectly pleasant to us however, which we appreciated.  I ordered a SteamWhistle pint ($5 special from 4pm-6pm Monday-Thursday I believe) and a turkey club sandwich with a side salad. The sandwich was tasty, ordered the way I had requested (dry toast, mayo on the side). I enjoyed my meal and would come back.  Overall, no complaints. Stick to beer and \"traditional pub food\" here and you will be fine. Also, probably not best to visit if you are in a rush."}
{"text":"After enjoying a really...really good burger and fries at a restaurant in the Distillery District, my brother and I felt like more burgers. It was our last day of our trip, so we picked Elephant & Castle, which is next door to Delta Chelsea hotel.  Big mistake.  While the place looks nice upon entering, that is where the positives end. The service was awful, the glass we were served drinks in were filthy and the food was pretty gross. I felt as if I was eating a McDonald's burger at times and wonder why I even finished my lunch. The waitress came to our table 4 times...to place an order...give us our drinks...give us our food and a check.   Now I do not think the wait staff needs to do somersaults and dance the charleston in order to be considered good. I mean the woman was sitting at the bar gossiping about co-workers...how do I know? Because our table was 5 feet from where she was sitting! Talk about hating your gig. Luckily I did not want refills on my dirty glass filled with flat soda or else I would have been upset.  Skip this place and check out Mill St. Brewery in the Distillery District or Wolf and Firkin right around the corner for a good burger in Toronto."}
{"text":"After seeing a show at Roy Thomson Hall, a friend I stopped by at this place around 23:00 on 06 April 2018.  The place wasn't all that busy, the staff were friendly and we were shown to a table immediately.  I ordered a bottle of Canadian ($6.00), chicken wings ($12.50), and my friend ordered a glass of 9oz House Red wine ($10.00).   The chicken wings were dry, over cooked and cold.  The quantity for the extreme price of $12.50 wasn't bad, but I guess when one arrives at that hour, the food has been kept warm and you get the leftovers.   With $3.71 HST the bill was $32.21.  A bit pricey for what we ordered.  However I can't blame the restaurant, and this isn't a site where we rant about taxes, street cars, King Street, oh,  you know what I mean.  lol"}
{"text":"Ratings: Food: 7/10 Drink: 9/10 Service: 8/10 Value: 8/10 Hygiene: 9/10 Aesthetics: 9/10  I came here for a friend's birthday with about 30 other people. I think the first impression I got while they were seating us was Wow, this place looks a lot bigger on the inside than the outside (TARDIS effect perhaps? Hahaha)   When I go to any English pub, I always look for the pot pies or yorkshire pudding (yorkies). They are a staple of any pub, and you rarely go wrong with meat pies. I got a yorkie myself, and I was quite disappointed. The crust was overcooked and they used sliced beef instead of cubes of steak. The overcooked crust threw me off, even though the flavours were alright. It definitely didn't measure up to other yorkies I've had before. The pot pies however, were much better and definitely would have been a better choice.   The cost of food here is around $10-15 for a dish, typical for pub food.  They have a good variety of beers on tap, so you'll be able to find something to drink.    It definitely has the feel of a more classic pub while trying, with wooden wall mouldings. The pub itself like I mentioned earlier is really big. It's great for large parties and has a nice ambience.  The service here is friendly and courteous.  This place is a good pub and it has its merits, most of the food was good, but next time I'm not ordering a yorkie. Still a nice place to catch a game or have a pint."}
{"text":"With two levels for seating, this resto has BAARE space for larger parties (even some pretty romantic two seaters that overlook the balcony on the second floor if you come for date night). They have a lot of cool decor, easily used for conversation starters. Although the atmosphere is quite loud, it is expected for a bar/pub/resto (especially because we DID visit on a Friday night).  I ordered a steak and mushroom pot pie ($14), which was a LOT more filling than I had anticipated. The bread it was served with was to die for: soft, yet had a subtle crunch (it was basically like a croissant...but, flat). Under my parachute of carbs, was a bowl of mushroom x steak stew. It was very hot (temperature wise), and was the perfect remedy for either a sick day or a nostalgic walk down memory lane to when your mom made beef stew. LOL Just so yall know, the salad that it comes with has almonds on it (and cranberries - which I really liked).  I'll be posting photos of what my friends ordered. The only reasons I'm giving this place 4 stars is: their service and the shock of coldness we get from walking downstairs to the washroom (where, at the time, one washroom was completely clogged and wouldn't even flush). The service was quite slow. We had to wave our waitress down when we needed her, and even had to ask her to refill the cups of water because she hadn't even after she passed us a couple of times. Honestly, it was probably because we were seated at the furthest table on the second floor - quite secluded, but enough privacy to be public (lol, if that makes any sense)."}
{"text":"A pleasant pub offering comfy atmosphere with nice decor, a welcoming and friendly disposition from the staff, and food that's very tasty for a chain pub, at reasonable prices. Great for catching up with friends after work.  Have had the butter chicken, mac n' cheese and burger here, and I recommend all of these dishes- they're flavourful, unpretentious and are served in good-sized portions."}
{"text":"Great, really tasty Ale and Onion soup!  Very burnt salmon entree, but the service is good and overall atmosphere"}
{"text":"Good service, decent pub food for the price. Tried the truffle potato chips to start and they were great. It's exactly what you picture when you think of a pub! Had the burger with a house salad. Burger was good but salad was just okay. Overall, I'll be back for the appetizer and the $8 gin&tonics on fridays!"}
{"text":"Cool interior for a pub. However, the food was awful. Burnt burgers and meatloaf.  The chicken curry was actually pretty good, but avoid anything with ground beef as they seem to think food safety on lower grade beef means full on burnt instead of well done.  Also, seems to be a very child friendly pub.  Good news to some, bad news to others."}
{"text":"Sometimes service and atmosphere can make or break a meal.   I went to Elephant and Castle to watch UFC 127 with my brother and a friend of his. The bar was the emptiest I've seen for a UFC card, but it also wasn't the best line up, so I'll cut E & C a break there.   I started the night with a Guiness, which took the entire 2nd Period of the Leaf game to get the waitresses attention and eventually, the drink in front of me. By the time Mike Milbury was done saying something, which we couldn't hear with the sound off, we were finally asked for our orders.  I got the Guiness Meatloaf. I'm a big meatloaf fan, and this was one of the best I've had and it only took until 5 minutes left in the third period to get to me. By this time, my brother's friend was able to order his beer after finally getting the attention of a bartender.   When the UFC event started, the sound was turned on to the far speaker, making the whole show sound like a whisper. The crowd wasn't really into the fights either, instead picking up and leaving mid-card or talking about their day at work. Even with knockouts and submissions being scored, the crowd was unaffected.  I ended the night with a Bailey Cheesecake while BJ Penn and Jon Fitch fought to an unexciting majority draw. The cheesecake was sloppy, but tasty nonetheless.   It may have been better if I wasn't made to feel guilty for ordering food at all in the first place."}
{"text":"Searching for somewhere to eat between the Rogers Center and the Hilton hotel around 10 at night.  Stumbled upon this place.  Its a very modern take on an English tavern.  The place was huge.  There were thousands of people roaming the streets, some of which went here, so I figured we wouldn't have a chance at sitting down to eat.  Turned out to be only a five minute wait.  Good sized menu with lots of beer & wine options.  We were seated but it took a pretty decent amount of time to get our drink order.  Then drinks took a while to arrive.  Water came without ice and one of the beers came out after our food.    I ordered the chicken pot pie and got pretzels & nachos for an app.  As slow as the service was, which I don't blame our waiter for (the place was packed and seemed a little short staffed), the food came out very quick.  Pretzels were great.  Huge and perfect doughy texture.  Didn't care much for the mustard dip. Chicken pot pie was great.  Fluffy crust on the outside and the inside was delicious.  Came with a garden salad, some of which wasn't fresh. Nachos were horrible.  We blamed ourselves for ordering chos at a British themed restaurant.  The beef had no flavor, onions were extremely overpowering and the cheese didn't add much to it.  When the waiter finally asked how we were doing our food was gone.  He was very concerned that we hardly touched the nachos though.  Took a long time to get the check but when we did a manager came over and apologized for the nachos.  He even took them off our bill.  We didn't want or need an apology for them, let alone a freebie so I thought that was great customer service.  I don't visit Toronto very often but I don't think i'd run back here.  If you order the right thing and can deal with the busy restaurant this place is just fine."}
{"text":"Forgot there was another location, however Elephant & Castle is your cozy, comfort type of pub with all the typical favorites such as reuben sandwiches, yorkshire pies, mac and cheese, etc.  The ambience is warm, welcoming, and busy due to its popularity, and location.  After a work meeting, this was a the place to be, the food is an overall 4/5.  Most notable was their artichoke dip with chips, as well their heavy hitter favorite, the Mac and Cheese, which had panko crusted top, and pieces of bacon. The server was knowledgable, polite, and efficient!!! definitely a great experience overall here.  Their selections of wines was a bit short, but again, its a pub!!!!"}
{"text":"Nice decor in this location.  Came in on a Sunday morning around 11:45.  The restaurant was mostly empty yet we were seated wayyyy in the back and right next to another table.  We ordered the Yorkies as an appetizer which were quite good.  Service was decent but we waited a bit for refills and the check.  Entrees were standard, I got a steak sandwich and my wife roast beef sandwich.  Fries were not fresh cut which go much better with poutine.  Gravy was alright but could be much better.  I'd return but it wouldn't be my first choice."}
{"text":"We love this place!  Great UK fare; roast beef could be better quality with more meat and less fat and gristle...but the fish & chips are excellent.  We especially enjoy that we can get an Innis & Gunn here.  I have yet to find a restaurant/bar that serves Wytchwood or Hobgoblin beer.  :-(  Reasonable prices, and friendly service!  ^_^"}
{"text":"The food was good but the service was garbage. Server had a resting b face the entire time and looked like she hated being there. We should've turned around right away but we were hungry and stayed to watch the game on tv.   Find a better place to eat where you don't have to waste time discussing how crappy your server is"}
{"text":"This was right down the street where we were staying so we figure why not try it out.     The good:  food  was decent, out party of 3 all seemed to enjoy it.  The bad:  our waitress took our orders and we never saw her again.   As with a lot of restaurants, somebody else brought out the food, so no big issue there.   But nobody followed up.  My daughter wanted some ranch dressing but nobody to ask, I wanted some water, again, nobody to ask.  It wasn't until we were ready to leave that another waitress helped us with payment, so something was off.  BTW, the game place wasn't busy at all.  We got right in with no reservations and seated immediately.  So food, a 4, the wait staff, a 2."}
{"text":"Set in an old 1930s bank, great British fare, prices about 13$ a dish. Good beer selection. Not a place for kids. Had the Shepard pie, fantastic. Pal had the fish tacos,  also fantastic."}
{"text":"The peri peri chicken was absolutely 5 star amazing and the gracious server's recommendation of the lamb burger was spot on and the brioche was the perfect bun to hold everything together to satisfy me. The ample serving of onion rings were truly scrumptious. After that I went back for a second time with some extended family to try something different. The breaded calamari here is the best calamari platter that I've had in the city to date. The jalapeño Mac and cheese however was a very huge disappointment with clumpy cheese pasta and absolutely no hint of jalapeños. Went back to give it a tie breaker with a co-worker for some afternoon appetizers however I found myself ordering the extremely trusted lamb burger again but this time with a mixed green salad. The salad was fresshhhhh and absolutely by far the best salad in any restaurant I've been to."}
{"text":"A very lovely place, I would go again.   I came here a while ago and although I don't remember much about the place, I can tell you that the food was great! I had an indian dish, which to my surprise, had a perfect authentic flavour without being too spicy! In addition to the flavour, portion size was generous and they served it with perfectly thin crispy papad. Lol I love my papad. Overall the dish was fantastic and I would give it 4 stars out of 5. Good stuff!"}
{"text":"Not the greatest for dinner but I recommend it for drinks after dinner.   The service is okay, and service is a bit slow but overall okay."}
{"text":"Good food, drinks, and had soccer games on. However beware that they do not honor the USD to CAD exchange rates...its \"dollar per dollar\" per the bartender. We paid in USD, which hasn't been an issue anywhere else in Toronto- we expected CAD back. So at this time it meant an additional $10 USD that we didn't get back. Also- on a Sunday they were supposed to be open till 11pm,  but had last call for food at 8:30p and for drinks at 9:45p. Very disappointing and frustrating."}
{"text":"Seated in the back where it was very loud on a friday night due to karoke.  One server for the whole area and she was more concerned about serving people alcohol than people ordering food.  I noticed a table nearby who had to ask a runner for the bill (that was indication that service was a bit meh).  We ordered mashed potatoes and got fries.  When I mentioned it to the runner, he had to check with the server.  Which took a few minutes and then she asked what was the problem.  ?  I said we ordered mashed potatoes.  She goes away and comes back to say they or she read it wrong, and then gave us a \"big order\" of mashed potatoes.  Thing is, they were cold.  She never checked in with us to see how our meal was.  Asked for the bill and she could see I was paying with a card, but she busied herself with other customers that were ordering drinks.    No thanks"}
{"text":"I haven't been to an Elephant & Castle location since I went to the one in Boston in 2014 and since I  really liked the food then, why not try one of the two Toronto locations in 2018? Well, I did just that last night! We came here around 8PM not knowing if it was going to be a drunk mess thanks to it being St.Patricks Day, luckily it was not a drunk mess. Even though the place was packed we managed to get a table for 2 without any wait. Once seated the waitress was super friendly and even offered some green shamrock necklaces (which I declined, sorry guys). The menu here is standard for a place like this, offering plenty of burgers, salads, and Plenty of dishes people love like fish n' chips, Shepard's pie, and bangers & mash. My hunger lead me to order the bangers & mash and it turned out to be a decision I would not regret. The food only took 15-20 minutes to come out and it was very much worth the time. When it came out it was steaming and both the sausage and mashed potatoes were absolutely fantastic. The sausage had so much flavour and was so juicy it was practically the perfect sausage. After having my second meal with this several city franchise, I can't help but wonder what will I order the next time I visit one? Because it's definitely going to happen!"}
{"text":"Decent place. This location is closing soon so they donot have some stuff as they are running low. So I will suggest to go any other location. The place is nice but I was never a big interested in the theme oh elephant castle or the food. Although they have OK burgers. I got the pulled pork sandwich which was decent. I come here as it is close to work and can fit many people at once specially at the second floor buy I won't come here for small groups and many other places which are better."}
{"text":"There's something to be said about convenience, or failing that, mutual inconvenience, as well as familiarity.  In going back and forth with friends trying to decide where to go, you quickly find that either everyone's either trying to get you to go to places near them, or are pushing a place that no one else has heard of.  Typically the point that I cave in and give up is when I say \"FINE!  Let's meet at the E&C!\"  Just off of University and King, no matter where you are in the city, the location meets the criteria of either convenient to all, or is probably central to all the homes or offices your friends are leaving.  It's also a place that everyone's heard of, so there's no mistaking that.  There is the chance that someone may ask about the other Elephant & Castle (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/elephant-and-castle-toronto) but really, why go there?  This is by far and away more convenient, and certainly the more pubby of the two.  It does look like a pub with shelves of old books, a patterned carpet typical of most British-style pubs, and a passable run of taps.  The menu is of decent size and shape, if not slightly pricey for the food that is served.  Portions are adequate, but the food itself is nothing to celebrate.  It's passable to adequate.  That said, if you are in a rush, the kitchen is fast.  Whether you actually want bland food fast is up to you.  At the very least, you'll have all your friends together in one place.  Now that they've got it, the back area of pool tables and the back satellite bar they call \"The Office\" (\"Where you going?\"  \"The Office.\"  Geddit?) is actually a nice hybrid between the front bar and restaurant and the second E&C location.  Good place to sit and watch games as well as have a pint with your friends who are all equally put out by your selection of venue.  Cheers."}
{"text":"Looking for a new place with Eric and decided on here.. I've been before and it's been alright -- much better than the place on the other corner :-S  Tried the tortilla soup instead of the salad appetizer - good call!  Lamb curry was the special.. even though I had curry for lunch it seemed like the right thing to do.. When it came out I was not disappointed! A little less spicy than I require but they had hot sauce ;)  I was really full from lunch and didnt finish, but DID finish the Innis&Gunn draft of course.."}
{"text":"I came here for drinks only with my girlfriend. This is a chain, and if you happen to be looking for a bar in downtown Toronto and not feeling like anything special, this is somewhere you should check out. The bartender was very friendly, and the beer selection is decent. She even made me a custom drink that I read off to her from a website (it's a drink that not many people know about, and I was pleasantly surprised when she said she'd try to make it for us). As for the atmosphere, there's a nice high ceiling and a balcony with more seating. Nothing special, but I had a good time here and would return if I were in the area again."}
{"text":"A group of us dined here today before the TSO's matinee. Despite the restaurant being packed, they were able to give us quick, speedy service with about 90% accuracy. They know how to cater to their primary audience of people who are dining just before, or just after, a show.  While we all tried different items off their menu, everything looked fresh and delicious. I had the chicken pot pie based solely on what I had seen on Yelp. I was initially concerned that the filler was too soupy; however, once I mixed the fluffy pastry into the broth, it turned out to be just the right amount.   The only downside to this place is that we had to hunt down our server 3-4 times, such as when we were ready to order and when we were ready to leave. But they basically got us out in the initial set time.  Definitely a good choice for a pre-concert/theatre meal!"}
{"text":"It's an Elephant & Castle, kind of on the larger side, split into 2 different bars.  They also have a pool table in this location, which is nice, but $2 Canadian for a game.  I ordered nachos of all things, they were huge and easily enough for 2 people, though I managed to polish it off myself in epic style.    Decent beer selection, and everyone in our party was happy with their selections, nothing was really fantastic but our service and food was all good."}
{"text":"Super fun on St. Paddy's but that was also because we had a reservation and didn't have to wait long. It's funny that they don't offer pitchers...the explanation i was given is that the cost works out the same. If that's the case, I'd much rather have pitchers so each can decide what they want to drink (just my opinion). Food was decent and atmosphere was fun with very friendly staff. I recommend the balcony to get away from the noise downstairs if you wish."}
{"text":"There's an Elephant & Castle in Vancouver near where I used to work.  Somehow, this E&C is both nicer and much worse than the bar I used to go after work.  It's much nicer because the interior is spacious and it feels like a old bank.  It's much worse because it's beer selection is pretty bland and it's pretty dead in here.  I didn't even come here to reminisce - it was a last resort as I had trouble finding a bar still open on a random Tuesday night.  'Meh' - even as a last resort."}
{"text":"We went to the Elephant & Castle prior to a theatre show at the Princess of Wales.  It was a Tuesday evening, but the place was fairly busy, although we didn't have to wait for a table.  The food arrived within a reasonable amount of time, and was excellent.  My only complaint would be that it's fairly noisy, and I that had to hunt down a waiter to refill my water.  Overall, the food was of great value, and I would return again."}
{"text":"Another day, another work gathering.  This time we decided to hit the Elephant & Castle, which I had actually been meaning to check out for a while.  I was already pretty sure I knew what I wanted, but someone asked the waitress a question about their hamburgers, and she proudly said that they were now using fresh, never-frozen meat, so I figured I should give that a shot.  I decided to order the Deluxe (\"chipotle aioli, guinness bbq sauce, peppered bacon, aged cheddar, lettuce, pickle and red onion\"). It arrived shortly after and was...fine? I guess?  The hamburger patty itself had essentially been charred to a crisp - it was black on the outside and everything - and was, not surprisingly, extremely dry. There wasn't a hint of juiciness to this patty, so any fresh, never-frozen taste had been completely obliterated. The toppings were all fine, though that Guinness BBQ sauce had been applied so heavily that it was really all I could taste. The fries were passable, too. (At least everything was hot.)  I did like the British-pub-like ambiance, so I suppose I would return just for that. But the food seems a little overpriced for the quality, unfortunately."}
{"text":"After an ill-fated attempt to grab a drink at 3 Brewers - don't seat me at a table that's literally three inches away from the next one! - we wound up at this location of the Elephant & Castle.  I wasn't really hungry enough to order any food - I came to drink and I enjoyed a couple of their beers - but my dining companion decided to order the Butter Chicken Poutine (\"simmered chicken in a curried tomato cream sauce, cheese curd, cilantro & spiced yogurt\").   It arrived to the table shortly after and it's definitely pretty decent. It arrived hot and fresh, which is always a plus, and the Butter Chicken sauce is very tasty (and even a little spicy). It's crammed with pieces of chicken, too, although they didn't taste super fresh. The fries are good but nothing special.  Service was acceptable, although we did have to wait a while to get our bill."}
{"text":"Preis/Leistung passt. Sport auf Flachbildschirmen. Gute Auswahl Biersorten vom Fass. Pub- Gericht wie Sandwich, Burger & Co. Alles ok! Bedienung gut."}
{"text":"Walked in here on a Monday night for some drinks. I was surprised by how spacious this place was.  There are plenty of booths and they're pretty comfy.  The washroom was also superb clean.    I ordered a hybrid drink, white summer (somersby cider and kronenbourg blanc).  Had a few drinks before coming to Elephant and Castle so I can't tell whether the drink tasted awesome or not.  The downside is that they don't sell pitchers.  Nonetheless, the server was very attentive and promt"}
{"text":"Second time coming to Elephant and Castle!  This time, however, at a different location.  The atmosphere here is nice with comfy booths.   I ordered the Mexican bulldog for $9 and its a great deal!  I only say this cause it's at least $18 at the Porch.  Anyways, the margarita was very slushy (which I really enjoyed) with a coronita.  Def will come back to get this again!"}
{"text":"Come here every time I hit Toronto! One of my favorite pubs around! Great food, and great drinks! Not overly priced! Recommend if a pub is for you!"}
{"text":"Visited here on a Saturday evening. I had made reservations in advance and was glad I did because a line formed at the door shortly after we got there. Service here was fantastic. Our server was attentive and so friendly. She chatted a bunch with us which made the experience even more memorable. The food was great. I had the chicken pot pie with a lightly dressed garden salad. The chicken pot pie was huge, had a nice fluffy puff pastry on top and VERY hot and creamy inside. Perfect for a cool day. Very decently priced as well. I would definitely visit again."}
{"text":"The place has been redone and gone is the classic British look. The new digs look more american bar than british pub. Plenty of uncomfortable high top tables now litter the place with a few booths near the back, and an upper area that is usually always full.  The food was nothing special and the portions were actually quite small. The lamb burger looked like it was a slider in an oversized bun. Fries, meh, sheppards pie, double meh.  The only thing that's good about this place is the beer selection. My advice, just keep walking in any direction until you hit a better option."}
{"text":"This was an interesting find while passing through TO. The outside architecture was gorgeous, and it's name gave me the impression that this bar might brew their own stuff.  For a bar, I'm unimpressed. Not too sure what this place is supposed to be - it had a full bar, full menu, but I couldn't tell which one complimented the other. Maybe it's a Jack Astor's type of place? The bar menu, in terms of beer, is very basic with a few local drafts. I didn't have anything to eat so I can't speak of the food.  In a city like Toronto, I would expect a competitive list of craft beer alongside the typical brews, and E&S had very few choices and no stouts. That being said, I got an Okanagen from BC - and for 7$, it was fine though not what I'd typically go for.  Elephant and Castle was the perfect place to stop for a beer as I was passing through the city. It had a dated, but charming, decor that fit the look and feel of the place, and it was quiet enough for me to get some work done. My only critique is the selection of beers - it's lacking!"}
{"text":"My Caesar came very late. The server actually forgot, but good thing she checked her notebook at the end. I ordered the curry butter chicken dish. I didn't like the spiced yogurt in the curry, but I might just be my preference. On the other hand, rice and naan bread was cooked really well. I still enjoyed the dish overall."}
{"text":"So much better than it's been in the past.  They still can't make a decent curry to save their lives, but if you want to stick with a cheeseburger or stir fry or other simple grub, you'll get your money's worth.   Seriously, though, they could turn their music down a notch.  It would be nice to be able to hear what someone two feet away from you is saying, and if they're even a little soft spoken, that won't be possible."}
{"text":"As the previous reviewer said, it sure is convenient.  There are lots of places to sit, a very cozy/nearly genuine pub atmosphere, and some good stuff on tap.  The location is fantastic and there's lots of outdoor seating.  It's not the most amazing place in the world, but it's perfect to meet up and hang out (or chill out in and get out of the rain, as happened in my case)."}
{"text":"Rude service and tasteless, expensive food. Had the fish and chips, both were obviously from frozen. Not even half a bottle of malt vinegar could make it taste better."}
{"text":"Self styled British pub, on the modern side (well lighted, no dartboard). Lost one star for running out of Canadian label gin for the gin and tonic. Chips were decent and service was happily and friendly"}
{"text":"Great drinks and staff. I ordered a hummus appetizer and it was weirdly cold but forgive and forget right?"}
{"text":"The place is HUGE and very beautiful. I'm pretty sure you won't have trouble finding a seat - I didn't, even on St. Patrick's night. Good service and menu. Pricing is ok, nice selection of drinks and beers.   The music is ANNOYING. You see, I go to a pub to talk. I have to SCREAM to be listened by the waiter - and I'm not even discussing the bad-pop-music-style, there's people who enjoy this, but the VOLUME. If I could talk decently, I wouldn't be complaining. This was supposed to be \"background music\", you know.   Anyway, I enjoyed my night and it's pretty close to Eaton Centre. Nice location."}
{"text":"Chain pub - nothing really out of the ordinary. Was surprised to know that not all of the beer that they offer on-tap can be served in a pitcher. This is a bit disappointing in a larger group setting, and to be honest, something you would simply expect a pub to do. Adding on to that, the Sleeman's seemed to be a bit off - not sure if it was flat or the lines hadn't been cleaned in awhile.   Had the meatloaf, it was OK. For desert I had the cheesecake and it was delicious. Probably the highlight of my dinner and would recommend it to anyone.  Based on the quality of the food though, the bill was a bit expensive."}
{"text":"Came by this little gem while walking through Toronto. Had a few beers and a Yorkshire pudding. Definitely recommend!!!!!"}
{"text":"The ambience and waitress was nice and this review is just based off one visit so please take with a grain of salt. I had the jalapeño Mac and cheese with chicken. It was good but there was a pool of oil lying at the bottom which made me feel icky. It was also bland and there was too much panko crumbs at the top. The bread was a bit stale too."}
{"text":"While walking down the street to a location that proved to be much further than we realized, we stubbled across Elephant and Castle. Being from out of town and always up for trying new things, we scratched our plans to push on and made the escape from the cold into Elephant and Castle. I would suggest it to anyone, the menu had a lot of variety and there are plenty of beers to choose from. The atmosphere was great and the staff was pleasant."}
{"text":"Great place. Super friendly staff, immaculate, great location and the snacks we got were very tasty. Poutine and beef sliders in gravy. Very rich and delicious!"}
{"text":"This evening Gord and I met his cousin, Deanne, and her daughter, Carling, for supper at the Elephant & Castle.  I ordered chicken curry ... it was okay.  Gord ordered dry ribs and wings.  He enjoyed them.  Carling ordered onion soup and pretzels.  She said they were good.  Deanne ordered meatloaf.  She said the mashed potatoes were good, the meatloaf a bit too peppery and veggies could have been cooked more.  Veronica, our server, took good care of us.  Gord and his cousin hadn't seen each other in 45 years and Veronica, while conscientious, left us alone so they could catch up."}
{"text":"This is an amazing place to take your family. Wonderful service and everything on the menu is comfort food. You have to try the chicken pot pie. It is amazing."}
{"text":"Was dissatisfied with service received. They don't take reservations before 1:30 yet when we walked in there was hardly anyone in the place. The service was slow. Ordered the fish and chips but substituted with sweet potato fries instead. Nice flaky crush on fish with yummy delicious sauce to go with that. Nothing out of the ordinary but a nice place to hang out with."}
{"text":"We were debating what to eat while meandering down King St when we saw the Elephant & Castle and decided pub grub was just the ticket. Nice atmosphere, and it was pub grub, but with some twists. Nothing shocking enough to scare away my husband the picky eater, but enough to keep me interested. Would definitely eat there again."}
{"text":"Pretty decent.  I've been to another one in DC so thought we'd give it a try.  Service was just so-so.  Good location downtown.  Several good beer choices on tap.  A decent menu.  Not sure if I'd try it again though."}
{"text":"The pub is pretty good.  It's very large and can easily accommodate a very large group if you want to do a big Meetup.  Service is hit and miss depending on your server.  The food is ok, it is typical pub grub and prices are typical Toronto Pub prices.  We came during Superbowl and their wings were delicious...better than a few other \"wing\" restaurants like Duff.  I wish they have regular wing specials."}
{"text":"We love this place! Lots of comfortable seating, many tv screens, good food, menu variety, reasonable prices, and full bar. What's not to like?"}
{"text":"I came here on a Thursday around 5:30 for after work drinks with some coworkers. This place was great for short notice reservations for large groups (we made the reservations the morning of - or maybe we just got lucky).  ATMOSPHERE: The place seemed quite full, but we got a cozy booth near the front. The part I liked the most was the ambience - they had great background music and the noise level wasn't too loud for being at capacity. The lighting was great too! Not too bright, not too dim...  DRINKS/FOOD: We ordered an assortment of beers, ciders, and vodkas. They seemed to have a general selection, typical of any bar but nothing really set them apart from the rest. The food was also typical bar food but the portions seemed larger than others. We tried the nachos, the standard burger, calamari, and sweet potato fries.   Overall, Elephant&Castle had a cozy vibe but I wouldn't come here unless I was looking for a typical after-work place to drink with a group!"}
{"text":"Nice location - we spend some time here for a Diner. We have ordered a Ale & Onion Soup which was really good and a Castle Sandwich with fries, fries should be crispy but they aren't but the Sandwich was very tasty. We will come back."}
{"text":"So it seems there's been a change in management here and it shows. I've been here a few times for lunch with coworkers and it hasn't disappointed.  In recent past, I've had the chicken pot pie (on a day where I wasn't feeling so hot) - nice, fluffy puff pastry on the top and tasty gravy-ey insides with chicken. I was surprised I ate the entire thing since it looks pretty big! I also had the club wrap, which was a pretty tasty wrap. A good size and served with some tasty fries that I couldn't stop eating!! Another time I had the fish tacos - WOW those were good!! Three smallish fish tacos with a super hot dipping sauce and nacho chips on the side.  I really can't say how DIFFERENT this place is from my last review. This is a must stop by for a quick lunch when shopping. I'm now frequenting this place once every two weeks and slowly trying everything on the menu. The service is good, attentive and the place looks better than it did before. Kudos to the new management - keep it up!"}
{"text":"Excellent Fare, Draft Selection and Very Reasonable Pricing!  This was an impulse stop and ended up being one of our favorite places in Toronto.  The food was excellent, portions good and pricing the most reasonable in the downtown area.  The service is excellent - really great!!    It is definitely a pub/restaurant/sports bar with a old world, high ceiling feel.  The draft selection was nice and varied.  Although there were tourists there, it was definitely full of regulars and there was an air of camaraderie present that boosted the atmosphere and comfort level.  It felt comfortable and welcoming!"}
{"text":"Good place pre-game or theater.  Not as packed as the bars and pubs closer to the Air Canada Centre or Rogers Centre on game day."}
{"text":"I generally go to the King location before a baseball game, but when I heard that this location had finally reopened, my friends and I decided to meet here for an after work drink. I am a huge fan of their butter chicken poutine, and I relieved to learn that it was just as good here as it is at the King location. I was also happy with their drink deal - I got a pint of boneshaker for $6 (Monday special).    The Yonge location is also huge and the service was quick and efficient. Will definitely return."}
{"text":"I went for a drink with a friend of mine on a Monday night. I know, who goes drinking out on Monday night. My excuse, I was a visitor. We wanted to grab a pint before going for dinner. This place serve food but we were not feeling pub food. I ordered a local ontarian beer, I cannot remember the name but it was pretty amazing. It was a citrus beer from what I recall. Our waitress was super nice and patient with me as I was trying to make my decision."}
{"text":"It was Sunday afternoon & we came in with our neice. The restaurant was half-full yet our food still took a very long time to get to us. Our waitress seemed distracted as well & wasn't very attentive. We both ordered veggie burgers. Mine with sweet potato fries & his with regular fries. My burger & fries were pretty tasteless & dry. I used to love this place for food! I'm not sure what's happened to them."}
{"text":"Dear E&C thank you for introducing me to the wonderfulness of somerby cider, it was amazing. I like the bar atmosphere and the tall ceilings. Also a English phone booth in the back that was a great picture spot for some drunk people."}
{"text":"It's a pub...maybe bigger than your regular watering hole...but a pub nonetheless.  Food is (for lack of a better word)...meh. My \"special\" of Roast Pork Loin was overcooked, dry and felt like I was biting into rubber. My friend's fish and chips was much tastier in comparison.   Lesson learned: When in a pub, stick with the basics and skip the specials.  The only saving grace is the pool table we were seated next to, that made for a few hours of boisterous frivolity and friendly competition ... in an otherwise tepid venue.   Good place for a quick beer or watch a few games...but that's about it."}
{"text":"Pretty good standard pub food. Our server was awesome and sung for us. The decore is really oldschool. Very nice decore. The food too a bit to get out. But not the drinks so thays good. Its a hudge place so bring a group."}
{"text":"We sat in the section that looks like a library.  I enjoyed reading the book titles; the New Testament and How to Care For Roses to name a few.  One plus, after our freezing cold shopping venture, this place was hotter than hell.  That's one way to warm up quickly.  A second plus, the server was efficient though I watched her spill a drink on another customer.  Ooops.  We shared nachos that were completely generic though for the price point, I thought they were reasonable.  I wish we had just come here and avoided the Bier Market, but geography and logistics made that unlikely.  I wouldn't feel any reason to return, but it was okay this one time."}
{"text":"I've been a few times and always had a great meal. Sorry but this time was a bust. I found the the server to be rude and short with us. Entrees were subpar and only half of what you would expect for the price your paying. I ordered the currie flat bread and it came out cold and an appetizer size. I was finished before everyone else. My daughter had ordered gravy with her fries and it came out in the tiniest dish, like the size you would serve a side of mustard in. Also it was lumpy and cold."}
{"text":"Been here a few times to watch UFC and HBO boxing cards. They use the back portion of the bar for this. It gets absolutely rammed, seemingly over capacity with lots of people milling around the bar area because there are no seats left. Slightly annoying as the table service gets reallllly slow since it's so rammed.  Good selection here on tap though and it does have a nice homey British pub feel. Service was great the times we weren't here during packed events."}
{"text":"This Elephant and Castle is probably the last place I would go for a drink in Toronto and yet I have been there about 1/2dozen times. The best thing about the bar, that would actually get them a star, is the layout/ design! The balcony style area is pretty fun and cool area although it could also be a little dangerous if you are drunk (it's pretty difficult to walk back down about 20 stairs).  The last time I was at E&C @ Gerrard, I recall our group paying ~$20 for a pitcher of bud light and ~24 for Keith's! Not only are these ridiculous prices, but as we just received our pitcher (we were standing by the way) we were told to drink it quickly and leave as it was a busy night and we had been there for two hours!! This is something that hasn't even happened to me in any NY bar so there's no doubt I was more than a little surprised, especially considering just two hours ago an order of (literally) $1000 was put in by the same group!  A few months ago, there was another example of a scuffle with the manager over a bill (I wasn't personally involved but was a witness to what went on), and together with my most recent experience I am left to feel this place is aiming to cash in on the one time visitors to Times, err Dundas Square and doesn't give a hoot about anyone who might return.   Don't go here, Toronto has so much more to offer"}
{"text":"I really liked this place for its variety of beer and the awesome dessert. I think the dessert was strawberry shortcake with an ounce of Grand Marnier on the side that really kicked it up. I had a good time."}
{"text":"During the week this place seems like a hot-bed of activity. Sunday is was almost empty so I gave it a try. The beer selection was fantastic; they had some of my lesser know favorites like Old Speckled Hen.   The food was really good. I had a french dip and it was perfectly done. My wife enjoyed a wrap with a poutine substitution for the fries. It was a good lunch with friendly service. The outdoor dining area was really the icing on the cake."}
{"text":"It has taken me 5 years to write this review. lol...well 5 years on my first visit...and our last visit last year. Weve been a little busy but im glad i can finally do this.  Me and my now husband had our first blnd date here 5 years ago. We had such a fantastic first date, we must have spent 3 or 4 hours here. We shared 2 bottles of wine (Tini & Fat Bastard) and a bunch of appaetizers. Needless to say, we obviously fell in love and our relationship grew to more date nights and foodie adventures - but we have a special place in our hearts for this place.   We returned last summer and we had the idea of doign some of our engagement shoots here in this space. I emailed the restaurant and told them about our story and how we had our first date here... we asked if it wa sokay if we scould bring in our photographer and videographer and if we could re-do the date by ordering the same wine etc.  When we arrived we were happily greeted by the staff, who were soo friendly and amused by our entourage of cameras. The waitress brought over a complimentary bottle of bubbly and glasses for everyone. We also ordered a pitcher of beer for the crew (it was a hot humid toronto summer day) and everyone was so helpful. After the shoot we ordered food and proceeded to just hang out.   This restaurant is awesome. A wonderful place for a first date -- not too stuffy feeling, casual, great food and a fantastic wine list and beer list. The location is ideal and the service is wonderful. :) Thanks guys for everything!"}
{"text":"We popped in for a quick bite and drink after the show at around 10.30 pm ..we ordered and after a while SOME of the food arrived , with no drink for one of us ... waited for a long time and finally walked out due to LACK of service...we did pay for our food and drink at the front reception ( staff was instantly available !! )...we will probably never go back nor will we recommend them ..shoeless Joe is a thousand times better"}
{"text":"I can't believe I hadn't been to this place till today. Good atmosphere, went on a Friday at 7 so there was a 15 min wait. Menu is really different from other pubs, appreciated it. I got the peri peri chicken burger, grilled chicken breast, lettuce, tomato, onion and sauces. It was amazing! Never had a chicken burger that moist before. I was honestly shocked. Came with fries, they were okay nothing special. Drink special for Friday is a double shot gin and tonic. You can pick your gin and from a selection of different tonics. I got the elderwater and it was really enjoyable. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"This place is fine. Nothing to write home about but not a bad place to get some food and lounge around with some friends last minute. I've walked by this place so many times and I never really thought to try it - its large but unassuming and I just never got around to it. When some friends wanted to meet here for dinner I finally paid this place a visit. The place looked like a typical bar/pub kind of restaurant, low key, lots of people and a less than spectacular menu but with enough variety that you everyone would find something to eat. Our party ordered the steak salad, some sandwiches, the mac and cheese and some other snacks, all of which were fine but not memorable. Service was decent, but probably wouldn't come back here if I was looking for good food."}
{"text":"Really good food in a really good location.  This restaurant is actually huge, you can't tell from the outside. I found myself here on a Saturday night, they had live music too. Their menu has a lot of British food, all which looked great. I had gotten a peri peri chicken sandwich. It was really food! The service was also really great here."}
{"text":"Terrible food poisoning from this place. Stay away from the meat there, they tend to use cheap stuff. About 15 people were sick"}
{"text":"Yeah...bangers and mash!  The best in Toronto, although it's also my first time to Toronto.  I'll be visiting this place again!"}
{"text":"Our hosted seated us that night, failing to let anyone else know of our existence. Perhaps it was a secret. For half an hour my date and I played the \"do you think he knows we're here?\" game, as the server whizzed by us at light speed.  Eventually we got up and left, neglecting to say goodbye.  At the other occasions where I managed to get served, the food was Elephant and Castl-y as predicted; not bad, but not fantastic either.  For all the service shortcomings, I'd rather hit the location at Yonge and College.  Obligatory Title Pun: CAST me out of this 'ELL.  Menu Readability: Boring.  Need to mention: They have pool tables.  What this place teaches me about myself: The only thing I like less than being ignored is being--- HELLO, are you listening to me?!"}
{"text":"We decided to stop in for some drinks and eats after a performance. Great atmosphere with several unique menu choices and great beer selection. Food was great! I had tried Yorkies for The first time which is mini Yorkshire puddings with beef and gravy more or less. Great place to relax and enjoy friends and family :)"}
{"text":"I really only came here for a networking event, but  it's an unusually large pub, and with nice decor. every nook and cranny had seats."}
{"text":"The food was terrible. I ordered butter chicken which came with rice and pita bread. All the pita bread were burned badly. There were a few tiny pieces of chicken and little bit of rice. My friends thought I ordered soup because they couldn't see any chicken at all.   Inside the pub there were lots of steps between different sections. I wonder why they designed it like that. It is very easy to fall if you are not familiar with that place. I had to watch my steps when I was walking inside and looking for the washroom. For this reason alone, I would avoid this place. I wonder how dangerous if someone slightly drunk while walking inside.  The reason I didn't give one star is it is spacious inside so not too loud. The location is convenient too."}
{"text":"It was a very grand experience I must say, we had a ton of fun messing around with cool backgrounds for selfies. While you may think this is more of a pub, the food is deceivingly good and definitely hits the spot for those craving something rustic and classic English. There really is nothing to complain about, it's an aesthetic restaurant like all the other ones on Dundas, nothing new but nothing to complain about either."}
{"text":"Placing a pub in an old bank seems like a great idea but for me it is too cavernous and lacks any feeling of intimacy.  The food is decent however and the location is central."}
{"text":"Huge pub, it felt like we were inside the TARDIS.  The food was average. Good burger, but dry meatloaf. Waitress was good, especially considering how big and busy this place is."}
{"text":"Brrr! It's chilly in this place!!  Our food was tasty, but not hot. We watched it sit on the counter for 10 minutes while the waitresses goofed off with each other. We were there for about an hour and I watched the bartender over serve two guests. They were both heavily intoxicated, and they just kept serving more...  Otherwise, our service was pretty good. We had to stare at the waitress just to get her to check up on us... The cool noticed we wanted something before she did so he came out and helped. It wasn't even busy. Overall, it was a decent place. Basic Toronto sports pub. The environment was really nice though! I loved the loft style seating."}
{"text":"I'm a fan of Irish/English pubs!! This one is alright!!  The black and blue burger is to die for, given the amount of calories... but it's worth it occasionally :p Match it with sweet potato fries... Surely will have a heart attack... but you'll die with a full and happy belly!!  The chicken bruschetta wrap is not bad, just not great either!!  If you want to watch sports, this is NOT the place to be. No volume, no fun!!"}
{"text":"On a warm Monday night when other places were packed this wasn't too busy. Music was good but not too intrusive. Menu pretty reasonable. I had the fish tacos, which were tasty.  Selection of British beers was a bit limited, but Old Speckled Hen suited me nicely (if a bit cold).  Service was a little on the slow side given the number of people eating."}
{"text":"The E&C has the standard pub fare and decent selection of beer.  The location for this place is great and makes for a great lunch spot downtown."}
{"text":"I use E&C as a meeting spot when I need to chat with someone in the downtown core, close to Union Station.  Beer collection is not too bad, and both drinks and food are sort of \"brit-oriented\". I mean the place tries to look like an English pub, but for as much as I know about pubs, it's not the actual one.  Service is sloooow... Always slow. Polite, but not really interested in making you feel great, and not quite helpful.  Prices are, again, ok. I mean you just drop in, order a beer, waste some time waiting for it while chatting with a colleague or a friend, get your food served after about a half an hour wait, discuss all you needed in the meantime, eat the food, pay without noticing anything remarkable on the bill and get out - this is it!"}
