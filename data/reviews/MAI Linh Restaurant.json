{"text":"so good!!  The other day, I popped in for the first time.  I ordered a couple veggie subs and enquired about meat-free items.  The staff were very accomodating and made me some meatless summer rolls.  The whole shebang cost me $15 and was delicious.  I only live a few blocks away so this will definitely become an takeout staple for me!"}
{"text":"The subs here are so good, the service is friendly, and it's cheap! There's not much more to say about it, even though Yelp is telling me I should write more."}
{"text":"Being at home, sick with a cold called for some Vietnamese brought to my doorstep. I was in great need of the warm, brothy healing power of Spicy beef Sate Pho and enough Sriracha to kick my cold virus into oblivion. MAI Linh did just the trick!  The delivery guy arrived at my house with piping hot pho, tea, salad rolls, and these super tasty fried banana spring rolls all packed neatly into a plastic bag.  The care put into packing this meal was really impressive! They use a cardboard slab on the bottom of the bag so it keeps its shape, a divider to keep the beef and onions away from the noodles until the time is right, and separate containers for Hoisen and Sriracha sauces, broth, sprouts and a lime wedge.  The sweet fried banana spring roll things are the bees knees.  They've got the same kind of tasting, deep fried shell like most spring rolls, but they're filled with banana and topped with cinnamon, icing sugar, and a maraschino cherry.  It was a fast, fresh Pho experience right in my living room - Just what the doctor ordered!"}
