{"text":"Pretty sure my comment got deleted if that is possible... but terrible service! They forgot half of our order and I had to call and tell them once the delivery driver left (food was tied in knots in bags so didnt realize it was gone until he left) and then they said, \"Oh! we forgot! We're sending it out now.\" Keep in mind this was after an over an hour wait for the delivery in the first place. Pizza was bland, pasta was even more so. Go across the street, MUCH better service and food."}
{"text":"Unable to review at this time because we arrived expecting to be able to sit in a dining room to eat. The restaurant website has a 'Dine In' menu and we didn't see anything on the website saying that there wasn't an indoor dining area. Would have been nice to know before driving there with a hungry family. We'll try again when they have a location with indoor seating.  UPDATE: Since posting, the website has been updated. The dine in menu was removed and seating options are now listed. Very helpful of them. Yelp will not allow a review without stars so I'm upping from one to three based on the website update."}
{"text":"Pizza quality is just okay. There is something weird tasting about the thin crust, it taste almost store bought. Mozzarella sticks were microwaved and almost inedible. Whoever it was on the phone that took my order didn't really know what he was doing. The kid that delivered the pizza handed me the food and the receipt at the same time expecting me to sign the receipt with no hands... He forgot his pen... Had to go get one of my own pens. All in all... for one large pizza and mozzarella sticks for 40 bucks... naahhh."}
{"text":"Save your money and pass on this experience... I had food delivered and all of it was tossed in the trash! Fried Ravioli, Cheese pizza with Ham and Cheese pizza with Jalapenos, spinach, mushrooms, tomatoes, onions and black olives... This was a $48.66 meal with a Tip of $9.73 so a $58.39 Meal that was so disappointing! The Vegetarians in our home ended up with sausage on the pizza not just one piece but many!... Nice touch when your guest are spitting there food out!!! The Ravioli was just bad I can't think of a way to describe how bad it was.. I would think maybe this should not be allowed to be delivered as it was so sub par... The Ham pizza was burnt and over cooked and the veggie pizza was under cooked and of course had meat on a veggie pizza. I can't even think about giving this restaurant a second chance. I looked at the reviews prior to ordering and thought this could be something wonderful. I was wrong!"}
{"text":"The Pizza is excellent!  My cousin and I (both originally from Chicago) really enjoyed their pizza!  Thin crust is our go to and the crust was perfect!  Sauce and sausage wonderful too! Stay tuned for their expansion 1st quarter of 2016!  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"So im just leaving this place and not only did both of my garlic cheesebread have wax paxer stuck to them but the pizza was also all over the top of the box. And then when u drove the 7 miles back to return it. They were closed at 820....this place sucks"}
{"text":"Very good pizza & anti-pasta salad, also the service was really good and can't wait go back!"}
{"text":"We have ordered from here a couple of times for work lunches and it is SO good every time. MMM!"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed the pizza. Had the deep dish with sausage and pepperroni. I am from Chicago but never heard of this pizza place. Tastes different (in a good way) than Gino's East, Lou's or Giordano's. Most people from Chicago always compare deep dish or stuffed to Lou's. This pizza was very tasty. Not sure why some people gave it bad reviews. My advice is to try the pizza for yourself. You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"This place is a joke. I paid $52.00 for two pizzas that were in no way related to the city of Chicago. The only thing worse than the pizza was the service. I understand that the place just opened, but the staff seemed incompetent. The cheese has a sour taste and the guys in the back must be cutting back on the topping because they only put  8 pepperoni on a family size pizza. Oh and it took 45 minutes to make a two pies. My family and I will not be returning and I will not be recommending this place to my friends and family."}
{"text":"I am from the region and grew up having Sanfrantellos. I just ordered it tonight and it was so nice to have a comfort food from home. It tastes and looks the same. I'm not shocked by the price of the food. Other consumers shouldn't be shocked either. You're getting a delicious product with quality ingredients. You're not getting a soggy, greasy pizza.   I saw another review commenting on time. It's not fast food!! Appreciate that! This is the kind of place that Arizona doesn't have much of. Call in advance. Problem solved. Shoot, I've had to wait an hour and a half for pizza. If it's good, I'll wait! (Not here. I'm just saying it's worth the wait).    I enjoyed my food and I will return.  Just a tip. Maybe work with your girls who answer the phones and run the registers. I wasn't very pleased with them whatsoever. Maybe she was new? I'm not sure. I speak clearly and concisely. I shouldn't have to repeat my name (spelling and all), phone number, and order multiple times. It was a little frustrating. In the end, everything was correct. Other than that, everything was great! Thanks for coming to Arizona!!!!"}
{"text":"Every time I would go \"back home\" to visit, I had to stop at Sanfratello's in Glenwood, IL.  I was so sad when they closed!  When I read Sanfratello's opened in Gilbert  I was thrilled!  I have ordered quite a few times and it is consistently good.  We like the thin crust with sausage and green peppers.  I haven't tried anything else yet because I just love the pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza is very doughy and lots of sauce. My kids and I liked it, but my wife didn't much care for it, so we probably won't go as a family very often. Nice environment and great service!"}
{"text":"Best Chicago Pizza in the East Valley!  I grew up on the south side and they definitely nailed the sausage and sauce!  Call ahead to pick up pizza and confirm what you order as well as time to pick it up....the place is crazy busy."}
{"text":"I loved their pan crust pizza! The pizza had a great crunchy bottom followed a thick layer of melted gooey mozzarella cheese, a delicious sweet pizza sauce and then our fresh toppings. Also, try their mozzarella sticks which are fresh and never frozen. Super friendly staff."}
{"text":"My wife heard this place was fantastic on the news. I really hope this is not the best Chicago has to offer.  We ordered an Italian beef sandwich, a Tomboli and a thin crust cheese pizza. About 5 mins after we ordered, we were told there was no more Italian beef. Its Friday night.....why don't they have a full menu? I changed my order to a Chicken Parm sandwich.  The Chicken parm had about two oz of breaded chicken and the sausage in the Tomboli was way under cooked. The pizza wasnt bad, but nowhere near as good as Sals or Casanovas.  Pretty bad experience and probably because there was no leadership there what so ever. All kids and one older man that just looked confused were working.  Worst $47 meal in a long time!"}
{"text":"Sorry, but our experience was a total let-down. Expensive and it didn't taste any better than a frozen pizza."}
{"text":"Wife is from Chicago and loves deep dish so we thought we'd try it out. We ordered a large pan pizza (their version of deep dish) with sausage. Sausage patty covered the inside pieces of the pizza but the outer pieces not so much. Tasted good but honestly, Rosati's deep dish has them beat hands down. We were disappointed and won't be going back."}
{"text":"Wanted to try this place since it opened and finally got the chance. Extremely disappointed....canned mushrooms? Really? With a full service grocery store right behind you? Too pricey for canned ingredients. Save your money and your taste buds and go to Brooklyn V's across the street."}
{"text":"Very mediocre and overpriced. I'm not getting all the rave reviews at all. My husband did carry out and was totally annoyed and the bad service."}
{"text":"This will be quick. I saw the dough they use for the pizza, it's not preformed or frozen. The food is good, best enjoyed as soon as you get it. As I understand they are increasing the seating area. It's a higher quality pizzas place, and the owner gives back to the community and to his customers. Thank you sir. And for the record I like the piece in the middle with no crust."}
{"text":"Food is really good. I've had the deep dish pizza and meat tortellini with tomato cream sauce. I gave one less star because the last two times they wouldn't deliver (once they said they were short staffed and once they had a big catering order and fell behind). Also they close soooo early for a pizza place. If they stayed open later and hired another delivery person I'd give five stars."}
{"text":"My husband is from Munster, IN. He says there's nothing like Chicago pizza. He grew up eating Sanfratello's pizza. So he was over the moon when he heard that they were opening the place near Phoenix. We loved pizza (of course;)) and the service was great. So this is officially the greatest pizza place on the west coast;)!"}
{"text":"Wow 30 mins for a pie thine crust is undercook 23.50 for large pie Brooklyn vs across the street 10x better just plain old ok pizza def not worth the money"}
{"text":"Im originally from Chicago area (W suburbs). Ordered the thin crust last night. Have to admit it did remind me of home cooked Chicago Pizza. Very good pizza. Great flavor good ingredients and not skimpy on toppings... I have to try the deep dish pizza now..  Congrats on your Openning. Great Pizza..  Pricey but worth the price. $$$"}
{"text":"Went in at 7:50pm and tried to order 4 pizzas, I was told that it was too late and they were closing. WTF it said they were open till 8:30. Forget this place, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"First time guest and was looking forward to good Chicago style pizza. Ordered take-out with a half cheese, have Hawaiian thin crust. Good price.  The crust was excellent and spot on. I didn't see any sauce and the pizza was flavorless. It seemed like it was painted on with a brush. We'll give it another try but will order the deep dish Papa Joe's specialty pizza next time."}
{"text":"Worst service for any type of business. I didn't get a chance to get my pizza !! I called in an order and the teen taking the call didn't give me a time. Okay. I show up 45 min later and I thought I was at a concert. No organization and people everywhere. After 15 minutes waiting is a cluttered lobby and making no head way to the counter I decided to go outside and call. Call went to voicemail 3 times. They decided to answer on the 4 call. I was very polite and didn't let my frustration show. I simply asked when my pizza would be ready. The teen hung up on me.  Real nice. Took my family elsewhere. Gave this place 2 stars because the pizza smelled good :-)) I was there January 23 @ 6 pm.  Joel and last 4 phone #1665."}
{"text":"In town on business and tired of crappy room service.  Found this place on Yelp and ordered for delivery.  Natalie who took my order was fantastic. My food arrived hot and in less time than she said.  Everything was delicious (especially the cannoli). I will definitely be ordering again when I'm in Gilbert!!"}
{"text":"Where do I even begin? My wonderful experience started on the phone when I was calling to place an order. I forgot the woman's name who helped me which is upsetting because I called twice based on my indecisiveness on my order ha! She was so friendly and helpful as to my order. When my boyfriend and I arrived we picked up our pan pizza with pepperoni and sausage. We were greeted by all of the staff including the owner. The owner educated us on the different styles of pizza and their appetizers. It's so refreshing to arrive at a restaurant and receiving such service! It made me so much happier we had come and ordered from this local establishment.   We chose to sit outside based on the beautiful weather at night here in Arizona. The patio area is very pleasant and I love the lightning. Everything both inside and out was so clean! Now to the food.   The pan pizza is AMAZING. The sausage was so flavorful! As we were shoveling our faces with food the owner came out and asked us to try the fried zucchini and mozzarella sticks. Holy amazingness! They make everything fresh on site and you can taste it from the special cheese to the breading. I HIGHLY recommend you try an order of these. They are so good. Now the pizza fritz. I probably over indulged on those. It's soft and doughy sprinkled with powdered sugar. It's feels soft and pillow as you dunk it into a puddle of dark chocolate. Yes yes yes!    I can't wait to come back here and try the thin crust. Thank you guys!!"}
{"text":"If I could give it more stars I would.  I grew up on this pizza and it tastes as good now as it did then.  Amazing!  Great crust and flavorful ingredients.  Their sausage is incredible.  You can't find pizza this good anywhere here, trust me we've tried. My only complaint is that it's not closer to my house so we could go more often.  We met the owner, Scott, today and he's a great guy.  Give this place a try, you won't be sorry!"}
{"text":"Sanfratello's is a welcome addition to Gilbert.  After 40 years in Chicago I moved to Arizona.  In my six years here have not found a great Chicago Pan or Deep Dish Pizza... UNTIL NOW!  An earlier review claims it is not Chicago Pizza, they are so wrong... The sauce and sausage are on point.  This is what it says it is a Chicago Pan Pizza.  And an amazing one at that!  It is not an inch and a half deep dish... But finally a solid Chicago Pan... I feel like I am at home.   So good.  As for the thin crust... On point again."}
{"text":"LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this place! Be prepared, this is a call-in-your-order, delivery or stop-in-and-order place. Now that you know, get ready for a fantastical experience for your taste buds. The pizza is different than what you find elsewhere. Sanfratello's uses very high quality ingredients including 100% Scamorza cheese and YES, it makes a difference. I'm also a huge fan of pizza sauce done right and Sanfratello's got it down perfectly. They also have really good pasta (not sticky, gooey or stuff that's been sitting around in a pan) and stellar meatballs. How's this for a change of pace... Sanfratello's has ribs. I was too stuffed with pizza, salad and pasta to try the ribs, so that will have to wait for next time. Definitely consider Sanfratello's for a refreshing change of pace on the valley's pizza scene."}
{"text":"2.5 stars.  We love eating our chicago food. We kept wanting to try this joint. We ordered over the phone for carry out. We were told 30 mins. We ordered a small pan which is what they call a deep dish pie. Cost for 10\" cheese was $14.29 enough for two adults. The best part of this place was their service. Pizza was ready 30 mins after placing order.  The pizza was okay. The better part was the crust, although their try to be cute angled pizza boxes smashed a slice. Small boxes only good for thin crust.  The sauce had a hint of tasting and reminding us of Campbell's Tomato Soup. The firmness of the crust was spot on. It seemed odd the deep dish pizza was cut like a thin pizza (thin pizza squares are normal for Chicago). Deep dish should have big angled slices where every slice has crossed with it. That is how the majority authentic Chicago places cut theirs ie, (Gino's East, lou malnatis, UNOs, & Giordano's).  A deep dish style pizza inherently means it should have a lot of cheese. Well they don't give you much! See picture. In the end i would not get the deep dish \"pan\" pizza again. Not sure if i would even go back to try the thin. So far Buddyz in Queen Creek or Rosati's has been our fav for deep dish."}
{"text":"I tried the Italian beef with mozzarella and it was one of the best sandwiches I have ever had. The bread was PERFECT! Even though the meat was dipped in Au hi and I had a 30 minute drive home, it was still perfect and not soggy AT ALL! It was a great sandwich and if they were open right now I'd be having it for breakfast."}
{"text":"This place is quite close to my house and very convenient for me.  The couple of times I've been there, the service has been great.  Unfortunately I can't say much good about the food I've had from Sanfratello's.  First thing I got there was the chicken parm sandwich for lunch.  At best it was OK.. Mostly bread with nuclear hot chicken and sauce.  Not sure if it was microwaved, but thought it was just hot and bland.    2nd time I went there was months later.. Thought I'd give the pizza a try.  I had considered it for quite a long time, but always shy'd away as it is considerably more expensive than most other places around here.  Ordered over phone for pickup.. The girl who answered was very nice and energetic.  Picked up in 25 minutes.  First impressions were good.. Smelled good.. Toppings seemed fresh.  Thin crust was actually a bit thicker than most Chicago style pizzas I'd enjoyed before, but it was still crispy and delicious.. Just a bit thicker.  Overall it was the pizza was just OK, but there was just something funky about the taste of the pizza to me.  Not sure if its a cheese I'm not used to or of the sauce was different than what I like.    I won't say that it wasn't good.. Just not for my taste.  Other people seem to really like it.. I'd say give it a try and judge for yourself.  I will say that it is super expensive relative to other places in the area.  I got a medium thin crust with 2 toppings for over $20 for pickup.  Had I gotten a large it would have been closer to $30 or more.      I can't agree with the people who say that papa johns or pizza hut is better quality.. But the value for those places are for sure.. Apples and oranges in this case.    I also don't agree with the reviewer that this isn't a safe place because someone posted a photo in their review with a gun.  First of all.. the receipt clearly says **PICK UP**.  So I highly doubt the person had their gun out on the counter in the restaurant.  Also.. This is Arizona.  People open carry firearms here all the time.. People conceal carry even more as you don't even need a permit here.  With that said..  I also certainly don't agree with the other reviewer's choice in flashing their gun around on a Yelp review of a pizza parlor though either."}
{"text":"FIrst, no seating? Didn't know that from the AZ Republic. Going in it was confusing. No one, customers or two girls behind the counter knew what was up. Finally was asked what I wanted and the cashier immediately turns around and talks to another employee then turns back and asks again what I wanted. How rude. Pizza was ok, no more. There are many places in Gilbert that are better, and some worse, to be sure. It was way over-priced. Opening jitters I can accept, and I might try them again - but the service had better really improve.  I don't know why everyone thinks everything from Chicago is so great. It's not. It's a filthy crime-ridden city. There are some fine restaurants, but so what? There are a number of places in town that seem to think that the only way to compete is to claim it's a Chicago tradition: Barro's, Salerno's, Nello's and now this. Besides, Geno's NY style is just as good and a heck of a lot cheaper."}
{"text":"Born and raised in the Chicagoland area. Tasted just like home!! It's nice to have a good Chicago style pizza in the southwest. The staff was very friendly and accommodating. The owner even gave us free dessert on the house. We will definitely be visiting again! Worth the drive!"}
{"text":"Deep dish with sausage and onion. Great flavor and will definitely order again.  The girl who answered the phone was professional and helpful. Already recommended the pizza to some friends tonight.  Thank u."}
{"text":"Ingredients were very true to the Chicago style pizza. Deep Dish pan was very yummy! However only complaint is that they could have cooked it a little longer. However I like my pizza a little well done. I would definitely go back there and plan on it! Best of luck to this new business!"}
{"text":"truly delicious pizza never disappointed when we order it always get delivery and they're always on time I highly suggest the Chicago meat lover style as it is a grease lovers heaven and I mean that in the best most delicious way possible"}
{"text":"I love trying new places so I gave this place a try. So, I ordered 2 pizzas, fried zucchini and breadsticks and the pizza Fritz.  My total cost was approximately $80 and it was the most disappointing pizza and sides I have ever ordered. The pizza cheese was rubbery, the crust had no flavor with the texture of cardboard, the breadsticks looked  like they were from Olive Garden but were dense and flavorless. I could go on, but I have already wasted my money, time and a meal on this place. All I can say DONT DO IT!"}
{"text":"Being a transplant from Chicago this is great food and does not disappoint. I wish they had REAL indoor seating ...but I will be happy to take my pizza to go. I was a little surprised that it took 30 minutes to make a small thin crust cheese pizza, but next time I will just call it little bit earlier.. not a big deal. So happy to have this iconic pizza in the valley to make my Chicago belly happy -thank you!!!"}
{"text":"We were referred here by a friend who likes deep dish pizza, like us. It was a Wednesday so we figured we'd get a large and have left overs for the next day. Very nice people, very clean place and smelled great! We ordered the Italian sub and the large Mojo deep dish pizza. Total bill was $33.00, yikes!  We got everything home within 10 min but by then both were a bit soggy. Sandwich was good but way too much Italian dressing. The meats were good except for the thick slice of ham. Very little lettuce but it was soggy. The bread was a little tough but good. The pizza crust was unassuming but good. I like a crust that doesn't overpower the toppings but I think maybe they kneeded it too much. It was really tough. We've been to Lou Molnattis in Chicago and that crust is tender and flaky. We loved the favor but because the crust was thin (yes we ordered the deep dish) we didn't really have left overs. The thin sauce was too runny and caused the bottom of the pizza to be soggy. The sausage was so thin I actually forgot we were supposed to be tasting it. Cheese? Not much. I know I'm giving it 4 stars but that's because it really was good just soggy. We will go back and try it again but it's so expensive that it might be a while."}
{"text":"Waited over an hour for my small pizza to be delivered, only to be disappointed.  The ingredients seemed pretty fresh, but kinda reminded me of trying to make pizza at home that just tastes completely \"off\" from any of your favorite pizza places.  I get that this is a Chicago place, but even still, I've had Chicago-style that I thought was much better from other spots.  Combine all of that with the high price for what I got and I'll choose someplace else next time (even Papa J's, etc)."}
{"text":"I just had a company lunch from your restaurant . The food was very good. I would recommend you to family amd freinds. Thank you for the lunch."}
{"text":"What a great pizza joint--I've had my fair share of pizza in the Valley including other Chicago based chains, and thought, how could this be any different?  Well it definitely was!  The thin crust pizza is to die for, it's crispy yet puffy and a little buttery, the sauce is the perfect mixture of sweet and spice and the sausage is brought all the way from Chicago--delicious!  The staff was super friendly and answered all of my questions when I ordered.  The pizza was made hot and fresh to order and was quickly devoured by my kids.  If you're looking for a truly unique and high quality pizza, I recommend trekking out to Gilbert, I can't wait to eat through the whole menu."}
{"text":"I tried this joint again. Food is highly subjective thing. Their sauce is hard to describe, but I do tend to agree with others that say it tastes a little like Campbell's tomato soup. I threw out most of my order tonight (pizza and chicken parm), it just wasn't for me. I feel like these folks do achieve a decent level of quality, but whether or not you like the recipes - you'll have to decide for yourself. Prices are too high for what you get. Delivery charge was $4 - rather high too."}
{"text":"First time trying this place. Just picked up a large thin crust pizza. My kids wanted different toppings so we asked to split up so we wouldn't have to pay for 6 toppings. Our \"large\" thin crust pizza started at $19 and added up to $29 when we paid the bill. Even if it had been half the price, the pizza was no better than a Tombstone. I wish I had been there to pick up instead of my husband - even if it was good - I would have told them to keep it for $27+tax.  Never going back"}
{"text":"Well pretty disappointing as the pizza was just ok and way over priced. Please note there is no seating and no beer or wine. Did not expect take out only based on reviews in Arizona Republic.  Doubt that it will last very long at $35-45 per pie! Try it before it closes."}
{"text":"We ordered Sanfratello's pastas and pizzas for my daughter's birthday party and we could not have been happier! Service was fast and friendly. Portion sizes for their catering were more than enough! Prices were reasonable :)"}
{"text":"I love Sanfratello's!  Loved them in Glenwood, IL when I lived In IL and was overjoyed when they announced they were opening here in Gilbert a few years ago.  The meatball sandwich is the best I've had (with or w/out cheese or garlic bread).  Pizza - both the thin and the pan are worth the price.  It really makes me sad to read the reviews where people compare this pizza to Papa John's, Little Ceasar's, Pizza Hut, etc. in terms of price.  This is REAL pizza - not mass produced, chain restaurant style pizza, ie great quality.  Homemade sausage, Gonella bread - top quality ingredients.  You are what you eat and I sure feel better about eating food that is fresh and real!   Service is always great, fast & friendly.  The only downside is they got rid of the jalapeno poppers appetizer which was one of my faves.  Otherwise one of the top places in AZ to get pizza!"}
{"text":"Keep in mind that this pizza was a gift from Sanfratello's, via YELP!  I feel bad not giving them a higher rating but I did bump it up half a star.  Service was indeed 5 star but down hill after that.  The free thin pizza was dry, with scant sauce but good quality toppings.  The cheese was not stringy and elastic as I would have preferred.  (Personal taste here of course) The girl on the phone was delightful and very upbeat.  She told me it would be ready in 25 to 30 minutes and it was ready in 25!  The owner introduced himself and shook my hand, everyone was quite pleasant.  We consumed less than half of the medium thin crust pizza gifted to us because it was so dry.  I sprinkled some good EVOO on it but it only helped a little.  I'm glad I didn't have to pay for it.  Included was their dessert bread \"Fritz\" which needed to be cooked more and have more sugar on it.  We consumed half of one piece each.  Maybe we just don't dig the Chicago experience, not for us, sorry."}
{"text":"We had been looking forward to trying this place because of all the hype and well because we enjoy pizza! We try to support our Gilbert businesses.  Ordered over the phone and picked up the pizza. Interesting box  ordered thin crust pizza with mushrooms and pepperoni    First impression looks like canned mushrooms and tastes like it. Pepperoni was decent. Now the make or break moment - the crust. Blech. Tastes like frozen pizza crust  bummer. Sauce needs seasoning. Expensive  pizza that just doesn't cut it. Too bad"}
{"text":"GET THE DEEP DISH (Pan)!!!!!!!!!!!!  My family is from south side Chicago and we all drove from various parts of the valley to check this joint out.  We quickly realized they don't have Indoor seating so we made the best out of sitting out on the patio.  We ordered 2 large thin crust pizzas - one sausage one pepperoni.  It was fresh, hot and had quality ingredients.  I would give the joint 4 stars for their thin crust.  It was really good for AZ, but in Chicago I would put it middle of the pack.  Now their DEEP DISH on the other hand is incredible!!!  If you've ever had Gino's East in Chicago, I would say this is very similar.  So damn good!  The tomato sauce is fresh and tastes perfect - just like home!  The sausage is excellent!  (That's what she said)  Get the deep dish damn it!!!"}
{"text":"This place is amazing!! The pizza is delicious and super fresh. Have been there twice and both times we received great service and great food!!  TRUE Chicago pizza, this is coming from my boyfriend who was born and raised in south side Chicago, who grew up eating Sanfratello's in Chicago!! If you can't wait 30 minutes for an awesome, delicious pizza, walk your butt to little caesars!!"}
{"text":"Great food friendly service, they deliver Large selection of chicago food. Appetizer options are amazing.."}
{"text":"The spaghetti with meat sauce I had was reminiscent of something you got from a supermarket deli.The sauce tasted blander than bland! And there was not nearly enough of it on the pasta. It was on the dry side. I tried one of their pizzas but was not too thrilled with it. Then again I'm a big fan of New York style versus Chicago."}
{"text":"Finally REAL pizza!  The sauce and sausage taste just like Chicagoland! Thanks for coming to Arizona!"}
{"text":"A good pizza place was just what this area needed so was extremely excited when Sanfratello's opened here. Finally stopped by tonight and ordered a thin crust meat lovers pizza.  The service was great, no complaints there and the place was nice and clean.  I wanted so bad to like the pizza but it tasted bland and rather forgettable. Based on other reviews it sounds like deep dish is the way to go. We will be back to give it another shot and will make a point to try the deep dish.  I really hope when I do that I can edit my review with a higher rating!"}
{"text":"We had the deep dish pizza. It was pretty good. The crust could of been more buttery and a bit more crunchy. Sauce was good, I like that the owner responded back to my review."}
{"text":"Long time customer of Tinley Park,  IL location.  Dinner tonight was just as good as I had hoped!  Mostacolli with meat sauce and chicken parm sandwich. We'll be back FOR SURE!"}
{"text":"We had watched the Sanfrantello's place get set-up, so we were really excited to try. We have been there twice to give it a chance, but we ended up being ok with the pizza. Three things to consider when ordering because if you've never had Chicago-style pizza, you may not know the first two of these things: 1) when they say pan pizza, it's going to be a deeper pizza than Arizonans are used to seeing if you frequently do pizza delivery. It's not crazy deep like you may see in Chicago, but be warned, it's thicker. 2) In an attempt to fix the mistake from the first pizza order and ordering a deep dish, we thought thin pizza was the alternative to the deep dish since we thought maybe their thickness was different than what we say is pan or thin, but it really means thin crust. That was our mistake, but now we both know what we know. 3) The sauce is more sweet than it is savory. I know some people like that, but it's a preference like people love Spinato's pizza because of that. Unfortunately, that's not our preference.  In the two times we went, we ordered mozzarella sticks, hot wings, a pepperoni pan pizza and a thin crust pepperoni pizza. The mozzarella sticks are breaded with Italian bread crumbs and Italian seasoning. The cheese pulls out of there like you would expect at most places, so it is a decent order. The hot wings are also acceptable as well where they cook it thoroughly, it is more cooked to a juicy, tender texture rather than crispy, and it's coated well in the sauce. The pan pizza was a good mix of sauce and cheese considering how deep it was. The crust was okay. It didn't particularly strike any chords with me, so I didn't eat it. The thin crust pizza was a bit on the dry side. It's really hard for places to find that perfect balance of thin while still retaining the sauce and melt the cheese.   The service was acceptable. The delivery people were nice and those that took our order were friendly. I wouldn't say they are particularly wow or outstanding - nothing sticks out - but they are acceptable. It also looks clean when you go in, and it looks like there's a small patio to dine at outside.  Overall, if sweet and deep dish is your thing, this would be a good spot to go. Otherwise, I would pass."}
{"text":"We had high hope's for this, but were disappointed. The service was good,the deep dish dough/crust was great but the sauce was TERRIBLE!! The sauce ruined a good pizza. We could tell the sauce was a canned base. For the price we were not expecting a sauce that taste like preservatives and a can tomato soup flavor. We also ordered hot wings and they had no real kick for a hot wing and they were soggy. We ordered them extra crispy but still came out soggy and mild.  I hate giving a bad review but for the price we can get better pizza and wings."}
{"text":"Honestly best pizza we have had since being out here from Chicago , we will return , Chicago deep dish is a must , good sauce , good crust , good cheese , doing things right !!!!"}
{"text":"I like to try new pizza places and usually just about everything I order is pretty tasty..However,when I made my online order with Sanfratello's, the order was pretty accurate except for not getting the extra sauce I paid for..my order was a large ham and pinapple thin crust pizza, a caesar salad and fried zucchini......the salad was fresh enough but not at all cold and the zucchini and pizza, honestly tasted like it was more than a day old and reheated...I also was given a free desert if my order amount came to $30 or more..the desert was sugar fritz with chocolate sause, also tasted very old....very disappointed and won't be ordering from this restaurant again..."}
{"text":"Absolutely love their pizza!  So glad that we stumbled across this restaurant & their delicious Chicago style pizza!  Our family has pizza night every Sunday night & this is our new go-to place.  The sauce is amazing, the cheese is great & the crust is done perfectly.  Highly recommend to all."}
{"text":"This is PRECISELY the OPPOSITE of Pizza Hut/Dominos/Papa Johns: real quality.   Not inexpensive, coupons online.  Try it."}
{"text":"It has been many years since we had a Sanfratello's pizza. Living in Las Vegas we make sure we visit Sanfratello's when going back home to Chicago/NW Indiana. So we were excited when planning our trip down to Scottsdale to learn that Sanfratello's has a Gilbert ,AZ location. We actually though this was a full restaurant but when driving up we realized that they do more carry out. After driving for over 4 hours we were glad they had tables out side so we ordered our pizza and grabbed out drinks and waited for a bite of heaven. Loved the Pomegranate water they had on tap. They guys working were great and bought our pizza and plates to us outside and checked back to see if we needed anything. It was a Friday night and they did not seem that busy which really surprised us because the pizza was great. We really wanted to bring back some pizza but had no way to keep it cold. I wish you would open up a franchise in Las Vegas."}
{"text":"This place could be better if they improved their sauce and made some other minor improvements. We got a thin crust with onions, mushrooms, sausage and green peppers. At first I thought their were artichokes on the pizza since the mushrooms were yellow. They use canned mushrooms, yuck. The peppers were very soft so I'm guessing they pre-cook them. The onions were non-existent until I dug around and found a few of them. The cheese and crust were good. So if they would use fresh veggies and add some seasoning to the sauce and kick up the sausage  the pizza would be a lot better. We also had a pan pizza which my husband said was ok but again the sauce has no flavor and there wasn't enough cheese. We also had the wings. They were too spicy for my taste but my husband thought they were great."}
{"text":"So excited Sanfratello's is here. Recently moving to Arizona from Chicagoland, we were really missing this pizza. It was just as great as back home, crispy crust and oozing sauce. Hope they decide to open a dine-in restaurant soon."}
{"text":"I was looking for some where to go that was new, I figured I would go here to give a whirl. I got 2 pizzas that lacked flavour and taste. The crust was hard and there where hardly any toppings on the pizza. The pizzas cost 50 dollars plus tax. I would rather eat Peiwei off the floor than eat at this place ever again. The pizza took about 30 minutes. If you so anything in life DO NOT go here ever."}
{"text":"Ordered a small and large pizza and it was 44.00. The pizza was salty with very little meat or pineapple or flavor.  We were hopping for awesome pizza and were very disappointed. Will not recommend nor will we be back. Staff was nice though."}
{"text":"I too am not from Chicago but really enjoy a good deep dish pizza.  Been too long since I had access to a decent one.  Unlike some of the ones i have tried here in AZ, this one is of high quality and not too \"Bready\".  Quality ingredients and yes a little more expensive than what Little Ceasers???  I hope so....  Have had no issues with customer service, every time I have called in, the experience and pick up have been both efficient and friendly.  Great local option.  Highly recommend."}
{"text":"For those who do not know South Side of Chicago means New York (thin crust) style pizza. I am very disappointed that this place pushed thin crusted pizza as their staple on the menu. Chicago is known for deep pan pizza and this is disappointing that they cannot carry on the tradition. Arizona has too many New York pizza options and to have another one with Chicago on the name is disappointing.   The sauce is fantastic but that is the only thing I was pleased with. I can understand the issues with the help but yet you boast that you have been in business since 1969 so one would think you would know how to start in a new location.   Nello's is as close to Chicago style pizza in Arizona so I guess they will have to do until I can make trips back to Chi-town and if I want New York pizza (which is rare) I will go to NYPD since they are closer to the house.   Sorry guys but unless things change I won't be back soon."}
{"text":"Had high hopes after reading online reviews that Sanfratello pizza was going to be real Chicago deep dish pan pizza. So we ordered one last night. Sadly it was mediocre at best. Gino's East Frozen Pizza from AJ's is much better and half the price! Sanfratello sauce was VERY salty and the crust is tasteless. It's about 1\" high so not what we consider \"deep\" dish. Side dinner salads were a rip off at $3.85 each. Their menus says the salad is \"lettuce, tomato and cheese.\" It should say \"half lettuce leaves and half lettuce leaf ribs, 1 grape tomato and too much tasteless mozzarella with \"Italian\" dressing that is either original Wishbone or a perfect replica.\" Who uses Wishbone dressing on salads? It's only good for marinating chicken or shrimp! Russ said: at least the lettuce is fresh. We are still looking for REAL Chicago pan pizza in Mesa/Phoenix. ( Lou Malnati's or equivalent). Phoenix friends, if you like real pan pizza, don't waste your time and money at Sanfratello's."}
{"text":"I decided to try Sanfratello's tonight for the first time and I am very glad that I did.  I ordered the fried ravioli, a pan pizza, and the pizza fritz.  The delivery arrived 15 minutes before the estimated time and each of the items was great.  I will order again very soon."}
{"text":"This review had an opportunity to not be very good, however in life things go wrong....it's what you do to correct a problem that tells me the most.   We had friends/family in from out of town we had been running around all day and we're looking forward to a relaxing evening at home with our guests. We ordered a couple of pizzas and were told delivery would take about 40 minutes...an hour later no pizza. I called only to find that the pizzas had been sitting in the hot box for some time and they were experiencing some staffing issues. I spoke with Michelle, new manager, she made new pizzas and had them prioritized for delivery. I was a little short with her on the phone, let's face it there are less expensive pizza options....just not as authentic and tasty.    The freshly made pizza arrived 35 minutes later, hot and delicious. The driver told me the charges to my card had been voided. While this could have been a bad experience, Michelle did the right thing. Btw, the pizza was amazing."}
{"text":"I'm not from Chicago, but I've been to several of the key places that serve as true pure examples of \"Chicago-style Deep Dish\" pizza. I also grew up on Rosati's (which came here from Chicago decades ago).   Here in Arizona, there's not a ton of places to get a Chicago deep dish. And I've seen a few of them close as well. I've been to a lot of them, and some I like more than others. Rosati's is great, but quality can vary wildly from store to store. Oregano's sells a deep dish... it's good, but intense.   Deep dish pizza in general is intense... it's a ton of food. It's also kinda weird if you haven't had it before. Sauce on top? WTF is that? It's almost like an upside-down cake made with pizza ingredients. It also requires you to wait a long time as they take like an hour to cook. But it can definitely be worth the wait.  Sanfratello's is a new chain that comes to us straight from Chicago. Tonight, I picked up a deep dish pepperoni and sausage, a caesar salad, and something called \"pizza fritz.\" Their pizza boxes are pretty unique - they don't require employees to spend hours of their day folding boxes... it's a clever design that I've never seen before. It also seems like less cardboard, and it's more sturdy. Who cares though, right?  The food was delicious. I honestly wasn't expecting too much from the pizza, but it was excellent. It was lighter than a typical deep dish. All the flavor was there though. It was a great example of a good Chicago deep dish, but when I was done eating it, I didn't feel like I had a giant brick in my gut. The salad was good as well - tender chicken, clean fresh lettuce, crisp croutons, and tasty dressing. Can't ask for much more.   The pizza fritz were like a puffed pastry made from pizza dough sprinkled with powdered sugar. Pretty simple, but a nice little treat. Didn't seem like it was super high in calories like other desserts. It came with some chocolate dip, but we opted to put chocolate swirl cookie butter on it instead - because fat. Shut up.  The setup here is more or less pick up and delivery... they do have some nice yet very small tables inside, and a few tables on the patio. This location is set up similar to how most Rosati's are, but a tad bigger. Don't expect to bring the whole family for a sit-down meal.    Anyway, I like this place. Put one closer to my house.   Oh, they deliver too. (sadly, not to me)."}
{"text":"Good food but small portions for the price. Ordered large salad large pizza family pizza and spent $70...there were 6 adults who were so hungry we had to order more from a chain restaurant...family size pizza not very large"}
{"text":"Normally, I don't give a business a second chance after reviews similar to what I left for Sanfratello's.  However, I decided to give them a second chance simply because they were closer than my normal Rosati's.  The first thing is that it is not an easy place to find because it is literally buried in the mall. You really need your GPS to find the place.  But it is in the same lot as the Albertson's but closer to Warner than Lindsay.  Once you get there, you notice how small the place is (looks more designed for a takeout instead of dining in like their parent store in Tinley Park, IL).  You do have outdoor seating but that's even small.  One thing I found interesting is how quick they had a pan pizza ready.  I am accustomed to waiting 45 minutes.  They had my pizza ready in 25-30 minutes.  When I got the pizza, I was kind of taken aback because the container looked kind of small.  In fact, it almost reminded me of a personal pan pizza in physical size.  I even thought it was going to be a square pizza because of the rectangular container.  After taking the first bite, I saw that Sanfratello's uses the patty sausage similar to Pizzeria Uno and Due back in Chicago. With some of the crumbled sausage I have had, you do taste the seasonings through the meat.  In this case, I did not.  It did not have the full-bodied flavor I am accustomed to when eating a Chicago pizza.    The second thing I noticed was the crust itself.  I have to admit I was skeptical that it would be cooked thoroughly because of the short time.  However, that concern was squelched.  However, I am also accustomed to a buttery crust.  This crust was not buttery and even the tops were burned in spots.    Third was the tomato sauce. The sauce, like the sausage, was missing critical seasonings that provide the usual flavor explosions I am accustomed to with Chicago pizza.  Additionally, I did detect a bit of sweetness with the sauce which is abnormal.  All in all, I would say it's not a bad pizza but this former Chicagoan says it needs a few things that will turn it into a serious Rosati's competitor."}
{"text":"A good change of pace from the other pizza spots in Gilbert, but our 12\" pepperoni pizza was $20!  It also took 40 minutes to make.  We do pizza nights when we need something cheap and quick... this place is neither. However, it was tasty and I could see us splurging every once in a while."}
{"text":"I'm conflicted about this review. My kids and I stopped in one day while riding bikes to have some quick lunch. It was my first visit and I had not heard or read anything about it. My wife mentioned it was somewhat new to the neighborhood and we like to support the local community.  My first impression was that the price was a bit steep compared to other pizza options in the area. But since I heard it was Chicago style, I figured the focus was on the quality.   To my disappointment, the pizza tasted OK but it wasn't great. Not for the price. It was no better than Papa John's, certainly not as good as Barros, but 30-40% more expensive. Had the experience ended there I would have given them a one star review.  However, the owners (?) unexpectedly brought out some sort of bread w/chocolate and powdered sugar for my kids, at no cost. That made them feel very special, and ultimately what makes them happy, makes me happy.   So, for going the extra mile by providing a happy and memorable dining experience for my kids, I would recommend them."}
{"text":"We ordered pasta dishes and they were very good. The staff was very friendly. We will be back to try their pizza too.  This is a small place with four tables for eating in. More of a take-out type of place."}
{"text":"This place needs a lesson in customer service.   I went in and ordered a pizza and was told 20 to 25 minutes and then in 5 minutes I get told it will be 30 to 35 minutes as more orders came in.  No more orders came in but the fact is that they let them go first.  The pizza is not that good and is expensive for what you get.  The Manager was rude and she said that is the wait and that is that.  Natalie the Manager was very rude"}
{"text":"Had to check this place out since its from my family's hometown in IL!  The pizza was OK.  My husband is a big pizza guy and was not impressed.  I felt the flavors were good.  I also ordered a chicken parm sandwich - it was awesome - make sure you order it on garlic bread.    The main reason I gave 3 stars is that this is the 2nd time I tried to order from there.  The first time, no one answered the phone and the line was out the door... this is not a sit down place.  It is a order ahead for pick up kind of place.  They do deliver - this is optimal."}
{"text":"I just paid $30 for 1 Pizza... No Salads, No Delivery... Look at my Receipt on the PHOTO section.... look like they charged me for 2 pizzas.... The Pizza was good... I enjoyed it... but DANG $30 for 1 PIZZA...."}
{"text":"Hello to all my fellow yelpers-  Where do I start... Where do I start ...  I guess I'll start at the very beginning... A very good place to start!  Read reviews of Sanfrantello's and being from the great city of Chicago decided to give it a try.  The reviews were very mixed but the one good thing in common was the sausage.  My top favorite Chicago pan pizza is Gullivers on the North side of the city.  Second fav would be Gino's East.  The reasons I find these 2 places to my liking is the crust and sausage... With that being said here is my opinion of their pan pizza.  The girl who answered the phone sounded rushed as a good pizza place should be... But it is still ok to be just a little friendly.  I asked for \"Scott\" the owner simply in hopes of getting the best pizza they make... So if I did not enjoy it, I know it's not that they made a bad pizza but because that's how they make their pizza.  Scott was super friendly and he turned over to another very friendly person to confirm the order.  An hour later the pizza arrived... Let take a moment to say the delivery time was very good considering the time it takes to properly cook a pan pizza...  That should have tipped me off.    Delivery guy was also friendly.  The price is a couple dollars more than what I am used to paying but as i always say... I don't mind paying a higher price but the food needs to warrant it...  Pizza looked like a pizza... Although I have never seen a pan pizza cut in squares... In the Chicago I grew up in only thin crust is cut in squares... But oh well... Doesn't effect the taste!  Let's start with the part I usually enjoy the most . .... THE CRUST!  Several of the other reviewers feel the same way... The crust was undercooked... Especially the bottom which was white and fluffy... And the taste?  Was there supposed to be a taste because neither my husband nor myself tasted anything.  When I spoke with Scott to order the pizza I told home 2 fav places and he said if I liked those I will enjoy his..... WRONG!  Gino's East uses a cornmeal crust and it is always marked on the edges and bottom with the black pan marks... And has a wonderful taste.  Moving along... The sauce... Keep in mind, food is a preference and I am just one persons opinion...and.... I am a VERY picky eater!  I will be nice and say... The sauce is sauce... Nothing terrible then again nothing that pops either...  Now for the saving grace... The sausage is the best part!  Not quite as flavorful as I prefer but nonetheless closest to home as I have tasted in Az.  I give credit where credit is due... Of course I am guessing they get the sausage from a vendor and do not grind it themselves... If I am wrong my apologies...  If this is the case then he picked a great vendor.  Would I try again?  I think we would try the thin pizza...but not pan!  I am told from pan pizza connoisseurs  the crust gets its favors from the pan which you want to be aged for years to get all the black crusty goodness ... so if they are new to town and are using newer pans that would explain a lot!  I gave 3 stars only for the sausage.  So we come to the end of another review...  Give them a try... See what you think...  Until next Time  Bon Appetite'"}
{"text":"Friendly staff. Pizza was delicious! It smelled and tastes great! The crust's edge was crispy while the rest of the thin crust pizza was positively soft. Food was fresh. The Pizza Fritz was also fresh and tasted great with and without the chocolate sauce."}
{"text":"Ordered large pan cheese \"deep dish\" & cheese raviolis.  Was told there would be a 25 min. wait so I went back home.  When I returned there were at least 8 people crowded inside waiting for their orders.  Took another 5 minutes to get someone to tbe counter to get my name & then waited 10 more minutes for anyone to come back.  While I was waiting I witnessed a customer complaining that his order came w/sausage rather than pepperoni.  Young staff had no idea how to desl w/it & kept running back to a manager that was trying to sort out a delivery problem.  Also witnessed another young employee hang up on a phone order the manager was taking.  Employee didn't know how to work the phone.  Bottom line...pizza was good, but overpriced; service was lackluster except for an overworked unsupported manager;  need better trained employees at counter & phone with customer service skills."}
{"text":"I could've made a better pizza with a can each of pillsbury rolls and tomato paste. Worst I think I've ever had. I'm from Chicago (so I really do know good pizza), and frozen pizza of any variety is better than this mess. To their credit, they refunded it-but not before the manager acted as though he couldn't BELIEVE we didn't think it was great. Do yourself a favor and go to Rosati's at Ray & Mcqueen."}
{"text":"Not the best pizza I've had.  Definitely not worth the price. Be sure to ask what your total cost will be for the entire pizza with toppings included.  I was really hoping it would be better."}
{"text":"Horrible!!! Canned mushrooms, stale crust, bland sauce and EXTREMELY overpriced. $52 for 2 pizzas and a salad, honestly one of the worst pizza's i have had and after 40 years i have had every pizza in the valley. Better off getting a frozen Red Baron and saving yourself $45 and 50 minutes of waiting."}
{"text":"Love Sanfrarellos and am so glad they are in Gilbert.  We order take out sometimes and it looks like the are expanding for dine in a have applied for a liquor licenses.  Happy to support this local edition of a Chicago favorite.  Staff is friendly and food is always good.  Will be back for sure."}
{"text":"If you like a good salty (not too much though) pizza made from fresh hand tossed dough this is the place to be!  The staff is very freindly and the resteraunt very clean.  They use a special cheese blend you won't get anywhere else.  Great for a quick take out or sit down and enjoy the meal!!!!"}
{"text":"This place has been good every time we've had it! Even our Italian family who makes amazing pizza liked it, so that's saying something.  The crust is different and really good.  Sauce and toppings, fresh and yummy.  Good stuff guys! And very friendly staff which is always a huge plus =)"}
