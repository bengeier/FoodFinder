{"text":"Careful! Do Not get delivery from this place!! Waited 2 hours and a half when the person on the phone said it would only take 30 mins. Very dissatisfied. Never getting this service again."}
{"text":"I was assured that the pizza would be delivered in 35 to 45 minutes. I called an hour later and they promised me it was on the way and would be there in 5 to 7 minutes. Almost 2 hours later the pizza was delivered cold. I don't mind cold pizza if it's good but this pizza was bad to begin. The delivery man was nice and polite but the pizza and the timing was horrible."}
{"text":"We didn't have pizza, opting for burgers instead. We're so happy we did! They were made to order with all the fixings. It's is a clean, sit down place, all meats are HALAL and the wifi is both free and fast!   I plan to return next time I'm in Montreal!"}
{"text":"Les employés à la livraison ne parlent pas bien français ce qui pose un léger problème de communication. On m'avait dit que ma commande arriverait en dedans d'une demi-heure, ça en a pris plus que le double. Quand je leur ai exprimé mon mécontentement, ils ne se sont pas excusés, le livreur s'est juste emporté en disant que ce n'était pas de sa faute. La bouffe est correcte mais c'est le seul point positif. Bref, pu jama."}
{"text":"I was really disappointed to find out that after ordering a pizza from a restaurant called 'pizza 2 for 1' that they don't actually mean that the pizza is 2 for 1, it is false advertising and they are actually just selling you 1 pizza for a ridiculously high price. Furthermore, the pizza is terrible and the customer service is abysmal. All calls made to the restaurant were met with snarky responses and then eventually the restaurant workers hung up on me. There are many other pizza places on St Laurent with better pizza, lower prices and better customer service - I would recommend ordering from one of them instead"}
{"text":"BEST FUCKIG PIZZA.  Come here or be square the place to be all weekend long late night fresh pizza!!! Damn"}
{"text":"The pizza is so good!! Love the fries too. Fried chicken is pretty good, wings are ok. Some of my favorite pizza in Montreal! Great crust, generous toppings. Our delivery was always about 30 minutes from when we ordered. We got the wrong drinks once, but other than that our orders were always correct. Delivery until 4am."}
{"text":"Worst place to order! We did not know we had a older menu.I wanted the promo #1:  2 medium pizzas,10 chicken wings ,fries ans 2 drinks advertised on the menu at 32,99$.I call the restaurant and ask for delivery and i mentioned TWO times to the man on the line taking my order: \"i would like the promo #1 of 2 all dresses pizzas and 10 chicken wings,fries well cooked and a orange crush and a Canada dry as drinks please @ 32,99$\" I MENTIONED IT TWICE!!!! When the delivery got here i was greeted by a 6$ extra fee on my bill because they changed the price of the promo#1 from 32,99$ to 38,99$ AND AT NO TIME I WAS TOLD THIS WHEN I WAS PLACING MY ORDER!!And the guy taking the order on the phone sounded distracted and rushed. I did not have a fortune of cash on me and due to the fact a extra of 6$ was unplanned  the tip was low and the delivery guy was rude and called me cheap to my face! I called the restaurant to complain about the 6$ fee and the rude delivery guy only to be told excuses and no apology.I worked 20 + years in the delivery food service and i would never treat a client rudely and bitch about my tip. STAY AWAY FROM THIS PLACE ,VERY RUDE AND NOT HONEST!"}
{"text":"Waited 2 hours for pizza, owners are liars. Terrible customer service, take your business elsewhere. Terrible, terrible, terrible..."}
{"text":"If I could give less than one star, I would.  If you're going to have some sort of deal with the Westin, put someone on the phone who can understand English. I told the woman three times that I have a gluten allergy, and she didn't understand me. I told her NO BUN on the burger. So what do I get an hour later, after paying the delivery driver $30 because she made me order enough to warrant the delivery?  A sad little burger on a bun.  So $30 for food I can't eat. And I get to go to bed hungry. Go elsewhere, or just go to bed and don't order from this place. Not worth it, and the Westin should be ashamed for giving me no other option."}
{"text":"Got the shake-down from a delivery person who thought $3 was an insufficient tip for traveling 5 blocks with a $20 order.  It took an hour to get the order (was quoted 35 to 45 minutes) and they got the order wrong.  I called and the manager apologized, noting that he pays his drivers a decent wage. I appreciated that, but that's about all I appreciated about this joint."}
{"text":"Great 2 for 1 Pizza place.  Good suace, the dough is better than other place.  Good Pizza for parties as well"}
