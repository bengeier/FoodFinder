{"text":"Needed something to snack on and decided to check this place out. Vegetable samosas were so good!! 99 cents for 3.  Will definitely pick up some more when I'm in the area again."}
{"text":"Right next to the New Spiceland Supermarket. Packed with people, long line up.  The deep fried items at the counter doesn't have a name/price tag, so you have to ask. They are usually sells in a few for a dollar. The vadai was 5 / $1, it was hot and crispy, soooo good! The pakoda (that's the name they use) was 5 pieces for $1 And they don't have any samosa that day (or they just don't make it?) so the server suggest I try the fried dumpling (which filled with sweet potato as it turns out) 3 / $1  I wanted to try the curry they have, I asked for mutton/goat curry, she goes and check and come back to say they only have chicken or beef. A real surprise as usually places won't have beef at all, and goat/mutton a must have, I guess they really have it the other way around. I had the small bowl of chicken, it was really oily and the pieces was small like a dice.  I tried to listen and wanted to find out what others are ordering to see what's good. But they were so busy with the big tray of catering food sending non stop from the kitchen, I didn't get a chance to ask more questions... May be next time."}
{"text":"Hubby randomly pulled into this plaza and parked in front of New Spiceland Restaurant. He was hangry and sent me inside to grab something quick. I was the only non-Sri Lankan/Indian person in the place; food must be pretty good.  Going in blind (no Yelp research) I had no clue what to order. I threw caution to the wind and ordered the following: - Veggie samosas 3/$1 great flavor. The outside reminded me of a thick wonton wrapper. The bad part was it wasn't even warm nor crunchy.  - Milk Hopper - made to order, it came out hot! It reminded me of something between a crepe and pancake with a delicious filling that tasted like it was made from sweetened coconut milk. Oh so good! - Masala tea was served piping hot, not wild about the combination of spices.  All the above came out to less than $5 and kept the hangry monster at bay. Next time I'll try something from their hot table, and I will ask if they can make a fresh order of samosas so I can bump up their rating"}
{"text":"This place was recommended to me by a colleague.  The mutton kothu was delicious, not greasy ... good, Jaffna seasoning.  The short eats - meh - my vegetarian roti was so-so.  Outstanding are the masala dosa.  Devilled beef - not bad, a few tough pieces in there.  Exceptional - squid curry.  You can get some masala chai as you wait for your order to be prepared."}
{"text":"Prices have changed since the last review was posted. Their 'shorteats' or fried items are around 2 for 1$ now. Ordered the chicken biryani (found it way to spicy even though I'm very used to spice), egg rotis were too salty, tandoori chicken had the color of the spice but tasted nothing like it and was very dry. I wasn't very impressed with the deep fried items either. I was hoping for a better experience since I saw two long lines lined up inside the store with 6 people handling the lines at the counter. I didn't try other items so maybe I'm missing something that the crowd loves (?)  Plus points - the girls at the counter are very helpful at explaining the dish(es) and although they are clearly stressed with the crowds, they are very polite and pleasant. Also, they're open until midnight if you're craving something spicy in the Markham area."}
