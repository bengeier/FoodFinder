{"text":"portions are very generous! we've had chicken parm which was excellent. enough for a meal and plenty leftover. homemade raviolis were good. dinners come with salad and fresh cellone's bread. t also tried the breaded porkchops-- biggest chops you will ever see and sooo tender. staff is friendly, seem to have a lot of regular customers who knew the staff. will return to try breaded fish and one of the entree salads. saw both being served and they looked great!"}
{"text":"We were introduced to this place a few years ago by friends that knew the owners and have been back several times since. All in all it's a great spot for homemade Italian food, including the spaghetti. You'll definitely want to be sure that you request the 'homemade spaghetti' for your meal.  I usually try to keep things on the healthier side, so I normally ask for the Chicken Parmesan to be made with grilled chicken and 'light on the cheese.' With the portion sizes they give you, it's definitely a good move. Once, when I was feeling more adventurous, I tried the Fish Parmesan and it was a delicious plate of fried goodness. Also, if you go with a Parmesan dish, be sure to add a meatball or two (and if meatballs aren't on your must have list, the sausage isn't bad).  Their homemade Italian dressing was also a plus on my list, although the tomatoes on that salad were not.  Finally, they do have a bar, but use to be BYOB. It's been awhile since I've tried to bring in a bottle of wine, but even with their bar, they were very cool about letting the BYOB thing go (I'd just call and double check before you bring your own next time).  Finally, while I'm a bit new to this yelp thing, I thought an interesting take on my reviews would be to add a note about coffee. I have loved coffee since I was a kid and probably spent too much time learning too much about it when I worked at Starbucks in college. Anyway, long story short it's hard to find a good cup of coffee in a restaurant, especially a mom & pop shop, so if I have a good cup at a place like this, awesome...if not, I'm not going to hold it against them. Most people aren't drinking coffee and my standards are a bit high....but if you do love coffee for dessert, wait to drive by a Starbucks on your way home...other than that, definitely try out the LO!"}
{"text":"We were out in the south hills last weekend and needed a place to eat.  After consulting yelp we landed here at little oasis.  The cute house, friendly staff, and numerous people sucked us in and we were hoping for an above average meal. Sadly, we were to be disappointed.  The food was uniformly bland.  It was also overdone - or already cold!    If you were coming just too drink it might be ok, as the beer was good as well as cheap."}
{"text":"the food is amazing and homemade, which is my favorite.....i would advise going early it tends to get busy early and the wait can get frustrating, but I would wait for the quality because its homeade....luv comming here!"}
{"text":"This is pretty much the same food as the Oasis from Heidelberg. They use the same recipes and have basically the old menu.  I usually get the chicken parmesan and homemade spaghetti. The portions are huge and I always have to take some home.  They really make this a family atmosphere and try for you to feel welcome"}
{"text":"This little neighborhood restaurant and bar is great. Apparently the Oasis Pasta House was the origin of the menu but closed and has now reopened a location in Carnegie. The prices are fair for the portion offered, which are quite substantial. Our table ordered the fried provolone app which was the highlight of the meal. Two half inch thick wheels of breaded, fried melting goodness and a small bowl of their delicious tomato sauce. Our entrees were linguini with white clam sauce which was just fine. Lots of great clams and a buttery sauce that had good consistency but could have used more acid (lemon or white wine) but as I said it was fine and I would recommend it. My wife got the house made ravioli and was sold when informed that the tough decision of either cheese or meat would not have to be made and the kitchen would gladly do the order 50/50. I didn't think they were great but my wife enjoyed them. I also tried the wedding soup which was extremely hearty, almost seemed to have a beef broth instead of chicken. Good balance and again I would recommend it. The ranch dressing is housemade and delicious. The bread is Cellones sliced italian which was fresh. An older relative of the owners came over to join us for a short time and offered some entertainment for our toddler which was a nice surprise. All in all for 45 bucks plus the 10 buck tip for the perfect service we had a great meal, met a new friend and helped support a local business that is doing a good job."}
{"text":"The best meal is the gnocchi with meat sauce and extra meatballs.  It is homemade and absolutely delicious!"}
{"text":"This place is pure home cooking Italian food. It doesn't get much better than this. The homemade gnocchi and spaghetti is the best around. While it may not look like much from the outside, its beyond worth it to come inside. I'd recommend this to anyone and everyeone!"}
{"text":"Although the Little Oasis is not much to look at, it has good food and huge portions! Wanting to try something different and local, I headed to the Little Oasis with 5 friends last Saturday night. When I arrived, I was surprised to find that the restaurant is actually an old house. There was a sign that said 'valet parking' though a man just stood at the entrance and pointed to a space for us. I think we could have figured that out on our own. When we went inside, the wait staff asked if we had a reservation. We didn't. They looked unhappy but were able to find a table for us in the front room. The room as empty except for 2 people sitting by the steps. The room remained empty the entire time we were there 7:15-9:00 so I'm not sure what the issue about us not having reservations was about. Not the friendliest wait staff around.  I ordered the small homemade gnocchi with meat sauce and a cup of the wedding soup. The gnocchi was huge and obviously homemade due to the lack of uniformity of the pieces. Along with the meat sauce came a large meatball. I thought the gnocchi was light and the sauce was flavorful but I was more impressed with the chicken Romano my friend ordered. The dish came with two huge pieces of chicken and a side of gnocchi with aglio olio sauce that was spectacular. The side of gnocchi was almost as much as I received for my small portion. Overall, the food was very tasty and the portions were huge. If you plan to try it out, make sure you have reservations and order one of the chicken dishes with a side of pasta."}
{"text":"App. (fried oysters) were nothing great - previously frozen and thrown in  the fryer.  Entrees (seafood platter and chicken parm.) were way overcooked.  Look up at the ceiling tiles.  It makes one wonder if the restaurant's kitchen is as dirty.  Wedding soup was very good and staff/patrons were friendly."}
{"text":"Another child or should I say grandchild of the old Oasis that was in Heidelberg. After being seated a woman stopped by to see if we remembered her. It was Laura, from the old Oasis. Her granddaughter is running the L.O. and has many of the old recipes.  Had the homemade spaghetti with marinara sauce. The spaghetti was real good, nice noodles and zesty sauce. Homemade Chicken Pastina soup was good. You get a standard salad and some Italian bread with the meal. Had the small plate and it was large enough for a good meal with a bit left over. A dining companion had the gnocchi, large, and took half home for tomorrow's dinner. Another had the Veal Romano, three pieces of veal, large, but was over-breaded and said that it tasted more like fried bread than veal."}
{"text":"Really great, traditional Italian fare, great seafood.  Service was professional and attentive.  Prices were very reasonable.  Portions are HUGE!"}
