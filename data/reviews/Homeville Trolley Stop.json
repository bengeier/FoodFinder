{"text":"Tucked away in a part of Pittsburgh not often noted, Homeville, the Homeville Trolley Stop is clean, friendly and serves American comfort food.  Prices are very reasonable and being attached to a bar keeps it family friendly but with options for adult beverages.  The hamburgers are homemade and the chicken fried steak were excellent.  They have fish every Friday.  Parking is easy."}
{"text":"This place is a 'Shot & a beer' bar with pretty damn good food...  Order the daily special and add an appetizer...  You'll leave full with a to-go bag.  Great bar, great bartender, good food... Come on out and have a good time...."}
{"text":"Formerly called Stumps, I'm not sure how this place acquired the name \"Trolley Stop\"... there hasn't been anything resembling a trolley near it in over 50 years. But beings that this place is within a few miles of my home, I stop in every once and while for a shot of Jamison and a bottle of Sam Adams. 

It's not a bad little bar and they've recently remodeled it to include a smoke free dining area. There's a juke box and free darts. 

The food is inexpensive yet good and there's a daily special that changes every week (although you can always count on a seafood inspired dinner on Fridays). 

It would be nice if they offered something more in the way of craft beers but it's kind of a local \"set in its ways\" kind of place.  I wouldn't discourage anyone from coming here, but I don't think you're missing much if it's out of the way for you."}
{"text":"Place has good comfort food. The decor is nice and new and well maintained.  

The only detrimental factor in this place is the cigarette smoke.  If you don't mind paying your dry cleaner to clean your clothes from cigarette smoke, then this place is for you."}
