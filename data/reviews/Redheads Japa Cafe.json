{"text":"Good lunch spot with a variety of choices priced very competitively. Check out the salmon avocado bagel sandwich on Wednesdays. Eggs Benedicts also look amazing. One of the better lunch values in the area. Some unique Japanese dishes available as well, Japa-curry with interesting toppings ( egg, euro sausage?), toast with red bean paste, and sushi!"}
{"text":"BEST salmon bagel on earth...  enough said. But not really...I really really really LOVED their chili, and Montreal smoked meat sandwich.   A must try. The only downside is they close at 3...everyday. I give them a 5/5 because I haven't been to any place like it. If you know of any in the Calgary area, please msg me!"}
{"text":"After having to abort a disastrous luncheon at the nearby Edo's... (Nasty Sushi that! Blregh!) I scurried to find somewhere else edible quickly. Found this delightful little cafe and it seemed very quiet so I thought \"We'll, they serve Bacon! How can we go wrong?!\"  Now that last line in any other review would be foreboding wouldn't it? Blimey! Thankfully Redheads was a massive exception! It reminded me of the small sandwich shops I used to encounter back in England (Bonus points instantly there). Service was fast and friendly, had a Toasted Bacon & Cheese Sandwich Lunch Box.   IT EVEN HAD PICKLES IN THIS BOX! Huzzah!   The sandwich was nice and light but still filling, the cris... (No! Bad Brit, You are in Canada now!) ..chips were a decent custom bag sized portion to compliment the meal. My palette had been sated! Without decimating my wallet and all!  All in all. If your after a satisfying lunch quick. Redheads is one of the best choices you can make in this part of town. This Brit approves!"}
{"text":"Small Japanese Cafe in Downtown.  Their curry dishes are excellent.  Good deals during happy hours.  We also try the Sashimi salad, which is very fresh.  Definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I was craving a bagel sandwich but was pretty tired of TH's, so when I saw this place online I was eager to try it out.  The other reviews didn't hurt either, so I made the effort to go there.  I cannot begin to say how bad it was.   I ordered an egg salad sandwich on a bagel and coffee. A simple enough order, or so I thought.  How bad could it be, you're thinking?    Let me tell you:  undercooked eggs with bright yellow, hard jelly-like yolks, chopped in HUGE chunks with an enormous amount of tasteless, gooey mayonnaise on a Montreal sesame seed bagel (the bagel was good).    Salt, pepper or any kind of seasoning never saw that 'egg salad'.  It was served with potato chips and a side order of POTATO SALAD??  and a pickle.   Talk about a starch redundancy!   The coffee was tepid at best, and the milk I poured into it had some suspicious looking 'flakes' on the coffee that made me think it's last good day was yesterday.     The presentation was attractive, but what good is that when the food was almost inedible??   I spent almost $9 for food that I could not stomach.  There is a sign on the wall announcing a change in management, which I could possibly have forgiven their lack of knowledge of menu prep if the changeover date wasn't listed as 2010!!  The people serving me were Japanese, and I suspect they don't know anything about Jewish deli at all.  They really should stick to what they know best, and that isn't deli any way shape or form.  DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY."}
{"text":"My foodie buddy told me about this cafe and we were really excited to try it. I would have never guessed that this cafe served Japanese food. My friends and I ventured over here for lunch and we were pleasantly surprised with the menu. They have regular sandwiches, Japanese sandwiches, rice burgers, bento boxes, sushi and salad.  I ordered the katsu curry and it came with a side salad. The katsu was bigger than I imagined and pretty thick too but it was kind of dry. It's still probably the best katsu I've had in Calgary. The curry was flavorful and delicious.The dressing that was served with the side salad was a yummy Japanese style dressing.   The karaage rice burger is delicious the karaage is crispy and still juicy inside. The rice burger was bigger than we imagined.   The karaage curry is my go to item now because the meat is delicious and so is the curry.  It's a good spot for lunch and dinner and the food is pretty good. I'm planning to try the ramen next time."}
{"text":"The concept is so weird...imagine western breakfast with Japanese lunch menu. Surprisingly it works! One of the best Japanese curry I had in Calgary. The curry was sweet but savoury.The egg Benedicts was phenomenal. The pork on the pork sliders were juicy and fresh and it went well with the egg buns. My favourite was the French toast. I can't describe it. Just go out and try it!"}
{"text":"Was visiting an office nearby while in town for business, and when it was time to break for lunch, I pulled out my trusty Yelp app and found that Redheads was a couple of blocks away.  When I left the office, I was asked if I was in need of assistance for restaurant reco's and I said I already had a place in mind.  Entering Readheads, the layout is like a cafe.  And as it was after the lunch rush, only a few tables were occupied and it looked like everyone was enjoying a Katsu lunch.  I, too, opted for the Katsu, with an egg.  Delicious!  The curry was very rich and flavourful, and the pork was not greasy at all!  The egg was nicely poached, and placed on the side, to allow me to mix with the meal however I wished.  While eating, another customer sat near me, and I saw the sushi she ordered was a generous size and looked really good, but I was certainly too full to try sushi during this visit!  But although I was full, I had also ordered a matcha \"donut\" when I ordered my lunch, so of course I had to indulge.  Upon tasting, it was really the texture of a madeleine.  Good, but lacked the matcha flavour somewhat, but good enough to pick up a couple (another Matcha and Nectarine) for a colleague to try.  On my return to the office, I was asked where I went.  I was told I made the perfect choice (thanks Yelp) and in fact, the office often used this cafe as their caterer!  Clearly, I made a great choice for my lunch!"}
{"text":"Cute little place on 11th Ave. Wish I knew about it earlier. Went in for dinner a few days ago and ordered the katsu curry and Hamburg bento box. Wanted to try maybe a roll or something, but the server warned us that we already had lots of food. It's very filling! Katsu pieces were big and delicious and the bento box was really good too. Can't wait to go back to try other menu items!"}
{"text":"Super delicious modern Japanese food. Intimate, casual setting. Great selection of beers. Had the most amazing curry dish. I wish we had a location closer to our home as we'd eat there a few times a month for sure!"}
{"text":"So first of all this place is randomly awesome!!!!! I truly love how well rounded their menu is. From Katsu sandwich to some of the best Japa curry I've eaten even the true Canadian cafe necessities. Redheads does it all for a great price and of course a great taste.   They only started doing their brunch on the weekends this winter but it is great to have so many options and the made to order options are very customizable! Which for me is huge as I do tend to make a lot of the Japanese food they offer on their menu.  Every time I eat here it transports me back to Japan and that is why I love eating here and if you haven't got a loyalty card yet DO IT!"}
{"text":"After much hype and many recommendations, I was super excited to try the Japa Cafe - However, I left quite unhappy with the borderline discriminatory behavior there during the dine-in lunch. I used to live in Japan (?????????????), but oddly during the lunch rush, I was forced to pick up my and my girlfriend's bento boxes at the front. There was zero service. I had to fetch all the silverware and there was an empty water pitcher up front. However, the massive Japanese family seated next to us had complete table service. Everything was brought to them and the owner even came out to chat in Japanese. This felt bizarre and borderline discriminatory. I don't want to assume it was because I was white (I didn't give off that I speak fluent Japanese)...but it felt like it.   The food was quite awful as well. My hamburg bento box was stone cold. The rice tasted old and the hamburger patties were almost chilled. I came in for a hot meal and left about as cold as the -20 degree weather outside. There wasn't much redeeming about the experience. Perhaps the curry is great (so I've heard), but the food was cold and the service was non-existent. Did I mention that the prices were quite expensive (over $11 per bento box)?  I would avoid here. ???????????????????????"}
{"text":"Came for lunch today, I guess it's been about a month since my last visit.  Noticed their cut backs in the meals. First off the Curry rice dishes no longer come with a starter salad. Also the sandwiches no longer come with a side. Food still tastes good. Just wish they didn't take back the extras."}
{"text":"Tastie \"Rice burgers\" (their term for a sort of Onigiri) .  Had the lunch combo that came with very good Chicken Karaage and a rice burger . I added another rice burger cause I hadnt had breakfast.  My friend had 3 rice burgers and promptly entered carb coma.   I'd avoid the fish ones (i thought they'd be raw like sushi, but they're cooked).  The Pork Katsu and Chicken ones are yum.   I'll return to this spot again to try other food, it was good."}
{"text":"Actually 4.5 stars!  I've visited Redheads on several occasions for lunch (which I always got to-go) and once for dinner (sit-down) and have always been really satisfied and happy with my meal! My favorite on the menu for lunch is the Chicken Karaage Japa-Curry which comes with a side salad with their signature house dressing. It's a generous portion, the chicken is crispy on the outside and moist on the inside and the curry has great umami!  They also make a fantastic matcha tea latte!  Things I'm not as big a fan of: the rice burgers don't really do it for me but may appeal to some, and the wait time when I was there for dinner was kind of long but on the plus side, their ramen (only served at dinner) was very flavorful. I don't know if I really enjoyed the dine-in experience much at all, but it's still one of my go-to lunch spots downtown!"}
{"text":"A couple of friends and I stopped in at Redheads Bagel Cafe and I was extremely impressed with not only the atmosphere, but with the selection and combination of bagels that they offer.  Whether you're in the mood for a breakfast bagel, a bagel sandwich, or just a bagel with cream cheese, Redheads Bagel Cafe is where it's at.  Specializing in Montreal-style bagels, smoked meat, Winnipeg cream cheeses and Atlantic smoked salmon, Redheads Bagel Cafe will have you salivating at the door. Everything is baked fresh on-site. Between the flavour, quality, selection, service and prices, Redheads Bagel will keep you comin' back for more and more and more and...well you get the point."}
{"text":"This was my first time at a Japanese restaurant I enjoyed my selection very much the atmosphere was fun and friendly and the food was excellent I have a chicken sandwich it was very tasty and delicious. I will go back again"}
{"text":"Cute, funky spot with great, authentic Japanese food!"}
{"text":"Ended up here on a whim because another brunch place had a 45 minute wait - and let me tell you, we are so glad we found it here! Walking in, it looks like you're in a tiny coffee shop - not a Japanese cafe, so we were a bit confused. It's snug in here, which is a little awkward for the buffet part of things along the counter, but it worked. We did the brunch buffet for $18.99 each (weekends only) and it's a combo of pre-made things and made to order items. For the self-serve items, there was soup, a garden salad, some hot noodles (they were dry) and slices of pork (also a bit dry). Oh, and some Japanese doughnuts, which are basically little cakes, not like the doughnuts from Timmy's.  You order your made to order things off a menu with a dry erase marker and there's everything from french toast to eggs benedict to Japanese curries. We tried a couple of the curries (so so good - flavourful and hearty and when you add a perfect soft poached egg, it's amazing), the french toast (so fluffy and soft!), the rice burgers (which are fat pieces of rolls basically) and the sliders (omg they are all so good). My favourite part is that you can add things to all your curries - so I added hot dogs. They cut them like octopuses so they've got crispy legs and goddamnit, it's so good I could have cried. I honestly can't say enough good things about them - AND they have cold Sapporo on draft that just makes everything taste so much better. This may be my new favourite restaurant in Calgary. When you roll yourself to your car after a meal, you know you chose a good place."}
{"text":"Redheads was introduced to me by a friend. I was told to get a rice burger. I was after a burger and she told me try something new. This was definitely worth it. Sure its not your typical burger but the rice and chicken is amazing!! Their London Fog is tasty too great on a cold day. Great anyday! I shouldn't get to much into their brownie but lets just say its tasty! The atmosphere is nice. Relaxed music playing and the staff are friendly. Its small but a reasonable size to move around in. You can easily become a regualr and they remember their customer's orders."}
{"text":"This place is such a hidden gem. We came here on a whim after work for dinner and ordered the katsu curry (signature dish), ramen (only 10 per day), and the spam and egg rice burger. Everything was delicious and brought me back to travelling in Japan. High quality and quaint. Definitely recommend a visit here!"}
{"text":"A quick but not so simple breakfast joint. Friendly staff and delicious breakfast items. Each with its own flare. Nothing bad to say at all. My morning just got better."}
{"text":"My favourite time to go is at dinner. The food is served differently than lunch, and homemade ramen is served too. I love the chewy noodles and and the mix of veggies, grilled pork and egg. It's more quiet and calming at night too, which makes it an ideal place for dinner after a hectic day. Get the curry katsu or chicken karrage, any of the salads (my fave is calamari) and ramen. Only ten bowls are served a night (not available during day time as it is too time consuming) with homemade noodles and the best value - $10.00!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place reading the reviews. Sadly, I will not be back though.   Pros: 1) I had the eggs Benny ham - it was tasty!  2) Good prices   Cons: 1) Very stuffy atmosphere 2) Asked for medium poached eggs but they were very well done  3) Service was decent at best  4) They told me they ran out of potatoes (I came at 12) but I saw them still available at the buffet"}
{"text":"Had the Katsu Curry and it was delicious.  Can't wait to go back, I've been thinking about it ever since - it's the perfect cold weather comfort food."}
{"text":"Redheads is a staple for my boyfriend and I. We are big fans of Japanese curry. The only wish I have is that they will start offering regular chicken curry as their only options are deep fried :/ which I would love to eat all the time but I'm health conscious. I do purchase their katsu curry probably once a month, but I would come more often if they had a healthier curry option :) Their tofu salad is so delish. I usually share one with my bf while we get separate entrees and it comes with yummy dressing.  They also do stamp cards so that you can earn a free curry. Win :)"}
{"text":"I'm married to a stunning Red Head. I'm also rolling into Week 3 of a long business trip and really really miss Gayle. So do you think that I would walk into a place based only on its name?  Redheads is also my kind of place as this place specializes in Montreal-style bagels and smoked meat, Winnipeg cream cheeses and Atlantic smoked salmon (flown in from New Brunswick). My only quibble is that they open at 7:30 AM during the week, which is too late to walk over before work.  I guess I'll just have to \"settle\" for another delicious nosh around Lunch, Linner, or Supper..."}
{"text":"Super delicious Japanese curry! Great little gem. The rice Katsu burger, Japa rice bowl and skewers are my faves. Not busy at dinner but very busy at lunch. I would try it out if you are into Japanese flavors. Staff are friendly and service is quick. It's a quirky little cafe so the ambience is a little odd but the food is fantastic. Highly recommended."}
{"text":"?????????CJCA????TIME?????????????? Thank you very much.  Very good foods & services."}
{"text":"One of Calgary's most unique brunches  interesting different food cooked with care.  Great value and it stays interesting after multiple visits."}
{"text":"I have been going to this place for about 6 years and I keep going so that means something right??   There are some great things like the smoked meat sandwich and the bagels in the morning. Over the past few years they have changed the menu a bit and some things remain slightly disjointed. For example when I asked for my bagel  double toasted and they toasted it once and put on the cream cheese and then toasted it again.   It's an ok place to grab breakfast or lunch. Nothing more, nothing less."}
{"text":"Interesting place for lunch. It's homey and mostly self-serve. Can take reservation but feel more like a fast food cafe than an actual restaurant. We had 2 different curry dishes. It came with a salad as a side dish. Although it said \"mini\" on the menu, it was really a decent size and the dressing makes the vege taste sooooo good!! The curry was alright with an Asian twist. The price was also acceptable considering it's in downtown. Would probably visit again if I'm around for a quick simple meal."}
{"text":"Was craving japanese curry and happened upon this place. Must've been fate! Very friendly staff and and very cozy and warm environment. I got the chicken katsu curry and it was outstanding."}
{"text":"Was here last year on a business trip, I had ordered the salad, fresh as I still remember it, that's a good thing.  Bright, spacious, and liked how their servers cleaned up the tables as soon as customers left.  It's a happening place, and had organized a catering online order with them; ask for Tomo, he's very helpful and offers any custom menu depending on your budget and dietary concerns.  I'd go back."}
{"text":"Tastes like a memory. Perfect! I visited Japan last year and I only allowed myself to eat \"truly Japanese\" food.  My absolute favorite was Japanese curry, and I fell in love. But alas, this was a love that could not last, as I had to return to Canada. So when a friend of mine told me they found Japanese curry at Redheads, I had to try it! It did not disappoint! It was perfect - if I closed my eyes I could swear I was sitting in Shibuya. Rich, hot, not too spicy, very flavorful - Japanese curry is a distinct flavor. Get the Katsu Japa Curry - Tonkatsu is a tender pork cutlet breaded with panko and fried golden brown, and it swims with agility in the golden curry sauce. This place is licenced, too, so grab yourself an Asahi to go with your curry. MUST TRY!"}
{"text":"Being an Ex- Montreal resident I do have a personal fondness of bagels so I was really happy to see this new bagel cafe open up on 11th avenue.  Here they prepare different types of bagel combinations as well as your standard lox and cream cheese for a really great price. But the difference is the fresh smoked salmon is actually flown in from New Brunswick every week.  You can even have your bagel with lean Montreal Smoked Meat which is also the real thing. Each Redheads Bagels is baked fresh every morning and all baked goods are made by the best local bakers.  This place is clean, comfy with tons of space and huge floor to ceilings which bring in tons of light, everything is both fresh and delicious and surprisingly cheap!!!  Well worth the visit!"}
{"text":"Best Japanese curry in the city; I really like the chicken karaage curry; it's essentially fried chicken with curry.  The japa rice bowl is good to order too because you get a little bit of everything. The Japa Rice Katsu burger was tasty.  The restaurant is a family owned operation. At lunch, you order at the counter and grab a table and they'll call out for you to pick up your food at the counter.  If you come for dinner they will serve you at the table.   I've heard the brunch here is excellent; unfortunately I haven't had a chance to try it out yet. I would recommend this place."}
{"text":"Came by for lunch a few days ago.  Initially wanted to try the Rueben sandwich but they didn't have any smoked meat.  So I went with a Tonkatsu bento box while my gf went with the Karaage bento box.  Unique system where everybody picks up a menu by themselves, lines up to order and pay at the counter.  For dine-in you get a number and seat yourself.  If you want water, you can pour yourself a cup at the pickup area.  When your food is ready, they call your number and you pick up the food at the front.  After you are done your meal, pick up your dishes and drop them off in a tub by the kitchen on a metal rack.  The food is solid, nothing amazing but will do the trick.  I prefer their curries more since I love Japanese curry and they are probably a better bang for your buck.  The pork was crispy and went great with the Tonkatsu sauce.  I found their salad dressing to be lighter than other places, but that could be a consistency thing.  The karaage was nice and flavorful, real chunks of juicy chicken.  Probably one of the best I've had in the city and dipped in the Tonkatsu sauce it was divine.    TL:DR- Get a Japanese curry dish of some sort and you won't be disappointed.  Japanese curry is much milder than regular curry, sweeter and is more like a gravy than a curry."}
{"text":"I like Redheads. For some reason, I thought this is a restaurant given that you can make reservation on OpenTable. But it turns out somewhat like a fast food restaurant but not quite really a fast food restaurant. Its basically a café with other options that are not café style food. So not just burger and sandwiches here. They do have some interesting things like the sushi burger made out of sushi (only issue is the salmon is not raw).  I got their bento box with the miso katsu. The katsu (fried pork) was not bad. I liked it. The portion was very big for $10.99. Box itself looks small but don't be food. I was really full from eating here. On top of it, I got a Japa Doughnut (matcha flavor). I liked it. it was freshly made (I can tell). Limited supplies on those doughnuts. The doughnuts are $1.   Décor of this place is kind of dark. Not romantic seating though. So you walk in and you order right away. Its pretty much self serve here. You get your own food and seat yourself. I noticed that this place is not very busy during lunchtime. I am guessing because its in Beltline and not downtown which makes a big difference.   Highly recommend giving this place a try."}
{"text":"They have a weekend brunch buffet that sounds really appealing and includes a large number of the regular dishes which could be ordered as part of the buffet.   No pickled veggie was included with the curry on the side which I thought was odd. For the California roll, the rice was on the dry side. It might have been because it was almost closing, so the rice may not have been as fresh so your experience may be very different.   They have a lot of unique dishes that I'd love to try if I'm ever in Calgary again.   Street parking is available nearby and is plentiful."}
{"text":"At first I was super excited when I stumbled across this place - all day breakfast, what more could I possibly ask for? The service was good, the staff very friendly and the café was clean and very homey. There is a great selection of breakfast food here and I opted for the eggs benedict - can't you tell that's my favorite food by now?  I was a disappointed with the food though, it was reasonably priced, but it wasn't great. So sad! Oh well, maybe I'll just have to try something else next time."}
{"text":"Had lunch with a friend on a weekday. You basically order at the counter then they'll call your number when the food is ready. We may have tried the wrong items here but we had a California roll to share and also a japa rice burger. Think of a sushi cone but in a different shape. The outside is seaweed with rice then a filling of your choice. I had the tuna salad and she had cooked salmon. We both thought they were dry and without much flavour.   We noticed several people ordering the curry katsu which seemed to be a popular choice. I'd try again if in the area so don't judge this by my stats alone! Maybe order the curry or ramen and report back. C'mon fellow Yelpers, I am counting on your feedback!!!"}
{"text":"My God, yes. Japanese-owned and -staffed. Best chicken karaage in town and by a long shot. Absolutely delicious curry rice, which I almost always get with that karaage, but on the side so it stays crispy- eat the curry and rice, savour that, and THEN eat the karaage as it'll be at the perfect temperature.  They have a brunch buffet on weekends that's a stunner."}
{"text":"I love this stop!   The food is so good and seems quite authentic. I highly recommend the JapaBurgers as well as the JapaDonuts and their Taiyaki (of course!) They also have a Sunday brunch AYCE (20$)."}
{"text":"Very good brunch menu.  The eggs Benedict was quite good.  The dining area is a bit disorganized but it's a cafe.  They have an all you can eat brunch buffet but we opted to order from the menu as the options didn't really look great.  They ran out of potatoes which was a disappointment.  Their coffee is quite good and prices are reasonable.  The service was OK but you really have to specify what you want or things could get lost in translation here.  I'd go back and give it another go!"}
{"text":"AWFUL SERVICE!!! The food is unimpressive and the service just unfriendly and terrible!! I would never recommend this place nor go there again!!"}
{"text":"I've been meaning to try Redheads Bagel Cafe for weeks. It did not disappoint!  Really simple, but delicious selection of menu items from the standard bagel and lox to Montreal smoked meat sandwich to bacon and egg. Delicious coffee too!  It's also a nice atmosphere....cafe set up with a booth bench along the wall and little tables. Nice music and free papers to read.  Definitely recommend!"}
{"text":"Amazing little gem I found on the old electric Avenue. My new lunch and dinner spot if I need to work on my laptop! Highly recommend this place for their amazing modern Japanese yet very authentic menu. I have never seen bento boxes served they way they do with taro root and authentic Japanese vegetables!"}
{"text":"In this neck of the woods, you are pretty much doomed to find anything quick to eat after the hour of 4 pm. So before the unfortunate floods tore our poor city apart, I was trying to grab a bite to eat before seeing possibly the worst act of the two days of Sled Island at Commonwealth. We were short on time and the only options were at least 6 blocks away or going to cost a 100 bones per plate. When suddenly I saw Redhead's on the Yelp app and low and behold they were open till 8! We parked by Commonwealth, walked a block and were greeted warmly when we entered the door.  They use Wayne's bagels here and specialize in Montreal smoked meat. We ordered two smoked meat bagels with all the offered toppings and grabbed a seat. The cashier brought them out to us once they were finished, they came with a side of chips and a pickle.  Perfect portion size. I am no expert on Montreal smoked meat, but it was tasty. The cafe itself is quaint and clean, several other hungry patrons passed through the doors while we ate our meal.  I would be back, very enjoyable and it filled my hunger hole.  Thanks Redheads!"}
