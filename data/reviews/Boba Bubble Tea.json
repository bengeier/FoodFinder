{"text":"My daughter introduced me to bubble tea at this Boba Bubble Tea store. I love it. I have tried many different teas and slush here and it's all good. Adding tapioca to the drinks tops it off nicely as well. Can't wait to go back for another."}
{"text":"My boyfriend did a pick up and I believe it was a matcha green milk  tea! It was great with a good serving of tapioca!"}
{"text":"We had:

-Taro Milk Tea with grass jelly: Good taro milk taste.  Fresh grass jelly.
-Pineapple coconut smoothie:  I would not order this again(or they should just remove this).  Lots of ice that wasn't grinded properly. Ice masks the pineapple coconut taste.  

Stick with the milk bubble teas.


They take credit/debit."}
{"text":"Amazing Wonton soup on a cold winter's day. They offer with pork, shrimp or both. Really nice owners. Took the time to chat. Will return for sure. Next time to try their bubble tea."}
{"text":"Refreshing blueberry iced tea with mango jelly. Definitely worth a drop in when walking along queen st - beaches"}
{"text":"This place is okay. Got the original milk tea and it's definitely not one of my favourites. My friend was kind of disappointed with her matcha milk tea. The place is tiny with little seating area. Overall, would probably only come back if I was in the area and desperately craving bubble tea."}
{"text":"This was the worst bubble tea I've ever had.  I had the passion fruit black tea with tapioca, and my girlfriend had the taro milky tea with tapioca.  Mine tasted like the tea was brewed over a week ago and the tapioca was dry and bland.  It was gross.  I actually feel nauseated.  She didn't like hers either.  We both drank a quarter of them and threw them out.

Edit: I vomited at 3am. I knew it tasted funny."}
{"text":"One of the only, okay only bbt joint by the beaches. It's okay, pretty basic overall in terms of menu, decor and service.

After been to so many, I've come to expect a lot for bbt for that price point. Hopefully they figure things out soon. What I'd like to see, some special deals, more flavour in the tapioca (let it steep more) and grass jelly and higher quality black tea."}
{"text":"3 weeks in business by owner..

Tapioca balls were fresh and chewy.

Mango slush was more watery...I think if they used fresh mangoes or a mixture of frozen/fresh it would be better.

Must have been a long day because if I were a new business in the beaches I'd be more friendly if your customer is asking questions about the shop."}
{"text":"I didn't go specifically for boba, but more for the Won ton soup . I had the shrimp with noodles one . It's pretty delicious. They make the wontons in-house . I'm definitely going back for more"}
{"text":"I ordered the bubble waffle with ice cream.  The bubble waffle is basically HK egg waffles.  It was freshly made but it was really thick.  It comes with ice cream and I requested for half a scoop of green tea and black sesame.  The black sesame tasted a lot better than green tea.  The green tea just lacks flavour.  It also comes with complimentary topping, syrup and pocky sticks.  I opted for Oreo chunk bits (my all time fave topping) green tea flacourepocky"}
{"text":"I had the taro slush. It was very good-not too much ice and enough flavour. The tapioca balls were warm and fresh tasting. I really enjoyed the drink. They didn't have quite as many options as some other bubbletea places but I think they have all the main ones. The bubble waffle icecream things also looked good."}
{"text":"Came by after having dinner for some dessert and ordered their Hong Kong waffle with ice cream and it was pretty good. The people who worked there seemed very nice as we were a larger group. I haven't tried their bubble tea yet so I can't comment on that but I would go back if I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Pros:
Friendly service
Drinks were well made

Cons:
Not much sitting space

We were near the beaches and feeling like a bubble tea.  BBT places seem to be few and far between in this part of the city.  Luckily we managed to find Boba. If you're craving a BBT in this part of the city, Boba gets the job done.

Boba isn't too big of a place.  It's mostly meant for take out if you ask me.  We were a group of 10 looking for a place to sit and chill.  They have a park like bench in front to sit and that's it.  The middle row is connected to both tables which can make having multiple groups sit in it a bit awkward.  When the line is big and the benches are occupied, it can get a little cramped.  Like I said, Boba is obviously more oriented toward take out.  It's no biggie at all really.  I'm just used to chilling where I get my BBT.  

Boba has a good assortment of your BBT items you would find at BBT places.  The prices are pretty good.  I expect places downtown to charge a premium because of the location, but I didn't feel that way at all with Boba.  Boba offers a bubble waffle which you won't find at too many BBT places.  It's basically a egg waffle (HK style) with a scoop or 2 of ice cream.  It's a nice little treat.  The egg waffle smelled so good while they were making it.  Check out my photo for a better description.

The service was very friendly here.  Being a new place and probably new type of place to area, the staff have to regularly explain their items to customers.  Over hearing the conversations, I could tell they were very helpful with people not familiar with BBT.  There were only 2 staffers on, but they made things run very smoothly even when it got busy.

Overall. Boba is a nice little place to get your BBT fix.  There probably aren't too many places of this nature in the area as well.  If I'm in the area again, I would definitely come back."}
