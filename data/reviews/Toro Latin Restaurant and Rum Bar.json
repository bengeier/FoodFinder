{"text":"Upon being seated as a party of five, we were promptly served water and their excellent homemade bread. Time ticked by and it appeared as though we may had been forgotten. Fortunately we were able to snag the attention of the water waiter to let him know that after 15 minutes we had yet to see our actual server. After a few awkward moments we had drinks in our hand, mine being the Rum Old Fashioned which turned out to be damn strong, just how I like it. Having just golfed 18 at the TPC Stadium course our appetite's were primed so we ordered all at once. I chose the Rainbow Tropical Roll with a side of the Pork Belly Mac and Cheese which was flavorful, a bit heavy but the the pork was absolutely marvelous! I would give the Roll a B+ as I've had better Sushi but the presentation was top notch. Other members of the table ordered the Brussel's Sprouts with Peanuts and the Scallops with Pork Belly which definitely pleased everyone at the table. Having said that, my next visit would definitely include anything to do with the Pork Belly-tender, juicy, tons of flavor and not a hint of dryness. This was our first visit and despite the hiccup on initial service, they really picked up the pace and took grade-A care of the entire table."}
{"text":"Beautiful view on a golf course! But the sushi was not amazing . They have a live band which is nice but the service is fairly slow."}
{"text":"Was excited to try this place.Arrived for lunch and were seated on the patio immediately.After a few minutes I didn't like that we had no shade so were seated inside with a good view of the golf course.Our water glasses were retrieved from outside and the silverware removed from the empty places ...as there were only 2 of us at a large table. Then that's it! We watched for 20 mins whilst waiters served the tables around us but we became invisible ! They were not that busy and we had no intention of asking for service! So we decided to leave ,the bus lady was upset but when my husband explained to the hostess she turned away from him and started asking what happened to the wait staff. Very disappointing experience....obviously can't comment on the food ....nor drinks as we only received water!"}
{"text":"Ambience and views in this restaurant are absolutely amazing. On top of that, menu variety and service are top notch. This is the perfect place for a romantic dinner or impromptu lunch. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"Food was very good. Service terrible. Waiter disappeared after order. One entre didn't arrive and had to grab two different servers before we got it 15 minutes later."}
{"text":"We were here with a large party and had lots of the menu.  Drinks, salads, and a mix of food from the small plate and large plate options.  It was all consistently very good.  Interestingly they have sushi on the menu, usually not a good choice at a golf course, but it was exceptional.  A great choice at the TPC in Scottsdale."}
{"text":"Came here on a Friday night as we were staying on the property of the Fairmont Princess. It was empty inside since everyone was at the hotel for an event for a group. We had a band playing for us. The space was beautiful and the food was really good . We got the angry tuna roll and the toro salad to start and Chifa Style Fried Rice and snapper for Dinner. The waiter was very helpful and make sure it was gluten free and the food was delicious. Would recommend this restaurant! Great people working there."}
{"text":"Okay food, okay service, terrible attention to food allergies.   When I go to eat somewhere with my best friend, we always make sure to be very clear about her severe nut allergy. Obviously we did this at Toro.  We told the waiter my friend had a deadly nut allergy. After a very sub par meal--the sushi really isn't flavorful--we ordered the chocolate cake for dessert. It was the best chocolate cake we'd ever had. One problem though: Nutella.  Nutella wasn't listed on the dish description, and when we asked the waiter why they had Nutella on the cake he just shrugged and said the chef decided to add some on the top.   WHY? I don't understand what the problem here was. Did the waiter not tell the chef about the allergy? (Not okay.) Did the chef not care? (Not okay.)  Obviously this ruined the entire brunch. Not that there was much to ruin. The food really wasn't anything special.   There are just so many other places to go in Scottsdale, and no chocolate cake is worth a trip to the hospital.   If you do decide to come here for brunch, avoid the adventurous dishes and stick with the more traditional breakfast fare."}
{"text":"Mediocre food, slow service, and doesn't honor their advertised groupon specials. If you're looking for a bait and switch, this is your restaurant. If not, I highly recommend another restaurant."}
{"text":"My husband and I were staying at the Fairmont for a weekend getaway. We did not feel like venturing far off the property but have been to several steak restaurants recently and weren't in the mood for Mexican so decided to check out this newer offering by the Fairmont.   All I can say is WOW!!! The menu is interesting and can be a little overwhelming but we had a fabulous server (ask for Chris!) who offered up amazing suggestions, most of which we ordered. We started with the the braised beef empanadas appetizer (they had run out and the chef made a new batch just for us despite the fact they were closing soon) - YUM. Then we had the Mexican campfire snapper, Asian Vegetable Saltado (basically Pad Thai) and a side of the Chipotle Pork Belly Mac and Cheese. Double YUM. Not a bad morsel. I will say everything has a bit of a kick to it. I typically can't handle spicy food and while a few items were slightly beyond what I would normally withstand, the flavor was well worth it. I only wish we could have tried everything on the menu! Oh, I almost forgot - the bread they bring at the beginning is divine! Ask how they make it, fascinating.  We were too full for dessert but several tables around us that the Bomba and it looked amazing. We were also told by our shuttle driver that the chocolate cake is something special. Both items are large enough for 4+ people. We are already planning our return visit and I'll probably starve myself beforehand so I can eat more!   Not only was the food incredible but the service too. We came in at 8:30pm and their posted hours are until 9pm (we weren't the only ones but it was thinning out). Our server, Chris, has a passion for the restaurant and shared interesting details about the menu, Latin food in general (we didn't realize the Japanese influence in South America) and the Fairmont. He was so upbeat and positive despite having worked valet all day and serving dinner all night. I admire his energy! He never rushed us and made sure we had the best experience they could offer.  As for the ambiance, the restaurant does have live music on weekends and the bar and dining room are all open with no delineation. We asked to be seated furthest away from the band and while it was a tad loud, it wasn't anything unbearable. I'm not sure what the noise level is during the week but it isn't a quiet romantic place but rather modern and upbeat.   We are telling all our friends and family about Toro and will be returning soon!"}
{"text":"Our server was Lesley and she was super sweet and very helpful. She explained everything on the menu and all her suggestions made our dinner even better.  We ordered the wild mushroom flat bread, Toro burger, the Panna Cota as the desert and espresso and a cappuccino to end the night. To say this place is amazing is an understatement.   We ended up going out tonight for our last night in Arizona and taking my in-laws here for dinner. They ended up loving this place and kept on thanking us throughout the night for bringing them here.   So, if you love amazing food, good customer service, great ambiance and a place to impress your in-laws, this is the place to go. I promise it will not disappoint.   I loved this place so much that I decided to write my first review on Yelp about it. To be honest, I was a bit lazy before about posting, but this place was definitely worth it."}
{"text":"We went to this place based on the great reviews online and quite frankly it was an awful experience. Everything was seasoned oddly, and all the sauces were way too sweet. We ordered the crunchy shrimp and surf and turf roll. The shrimp was way too heavily breaded and inedible because of how salty it was. The roll was blah. We also ordered three entrees, including the miso cod and the Christmas special. Both of them had sauces that overpowered the meat and fish- it was just too sweet and odd tasting. We are not picky eaters so this was a thoroughly disappointing time for everyone. Not to mention the price is way too high for the quality of food they have to offer."}
{"text":"The food was delicious! I got the pork belly with scallops and it was cooked to perfection! My husband got one of the Sushi rolls and it was delicious! The ambiance was nice, we had a reservation for a window table looking out onto the green, for right when the sun set. (Check online to find out what time it sets and make a reservation for about 30 minutes before sunset). It was perfect. Expensive, but perfect. And our waiter was great, the whole staff was very accommodating. You do have to take a bus from the princess resort to get there, but the driver was so funny and we actually ordered what he recommended!"}
{"text":"Enjoyed dinner with my husband last night.  The food was experty presented and very flavorful.  My husband had the Toro Salad and I had the Chicken Croquettes for our appetizers.  Wanted the snapper for an entree but they were out.  Ordered the pork loin.  Very tasty but not used to eating pork rare...very rare.  The desserts were the best. My favorite was what i would call zeppolis...sugar coated fried dough with 3 dipping sauces.   Fabulous rum selection and very creative cocktails.  Beware....very large portions more like family style tapas than small plates.  Like a number of other reviewers, we had a Groupon and were disappointed that we could not order off the regular menu.  Groupon should have been clear.  We had a reservation and were seated immediately seated.  Server greeted us within a few minutes but then seemed a bit put off by the groupon and took over 15 minutes to bring us the very limited prix fixe menu.   She did apologize for the delay and offered to bring us a complimentary drink.  Good recovery.  Overall we enjoyed the experience and will go back."}
{"text":"Outstanding location and view. Staff are courteous and efficient. Fusion. Excellent food. Rum list is impressive. Rum flights! Will be back"}
{"text":"I ate here with my parents and best friend. We were staying at the Fairmont Princess and wanted a nice kid free dinner. We all four loved this place. The wine, food, atmosphere, and service were all top notch. Sean was our server. He was very helpful and spent a lot of time helping my mother pick out something with no spice. I had the fried rice and it was absolutely delicious. I highly recommend eating here."}
{"text":"We dined here last night and it was decadent! The ambiance starts it off perfectly with simple, yet elegant decor and fabulous views of the course. The wait staff couldn't have been more professional and very knowledgeable of this Latin cuisine. There were 4 of us, each choosing and sharing a variety of small plates and a few entrées. From the sushi to the empanadas to the filet...and incredible Mac and cheese...it was all so delicious. The flavors and plating made it just right. We will be back!!"}
{"text":"Decided to try Toro after eating our way through all of the other Fairmont restaurants.  I guess we saved the best for last.  Our daughter and her college friend were in town for the weekend and we wanted to try something new and different.  The menu has something for everyone.  We ordered many of the dishes and shared them all.  Most reviews talk about the incredible angry shrimp roll, fried rice - had to try and each was worth it.  My favorites were the scallops, the avocado salad and bacon wrapped pork with house made mustard seed sauce.  The filet was cooked to perfection and tender.  As incredible as the food was, Chris provided amazing service!  When we have a craving for Toro again, we will request Chris.  He was personable, made great pairing suggestions and laughed along with our table.  Also, it was a Friday night and there was live music.  Great night!"}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant in the resort, we ate there 3 times which involved taking the shuttle with two small kids and that says a lot! Delicious food, especially the seafood and sushi and our 10 month old son loved the fried rice!!! The drinks are great, you look out on a gorgeous golf course. They were also very accommodating to our double stroller"}
{"text":"Great venue to relax and enjoy Latin music and phenomenal food! The rum bar and great wine topped the list ...."}
{"text":"Ceviche was some of the best I've had. The chicken was really, really plain: no sauce no spice no nothing. Disappointing. Plantains that came with it were perfect. Potatoes with it just potatoes, plain. Red snapper was also good, good flavor (not great), but required/needed hot sauce, there just wasn't enough flavor there on its own. Rum Flight was also very good and they have a good selection of beers and wine. Service was also excellent. I've had much better Latin cuisine and much cheaper places. Was really hoping this place was going to knock my socks off because it's just around the corner."}
{"text":"Second visit to Toro and the kitchen was consistent in putting out great food in a timely manner. Scallops and Pork Belly (prepared Chinese \"char siu\" style) over polenta was great, as was the Toro Toro rum cocktail, reminiscent of a mojito. Other entree was a very moist snapper served with pico and warm tortillas. Like most Scottsdale eateries, with the open floor plans, the room can get loud with other diners, however the addition of the live music (2 guitarists) playing latin/cuban music was very nice."}
{"text":"Food was great but pricey. A little much for lunch after golf. The sashimi was delicious, the seared salmon roll was very good, & the tuna ceviche was great as well."}
{"text":"We had a fantastic lunch today at Toro! There were eight of us and we all LOVED what we ordered. The restaurant honored our request for a round table which was big enough for all of us. The view of the TPC golf course was gorgeous, too. Our server, El Cubano (aka Arnoldo) could not have been more accommodating! He was polite, professional, considerate, well-informed and enthusiastic. We will all return here soon. I know why this restaurant was given a top-ten rating of new restaurants by Phoenix Magazine."}
{"text":"Great service and very friendly staff. Food was good, but not amazing. We had filet and scallops w/pork belly. Crunch cake for dessert was okay. It's also a rum bar so that's fun and lots to try. We were staying at Fairmont Princess and used the shuttle servixes"}
{"text":"My husband and I absolutely loved this place! Not only was the food delicious, but the customer service was exceptional! We went there for the first time this past Sunday to celebrate our 8 year wedding anniversary, and they treated us like a King & Queen. Everyone from the hostess to our server Dean were amazing! Loved the entire experience. We will definitely be going back and will bring our friends along for the ride. If you haven't checked this place out I definitely recommend you do, you won't be disappointed!  To the Toro Latin Restaurant & Rum Bar staff: Thank you for your outstanding customer service! You really know how to make your customers feel special. If I could give you guys 10 stars I would! Thank you again for making our special day feel extra special. :)"}
{"text":"Was very disappointed in this restaurant especially after all of the good remarks we got from people around us and hotel staff.   The first table we were going to be sitting at was right in front of the very loud band that was playing. Really?   Who thinks this is a good place to sit?  We asked to be moved and got a better table looking out at the 18th hole. Very nice view.   The ambient noise, without music playing, made it hard to have a conversation. When the band started playing, forget conversations.    The menu was different.  We asked our server if the food was spicey.  She said it was not.  Guess she doesn't have any tastebuds.  Pretty much everything had \"a kick\" to it.  So, if you don't like spicey, this is not the restaurant for you.    Service was SLOW!   We got apologies from staff, but with reservations of a 16 person party, the staffing should have been adjusted so the rest of the diners weren't put on hold.    Most likely won't be going back any time soon."}
{"text":"So good! I had lunch here and the food was great. The restaurant is beautiful and the views of the golf course are lovely! We started with a couple of sushi rolls. The Seared Salmon roll was smokey goodness (avocado, crab, masago, tamago and bonito flake)! We also had the Angry Tuna (chipotle rouille, spicy tuna, cucumber, avocado and sesame) which was really great too. Everything was very fresh and beautifully presented. (I love the metal chopsticks) For our mains we ordered salads. I had the Toro Chopped Salad and added chicken. This salad is good! They mix in chayote, fava beans, queso fresco, lots of panchetta, roasted corn and tortilla strips.  This is a fantastic restaurant in north Scottsdale if you are looking for great food and beautiful views."}
{"text":"Had a business meeting here yesterday and what a beautiful location to have lunch. The view is of a greener then green golf course, very serene setting and the interior tastefully decorated in Southwest style.   As far as food is concerned, since I was here for a meeting, I couldn't really order a ton of things to try out so I just did the lunch special of carnitas taco with avocado and mango salsa that came with the steak fries. Carnitas came out flavorful, plate was hot to the touch, salsa was nice and had a good kick. Can't wait for my next visit."}
{"text":"We had a group of 24 in the private dining room and chose the Big Bull Plated Dinner from the private dining menu. I'll start with the positives: 1. The service was excellent. Each course was presented quickly (almost too quickly), and our server was excellent. 2. The atmosphere is very pleasant though the private dining room isn't really private as it opens directly to the public dining area. 3. The presentation of each course was very appealing to the eye. 4. The ribeye served with the main course was perfectly medium rare. Now the negatives: 1. The meal was very expensive ($114 per person when service charge and sales tax added). The 24% service charge was excessive. 2. The starter portions were small. Served family style, the portions allowed for one corn empinada, one small scallop. 3. The Mexican Campfire Snapper main course was unimpressive and underseasoned. 4. The Tre Leche desert was bland and visually unappealing. 5. The main course was not served hot enough. Under temperature fish is very undesireable.  Overall, only average review. For the price paid, I would have expected better. It wasn't bad but no wow factor."}
{"text":"This was absolutely one of the best overall experiences. The food was excellent but the service made everything stand out that much more. Chris our server is the epitome of the word service . The food is always important but the quality of service surpasses that any day of the week . Chris was knowledgeable, friendly , and most of all he has fun and he took us along for the ride. He is a huge asset to Toro and they should do their best to keep him around. Oh and make sure to order the Bomba desert !!!"}
{"text":"I was thrilled by the experience and would go here weekly if I lived in Scottsdale. The staff was friendly and made the whole experience amazing. I wish I could remember the name of our waiter as he made the evening. He was attentive but not overbearing and his sense of humor was very entertaining.  The highlight of the evening was everything but 2 experiences stand out. This is a rum bar and I was not disappointed. I am a usual rum drinker but the waiters recommendation change my rum choice. Voodoo rum is now the rum of choice. The second amazing experience was the dessert.  This is an adventure you can not miss. The dessert is called the La Bamba. The presentation was plastic sheet on table and slam the dessert down and yell 'La Bamba'. Combination of chocolate,gelato,cake chocolate syrup and on and on.  It was perfect for 6 people. I still think we should have ordered 2. Everything on the menu was a hit. Go and have an amazing time."}
{"text":"My first time will definitely not be my last. I came to Toro for breakfast and couldn't have been happier with my decision. The interior decor is beautiful but nothing compares to the view through the large glass windows. We sat at the patio overlooking the golf course which reminded me once again how beautiful Arizona is. The waiter Arnoldo created an inviting atmosphere with his vibrant personality, which set the tone for our meals. I choose the Benedict and may I just tell you it was to die for. I cannot say enough great things about this restaurant nor can I wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Have been a long time customer of the TPC Grill so was anxious to try out the new Latin concept.  Richie Sandoval's menu is delicious and unique.  Everything we had at lunch was great.  Wonderful salads and sandwiches.  Even the ketchup is different. As always the golf course and mountain views are beautiful.  Only thing that keeps me from giving the place 5 stars has nothing to do with the food.  I can't wait to try all the different entrees.  It is the staff that needs a little fine tuning.  Hostess seemed in the dark as to the style of food.  No offer of a dessert menu, water glasses not refilled. Maybe the staff just  needs a little more training.  I will tell all my friends about the new menu.  Great job Senor Sandoval."}
{"text":"This restaurant has an amazing view and overall ambiance. It sits on the edge of the TPC Scottsdale. Inside there is a beautiful, modern sushi bar, a fire place and space for live performers.    Unfortunately it rained the night we went, so we couldn't sit outside. But the outer patio is stunning.  The sushi is deliciously different. The surf & turf sushi roll is the most unique roll I have ever tasted. Don't let the NY steak discourage you. You MUST try it!"}
{"text":"Where do I begin!  Cailee (sp?) the bartender was extremely knowledgeable about the rum they carried (this is a rum bar after all!) and went above and beyond when it came to service- same goes for the manager, Clayton.  That alone would have warranted a 5 star review.  But the food was also amazing!  We had the red snapper and the scallops and pork belly- phenomenal!!  What an amazing experience.  We will be back!"}
{"text":"I had two hours to pass this afternoon while my other half played the front nine at the TPC Scottsdale's Stadium Course (riding along for the back 9), so I stepped in to Toro for lunch. Seated on the patio overlooking the 18th green (beautiful view) and my server Cheyenne took over. She set me up with a watermelon caipirinha and the Cubano sandwich with a side salad.   I was in no hurry, and neither was Cheyenne. She was attentive, but never hurried me. The meal was delicious, the cocktails even more so, and the ambiance was without parallel. Nice job all around, and an awesome afternoon!"}
{"text":"Every thing I had here was SO delicious.  Friendly host, server and OMG super quick service!  Appetizers were: mac n cheese w/ pork belly... need I say more. holy moly. fuck, i want it now!  We also had the ceviche which was amazing.. good texture, good heat, good in my belly.  Entree: Pork Belly & Scallops: we were SOOO full from the apps that I finished only 2/3 of my dish and I literally felt like an ungrateful asshole leaving 2 whole scallops and pork belly pieces.  I wish I could've taken it back to our hotel room but we were seriously SO stuffed we couldnt; even look at it any longer.  One thing: the slicked snap peas on this dish just did not really play well in my mouth with the rest of the dish.. it didn't belong.. at all.  and I love snap peas.. but keep them the eff away from my scallops and pork belly and polenta!  Drunky drinks: I had this amazing sipping rum that elevated my evening.  I asked the server to recommend a sipping dark rum from Dominican Republic (where I last had the most amazing sipping rum) and he delivered the most magical glass of rum.  Kudos young man for knowing your shit.  I would TOTALLY come back to this place as it left a warm spot in my heart with zero disappointments!"}
{"text":"I was here for brunch today and loved it for so many reasons..the food was excellent and great atmosphere. My server seemed personable and to be very familiar about the bar drinks (which since a bar as well, I'm sure many appreciate). My only reason not 5 stars is the eggs benedict comes automatically with a side of potatoes (but the description didn't say that) and so I ordered a side of potatoes so when came out it came with the normal potatoes plus an extra side. You'd think the server (if didn't know it came that way or just forgot to ask) would have asked at that time about it being okay (being it's kind of odd ordering so many potatoes). Nope. And no one asked during our meal \"how is everything?\" to be able to point out the weird situation. I'd have to run and get somebody to say something. Then someone else clearing the plates took the clearly fully untouched potatoes from the table without a glance or asking \"Was there anything wrong with this? Was everything okay with you?\" It was so odd. The servers need to at least ask \"how is your food?\" and those clearing the table if something is obviously completely untouched have the sense to say \"was this okay for you?\" or \"Did you want something different?\" So because of that I was disappointed with the waitstaff. But other than that the food was great and enjoyed the ambiance too."}
{"text":"Service was extremely spotty. Bus help seemed a little ticked off to be working, our waitress was enthusiastic but not very attentive. Given that the restaurant wasn't that busy, and that she seemed so enthusiastic, the inattentiveness was a surprise. Drinks were ordered but then she forgot to pick them up for 25 minutes or so. Interesting cocktail menu, and a nice assortment of runs, beers and wine.   Food was tasty, but as inventive as the granite plank presentation might be, it makes a mess as you try to cut into your food and the usual sliding around of food on your plate. Lost the planks and buy some dishes. The skirt steak I had was delicious, what there was of it. For $39  I expect more than 4-5 ounces of meat. The tuna ceviche was good & shrimp ceviche outstanding, although I think the seafood should be diced or at least cut into smaller pieces. Salmon excellent, as was the snapper. The ribs were good, but could have used a bit more sauce."}
{"text":"Two stars for the view and service. Food is strictly average, and really not worth the price."}
{"text":"Every time I go to this place I eat the skirt steak with churros sauce I love it!! Service is great the ambience is chic warm with plenty of view of the golf course. Place is great for special occasions & large groups but it could get very pricy so watch what you order. Last time we went it was 4 of us we ended up paying almost $700 that I thought was ridiculous."}
{"text":"Maybe an off night, but our server never checked in with us after our entree's. Both my husband and I were wanting to order drinks and never saw our server. A employee came over and asked if we were ready for our check.  Then we saw our waiter again. I would most likely not come back again."}
{"text":"Come for the rum, stay for the second, third and fourth rums. If you have a bad meal here, it is your fault. Incredible food, attentive service, and the view. My god, the view."}
{"text":"This restaurant  has a great view of the golf course through panoramic windows. The intimate ambience is great for date night. Entrees are remarkable looking as well as flavor is Amazing. Definitely a great place to feel special and well taken care of. Service is top tier. A great restaurant to go to again and again. Love this place!"}
{"text":"Took advantage of lower summertime greens fees to play TPC Scottsdale Stadium Course and stopped in , after the round, for lunch.  Superb service. Wonderful food. Comfortable setting.  We enjoyed two sushi rolls, as an appetizer.  Cuban Sandwich and Chafi Style Fried Rice were the two items chosen from the diverse menu. Both were delicious. One blueberry mojito and one local beer, along with the required life-giving water, helped to quench our thirst.  Our table afforded us a view of the 18th green and approach fairway.  Not a bad way to spend a Tuesday, in June."}
{"text":"We were staying at the Fairmont and took the shuttle over on a Saturday night.  Love the atmosphere and they had live music.  Service was incredible.  The food was really tasty.  We had the scallops (which were overcooked but great flavor), sushi rolls, and the burrata watermelon salad- which was our favorite!  We just got engaged so they gave us dessert to celebrate.  Delicious rum drinks, too!  We will be back!"}
{"text":"The ratings for this restaurant (3.5 stars at the time of me writing this review) provide an interesting case study on how a few 1 and 2 star reviews can drag down the average of a restaurant that most everyone regards as a gem. But enough with statistics and on to the restaurant... Great ambiance. Special, creative cuisine. Excellent service. Sean, a server there, is regarded as one of the best in the business. We were his regulars at the Salty Sow and started coming to Toro when he made the move and turned us on to it. Overall, the restaurant is creative and excellent at everything we've tried. So come looking for a culinary adventure and prepare to be amazed."}
{"text":"Tried this place tonight due to seeing it on groupon and I loved it. The staff was amazing, and our waitress was really sweet and accommodating. The food was good and the drinks were unique. Also, the sunset view was amazing. Overall great little romantic spot. Will go here again!"}
{"text":"Hello! ...Second Yelp reviewer here and they are not even 'officially' open yet!! If this was the 2nd week of their soft opening....WOW!...how can this be improved upon? Our entire dining experience was fabulous.   What does Scottsdale, AZ have in common with Dubai and Hong Kong? TORO.    We are staying at the Fairmont Princess so you can catch the complimentary Mercedes shuttle from the main portico at the hotel...it's only a mile or less to the restaurant.   It's Asian + South American fusion. And it rocks! Sushi + ceviche? Sashimi and lomo saltado? Why not?     As we perused the menu, we had a lovely visit from the Rum Princess (love that they have a Rum Princess in lieu of a sommelier) to help us navigate the extensive spirits selection.   Rather than narrow our choice down to two mains, we ordered five small plates/apps and ALL were terrific.  After ordering, a couple of warm, fabulous, cheesy rustic rolls appeared with a light and bright tomato/onion ...then to find out it is GLUTEN FREE, made with yuca flour - very HAPPY!!    We tried the hamachi toradito, lamb skewers, angry tuna roll, short rib flatbread and the steak tartare.   Now, if we were forced at gunpoint only to choose three of those again, we'd say that you CANNOT MISS the lamb skewers, steak tartare, and angry tuna roll.   Huh?   Yep. A sushi roll, and grilled skewer and a classically french dish...all at the same restaurant and all are standouts.    Nah - we'd probably just take the risk of the bullet and order them all again.   The flatbread with the pulled pork rib meat, manchego cheese, horseradish cream, caramelized onions...yum! The hamachi with sriracha...everything is better with sriracha.   GF? - you are in GREAT shape here. Tons of choices. Vegans, pescatarians, frugans, paleos, carnivores, finicky kids...I think you've found a happy place. There is something here for everyone and that includes foodies alike.     A wonderful Martin Codex albarino topped it all off...absolutely perfect. Here we are, ranting and raving about the food because that is the point of dining out - you do not notice the service because it was spot on and the ambiance (center bar with tv's for those wandering sports fans' eyes) was very complementary.        TIP: Food production was FAST. If ordering multiple small plates, order in waves so that they do not all arrive at once...or let your server know to stagger the order.   Great job, all you peeps at Toro! Good luck on your grand opening!!"}
{"text":"Toro did not disappoint.  When you call for reservations the phone is answered by the Scottsdale Princess Hotel.  I was not aware they were affiliated and it caught me off guard.  Ambiance was awesome with a beautiful view of the 18th green at TPC. I believe the interior of the restaurant has also been recently remodeled and it shows.  From the hostess to our waiter, service was top notch.  Our waiter, Shane, was incredibly knowledgeable of the drink and dining menu.  My impression of the menu was not so much \"latin\" as latin/asian fusion.  Love that new buzz word - makes me feel like the restaurant can't choose which way they want to go so \"fusion\"!!  Either way, the diner benefits as there are some creative options.  The local tomato salad is excellent (tomato, watermelon, burrata, hearts of palm, etc).  I had chorizo croquetts which were good and innovative, but slightly overdone.  Two of our diners had Achiote BBQ salmon that was accompanied with a achiote ponzu broth and thought it was the best salmon dish they ever had - a high compliment from them.  Another diner ordered Nikkei BBQ ribs and loved them.  They are sweet and sticky if you like your ribs prepared that way.  I ordered the Nikkei Lomo Saltado Wok (stir fried beef tenderloin) which was good but had a slighly tart flavor that I didn't care for.  My bad as Shane, our waiter, had told me it was prepared with oyster sauce and that some people found it tart.  The tenderloin was lovely, but there are so many interesting items on the menu that I would try something different next time.  My only complaint was as the restaurant got busy (on a Thursday night, good for them in slow season) our waiter got busy with other tables, our dessert order was never delivered and we finally cancelled it.  Would I come back, you bet!!"}
{"text":"Didn't know it has the largest rum selection in AZ!  Great scene, 3-piece live band and friendly staff.  Smoked whitefish tacos were great, but the empanadas were the best!  Will definitely come back."}
{"text":"The  view was beautiful at sunset on the golf course. There was a live bad and our server was very attentive. The food was very flavorful, perfect portions. I highly recommend the bomba dessert, yummy gelato in a chocolate bowl with edible flowers."}
{"text":"I brought a client and his wife to Toro while they were visiting AZ for wedding.  I love the renovation they have made to the space and the views of the golf course and mountains are incredible.  We enjoyed a glass of wine and I enjoyed the beef tenderloin stir fry - it was quite tasty, but very salty.  They certainly have a nice menu and the improvements I'm sure have been a success for this space."}
{"text":"This place was amazing. The view was fantastic and the service was spectacular. Was thrown for a loop by the menu. Toro is categorized as a Latin American restaurant. Maybe I'm not to well versed on Latin cuisine but there was sushi and stir fry on the menu???"}
{"text":"Staying at the Fairmont, free shuttle brought us to this magical place on the golf course. Sat at the bar for a late lunch. Ordered the chifa-style fried rice (so good) and an off-menu sushi roll we spotted the chef making for staff; he generously offered to make us one as well. Very high quality ingredients. Extensive rum menu; mai tai was a bit on the sweet side, but traditional daiquiri up (made with aged rum) was on point. Will definitely try to return before heading back east."}
{"text":"I'm torn on this place. The steak my boyfriend had was amazing! I ordered the sea bass ceviche and I couldn't eat it!!! The mustard sauce was sooo overpowering!! But what really got to me.... the ceviche came out first as an appetizer. We clearly said as a meal.... and I ate 2 bites and the bartender never asked me if I liked it or not... so for a pricey place I'd expect better service. So I'll try it again but not on my list of places I'd recommend for now"}
{"text":"We had a surprisingly delicious meal at Toro and look forward to dining there again. The portions were generous and the food was as good as it looked when presented. This is a gen."}
{"text":"I note at the time of this review this restaurant is newly opened and still might be working things on the menu out.  First of all maybe the most useful information needed is that you must use the address posted on Yelp and not the Fairmont Princess Address posted on the Toro Website or you will be in a mess and will have to use the Fairmont Shuttle Bus that may or may not be running to get to the Toro Restaurant and Rum Bar.  When we finally found this restaurant sort of hidden in the Fairmont Golf Course we found that it didn't have a sign. You will know your in the right place when you see the bottles of rum and restaurant tables.  The interior of the restaurant is very slick and modern with a big sushi/ceviche bar in the middle of the room.  We decided to sit on the patio with lovely views of the golf course and the McDowel Mountain Range.  The menu is Pan Latin Cuisine. We were told the menu is mostly Peruvian with flavors but blended with Asian too.   This restaurant features a rum bar but I didn't partake in alcohol and had Iced Tea and water instead. The restaurant could use more filtration as the water had an off taste I didn't like.  We started with the Angry Tuna Roll. It was made with quality Tuna that was delicious. I liked that they dotted each piece with actual wasabi sauce. The tuna really was spicy and the rolls sat on some sort of Thai Chili Sauce. The Angry Tuna Roll was really very good.   For me what wasn't as well received as the Tuna Roll was the Chicken Soup (Caldo De Pollo). It was presented to us as cold pulled chicken in a bowl with some rice and a little bit of something like pico and a little pitcher of warm water laced with a little bit of chicken flavor that you pour on. This soup was very weak in flavor. TO BE FAIR as possible I do think maybe the soup might have had more flavor if the liquid was hot enough to bloom whatever was in the bowl and maybe you might get a better tasting soup than I got. The waiter asked us how it was when we were finished with it and my husband told the waiter the soup was very bland. The waiter thanked us for the imput.  We also shared the Lomo Sactado. It was delicious and made with Medium Rare  (almost too close to rare for me) Tenderloin and Crispy Fries as promised. It was really a very tasty Stir Fry in a Soy Jus. The tomatoes and onions just tied it together. I do think they should ask you how you want the meat cooked in this dish. I'm OK on a tenderloin with M/R but not everyone is.  The kitchen was very good about splitting our plates for us.  I really want to give this new place 3.5 stars but if I have to decide between 3 and 4 I'm closer to three stars on this one mostly because of the Weak Chicken Soup, the very high prices on the iced tea and soda ($5.or a small glass of soda) and the rest already mentioned.  3.5 stars"}
{"text":"I've eaten at Toro for a nice dinner and also for brunch. This is a really great place. The food is interesting and tasty, the service is friendly, and the drinks are fabulous. The many large windows give a great view of the green fairways of the TPC golf course. Toro has a nice balance of being luxurious but also casual."}
{"text":"Absolutely great experience...from the ambience with live Cuban music on a Saturday night...to the great cocktails...to the fresh take on sushi..and absolutely incredible entrees...  Granted, it is \"resort-priced\", but I would come back time and again.  Loved it."}
{"text":"If you have the Groupon, please make sure to let the waiter know in advance. It didn't state anywhere on the Groupon that it was for a different menu, so for our group of 4 we ordered the 4 appetizers, 4 entrees, and 4 drinks. I even called ahead to verify because I had read online somewhere that the menu for the Groupon was different. The woman I spoke to on the phone confirmed it was the regular menu and we just had to stay within the value of the Groupon when we ordered. 3 of us got steaks with sides, figuring anything over the Groupon we'd just pay, no big deal. We were too stuffed for dessert, but to my surprise when I tried to use my Groupon I was told at that point I could not use it. When I mentioned I called ahead our waiter (who was great by the way) talked to his manager and they took the $170 off the bill. We still had to pay over $200 dollars for this meal, meaning the original bill was close to $400 for 4 people having only one drink each and no dessert. Two of the three steaks were not cooked correctly, my husbands was charred. The only reason he didn't send it back was because we thought we were going to use the Groupon and for that value it wasn't worth it. For a 50 dollar medium rare steak, that is unacceptable. Appetizers were delicious but for the price the entrees were severely disappointing. The menu makes it seem like the steak doesn't come with any sides. After you order sides (which are 10 dollars each) and the steak comes out, it does come with a potato. If you don't know this and I don't know why you ever would, you order sides you don't need and will probably be too full to eat. Totally deceptive. Drinks were very good. View was gorgeous and service was great but feel completely ripped off, definitely won't be back there unless it's just for drinks and apps but to be honest, I'm so put off by this place I'd rather go somewhere else where I don't feel conned."}
{"text":"Wow! So happy that this gem is so close to us! Ambiance was great we absolutely loved the live music, just perfect not too loud. My husband usually refuses to go to restaurants with live music but he really enjoyed himself here. Our server Chris truly made our experience, he has such a passion for his job and clearly for life. He was very knowledgable about everything on the menu, I don't think our experience would've been the same without his guidance.The views of the mountains and golf course were amazing from the window tables. We were extremely pleased with the food. I ordered the tomato salad and angry tuna roll, my husband the skirt steak and fried rice which I literally just finished in bed bc I couldn't wait until tomorrow. Bottom line, we will be back. We had a wonderful date night. Many Thanks to Chris and the rest of the Toro team!"}
{"text":"This place is fantastic.  I met a friend here for lunch and had no idea what to expect.    It's in a golf course club house and has a great patio with a scenic view.  The bar has a really nice look and the dining area is open and modern.  I had the Ahi Tuna salad and it blew my mind.  At this point in life it's rare for me to find a dish that really stops me in my tracks the way this one did.  The fish and avacado was delicious and the dressing was fantastic.    This spot is nearly an hour from my house but might be worth the drive to get this dish again.  For sure worth a stop if you're in the area."}
{"text":"Beautiful place to catch the sunset.  Amazing drink menu and friendly staff. Get the angry tuna role, brilliant!"}
{"text":"A big shout to the Toro family. You take care and treat everyone with excellence. Make sure Dean and Chris help you with the delicious and well prepared food decisions. They provide excellent service."}
{"text":"Looking for new seafood restaurant to try, and this one came up on yelp.  It is located inside the TPC club house.  The view from the restaurant is beautiful, especially now, a little over month away from the PGA tournament, the green was at the perfect condition.  Service was great. We had our server, but there were two other servers helped us with bringing food and refilling drinks.  I had artichoke Atlantic salmon lunch. Salmon was very thick and juicy.  Sauce they poured on top complimented the salmon and mushrooms. They used really good quality salmon and I enjoyed every bite of it.  They offered three different desert the day I went. I decided to try their vanilla pudding.  It was overly sweet, and fresh fruit mixed well with the pudding.  Espresso was really good as well. It complemented the desert and was nice way to end a great lunch.  Since the view was very nice, I would like to come back for early dinner during sunset."}
{"text":"Awesome time here on a recent visit to Scottsdale.  We had a fabulous view of the golf course, and received great service in helping us find some vegetarian options.  Their plantain chips (not listed on menu), btw, are an awesome choice to accompany the mojitos, strawberry lemonade and other delicious beverages there.   The corn empanadas and guac are not to be missed here.  Everything we sampled was good, and the service made this visit a very positive experience.  We will definitely go again when we are in the area."}
{"text":"We celebrated our Anniversary here. We sat in the patio Overlooking the 18th hole on TPC.  It was a beautiful night and the service and food were simply wonderful. We will be back again!"}
{"text":"It's been a couple of weeks since my first Toro experience but I continue to think about what an amazing meal my family enjoyed, and I cannot wait to return!  My parents wanted to take my husband out for his birthday, and he chose Toro to mix it up from our usual steak house celebrations.  He was the only one that had dined at Toro before, and he talked it up so much that we all went in with high expectations.  It did not disappoint... from the warm greeting and prompt seating to the fun atmosphere and of course the amazing food and drinks, everyone enjoyed it and left with a full belly!  We really did love everything we ordered.  Sushi in the Valley may not have a great reputation, but Toro does it well.  Ceviche too!  And if you have meat eaters in your party, the Churrasco Platter is a must.  The entire menu is appealing, so our party of five had to stop there, but all of the Chef's Specialties also sounded exceptional.  One thing to note... save room for dessert, especially if you are celebrating something!  \"La Bomba\" is the way to go.  Don't ask -- just order!  Bon appetit!"}
{"text":"The food was outstanding and had choices for all of us including our vegeterian.  Our server, Chris was charming,knowledgeable and a real pro.  And he had great wine skills. Definitely a hidden gem and a must try.  We will be back."}
{"text":"The one thing I want to emphasize about this restaurant is the 5 star service. From the moment we walked in we felt super welcome. Hostesses, servers, and all staff were all flying around making the experience priceless. Water was always filled and the menu was explained in a detailed and professional manner. The food was top notch. The boneless rib eye comes with sauces that are all killer! Food was all very flavorful and excellent. Will be back we want to try everything on the menu!"}
{"text":"I love this restaurant, and am there quite a bit and it should be a 5 star estblishment. The service is great and the food is fantastic, but it has been the same menu since they opened the doors 2 years ago. Noting has changed, not even the cocktails or appetizers.. It seems like this restaurant is the \"forgotten\" child of the creator and chef who also owns La Hacienda. I know that there has to be other dishes out there that fit this type of cuisine.  It is sad that not more is done to keep it new and fresh, maybe seasonally changing the menu offering. Also on a side note make sure you pace your food order and order your cocktails first then the appetizers and after you are done with those the main course or know you will be done with your dining experience in under 45 minutes, again not what I would expect from an upscale offering as Toro strives to be. I will call ahead next time to see if the menus has changed before I will go back."}
{"text":"The best meal I had in Scottsdale, by far. Great service, beautiful surroundings. The only thing that could have been improved was the bus service back to the resort, which was deplorably slow.   Appetizers:  Calamari - really excellent, breaded pretty lightly  Nacho Trio - beautiful trio of really distinct sauces   Entrees:  Angry Tuna Roll - really, really delicious; great blend of flavors  Salmon - DELICIOUS words cannot describe.   Dessert:  Chocolate Cake - get it. less like chocolate cake with caramel icing, more like straight up chocolate fudge with layers of caramel.  Pumpkin donuts - okay; a weirdly tiny portion compared to our gargantuan slice of cake."}
{"text":"Great food, great service. Skirt steak, pork shank, rainbow roll and amazing calamari. Came tonight for my parents birthdays. Estevan was awesome. It was just a great night and I was so happy to treat them to such a great meal!"}
{"text":"one star for no lunch menu on a saturday, and an uninspired club sandwich.  yuck.  I could get better at Arbys.  Its 93 degrees out, i dont want Benedict at 12:30.  Edited:  Excellent service.  Gracious staff.  Still though, horrible club sandwich and awful weekend menu."}
{"text":"Not a good experience. We were seated at a wonderful window table and waited about 15 minutes and no server came to our table. We witnessed servers waiting on tables all around us, and not one of them came to our table. The restaurant wasn't even that crowded. A gentleman just being seated behind us was greeted almost immediately by a server who took his drink order. One shouldn't have to speak up in situations like this. It's best to walk out and they will get the message. That's just what we did. We explained to the hostess on our way out why we were leaving, and she was noticeably concerned. Not worth a return visit from us. There are plenty of other good places to eat in the area"}
{"text":"Food was amazing in every way. The menu has a lot of fun, new options to tantalize your tongue and make you want more. We ordered a ton of food and everything came promptly. The edamame was not as flavorful as we expected so the chef sent another one, free of charge, that was much more in line with the description. When we had service it was great. The water boys quickly and often refilled our glasses. I cannot give it five stars but they're so close. When we arrived we were early. No big deal, we gladly waited. Once seated it took a good 15 minutes before our drink orders were taken, but by that time we were ready to order, yet not offered to order. Drinks came and then we were asked if we wanted starters. So we ordered those. Over 45 minutes later or dinner order was finally taken. I understand this is s fine dining experience meant to be spread out over time. What I don't understand is why we couldn't order and then they pace the meal. It was awkward eating and passing our appetizers while holding their big menu. Twice I ordered a coke after my cocktail and twice it was never delivered. When our entrees arrived they were all plated differently even when having the same dish. The small, rectangle wood platter was too small for my entree so food kept falling off. My mothers dinner was served on a tiny flat metal dish with no edges. Just kind of weird. They did provide an amazing dessert for my husbands birthday but never brought the coffee ordered twice. Yes, twice again. They did comp our cocktails for the poor service, which we never complained about once. We could never find our server when needed. Overall I'd go back but knowing service is challenging ."}
{"text":"Food was great, but the service sucked. Our reservation for 10 people was set for 7:30pm, however we didn't eat until 9pm. That aside, everything that we ate was amazing, I would highly recommend the Fried Rice and the Chicken."}
{"text":"Toro is delicious! The Food was amazing, the drink choices were great, and the service was top-notch! My girlfriend and I enjoyed our Valentines Day dinner at Toro and it was as good as it gets  I had the Asado Negro, the rib was falling off the bone and super flavorful and the avocado relish was a perfect addition to the rest of the meal. My girlfriend had the Nikkei BBQ ribs and they were perfectly tender!  The staff was very attentive! The GM, Miljan, definitely made sure this was a Valentines dinner to remember."}
{"text":"We had an amazing evening. The food was out of this world. Clayton, the assistant manager, helped us with just about everything. The lobster was fantastic and the black cod was delightful. My short rib was great but it gets better... The desert was inspired by the artist Jackson Pollock. In the middle of our table... imagine a canvas. Clayton presented a bowl of assorted berries, gelatos and ice creams.  He took his bowl, not just any bowl, but a ball made completely of chocolate, raised it about 24 inches off the table and then dropped it up on the canvas. Finishing everything with three different sauces. OK I know words can't describe it, so just go and ask for the amazing bowl of ice cream."}
{"text":"I ordered the fried rice and it was amazing compliments to the chef on the wok but I had an issue with my drinks later into the night and the general manger did nothing to compensate my troubles, in fact he came off kind of disrespectful, I recommend going here for the food but watch out for the general manager if you have a problem, other than that the server and food was great!"}
{"text":"GROSS! We got a stir fry with steak and rice... the rice was over cooked, it honestly tasted like a frozen meal that was just taken out of the microwave.. and to top it off they put a pile of French fries on the top of the stir fry.. French fires and stir fry definitely do not mix.. not sure where they got that idea from?  Lastly,  I have no problems spending a decent amount of money on a good margarita... Their drinks were small, mostly ice, extremely weak and $17.... noope. Won't be returning."}
{"text":"We bought a Groupon for the Fairmont Scottsdale Princess Resort. Toro is a restaurant that's part of the resort and we decided to go there for our anniversary celebration. It was a great dinner!! Ryan ordered a snapper entree; I got a side of pork belly mac and cheese and the pork belly and scallops entree over a creamy polenta. The pork belly and scallops were tender beyond belief and the polenta, which I've never had before, was creamy, flavorful and light. Ended up boxing the mac n cheese to go, but the sauce on it was very rich and delicious. out shall be the hubbys lunch for tomorrow but i enjoyed my bites of it. I had to save room for dessert!   The service was incredible -- the waitress was very attentive but the best service of the night came from the assistant! My glass of water never went below half-full and our dishes were always taken off the table the moment they were done. We ordered a Peruvian hazelnut chocolate Crunch cake to top off the fantastic meal and they ended up giving it to us on the house.   We definitely enjoyed our anniversary meal! Thank you, Toro!"}
{"text":"Had a minor hiccup but then manager made it right. Service was great. Food was excellent and desert was fun.  Sergio was an excellent waiter and the staff was nice and professional. Great atmosphere and excellent view. Live band. Just a nice place to unwind and forget for a bit.  The manager was great. Five Stars"}
{"text":"This was, by far, my favorite meal during our most recent trip to Scottsdale. We typically stay at the Fairmont Princess when we come in town, so my review could be a little skewed since I usually end up at restaurants close to (or inside) the Fairmont several nights in a row.  Toro is not in the immediate vicinity of the Fairmont, so we grabbed a little resort bus to the spot. First of all, the sunsets at Toro are AMAZING! If you're looking for good scenery during an early evening meal, look no further than this restaurant.   Second, the sushi rolls were FANTASTIC! The tuna in my angry tuna roll was some of the freshest tuna I've tasted in a very long time. The roll was excellent. And the Havana roll.... Oh. My. Goodness. It was SO DELICIOUS! This particular roll is probably one of the top five sushi rolls I've ever had in my life. I eat sushi about once a week, so that could be saying something. I don't know if it was the interesting+unique combination of flavors or the fact that it was so incredibly fresh, but I just absolutely loved this roll.  The mac and cheese was also scrumptious!!! I'd certainly recommend it as a side item to compliment your main dishes. The drinks were super tasty as well.  Overall, this was an excellent restaurant that totally blew my expectations out of the water. I can't wait to come back to Toro the next time that I'm in town!"}
{"text":"Went for a late lunch. There was a dj. I can see how that would be cool for some people. It wasn't for me. As for the lunch it was fine. I had a club sandwich and fries. Both were very serviceable. Staying at the princess hotel, which this is affiliated, if I had time and I already ate at the other restaurant I'd go off campus. That's me. I don't need to feel like I'm in the club while eating my club.   This is a rum bar tapas sushi Latin restaurant so they likely have something for you. I guess. Average it was. Enjoy"}
{"text":"We came here for the Christmas at the Princess display that runs from 5-10p during the holidays.  If you eat here and spend at least $75, you get valet parking ($55 per car) and a wristband for the rides for free ($10 per person but free with valet parking).   We had six people in two cars so I figured eating here would be a good deal with the xmas display as entertainment afterwards.   I made reservations for 6 on open table and was told they were fully committed until 830p when I tried to add two people.  However, the restaurant was half empty, including two adjacent tables (minus one star).    While you valet at the Fairmont, you have to take a shuttle to the restaurant, which is a mile down.  It was not bad and we didn't wait for the shuttle (tell your server when you get your check you need the shuttle). The driver, Warren, was very nice.    We were seated at the far end of the restaurant in the crappy side room with no view.  There were plenty of other better tables but since they told me they were \"fully committed\" I didn't ask for a better table.   The appetizers were ok.  Croquettes and lamb skewers were good and the angry sushi roll and hamachi were ok.  Nothing to come back for.  They didn't even give us enough chopsticks (3 sets of chopsticks for 6 Asian persons!).  The snapper was a meager appetizer portion and was pretty bland and tortillas were soggy and cold.  It was close to $30 and wasn't worth it. The pork belly was overcooked and the scallops were ok. The Mac and cheese was the best dish along with the complimentary cheese bread.  The side of Brussel sprouts was sour.  (minus another star for the lackluster food).   My Moscow mule was ok.  It was also $15.  But at least it was in a proper copper mug, right?  The waitress was ok but her Mexican snapper recommendation was a flop.  The bussing service was a bit rushed and disorganized when clearing the table - they were either too fast or aggressive or appetizer dishes piled up.    The only reason why we are here was bc the other restaurant was booked and now I can see why.  The food was disjointed and lacked basic technique.  The service is what you would expect from Red Robin but not the Fairmont.  I will not be back."}
{"text":"I would have given this place a 4 or 5 had it not been for the worst and downright rude treatment by the manager. He started well, even asked the band to sing happy birthday to our party. It was at the end of the dinner when he verbally attacked me. I had asked the waitress for the check a couple times because we were rushing to see the fire works. It was app. 10-15 later when I decided to approach our waitress to see if I could have her charge our meal to our room.   Well, I couldn't even utter a work before the manager stopped me and started mouthing off on me. He was like \"miss, listen to me, it's not easy to break out the meals' and on and on. He said we didn't inform the waitress that we needed split check - not until the service has started. Which was an utter lie because that was the very first thing we told her before we ordered! He seriously did not even allow me to say what I wanted to say and would cut me off before I could say a word. The waitress finally gave us our check and I started to talk to her when he littered shoved his face in front of me and said 'miss I'm right here'!! I could have punched him in the face! I have not experienced such disrespectful and rude experience EVER!   As for our waitress, she was good. She serviced our large party with flawlessly. The fish we had was good. But food and experience will have to go hand in hand, especially when you are a high end restaurant. This restaurant need to train their manager better. I rather bring my money to other restaurants where I would not be treated rudely."}
{"text":"This was one of the best meals I have had all summer. I went here with my family to celebrate my grandmas 80th birthday and we had an amazing experience!  First of all, the ambience was wonderful with the pretty views of the golf course during a beautiful Arizona sunset. I loved looking out on the terrace that was decorated with pretty lights. There was also an amazing mariachi band playing throughout the night, and they even sang happy birthday to us at the end of the night!   The service was also outstanding. Our waiter was so helpful and made accommodations for my brother who is allergic to shrimp/shellfish.   The cuisine was wonderful - it is a Latin American restaurant but with what felt like a Japanese influence. The bread that they serve is gluten free and tasted amazing! It came with a homemade sweet pepper salsa that was great. We started out with two orders of really fresh and yummy tuna and shrimp ceviches. We had some awesome sushi rolls - the salmon and rainbow rolls were two favorites.   The best part of the meal was definitely the red snapper dish. It was completely to die for! It was definitely the best red snapper I've ever tasted if not the best fish. It was cooked perfectly and came with yummy flour tortillas and grilled veggies on side so you could make little tacos if you wanted!   And additionally the chocolate cake that we had at the end for my grandmas birthday was absolutely incredible!! One of the best cakes I've ever had. This was such an incredible meal and whenever I'm in Scottsdale again we will definitely be coming back."}
{"text":"The food was good and the service was good. My only complaints are that  (1) I purchased a Groupon for a price fixe dinner, which was not a great way to  try to food (as most of the creative items on the menu were not available for the price fixe dinner - in fact two of the entrees on the price fixe menu were not even on the regular menu - buying a Groupon was not a good way to try out the restaurant for the first itme (and not a great way for the restaurant to introduce itself to a new customer) and (2) an 18% tip was automatically charged, despite the fact that it didn't state that on the Groupon.  I didn't complain because the service was good; however, I prefer to decide the appropriate tip, based upon the service; if a mandatory tip/service charge is imposed, it should state that in the Groupon."}
{"text":"Great night both in service and food . Estevan was phenomenal as our server . First they brought a bread of sorts . It was made from Yucca, flour and mozzarella cheese ..and it came with a fresh light salsa with a hint of vinegar. The taste was fabulous! Next were the Rainbow Roll and calamari appetizers . Both great - the calamari came with the chipotle aioli and a ginger scallion sauce . Delicious. Extensive wine and rum menu .   For the main course we ordered Churrasco steak and the Pork shank with yucca fries . The steak came with 3 sauces- BBQ, horseradish and chimichurri sauce . Cooked to perfection and well spiced.   The pork shank came with light sauces - all added to the flavor of the meat. The shank was crispy on the outside and very flavorful. The meat fell off the bone .   The outside area was beautiful- great spot to catch an Arizona sunset. The area was spacious- not at all cramped . The staff were extremely courteous and very knowledgeable about the menu items .   Overall - perfect. Must try a dessert next time !"}
{"text":"Great place however I would suggest when making a reservation make sure you're talking to someone at the restaurant, not someone in the reservation department at the resort.  I made that mistake and supposedly reserved a table by the window .. which I would strongly suggest as the other tables are meh.  When we arrived they didn't have our table and wanted to seat us somewhere else ... I don't think so.  The hostess, who needs training, told us \"sorry, you didn't talk to me so you'll have to wait 30 minutes for a table by the window\"...I don't think so.  We were approached by several others and offered a free round of drinks which brought us to stay and sit at the bar for our drinks.  The service and attention was so good we stayed and ate some app's at the bar which were excellent!! The bar tender was good and the drinks poured well.  Good job management, we will be back.  I would suggest getting a table by the windows at sunset or just sit at the bar."}
{"text":"This restaurant is so much fun! The ambiance is just gorgeous. They have the most delicious cocktails, and unbelievable food & desert! I was so pleased. We started with tasty rum drinks along with a rum flight where we were educated about each rum and how it is made. I had an amazing ginger-miso cod as my entree.. it was extremely flavorful and cooked to perfection. For desert, we ordered a very unique item called \"la bomba\". It was a chocolate shell filled with fruit, a variety of ice cream and sorbets, and sponge cake. They drop the chocolate shell and the deliciousness just falls all over the table ! They then cover it with a variety of sauces.. the experience is just awesome! So much more than a dessert. This is the perfect date night restaurant. Very impressed!"}
{"text":"Drove here from northwest Phoenix to enjoy an outside lunch at a PGA tour stop. Really warm day but beautiful outside - we had the seating area to ourselves.  Server was very attentive and knowledgeable about the menu. I had the carnitas tacos with a salad as my side. Excellent salad - fresh greens and lightly dressed with garnishment that made it interesting. Tacos were a little spicy and also freshly made.  Good portion size for me but a guy could end up hungry .  My husband had the burger and fries-thumbs upon the burger but fries were disappointing.  Food presentation is visually appealing- menu is limited.  Like to have desert when on vacation occasionally but not here. Food is pricey but deserts are crazy expensive for lunch.  Seating offers a view of 18th hole only.  Glad we came but probably won't return."}
{"text":"Came here for breakfast and it was amazing! The service was outstanding. I had the breakfast burrito with potatoes. Delicious coffee too. My husband had the eggs Benedict and mimosa and he loved his as well. We sat outside and had a great view!"}
{"text":"Let me begin by saying the staff was great as was the service.   We had purchased this Groupon:  $89 for a prix fixe Latin dinner for two (up to $130 value)  Two appetizers (up to $28 value) Two entrees (up to $58 value) Two desserts (up to $20 value) One rum house cocktail, beer, or glass of wine per person (up to $24 value)  I mistakenly assumed that meant we could order off the main menu. That was not the case.  We were provided with a limited menu, which while good wasn't what I would have chosen. The restaurant is known for its \"SUVICHE\" yet none of those items were on the price fixe menu. This was disappointing.  We split the Mexican Snapper, perfectly prepared along with the chipotle ribs which were good. We started with a CESAR salad and their Toro salad. Both were good.  The Toro salads pork belly was very crisp and tasty. One thing to know: THEIR PORTIONS ARE VERY BIG.  While we enjoyed our meal, it didn't include items we would have preferred to try.    Scottsdale is a very rich food town.  There are so many great places to eat.  We probably won't be going back since we don't live here.  For the price it was a good value and the people who work there take really good care of you."}
{"text":"Fantastic experience!! Brandy was our server and was excellent. Food was spectacular as well. The manager Miljan stopped by to make sure everything was perfect. Definitely a great restaurant with high level of food and service."}
{"text":"Very eclectic fusion cuisine, fried rice especially good, nice rum tastings, angry tuna roll, everything good, with a nice ambiance and good service"}
{"text":"Gabby did a terrific job!  A great place to watch the Golfers come in off 18."}
{"text":"We had a large group of 29. The service was fantastic and the food was better. the vanilla caramel custard must be made of angel tears, so incredible! We were extremely impressed and the view wasn't too bad either!"}
{"text":"So disappointed. We had 8:30 reservations and we were treated like an afterthought.  Christmas Eve and get these people out of here. Food was ok but overpriced with very small portions. Luckily we were with good friends and the evening was still great."}
{"text":"Toro Latin is a new restaurant that occupies the space that was once the TPC Grille, overlooking the TPC golf course, and with a small outdoor patio that benefits from green grass, a lake in the background, and our beautiful Arizona sunsets.  The food and service have to compete with nature, and they both did so successfully on our visit.  Our group started with a couple of salads (the Toro Salad is huge), and the crunchy shrimp, all great especially the shrimp.  The filet was a fine cut of meat and perfectly done, served with three sauces, the best of which was the chimichurri. The salmon was a huge chunk with a great sear, and the snapper was perfectly done but maybe lacked something in flavor.  Prices are high -- this is a resort restaurant -- but not outrageous.  I'm pretty picky, but I really can't find anything wrong with Toro Latin.  But I'll be back to keep trying.  PostNote: Came back in February 2016.  Still can't find anything wrong.  Ribs also very good.  One small point - you can make reservations for sitting outside but they may not honor it when you get there, such as if a large party calls and takes the entire area."}
{"text":"Food was excellent: sushi, scallops, shrimp, sashimi, empanadas, RUM FLIGHT, topped  with LaBomba dessert flambé.   Most importantly Chris, our server, gave us 5 star service."}
{"text":"Really good food nice view but what made this experience even better was our waiter his name Arnoldo he's fun, energetic and full of life will definitely return thanks to him"}
{"text":"Went here with my girlfriend for happy hour. The drinks were so unique and great. We had enjoyed a few rum punches, fried calamari, carne asada and fish tacos. All very good quality. Smaller portions for the price and still seemed a bit hungry. All for about $60. Seemed a bit pricey even for happy for the amount of food received. Happy hour is only till 5. It should be extended a bit later. The vibe seems way more casual than the feel the feel they try to give off. People dressed right off the golf course. I think it's a bit overpriced for what you get and the ambiance. Server was also a little obnoxious and pushy about drinks and shots."}
{"text":"Great Food & Service! Ate here two nights in a row. Our server, Cheyenne, was the BEST we've had in a very long time!  The menu has lots of small plates and apps to share and servings are very ample. Some of our favorites were the ceviche mixto, Rainbow Roll and Shortrib. Other sushi rolls being delivered to other tables looked fantastic. We could do an all sushi dinner another time!  The Miso Black Cod melted in your mouth and the serving was entree sized and sat on a great stir-fry of vegetables and mushrooms.  The Chocolate Crunch cake was a satisfying finish!  Our first visit encounter a mis-step with the Beef Picanha we ordered. Even though we ordered it medium rare, it was very tough, although tasty. We actually sent it back and declined a refiring of it and it was taken off our tab. On our second visit, Cheyenne brought us a complimentary order of the dish and it was much better. We were very impressed with how she took the extra steps to make our experience an excellent one!"}
{"text":"Stopped by here for a in between meal after looking at some places in area and this is a wonderful environment!! Over 110 rum selection at the bar and a \"lite menu\" offered here with an amazing view!! Started with the calamari which was fried perfectly!! Then got the empanadas which had an amazing sauce that's spicy with it. Next was one of the best medium rare burgers I have ever had!! Must try!! Then got short rib nachos...would pass on that, short rib was a little well done and not tender and looked like a heart attack ready to happen...but the view was fantastic!!!!"}
{"text":"In Scottsdale for the weekend before heading to Sedona as part of a long overdue vacation and staying at the Fairmont Princess (great rate in summer heat and amazing spa for escaping the heat). I was going to return to Bourbon Steak because I had a superb dinner there last year but instead tried their newest restaurant, Toro which is their second Richard Sandoval place. It's in the clubhouse for the golf course of the Phoenix Open with a gorgeous view of the course - but more importantly, some really good food. Lots of ceviche and sushi with a latin twist and really hyper fresh flavors. They hit the heat just right and i loved all my dishes - really loved them. Also loved the enthusiastic and charming service and their \"Rum Princess who brought me a taste of a Chai Dessert Rum which I want bottles of. They have 110 Rums on their menu and do flights. Really great dinner - and if anyone knows where I can buy Smaks Chai Rum, let me know!"}
{"text":"Amazing view. Amazing cocktails. Food was just ok but it was a special Mother's Day brunch and I wasn't a huge fan. Loved the spot and cannot wait to go back. Excellent service."}
{"text":"This place is top notch. The sushi was excellent as was the service. Great upscale atmosphere and bar. This place isn't just for golfers. It's worth a night out."}
{"text":"Unique menu and an excellent meal.  We started with scallops and empanada.  The snapper was perfectly prepared with a seasoned rub.  The Chilean Pinot Noir was great. Try the Peruvian chocolate cake with berry sorbet.  Great service by Sean."}
{"text":"This place is fantastic!  Excellent views and great atmosphere.  Friendly and helpful/knowledgeable staff.  Food and drinks were excellent with extensive rum selection.  The best part is the freshness of the food.  We had the shrimp ceviche, calamari, and tuna roll.  All some of the best I've ever had.  Can't wait to come back!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, the food is wonderful! The staff is amazing. Thank you Andrew for the cookies. :)"}
{"text":"Went to Toro for the first time last night, and it was GREAT!  The friends who came with us have some dietary limitations, and we typically share dishes, which can be a challenge for restaurants that we visit.  The Toro staff handled us all without missing a beat; accommodating our friends while still giving all of us the full experience of every dish.  Everyone was very nice, and took good care of us, but the highlight of our night was Caitlin.   Known as the \"Rum Princess,\" (and how cool is that?), Caitlin is the reason we'll return to Toro.  She gave us outstanding food recommendations, perfect guidance on the rums, and generally made our night a great experience.  The food: get the fried rice!  No, stop telling me about your favorite fried rice at your favorite Asian restaurant, and just order it.  That and the short rib empanadas were \"I'll have that again\" dishes.   Also, the chocolate cake with dulce de leche layers between?  WOW!!!!  So good, and another definite for the next visit.   Go to Toro. Period.  Put yourself in Caitlin's hands.  You won't be disappointed.  I'll review an entrée next time (when I actually have one); regardless, I'm going back, and so should you."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant on a Friday evening . Walked in and requested a window table around 5:30 Was told they were all reserved, although we were the only ones there . Seated outside with heat lamps was fine . All of the food Was good , tried 6 small Plates in our hour plus time . Upon leaving inside of restaurant looked nice , with two people seated Anywhere in the restaurant . Will try it again  next year ."}
{"text":"Looking out on a beautiful view of the night sky and golf course, Toro provides an excellent dining experience and atmosphere. The drinks are excellent, if a little strong, and there are several unique drinks you are unlikely to see at other rum bars. They seem to have a wide menu, with a lot of variety and original choices: most notably, the latin-inspired sushi. The purist in me was hesitant to try it at first, but the Havana roll ended up to be quite the harmony of sweet and spicy, blurring the line between Latin and Asian flavors quite beautifully. The mango topping slips off, making it difficult to eat with chopsticks, but it is well worth the work. While Toro is slightly pricier than my usual choices, it is an excellent choice for a nicer occasion."}
{"text":"Awesome dinner! Liked it better than Burboun or La Hacienda. Waiter is very attentive and food was excellent. Cooked to perfection and right temperature."}
{"text":"Every time I go to this place I eat the skirt steak with churros sauce I love it!! Service is great the ambience is chic warm with plenty of view of the golf course. Place is great for special occasions & large groups but it could get very pricy so watch what you order. Last time we went it was 4 of us we ended up paying almost $700 that I thought was ridiculous."}
{"text":"After a round of golf at TPC Scottsdale, lunch at Toro Latin Restaurant was just as good as the course itself.  We sat outside and watched the 18th fairway and green.    I got the Cubano sandwich and salad.  Both were excellent.  Next time ask for very little dressing for the salad.  It was drenched in the dressed, but the dressing was fantastic.  My buddy go the Club sandwich and he said it was great.  It looked great.  The table next to us got the carnitas omelette and I was almost jealous that I didn't get that instead of the Cubano.  If interested in a Club sandwich, ask for 1/2 sandwich and salad.  The table next to us got that.  I will definitely come back."}
{"text":"This place is within walking distance of where I live. They allow dogs outdoors which appeals to me ..my dog is very quiet and small. I am a big fan of sushi and they did a fantastic job.  Great place or a bottle of wine and sit outside to enjoy the cooler weather. Very romantic and cozy place they have live music but close early ...check times before hand.  Some may think it's a little pricey but it is fantastic!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate here last night. The service was impeccable, everyone is really friendly and courteous. Chris our server was on it, everything he suggested was spot on. Right from the fresh bread they served, which was amazing, all the way to the appetizers and main courses. We sat outside to enjoy the TPC 18th, plus watching guys 3 putt made us laugh. I felt their pain."}
{"text":"Great atmosphere, great wait staff, (we had this guy Sean, he was arguably the most attentive, knowledgable server Ive ever had), and an awesome view of the golf course, too. Drink prices are a little high, but they do some serious work on them! It's well worth it; they always come out great. A wide selection of rum, and the food is exactly what you want for a date night - not to heavy, and not too messy. Overall, I'd highly recommend."}
{"text":"UPDATE: Just FYI fellow diners: I did get an email from a Toro \"manager\" after complaining to Groupon, and Groupon telling me that a \"manager\" would be in touch to \"make it right.\" The email consisted of something along the lines of \"thank you for contacting us, we will be happy to assist you with your reservation.\" OMG. In the end, Groupon was gracious and intelligent enough to give us a full credit. Lesson learned, please do not patronize this 'restaurant'."}
{"text":"I had breakfast here 2 days in a row.  The food is great and the views are amazing.  Next time you're going out for breakfast, up your game and come here instead of the usual breakfast joints in north scottsdale.   The price was super reasonable and its a beautiful setting to start your day!"}
{"text":"Interesting Latin fusion restaurant inside the TPC Scottsdale, home of the Phoenix Open Golf Tournament. Toro is a great place to unwind after a round of golf or day at the pool at the Fairmont Princess; you can sample the extensive rum menu and flight tastings at the bar or your table. Our family party of 12 was seated at a beautiful long table in a secluded back corner of the restaurant. We started with a variety of appetizers: the ancient grain salad ($16-healthy, light, and full of superfoods), tomato salad ($16-chunks of watermelon, tomato,avocado, and balsamic glaze), and Parmesan crusted sea scallops ($22 for three pieces). The suviche (sushi/ceviche) menu is unique and filling; each roll comes with 8 pieces and is priced between $16-$22. I recommend the Havana roll ($17), and you can't go wrong with the crunchy shrimp roll ($16) or sea bass ceviche dip and chips ($16). The chef's fried rice ($24) was a popular choice and came highly recommended. There is also a kids' menu with hamburgers, chicken fingers, fruit or fries. We were stuffed and skipped dessert, so be sure to save room! We had a great dinner and enjoyed the service--it was a nice way to spend our first night of vacation in Scottsdale!"}
{"text":"I had my birthday celebration here recently and I couldn't be happier.  The restaurant is gorgeous, food was amazing and the service was excellent! I ordered the Spanish mimosa and it's one of the mimosa I've had.  I don't really like champagne taste that much and this had a very subtle taste of champagne to it so it was perfect.  The calamari was perfectly fried and with fried peppers which gave it a nice kick to it.  I had the Cubano Sandwich and it was very good.  The bread was crispy, tender meat and nice tang from the pickles.  I'm definitely taking my husband here next time so I can try the ceviche and sushi. I highly recommend this place for a date or enjoy a delicious meal in a great ambiance."}
{"text":"I'll definitely be going back. The food was amazing. The atmosphere was nice and quiet. The only thing that kind of put me off was the way they require reservations to be seated inside."}
{"text":"We'd been wanting to try this place for a while, and given improving reviews, thought now was the time.  Well, as sometimes happens with places catering primarily to the tourists, there was some good and some bad.  First the good.  Our service was outstanding, waitress was very attentive and did her best to make our experience better.  The rum drinks were also excellently executed, flavorful and with ample but not overpowering rum.  The yucca cheese rolls were great, as was the short rib flatbread.  Here's the \"OK\".  Shrimp ceviche was good, about what you'd expect, but we needed  to ask for chips to eat it on.   The \"very popular\" red snapper dish was not a whole snapper as one review indicated, but a rather small fillet that while prepared well lacked in overall flavor and was a bit pricy for what you got.  Now the bad.  The slaw that accompanied the snapper was so salty I couldn't eat it.  The house special Toro salad was iceburg lettuce (really?), that was overdressed with a flavorless dressing, and also looked and tasted as if it had been made and dressed hours before leaving the lettuce limp and soggy.   Unfortunately the dessert they comped us to make up for the salad was also a miss.  It was billed as a custard, but came and was so soupy I would have never identified it as custard.  My husband hit it when he labeled it \"sweetened condensed milk straight from the can\".  So as I said hit and miss.  I might go back for drinks and apps, but not for dinner."}
{"text":"Had dinner here while staying at Fairmont Scottsdale Princess. Its one of the few restaurants within resort property that we got a lot of good recommendations from the staff to try out. If you are staying in the hotel theres a benz sprinter shuttle that will take you from the lobby straight to Toro. Id recommend to go here during sunset so you can see full views of the golf course. We had late dinner here so we couldnt really enjoy the views as it was dark out and the course had no lights. Overall food was good. The steaks were a little bland compared to Bourbon steakhouse but their ceviches  were the best! Service was fast too!"}
{"text":"Food is decent... If you sit on the patio, you get an amazing view of the golf course. I don't necessarily know if I will be back."}
{"text":"Sean was our waiter and was great! The ceviches were great, as was the pisco sour! Beautiful views. Try to get reservations on the patio for sure!"}
{"text":"One of my favorite spots in Scottsdale and the culinary variety of flavors is amazing!   From start to finish this is a very special experience."}
{"text":"A little pricey but very good. A group of us went to Toro for dinner; 4 of us in the group had a Groupon for the Prix Fixe menu. We sat outside and had a lovely view of the golf course. Our waitress Leslie was awesome and gave us great ideas on what to select on the menu along with the Rum Princess who helped the men with their rum flights. Some of the most memorable parts of the meal were the appetizers and dessert. We shared appetizers and had the Toro Salad, chorizo croquettes and crispy calamari, all delicious with our favorite being the calamari. For dinner 3 of us had the snapper which you could have like a fish taco, the seasoning was delicious along with a slaw and flour tortillas, not spicy but just a great combination of seasonings. The kids mac and cheese was very cheesy and rich, had a great blend of cheeses. The wok beef tenderloin was fabulous I tasted some of my mother's and couldn't stop eating it. It was a little unusual having white rice along with shoestring french fries but it works! For dessert we shared La Bomba which was offered on our prix fixe and it was quite an experience. It's perfect for a group. It had a delicious chocolate shell with several scoops of ice cream and home made syrups; the caramel was fabulous. The prix fixe came with a cocktail 2 of us had the classic daiquiri, very good and 2 had the rum mule which they also enjoyed. They have a great selection of rums and created a wonderful coffee drink for me with rum but I couldn't tell you everything they put in it since it was off the menu."}
{"text":"Know that feeling when everything clicks perfectly. when you visit a new restaurant for the first time.? The decor, the water glasses with a colorful swirl, the beautiful flatware, the view from the veranda, all set you up for wonderful food & service.  This is one of those places. Simple, elegant, with sumptuous food (we had the breakfast burrito) and great service from Melissa.  Why so good? Astonishingly fresh ingredients, like the poblano peppers and wild mushrooms, incredible salsa, beautiful plating and the most perfectly cooked potato I have ever tasted. High high recommendation. I dine out all the time.  Superb!"}
{"text":"Went in with high hopes for our date night after reading the reviews and looking up the menu online. Unfortunately the food just wasn't amazing, especially for the price.   Beautiful decor and ambience. We went at night so we didn't get to see the green grass and golf course but I can imagine it's impressive during the day. Service was also great and our waiter did a good job engaging with us and provided his personal favorite dishes as well.   Unfortunately, the taste of the food wasn't as spectacular as the ambience. We ordered two Sushi rolls - the angry tuna roll and the seared salmon roll. At first I liked the seared salmon roll the best because of its unique flavor. After a few bites, the smokiness of the chipotle aioli became a bit too overpowering for me. I did really enjoy the angry tuna roll. We split the snapper entree, which our server explained is one of their most popular dishes. It looked pretty and they did a nice job splitting it onto two beautifully presented plates. It just tasted SO fishy!!! We tried to cover the flavor by wrapping the snapper in the provided warmed tortilla with avocado and the onion/tomato slaw, but the fishiness still permeated. By the end we were dipping it in left over soy sauce from our sushi to cover the taste - yuck! I couldn't even finish it. Now I've had snapper before and it's a bit fishy but this was very fishy. Maybe we just got a bad fillet because I can't imagine this dish being anyone's favorite! We didn't complain and we just dealt with it - but I don't think we'll be ordering snapper anytime in the near future!   For dessert we ordered the chocolate cake to split. From the description it looked like a very rich dish and it was -- unfortunately it was dry and leas decadent than I had anticipated from the description. We didn't end up finishing it. The best part of dessert was the tea served with a teapot full of warm water, honey, and variety of delightfully flavored tea bags.   We still enjoyed our date night because the service and ambience were great. We probably won't return because the food wasn't as delicious and amazing as we had hoped."}
{"text":"Great ambiance, plenty of good rums in menu. Wine list wad very good too  I love my food, had two appetizers. Love the music they play   I will be back. Did I say the service was spot on?"}
{"text":"Had a reservation on Christmas Eve.  We got there a little early and were seated promptly.  The menu items looked good, but unfortunately nobody would take our order.  After 20 minutes, we got up and left."}
