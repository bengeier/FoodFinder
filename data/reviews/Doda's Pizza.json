{"text":"Just tried doda's today after hearing about it on nextdoor.  They have lunch specials every day and the price is good.  Pizza is thin, new York style.  Crust was crispy and did not soften as the time passed.  Sauce is not bitter, not too much per slice.  2 large slices of cheese pizza, with pepperoni added, and a drink was only $6.28.  Pizza is much better than Barros  which also has lunch specials.  Nice clean seating area.  Menu had tons of other choices including subs, specialty pizzas, wings, and hot pasta dishes!  Staff were friendly and welcoming.  Definitely will be coming back!"}
{"text":"The first time I tried Dodas was when my co workers and I had our Christmas party there. We had salad, wings, appetizers, and different pizzas.  I love their thin crust and the Dodas special pizza is my favorite.  I have also had their lunch special steak and mushroom toasted sandwhich, which I love.  Their fried mushrooms and zucchini are to die for!  The family that owns it go out of their way to make sure you are always satisfied.  I have recommended alot of my customers and friends to try it.  Love this place!!"}
{"text":"In between the school day and an event Doda's brought the teachers many different delicious pizzas! I loved the Philly  Steak Pizza and the salad! The meat pizza was really good too! Thank you Doda's for making a really long day even better with your great pizza!"}
{"text":"This establishment will not see me again. Poor flavor and service. The pizza crust is very much like a saltine cracker. The sandwiches are skimpy."}
{"text":"This is the place you are looking for!  Fresh ingredients like Bella mushrooms not canned white shrooms.  The crust is perfect and light.  A little extra cheese on top of the rest of ingredients for a final touch.  Can't wait to come in and try a dinner plate."}
{"text":"I have been searching for good east coast pizza since I moved here a year ago....and today I finally found it!!! This place is the bees knees. The cheese tastes just like home authentic and great."}
{"text":"Tried a new pizza spot and was not disappointed!! Pizza was just like I like it, and the BBQ wings were large and in charge! Clean dining area and nice enough for date night with out breaking the bank! Can't wait to go back and try the rest of the menu!"}
{"text":"Been looking for a NY style thin crust pizza for a long time.  The pictures and reviews looked really good for Dodas so we gave them a try.  Got the 18\" special with 30 wings for 30 bucks.  That's a great deal for the amount of food considering wings sometimes run a buck a pop these days (isn't that just crazy or is it just me??).  The employees (sons) are really nice and we love giving a mom and pop place a shot so we were happy to come by.  Unfortunately, the food was not what we were hoping for.   The pizza was not very thin or foldable as we were wanting.  The crust was pretty plain.  Not a real chew to it or crisp to it either.  The cheese and sauce were also pretty basic.  None of the flavors really shined or created a desire for more.  We tried three different wing sauces bbq spicy, medium, and honey hot.  The spicy bbq was super thick and not spicy.  The medium was the best of the three.  Very tasty and well balanced.  The honey hot wasn't hot and had no taste of honey.  Sad to say this isn't what we were looking for and we won't be back but we wish them the best of luck."}
{"text":"Small place,big taste. Gone there twice and have been super satisfied. Wife loves the Pizza,friends adore the wings,and for me the sandwiches are the best. Not very big,far from fancy,just good food and service."}
{"text":"Best service around town. Unbeatable. Will defiantly be back. I highly recommend the fried zucchini and boneless hot wings."}
{"text":"Love this place. They give me what i want. I've been goin there since iwas little. You should go there. The food is excellent. Try the wings."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza and wings at a very reasonable price. Service was second to none and the inside is kept spotless. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Nice place. Service was great. Ordered take out. picked up a large pizza. The place was empty. The fellas that helped me were super nice. As far as the food. Not that great. Something is up with the dough. I don't know. it's just off. The whole thing, not a lot of flavor at all. Sad to say it. I had hoped for another great local pizza. This was just a miss for me. I like my pizza to be crisp on the bottom. after reading the reviews. I saw to order it \" crisp\" and I did. Though it started to blacken in the bottom which is fine. It wasn't crisp. Just weird."}
{"text":"Doda's Pizza recently opened by the Petsmart strip mall in Glendale on Bell Rd. This is a small very casual pizza place that serves REALLY GOOD!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Almost East Coast Style Pizza!!!!!!!!!!!!! We tried a plain slice and a Spinach, Mozz, Ricotta, Sauce Pizza. Really Good! This pizza is the very first pizza I tried since I moved here over 10 years ago that reminds me of east coast pizza. Not as oily like New York but more like New Jersey or Pennsylvania. The kind of pizza that comes from pizza shops that might be in walking distance from your house. The mozzarella  cheese has flavor to it (not the ricotta...it taste like Arizona ricotta), The sauce is thick with the right amount of sweetness, the pizza taste like pizza and is seasoned and the crust is very close. It has flavor and a nice crisp bottom. On the spinach pizza they used fresh spinach. They offer all kinds of sizes and two choices of thickness of pizzas, many varieties including a green chili one that interests me. Lunch special and lots more. The family that runs the place was friendly.  Don't walk......... RUN to Doda's to try East Coast Style Pizza!"}
{"text":"I've been looking all over town for a place that serves traditional New York style pizza and finally found it. Pizza slices were huge. Perfectly baked thin crust. The flavor rivaled some of the best pizza I've had in New York and Naples. I was beginning to think you couldn't find pizza like this in AZ. This is a family owned establishment. Grand parents, parents and children all chipping in. Super friendly. They obviously take a lot of pride in what their serving."}
{"text":"Super great... awesome service. There wings are just so good and they have that awesome home style flavor. The pizza its also fresh and just delicious. Will be coming here more often. Also nice clean place."}
{"text":"We've been looking for an awesome neighborhood pizza joint and I think we found it! Lovely little company that is community and family oriented. And let me tell you something, the white pizza was a huge hit with the staff at Arrowhead Elementary School! I can't say enough about Leo, he is so personable and helpful, he helped set everything up and didn't leave until he knew it was all good!  Great customer service!"}
{"text":"Had a Groupon so we checked them out! We got the thicker crust pizza and wings! Everything was delicious!! Would recommend!"}
{"text":"Awesome yummy pizza and wings! This is obviously a family owned place and the service was great. We got a combo special and it was well priced. I liked watching them pop our pizza in the oven and keep a close eye on it. We had two kids with us and they even sliced some of our slices small without being asked. Great touch. We were there early on a Tuesday night so we were the only ones in there at the beginning and when my 3.5 year old started dancing to the oldies they had on they turned up the music for her! The pizza was perfect and crispy and the wings were too. We just found our new neighborhood spot!"}
{"text":"The owners are from Original #1 Brothers Pizza, a place we have visited many times.  PÃ«rshendetje!  We had baked ziti and ziti with meatballs. The baked ziti was better. We're both big eaters and both of us had to ask for a to go box due to the large portions. The hot plate dinners come with garlic bread, light and delectable, and salads. The salads are iceberg, onion and sliced black olives, simple but very fresh and crisp.  Dinner for $10 with leftovers to take home is the definition of a good value."}
{"text":"I honestly didn't expect much from Doda's. Little pizza shops like this are a dime a dozen in Phoenix. Unfortunately, most are putting minimal effort into their product and simply just phoning it in.  I swung by here for a quick lunch and split a two-slice and soft drink lunch special with my girlfriend. You'll get charged per topping, but I've always been more of a minimalist in this regard.  The pizza is actually much better quality than I expected. Yes, it steers more towards that New York-style, although not as greasy and a texture that hits just the right amount of crisp, although still able to be folded. Crust flavor and ingredient quality were both solid and significantly better than what I was originally expecting going in.  They have a deep dish on the menu, which might make for an interesting experiment down the road.   The calzones: I tried one on a return visit. Quality was good and they can easily be split between two people. However, the excess reminds me of eating a giant burrito. It's good for a few bites, but then you just get bored with it. But again, that's only my opinion. I prefer their pizza and have since returned a few times. I continue to be pleased!  I'd strongly recommend giving them a try!"}
{"text":"Kids unanimously like this pizza better than Barros. I was hoping this would be the burnt and bubbled crust of my childhood, but it was not. However, I did like the sauce,cheese and pepperoni. My steak, mushroom and cheese sub was OK. Super friendly staff. I like the NY pizza decor mixed with a bit of modern decor. A few large TVs. Nice non-chain family pizza place."}
{"text":"Stopped by this place because I saw someone mention them in a neighborhood app and I like supporting community businesses. This place didn't disappoint and is a nice addition to the area however they are somewhat tucked away in the Petsmart area so easy to miss from the road. I was in around lunch time. 2 slices and a drink for around $5. Can't beat it. Slices were huge (see photo), had that nice crispness to the crust but you could still get that NY fold out of it. Inside of the place was nice and clean too. Stop by if you're in the area as this place is great!"}
{"text":"Great customer service very friendly atmosphere. Family owned. Amazing pizza and wings very satisfied with my first time definitely will be coming back?!"}
{"text":"Soooooo good! I love pizza, I just...love pizza so much, but, it's hard to find a really good pizza. My love is strong for traditional thin crust New York pizza! This place more then delivered on that! They serve slice combos that are wonderfully priced, and, the staff was super nice and helpful. The owner (I believe it was the owner) even gave my friend a free slice of pizza when we got dinner there last week. If you are a fan off pizza, do yourself a favor and a service and check this place out ASAP! They also have amazing sandwiches and calzones if you aren't a pizza lover."}
{"text":"Coming from a \"Philly girl\" this pizza is the best that I have had in Arizona!!!  The crust is amazing!  I highly recommend it"}
