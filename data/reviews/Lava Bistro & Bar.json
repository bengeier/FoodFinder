{"text":"Just went here for new years eve dinner. This is a tradition for us, and we usually have a great time. This year however was very disappointing. For some reason they ditched the entirety of their usual menu for a very limited prie fixe menu. Three courses for $40 each, and each course only had 2-3 options. Most of the food was drastically under seasoned and poorly cooked, at least for the price. My mahi was tasteless and came with this really lemony potato salad. My husband's ribeye was under seasoned and very thin. It was the kind of stuff you would expect to pay $20 for at TGI Fridays. On top of that, they gave themselves a 20% tip on our bill. This was by far the most overpriced meal I have ever had."}
{"text":"We had lunch on the boardwalk at Lava because Sushi 101 was closed.  Well it was great karma for us because lunch was awesome.  I had the club sandwich that was served on focaccia and the bacon on it was superb.  And the egg roll appetizer was nice and crispy!  Elegant polished bar and open atmosphere.  Great for a quiet date."}
{"text":"I have so many good things to say about my dinner tonight, I'll just stick to the facts and not waste your time. I am staying at the University Place Hilton on business. Last year I was here by myself and tried Lava Bistro. This year, I am here with several coworkers and four of us decided to walk over to Lava Bistro for dinner. We could not have made a better choice.   \"Handcrafted\" food is right!  We were kindly greeted when walking in and were seated quickly.   Our sever not only told us the specials, she told us their prices, too! Very cool!   The cheese plate (three cheeses and various toppings) and rosemary bread was spectacular. Tonight they had goat cheese with fresh strawberry topping, manchengo with sauteed onions and mozzarella with tomatoes.   Wine pours were huge, reminded me of the Keg size 8-9 ounces.   The Seafood Meritage was great, two small crab cakes, shrimp cocktail, and rare tuna on wonton-like chips. The tuna was perfect.   Marinated Tomato Salad sounded very interesting and tasted better. Fried tomato, stuffed with marinated tomato, feta, and mixed greens.  Cheesecake with salted caramel . . . Are you kidding me!!   Top it off with some decaf and call it a near perfect meal!   Bottom line, everything was delicious, service was top notch, food was high quality, and prices were reasonable.   Don't walk, run . . . to Lava!!"}
{"text":"The calamari was rubbery, over cooked.  The salad was good... (Chopped wedge). Decent bar selection, beers were okay, some fun choices.  The grilled rib eye was not tasty at all.  I wish I would've got some fish instead..  I won't be back."}
