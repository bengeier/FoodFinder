{"text":"Solid gyro with delicious fries (perfectly cooked) and a good value. Gyro was heaping with meat - could have ordered a second pita and made two sandwiches!  I will be back - for sure."}
{"text":"Update:  Still awesome!!  Do not be put off by location or appearance...and DO try the gyro plate or chicken plate..salad the freshest I've ever had and dressing to die for!!  Meat, rice and tzaziki are all delicious!!"}
{"text":"This place is great. A gyro combo is $6.50 and that gives you a stacked gyro, fries, and a drink. The gyro is delicious and totally stuffed with meat, everything about it screams flavor; the fries are also awesome. They have an entire fridge of drinks to choose from, as well as fountain drinks and even a Gold Peak tea machine, which is the icing on the cake for me.   Head into this place, they really deserve more business. I'm a completely broke college student and I always feel satisfied with this purchase."}
{"text":"I've passed Gyros on Central many times and I stopped for gas on my way out to eat and thought since I was there and hungry I'd give it a shot. Loved it. The only person working wasn't a warm guy by any stretch, but I'd go back for the gryo again and again. My husband had the chicken pita ( which is basically a gyro with chicken ) and  a small salad. I had the regular gryo and fries. Everything we ordered tasted wonderful. Give it a try if you are in the area."}
{"text":"Delicious!  Simply the best around.  Fresh with generous portions and friendly service.  Went from looking for a good gyro place, to eating here several times per week.  Now, my colleagues eat here too!"}
{"text":"The food is great but get it to go... the location is horrible. It is in the parking lot for a gas station so forget eating outside unless you enjoy smelling gasoline while you're eating. Even inside it still smells like gas..."}
{"text":"This is a great little spot off Central and Dunlap. I'm not much of a meat eater so once I sprang for the falafel salad. It was really good!  I've ordered it now 4-5 times and the best part is it is consistently good!  Their gyros look great, but like I said I stick to the veggies.  It is hard to find food that is not Mexican or American but this is the spot, good prices too."}
{"text":"Great food for a great price. Owner is very generous and a nice guy. Small space, I go for take out but worth the stop in for sure."}
{"text":"Very good gyros.  across the street from JCL  by a shell station, shares the building and lot with the gas station, very hard to see if you aren't looking for it.  I don't know if new or old business, but I wish I had known about it sooner because the hospital food is bad and very few good, quick, affordable places to grab a meal around this area."}
{"text":"I was getting gas at the station connected to it and thought, yum, Greek food! Apparently it's the same owners. A little strange but why not! Plus I saw good reviews on here. I read one review which said it had good marinated chicken. I ordered the chicken gyro thinking it's the usual, juicy, marinated, white chicken breast. Well maybe they ran out of chicken that day because it was thin pieces of what looked exactly like turkey bacon! It was hard and disgusting! My lettuce was wilted and the sauce looked and tasted like something out of a jar! Nothing fresh about this place. If I hadn't taken it to go I would have sent it back. I came home and gave whatever that meat was to my dog. My cat wouldn't even eat it! It's too bad because the guys there were nice!:("}
{"text":"Best Gyro's for the price.  For reference, I used to be a fan of Med Fresh Gyro's on Mill Ave but their prices have gone up and quality has gone down.      Don't remember the name of the cook. He's always been very friendly and makes the best gyro sandwiches for $4, can not beat that anywhere in town.  I think gyro places get their meat from the same distributor/brand (Kronos), but this place is fairly generous with their pieces of meat, always pretty fresh too.    My wife loves the Greek Salad with chicken,  like others have noted the chicken is marinated wonderfully and the lettuce is perfectly crisp each time she's had it  4-5 times now."}
{"text":"This is a great place for quick Greek food. I've lived near the place for 7 years and never knew it existed. As others stated its next to a convenience store. The place is small and only approximately seating for 15 inside and 8 outside. But if you want a good gyro and or salad don't pass it by."}
{"text":"We have seen the place several times. Never stopped, I had a thing about eating what appears to be gas station food.  Well its NOT. Its a little place right next to the gas station. They just share a wall and parking lot. Still weird. They say they're looking for a new location.  The food was really good though. I am super picky and so is my body. I left feeling very happy and glad that we finally stopped.  Yeah I see they shop at Wal Mart which is the worst thing. We only know cause we watched them bring in the groceries.   We will be back."}
{"text":"Best gyros in town. The combination for $7 is an amazing deal. The guys who work here are the best, friendly, polite, and great food! I love the fries and there are many drink choices."}
{"text":"Love their gyro meat. A great value for the combo even if the rice is not quite my thing. That's okay, I switched to the wrap and I'm feeling better than ever. What's next from here? Only the future can tell. PS- the guys inside are very nice. My only negative experience was some moron vaping inside the store and blowing it all over me. I wanted to throw falafel balls at her but instead I stormed outside in a huff like a true American."}
{"text":"I was looking for places to try for dinner and found this place on Yelp so I decided to try it. Overall good food and gyro meat was nice, I only wish the tzatziki was on top of the meat to give it some added complexity. I agree with previous reviewers that you would want the food to go because it is located in a gas station parking lot. If you're in the area it's a good place to try."}
{"text":"This place knows how to make a good gyro and nice thick steak fries the lamb is really great quality and flavor"}
{"text":"Authentic Gyros, incredible price, generous portions, you can't go wrong!  Came here thanks to Yelp and found a hole in the wall shop with a good menu.  Of course I had to get the Gyro sandwich, which is what I use to measure the gyroness of a place and it was good!  With an extra helping of tzatziki sauce, I devoured my sandwich in no time.  I'm definitely heading back to try some of their other goodies."}
{"text":"Gyros on Central serves gyros EXACTLY like the ones you find in New York City.  Exactly.  So good!  The owner is nice and its centrally located.  We go all the time!"}
{"text":"Family owned and operated.  Love it.  Always freshly made and very yummy."}
{"text":"It's not stylish, but it's fresh, tasty, and budget friendly. I have eaten here a number of times with my son, and I have never been disappointed. I usually get the gyro platter, and if he charged more for it, which he could, I'd still come every bit as often. Support local business! Support Sunnyslope!"}
{"text":"Perhaps the were just having a bad day based on everyone else. In my case, my wife picked up two gyro plates, one side of fried mushrooms and another of fried jalepenos. First, both sides tasted like the prefab ones they sell at grocery stores, or sysco foods. Not terrible, just nothing that I enjoy. The gyro meat is fine, althou if your like me, you prefer a bit of a chared taste as proof that fire was involved somewhere, I would have been happy if they had just given my slices a nice, quick sear in a pan before putting then in the box.  They give a whole lot of rice for the amount of meat, really gets your hopes up with you open the lid and then is a letdown when its well over 60% rice puffing up everything else.  What I REALLY disliked, REALLY, is no TZATIKI sauce and NO FETA, but what is obviously some offbrand ranch dressing in containers.  I admit, that last fact almost made me give them one star, I'm just assuming it was an accidnt. And if I go back, I'll be sure and ask for them on the platter and with the side salad.   Man its sad, I really was hoping for a good experience, I mean the man and the boy there were very nice. which goes a long way with me."}
{"text":"Total Yum!  Best Gyro salad I have had in a long time.  I was skeptical after walking in and seeing the very plain d√©cor, but YUM - and great value. I will be back soon.  Lot of good gyro meat, feta cheese, great dressing, a few peppers and olives to boot. Try it!!!"}
{"text":"This little shop next to the Shell gas station is a hidden gem! My brother and I were in the car filling up gas and saw a small cafe next door, \"Gyros on Central.\" I loved the name - reminded of how they name restaurants in New York. We were both starving so we thought to try it out.  AMAZING! I ordered the chicken pita combo and he ordered the gyro combo. Both of our sandwiches were filled up with a hearty amount of meat (love that) and the fries were seasoned, crispy and HOT. Too many times I've ordered combos, and the fries end up soggy and/or cold. My brother loved his food, too. The owner came by to ask how everything was and sat with us for awhile - incredibly nice guy. We both appreciated the hospitality.  And we'll both be back  - you should, too!"}
{"text":"First time here! I got a Chicago Dog and a Gyro both were awesome! I was greeted as soon as I walked in.  Service is great! I will be back in 2 weeks, when I am up in this area again!"}
{"text":"This place is a lost gem....no frills authentic greek cuisine the gyro bread, soft tasty, the meat fresh and delicious well seasoned flavor with every bite....tahini & hummus creamy delicious and fresh......extremely clean and polite atmosphere...a lil hole in the wall where for a few minutes in time you stepped into Greece...all thats needed is the waves crashing the rocks along the shore....Best in Phoenix"}
{"text":"I stopped at the gas station next door to fill up.  Had not had lunch yet, so stopped by the gyro spot.  At first I didnt expect much, but man those gyros were juicy and topped with all the goodies.  Some gyros can be dry, but this place had some flavor! My brother had a chicken plate, which was also tasty!"}
{"text":"The gyros are so good. The food is always hot and fresh. They have a large variety on their menu. The staff is friendly. Restaurant is clean. I eat here every Saturday with my boyfriends family."}
{"text":"Little hole in the wall with a few tables and chairs. Great food and service. Order at the front and sit where you want. You should try this very casual restaurant."}
{"text":"\"You eat your Gyros at a gas station?\"  Yes I do, but only because of the outdoor seating."}
{"text":"We've passed by this place a dozen times, and I finally got to try it out when we had a family dinner at our house. I was craving gyros, so I called to ask how much a big platter of gyros was. The owner was extremely nice. Both he and the cook ensured that we had a great meal. They gave me directions for reheating (as I was needing the food for Sunday, but they were only open Saturday for pickup.) Everyone loved the gyro meat. He even put together salad and pitas to go with it. It was a great price too for feeding 10 people!!! We've gone back a few times. :-)"}
{"text":"Me and my colleagues sat at the round table as we waited for our food.   We discussed how this place is not inside the gas station but rather next to a gas station. To sum up, it is not inside a gas station because it doesn't belong in a gas station.   Pita Combo: As for the food, the chicken is tooo good, and the fries are too crispy and tasty that my taste buds were showering with joy. The pita bread does not fall short, it is soft and fresh; it compliments the taste of the meal very well. And dont forget to eat your veggies, yes my meal had some veggies fused inside the pita for that extra delivery of great taste followed by my tasty beverage to wash it all down.   After we were finished I nodded my head to the cook and we drove off into the sunset."}
{"text":"Was pleasantly surprised by this place.  I wouldn't have expected to have one of the best gyros I've ever tasted in Phoenix!  If your in the mood for Greek, go here!  They do close at 7pm so get there sooner than later."}
{"text":"This is located by a converted 7-11 to some other convenience/gas station.  The place is small and doesn't look like much.  The gentleman that greeted me was nice, took my order and prepped it in about 10 minutes.  The nice thing was that it was fresh & hot.  The tzaziki (sp) sauce was very good and the gyro meat was seasoned well.  Veggie garnish was real fresh and crispy and the pita was nice and warm/hot.  Just the right amount of fries to accompany the meal and very inexpensive.  I would definitely go back again!"}
{"text":"I have been here twice. The first time I got the Veggie Platter. A nice mix of hummus, pita, a little Greek salad and Dolmades. The food is nice, but nothing overly impressive.   On the first visit after ordering and waiting 5 minutes I was told they were out of hummus. What? A Greek place out of hummus?  At any rate I think they scraped the bottom of the barrel and I got some with my meal, but about half of what was pictured in the menu.   I went back again today, only because I was rushed for lunch and thought i'd give them another shot, since the food was ok last time.   I again ordered the veggie platter and was told it would be 20 minutes because they were slammed.  At the time they had three customers waiting that had already ordered. 20 minutes for a meal that has everything already made and just needs to be put in a to-go container. No thanks.   On top of this the staff is not really overly friendly. I'd skip this place."}
{"text":"I never would have noticed this place, which is attached to a gas station, if it hadn't been for my sister taking me there, but I'm so glad she did. They're quick, friendly, and make the BEST gyros in Phoenix, hands down. I'm also kind of weirdly obsessed with their fries, but that's another story. Please check this place out and don't let it disappear like all the other great local places in the neighborhood!"}
{"text":"This is what I like to call a sleeper restaurant. It's next to a gas station, Has minimal parking but the food and the service can't be beat. I have been a few times and always enjoy going back. The owner is fun to talk to and he will tell you some amazing stories. Stop in and you'll see what I mean."}
{"text":"I love this hole in the wall. O haven't had many entrees here but the gyros are the best in AZ"}
{"text":"I used to live nearby (2003?) and would get my gyros from a counter within the gas station. The gas station owner's wife made gyros and sandwiches which became so popular,  her husband took his large storage room and made her a seperate restaurant. I am not sure if the original family is still involved but it sounds as if the great flavors continue."}
{"text":"Since moving nearby I'd been scouting this place, and it seemed to be a little hole-in-the wall gem. We finally tried it this week and it was exactly that!  We walked in and received a cold greeting from the guy at the counter. He seemed a little bothered that we were there, but took our order. Two gyros with a side of hummus. It took a little bit to get the food, but as he was the only person working, I didn't mind. The price was reasonable. We hung out in the sparse interior until it was ready, then headed home to chow down.  The meat itself was hot and delicious; not at all dry like gyro meat can sometimes be. There wasn't an overpowering amount of onions, which I liked. (I hate feeling like I have dragon breath for hours and hours after enjoying a Greek feast.) I usually like an obscene amount of tzatziki sauce and this gyro was lacking in it. But the more I ate, the more I found myself enjoying the tasty pita and meat flavors instead...but I'm not a total convert: next time I'll order some on the side for dipping's sake. The hummus was really tangy and had a few veggies hanging out on top, most notably a kalamata olive, which I grabbed before my husband even had a chance. Yum."}
{"text":"Cool little hole in the wall place, good food, good price. Only went 4 stars because it takes a while to get food which doesn't work if you're on lunch and they're busy"}
{"text":"Good service great value a little place convenient for central.  Salad fresh. Good job guys"}
