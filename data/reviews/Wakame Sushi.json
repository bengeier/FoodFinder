{"text":"It's a hit or miss at this location. Sometimes the food is good and at others it's mediocre and the fish doesn't taste or smell  fresh. I always get the all you can eat buffet and the food is ok for the low pricing. However they don't have the best sushi and the servers are rude and kind of throw your food on the table. The only time they speak to you is when they bring out the debit machine for you to pay and they put a fake smile on for a tip. I once overheard the server raise her voice with the customer at the table next to us because he left her a low tip."}
{"text":"Came in with my sister for lunch. All you can eat for about $14.50 (excl. tax). Nice, modern looking space. Busy but quick service. We ordered avocado salad, yam tempora, steamed rice, chicken teriyaki, dynamite roll (4 pcs), rainbow roll (6 pcs) and mango ice cream. Everything was delicious but the rolls. It lacked taste and it looked like they didn't make an effort to put them together. I would have given a better rating but my main reason to go to an All You Can Eat is sushi, so the sushi really brought it down. Maybe next time I'll try the regular menu. One upside at the end though, you get 10% off when you pay cash. So that's something :)"}
{"text":"Was there Dec 11, 2015 - the waitress spilled terriyaki sauce all over my jacket. Yes, accidents can happen; but they didn't bother to clean up the huge pool of sauce on the ground beside my table. Every time I go, its slow service for all you can eat or a la carte sushi. Hard to find waitresses when you need them. Never going back.   Try Sakura Garden on Avenue Rd south of hwy 401. Much better service, much better sushi, much better all you can eat. Sushi Supreme at Yonge/Davisville is also as great as Sakura, but doesn't have all you can eat. See my reviews on those 2."}
{"text":"Excellent value for money. I've been here dozens of times, and find the quality of the food to be consistently good. Service is usually good, but sometimes they have their bad days. Even then, still markedly better than any other AYCE sushi joint that I've been to, and your food will arrive rather quickly compared to other AYCE restaurants. I would be glad to recommend this place to others."}
{"text":"I think I would come back here.  Actually, I most likely will come back here since it is located right in the middle of where I have a lot of work meetings.  There are only so many bagel places I can eat at, so this was a welcome alternative the other night!  I ordered the vegetarian box and was very happy with it.  For $7.95 I got: -6 avocado-cucumber rolls (that unravelled a bit because wasn't well wrapped) -edemame (with NO salt on it, which I loves) -3 fried tofu cubes -rice -vegetable tempura (assorted)  The miso soup and salad were fine and tasted like it does everywhere else.  After consuming the soup, salad and most of the box, I was stuffed.  Didn't even make it to the rice, which I felt badly about since it was in such a cute ball.  I found the staff extremely pleasant and accommodating.  Is it the greatest sushi I have ever eaten?  No.  Is the plaza it is located in a joy to drive in and find parking?  Absolutely not.  In fact it is horrible.  However, it is the only place available in that corner that is not bagels, burgers and other bakery/cafe type food."}
{"text":"Food was average but came out really fast and it's one of the few sushi places in the area. The interior is nice and service was good. Will come here for lunch again"}
{"text":"I came here the other night with my fianc√©.  We ordered a la carte it came up up $45-$50 all together including tax and tip.  The food isn't bad the service is ok.  I would return, maybe to try the all you can eat. We saw a table beside us who did that option and they had a lot of food.  They were holding some plates because there wasn't any room on the table."}
{"text":"Looks a little ghetto from the outside, however its a great sushi place on the inside. Fire dragon roll a la carte was exquisite, the ambiance and waiting service was top notch. It was packed even at 10pm. They offer buffet as well. Will recommend."}
{"text":"I come here almost every weekend.  It is my most favorite sushi place of all time... and believe me I've been to many sushi different sushi places but Wakame has my heart!"}
{"text":"I agree with other reviewers. This place is hidden away but a very good sushi place! There is great selection both for the buffet and if you want to order from the menu.  Nice atmosphere and decor.  There is plenty of space for larger groups.   I would go again and have recommended it to others."}
{"text":"Garbage. This is hands down the worst sushi I have ever had. The quality was terrible- the fish was not fresh. The waiters are unpleasant and unprofessional. This is a waste of your time and money- stay away."}
{"text":"Good: cheap lunch menu if you go for the maki rolls, 8 pieces of california + 8 pieces of spicy salmon for only $6.  Decent quality of rolls for the price.  Service was pretty good pace.  Clean and nice decor.    Bad: salad is quite low quality and inconsistent.  Sometimes come with no dressing at all, sometimes without any carrot strands, sometimes frozen.    I haven't tried their buffet and much other options yet, so can't comment on those.  Update:  Their salad has improved since my first review.  Now I love everything about their lunch specials.  Upping the rating."}
{"text":"Love their crab meat roll! All the rolls we have ordered seemed to be fresh and tasted good. They also have all you can eat menu, havent tried it, but it is a good price, will try at my next visit"}
{"text":"This was the worst sushi I've had. The sushi tasted like detergent, the ingredients were not fresh at all, and the service was awful.  Waitresses are not welcoming at all, they just want to get you in and out (they're not even a busy place).   I will not be coming here again and I do not recommend anyone coming here. The sushi tasted like detergent most likely due to poor hygiene conditions (not rinsing properly).   Extremely overpriced for the quality of the food and service at this restaurant."}
{"text":"Tried this place in it's opening week.  The quality of the sashimi was great, everything was fresh and delicious.  The decor is modern and everything was very clean.  The quality and selection were especially amazing for the price. So many sushi joints downtown have gone so far downhill in the past year, it's great to find a place offering such good sushi in toronto.  Have been back to this place several times since I wrote this review and forgot about it....still very good food, and better service now that the place isn't packed all the time."}
{"text":"unfriendly staff. Counts the tips in front of you and asks you if you didnt like the service because she wanted more tips. I gave her 10$ for 85$ that i spent and she flat out asked me that. And i had to ask for spicy mayo 3 times from 3 different staff because they would never bring it and one of them actually said i forgot. Not coming back"}
{"text":"I've eaten here a few times b/c it's so close to my house. The decor is nice, the space is comfortable, and there's relatively easy parking (but watch out, some of the worst drivers in Toronto drive in this parking lot!)  Food-wise, the food is good. Not knock-me-over fabulous, but fresh and reasonably tasty. The basic salad is, well, basic. Not remarkable. The rolls are a decent size. Portions are smaller, and less nicely presented if you order off the AYCE menu than off the a la carte menu. Prices are good, I have to say.  The menu doesn't indicate a charge for very young children on the AYCE menu, and for a while they didn't charge (we're talking 2 year old child here), then one day a charge just got put on the bill. No mention of it ahead of time, and the waitstaff all know us.  Service is middling to indifferent. Waitstaff regularly forget orders, esp. off the AYCE menu. They are very unconcerned when asked three times for the same order of avocado rolls. They've tried to tell me that my child can't walk around the restaurant (with an adult right behind her, not bothering any other diners). Charges magically appear on the bill.   Overall, the food is fine, but there are better places."}
{"text":"Been going here for a couple years now for AYCE, but unfortunately, I'm starting to notice a jumping of the shark.   Sushi is still very tasty, but it's often slow getting to you and you rarely get every single item you ordered. There's always a roll here, or a sushi pizza there that doesn't come. When you ask about it you're given a nod as if it'll be tended to, and still nothing shows up.   Whether it's busy or not, service is mostly bad, as it is at many AYCE places. There's the odd server that is attentive, and when it first opened they were all great. Now it's a mixed bag, and most of them don't seem to care.  Also, you'll sometimes find your table and sometimes plates, sticky and still dirty.  Anyway, gave it a 3 because the food you actually do get it still quite good. Prices are also pretty good, and it's the best place in the area. But this place would've got a 4 or even 5 a couple years ago...Management needs to get things in order."}
{"text":"I usually order delivery from here. I'm a fan of the deep fried rolls. They are quick and the food is on point."}
{"text":"This place gets pretty busy on a Saturday afternoon. Even though it was busy the service was great! The food was very fast and delicious.  Is recommend the general tsao chicken, it's something special!"}
{"text":"Excellent food. Would have given it a 5/5 but because the service was lacking due to the waitresses being under staffed, they cannot keep up with the high volume of customer occupancy. Other than that."}
{"text":"My top priority place to eat sashimi ! I always have a full lunch there with pretty good price (to a poor student like me). However, I think the staffs are quite reclutant. Sometimes I have to wait for 5 6 mins to call someone giving me a menu and they also seem busy all the time..."}
{"text":"Foods meet my standard. They are delicious. However the servers are awful. They are rude and slow. I didn't even finish my dish and they grabbed it without asking. When a lady staff came by and asked for my ordering, I told her I was not ready . And she gave me a dirty look. Every time I leave this restaurant, I feel irritated."}
{"text":"I'll start by saying that we expected bad service due to all the other reviews and also due to the fact that all he AYCE sushi restaurants have shitty service, but here was the worst. It wasn't even that busy for a Sunday night and still out server Janice was awful. She walked off while we were mid ordering and clearly not finished as we had only ordered the salads. (Seriously our jaws dropped she just left mid sentence). She was neglectful and rude. She didn't even bring us the right bill I was shocked as how hard can it be to ring up 2 AYCE bills?!?!  Besides the bad service, the sushi was below par. There was much less selection than most AYCE places and less creative/special rolls too. The spicy rolls were drenched in spicy mayo and the spicy mayo wasn't even good.   Price is about what you'd pay for any other AYCE place. All in all skip this place. Super bad service, not good sushi. Pass."}
{"text":"Our go to place for lunch takeout. Its super cheap and you get so much food. And it's pretty good too. The portion size of the sushi is quite large compared to other sushi places so you're definitely getting more. Definitely try this place if you haven't."}
{"text":"Came for the all you can eat sushi dinner; $21 per adult on weekends and there is a discount if you pay cash! The decor is lacking... seems more like a cafeteria than a restaurant. Servers were very polite... overall service was excellent. Food was very good... excellent selection for all you can eat! Will definitely visit this place again!"}
{"text":"I'm so glad this place opened up. I've been longing for an AYCE sushi place that's not too far from where I live, and my prayers have been answered.  The quality of the sushi rolls are quite good. They don't load you up on rice, and the portions are quite nice for AYCE. There's plenty of seating, and the service is good.  I do wish there was more variety but it's a lot better than other competing AYCE sushi places in the GTA."}
{"text":"Food is great for the money and the AYCE cannot be beat! Always presented nicely and comes in a timely mannor. Service could be a bit better though 4/5"}
{"text":"This place sucks. Service is horrible and server are racist when i brought my black brother in law"}
{"text":"Eating here right now. Service is moderately quick for the amount of people in here. The sushi quality is awesome.. You really can eat to your fill. Would come here again if in the area.   Also the Asian waitresses that usually never respond to plain English.. Don't do that here!  Came back with a a response to my question when asked."}
{"text":"Only OK for the buffet, had better elsewhere. Acceptable lunch. Have gotten take out here many times just because of the convenient location, never got sick or anything which is good. But for buffet experience we usually go somewhere else."}
{"text":"The cheapest place I know for sushi that's really good. This place is a regular haunt for me when it comes to their all you can eat special and I am hooked on their rainbow roll!!"}
{"text":"Horrible. I thought it would be good in spite of the negative reviews but it's true the people are so rude. And there's little sushi to choose from even though lunch is 16.99 not worth the price. And the rice was falling apart."}
{"text":"We usually come here once a month and used to enjoy it, however our last experience changed our minds. The tuna tataki sushi had bones in it...yes you read that right; bones about 2 inches long! My cousin cut his mouth on it and they came up with excuses saying they order their tuna so they have no control of the bones. How can a sushi chef not see this? Also, another issue that put us off is that their chicken skewer was bloody. It was fully cooked but red inside. We won't be going back."}
{"text":"Got food poisoning for a second time. I know it's cheap, but does it worth it? Please avoid shrimps rolls."}
{"text":"Looked forward to having a good sushi place nearby, but unfortunately this one fell quite short. I ordered pick up and they gave me a volcano roll instead of the wakame roll. The udon soup lacked flavour and the spider roll softshell crab seemed old. The edamame was cold, dried out, and not fully cooked. The prices were also higher than most other sushi establishments I've been to. Maybe it was an off night, but probably won't be going back."}
{"text":"The service is so bad, I ordered food I never got, food took long to come and I did not order much food. They forgot one of my orders. I sat for 1hr, and got only two plates, I had to go back to work, and paid $18+ for two pieces of sushi. Servers did not make me feel welcome.   I eat at many Japanese places, as I really like sushi, however I will never go back to this place again based on the service I received. Food was ok, but service was bad. Server's only cater to distinct group of people."}
{"text":"For the area, Wakame sushi is probably one of the best options in terms of dining. Their beef teriyaki dinner is my ordering out or delivery go-to with a green dragon roll and tempura shrimp.   When I eat in-restaurant, I do the all you can eat. It's worth it for the variety and most of their stuff is really tasty. This is a great spot to get some satisfying dishes for a good price. You won't regret eating there. Their tempura yams and yellow dragon rolls are delicious as well.   Downside? I mean, it's no blow-your-mind sushi spot but it's worth the price. Sometimes the dine-in waitresses forget parts of your order, but I find that tends to happen at every all-you-can-eat sushi spot.    I order from them all the time and will continue to do so. That beef teriyaki is wonderful. Order the dinner meal and not the lunch though; the lunch comes with a thinner sliced beef which isn't as tasty."}
{"text":"I used to live in the area of Wakame Sushi, and often ordered takeout, which was always fast and delicious.  Today I went for lunch with two other people, and I think I'm going to stick to just getting takeout.  We seated ourselves, as the staff seemed too busy to seat us.  The server who took our order seemed like she did not want to be there, and ran away from the table as fast as she possibly could and never said a word to us.  We were also given two AYCE menus and one regular menu, and keep in mind, there's three of us.  Why not give us three menus?    We were all served our food at random times, which in any restaurant isn't that nice.  Despite that, my salmon and avocado rolls, cucumber rolls and hot and sour soup were delicious.  The server also got frustrated with us when the credit card machine was being a bit glitchy.  We also only got two fortune cookies rather than three.  I think either the server either couldn't count, or myself or one of my companions was apparently invisible.  Overall, I would still recommend Wakame for takeout, but with the rude servers, I won't be coming back there again for a sit down meal."}
{"text":"Great AYCE, especially for the price. Service is good.  All food was very fresh.  The servers were friendly. Can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"Love the fact that they do delivery within my area, and their beef teriyaki, golden dragon roll and green dragon roll are delicious. That's generally all that I order so I can't speak on their full menu, but it's great to have a delivery option that's health-conscious and punctual staff. They're generally friendly to me whenever I go there; I'm comparing their \"friendliness\" to that of a few downtown sushi spots and can say that they are actually quite nicer. I love ordering from them but the atmosphere inside the place is casually cute as well. One of my go-to spots around the corner."}
{"text":"I frequent this establishment at least monthly.  Nice selection of AYCE items, served fresh.  The only drawback is that soft drinks are sold by the can rather than fountain with free refills."}
{"text":"The lunch specials are an absolute bargain. Service was swift, the atmosphere was clean and neat, and the location a short walk from Earl Bales Park.   Our group of 7 came here for lunch in between skiing on Tuesday, and the restaurant was half-full around 1pm.   I personally ordered a salmon teriyaki combo ($6.75). It comes with miso soup, green salad, 3 pieces of California rolls, 2 spring rolls, 2 deep-fried cheese dumplings, salmon teriyaki, rice, and 2 slices of orange.   ... Yep, quite a lot. I was very satisfied by the time I finished my meal.   In terms of taste, the food was average. The salad dressing was delicious, cheese wantons were creamy, and the salmon fillet was surprisingly large. The spring rolls were oddly flavourless - the shell took up more volume than the filling, so it ended up tasting somewhat like a chicken nugget.   They also have AYCE lunch for $12.95 - but for our party, the lunch specials were enough food to fill our stomachs!   I would definitely come here again the next time I go skiing at Earl Bales Park."}
{"text":"Terrible services. Very rude waiters. And the sushi nigiri and rolls were poor quality. For those who can differentiate subtle quality of sushi, I wouldn't recommend going here. The price not that cheap either, for a budget level of Japanese restaurant owned by Chinese."}
{"text":"Always terrible service. Food is great but do not go to this location, make the trip to the bathurst and sheppard location!!!"}
{"text":"I used this place for sit AYCE and did a simple take out as well. The place is very nice and has a lot of seating.  Well we walked as a team of 5 to indulge in AYCE and it came up to around $100 after tips and taxes. The service was really and the menu had nice variety to it. Their fish tasted, looked and felt fresh! The pace of food coming out was good as well.   On an other day I had a small take out order for Butterfish sashimi. This comes with 3 pieces but to my surprised these were very thick pieces and very fresh and tasty.    This here is a decent restaurant with good service and fresh fish!"}
{"text":"Pretty good sushi. Good service. The staff is not all English speakers.  They didn't give us ginger with our meal though for some reason. We had to ask for it. As someone said in a different review there is a need for a sushi place in this area as the closest ones are probably at Yonge & Sheppard."}
{"text":"A friend took me to this place while I was traveling for business. It is a bit away from any main street and it is at the far end of a strip mall.  The service was fast some waitress were friendly some less. This is an all you can eat place so you pick from a menu and they bring it to you. You can also order a la carte. You get a lot to choose from and some better than other. Unfortunately the rolls are cut a little big so it makes it hard to eat them. We also tried deep fried California rolls and it was the worst thing ever.  The general tao and the sesame chicken had the exact same taste and sauce the only difference one had sesame on it. The tempura veggies were pretty blend and not very crispy. One thing was very amazing was one of the sushi with mango (cant remember the name) and a piece of salmon with a glazed sauce on it. Overall it was good but not the best all you can eat sushi I have been too but I would love to go back to try a few more things"}
{"text":"LMAO, Don't ever come here.  The staff are rude they talk behind your back in Mandarin, from the way you dress to the way you look. The food is pretty mediocre for the pricing. 23$ for Dinner, rip off..   When our waitress brought our bill it came with fortune cookies, we decided not to tip due to their lack of good service. When the waitress saw our receipt  she was astonished and told her manager (who walked by) that we didn't tip and then proceeded to picking up the fortune cookies and walking away.   Food was mediocre I've had better sushi from 12$ AYCE restaurants or T&T Supermarkets.. I do not advise coming here as you will be ripped off. AVOID THIS PLACE"}
{"text":"This is one my favorite sushi places in Toronto   Always busy(which is good at a sushi place) , the freshest Sashimi I have ever had, and pretty good service.   I suggest making a reservation especially on the weekend"}
{"text":"Hidden in the Crossroads Plaza, you wouldn't expect this place to have really good AYCE Sushi especially given the location at Weston Rd and Hwy 401. My girlfriend decided one night to check it out since we pass by it every night on our way home.  To my surprise it was not something I had expected the decor and atmosphere was out of the normal ayce sushi place. From looking at the outside of the place you expected a small tiny restaurant with angry servers LOL.  The servers were very attentive and served us with a smile. The sashmi was mediocre but better than most places Ive tried.  The Green Dragon Roll was scrumptious the avocado was fresh and made to order. We also tried a variety of several other rolls, no complaints they dont stuff a tremendous amount of rice like some other places do to fill you up quicker.   As for dessert was the usual Ice Cream.  Try out this place very hidden from the public!"}
{"text":"Happened to be in the plaza here at Weston Road and Hwy 401 and realized it was getting on in the afternoon and had yet to eat lunch! Unacceptable! What was also unacceptable was that it appeared my only lunch options in this plaza were Timmy-Ho's and McDonalds.  Not satisfied I drove around the back of the plaza and came upon Wakame Sushi - what luck. I'm typically a little reluctant to do sushi in strange plazas but I was hungry and knew sushi would be better for me than a Big Mac (resolutions remember).  Walked in and the space is deceivingly large and very long. I would guess somewhere in the 75-125 seats. It was fairly empty with only a half dozen tables also grabbing a late lunch. The offer both AYCE lunch and dinner, as well as a la carte sushi. Normally I'm hands down an AYCE guy, but I'm tired of feeling like I have to eat everything rather than wanting to eat what I order, so I opted for a la carte and ordered the Sushi + Sashimi Tokyo combo and subbed out the standard salad and california roll (the worlds most pointless roll ever) for a seaweed salad and spicy tuna roll (at a out $2/substitution).  Within seconds a sizable bowl of Miso soup and Seaweed salad were presented to me as well as green tea and water. Perfect. The miso soup was pretty much as you would expect but it did have quite a bit more green and tofu which I really enjoyed, and the seaweed salad was amazing - standard in taste but there was something much better about both the temperature (meaning not frozen) and the texture. Full points on each!  Before I could finish my soup and salad my main was brought to me and my eyes lit up! Finally a place that gives you SASHIMI when you order SASHIMI (not sashimi...). Three 1\"-1.5\" thick slices each of Salmon, Surf clam, Red Tuna, white fish, and red snapper - I honestly haven't seen such thick cuts of fish in ages! As well even the sushi assortment (crab, salmon, red tuna, red snapper, etc) were perfectly formed and not skimpy on the fishy! They always say you can tell good sushi by the rice and the rice here was easily one of the best around I've had in awhile. Lastly the subbed in spicy tuna roll was done perfectly, separate and identifiable portions of both chopped red tuna and spicy tempura were present in six well sized pieces of maki roll, and the taste - so fresh, so crunchy and delicious!  There isn't much more to say, that hasn't been said already, this is truly a hidden gem and if you're in the area tell McDicks to take a McHike and spend your dollar bills at Wakame!  Eatcrest Out"}
{"text":"I have a love/hate relationship with Wakame.  You'll probably have at least 3 different waiters who don't come by unless you desperately try to make eye contact with one so you call them over to your table. The staff is unfriendly, and act like they don't want to even be there.  The restaurant will leave your clothes smelling like fried food, and the tables and floors are usually sticky.   The food is still delicious and inexpensive, especially the salmon maki and their bento boxes.  Take out is a good option but I always feel guilty for walking away with half a dozen styrofoam containers which are horrible for the environment."}
{"text":"I was very surprised by this location. They have super cheap bento lunch specials which are huge for $8.50. The dinner ones are good and was surprised as normally I wouldn't order a la cart at an AYCE place. We did the all you can eat for dinner and was very impressed with the quality of the food and things always made it out and in good time. The lunch I was less impressed with as it is a smaller menu to choose from and lacked the sashimi or anything tuna but was cheaper. Usually this place is pretty full and good for uptown sushi."}
{"text":"Only AYCE in the immediate area I have to say this place was a wonderful surprise. Its nothing amazing but the food was good and the service was great. Probably the only viable complaint would be their oversized spicy salmon rolls which are too big and fall apart when eating. The portions on the rest of their menu that we tried that night were on par with all AYCE Japanese restaurants.  The ample parking and modern decor in a outdated looking plaza is worth noting.  I plan to visit again."}
{"text":"They've screwed up my take out twice and the sushi wasn't the freshest. However, dining in restaurant may be a nicer experience. Not a big fan of Wakame, I prefer to order from Nolbu up Sheppard."}
{"text":"is it just me or dinner Ayce menu has gotten much smaller, fits comfortably on half a page, just the basics for 24.99 on weekend.. did not justify..the food quality is good, taste is so-so, I like the atmosphere and convenient location but next time will likely go elsewhere."}
{"text":"They are very rude and have horrible customer service. We made an order as we are regular customers and they did not deliver the complete order. When we called to ask where the rest of the order was the server told me she'll call me back with managers help and we waited 14 minutes in which our food got cold, however the restaurant failed to contact us with the rest of the order so we had to call them when they answered she said they dont have a manager and hung up on us. I was absolutely appalled. Who does that? Hangs up on a customer when you didn't give them the entire order they you charged them for. Definitely not going there again. Unless you want shitty food with shittier customer service, don't go there."}
{"text":"The sushi isn't bad but only if you get your actual order! I know I won't receive the best professional service in almost Asian restaurants but this was below average.   I asked for spicy tuna and I just got tuna. I couldn't find my server, she never returned, especially when I said I would be ordering more.   I asked another lady if this is how they served the spicy tuna? She said no it's not. So I ordered a spicy tuna and instead I got the original angry server.  They said the only difference was the sauce. But that wasn't true.   The differences: sea weed inside, rice outside, with green onion, tempura bits and sauce.  They offered to bring my the sauce. I wasn't happy so I asked for my bill. Call me evil but I didn't tip. I didn't even take the fortune cookie. Un-fortune-atly, this dining experience was a thumbs down :/"}
{"text":"Came here for weekend lunch with a friend. Sushi was a bit average to below average because the sushi rice was a bit hard and warm. Fish quality on the sushi was also average to below average. Cooked food was good. Cooked food came first but sushi was a bit slow to come out for some reason. We were the second table of the day, and yet other people got their rolls first.  Tobiko sushi had like a tiny bit of tobiko, and it had basically no taste.  Not as expensive as some other places, so I guess that justifies the quality a little bit.  Quality: 5/10. Service 7/10. Value: 6/10. Overall: 5.5/10 (not an average)."}
{"text":"Tried this restaurant for the first time since it just opened, excellent food quality!!!  Everything we ordered was fresh and tasty.  Atmosphere is modern and prices reasonable. I will definitely be back again to try their all you can eat option (lunches from $13 and dinner from $19 on weekdays)!!!!"}
{"text":"I go for AYCE sushi at least once a month and have gone to over 20 different locations. I went for all you eat here for lunch. service was fast and efficient and the servers were nice but honestly it was the WORST sushi I have ever had. the yam rolls in particular were awful. I would honestly never go here again. The quality just wasn't there ... a lot of the sushi was over rolled & Even the deep friends items like shrimp tempura & Chicken wings were not good. I would never recommend this place . I know it's the only sushi in the area but drive 20 minutes and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Solid local sushi joint with prompt service and a clean atmosphere."}
{"text":"Came for weekend AYCE sushi lunch. I was pleasantly surprised with the quality of food. The sushi was fresh and the tempura was light and crisp! The beef ribs weren't that great though...would skip that next time. Not much flavour and I don't think it was grilled, looks like it was just pan fried. The sushi had a bit too much rice for my liking, but what do you expect for an AYCE place?   Next time I may try the lunch specials. They looked pretty good. The restaurant was very busy and lots of people were getting take out. That's usually a good indication that the food is good!"}
{"text":"Wakame is always a great choice. I have only once been slightly disappointed, and that was with a new menu item they had been testing (which they've now perfected, so no longer an issue).  Service can be hit or miss - on a Thursday, Friday or Saturday night, we do take-out or get delivery (free if your order is over $20) as it is much faster and still fresh.   They have a cash discount of 10% if you pay in cash. If you walk in and order, by the time you go to the bank to get cash and come back, the food is usually ready by the time you get back.  This has been by far the best addition to the Bathurst and Sheppard plaza in years."}
{"text":"This place is a notch above mall food court sushi with a larger menu, more seating and better bathrooms, but the quality of the food still lags far behind the real sushi houses in Toronto. This is sushi for the American crowd or the people who demand all you can eat. Deep fried items and deep fried rolls abound on the menu. If you can tolerate all the grease you won`t leave here hungry, that`s for sure. Service ranges from poor to non-existent - I had to walk to the counter and wait almost 5 minutes just to get my bill, so don`t go here if you`re in a hurry. While the food wasn`t terrible, I have no reason to return as there are plenty of far better sushi houses in Toronto."}
{"text":"I went here with my family for my birthday dinner.  It was a Monday night, and the place was surprisingly busy.  I really do think there's a demand for sushi in this area, and this place has found a niche.  The restaurant is aesthetically clean, new, and neat-looking.  Pretty basic.  The menu was fairly vast, and the prices are average.  They have an all-you-can eat option here as well, if you're a big eater.  I had a sushi and sashimi combo for about $16.  Their portions are BIG, and my meal came on a giant plate full of rolls, sushi, and sashimi.  It was super filling and well worth the price.  The food around the table was pretty good overall as well.  In terms of service, this is where the place might need a bit of work.  Many of the waitresses (well, the ones that fill up your tea and water and stuff) don't speak English well, but if they don't understand you they'll grab someone who can help.  Our meals came fast, except for my own.  I'm not sure what the delay was about, but my family was a quarter way through their meal before mine came.  it's a pretty new place, so hopefully they'll tweak things for the better.  I'd certainly go back.  It's one of the few sushi places in the Downsview area."}
{"text":"I've been eating here for years and I have had a different experience everytime. Usually the cuts of  sashimi are way to big to be consumed with skin and bone left on them. The presentation of the roles tends to be really bad and undesirable, but taste pretty good.  I never recommend this place I only go because of the convenience of location and price. Also the servers don't speak a lick of English."}
{"text":"Horrible service, we got ignored everytime we tried to order things. The servers acted as if they could not \"see\" us, when we finally gave them our menu they only ended up giving us 2 out of 6 rolls, and we waited 30 minutes because they had a few takeout orders to do so I thought maybe they were just extremely busy. Nope, apparently we didn't \"order\" the other rolls. Which we for sure did. We are always so careful about what we order because some places like to do things exactly what this place had done, and we literally order the EXACT same thing every time, so I'm pretty sure we would know. Horrible service, and rude waiters. They later complained about a 2 dollar tip, we shouldn't even of tipped. Would give them a negative review if I could. I used to think this place was good too. Horrible sushi place, they have about 5 servers walking too, maybe even more and they can't work 10 tables of people? They have 3 chefs too! How slow could you possible be! Never going back, ever."}
{"text":"Food was alright. The prices were great, and service was very friendly.   It's a great little Japanese place in an area that was really needing it.  We came on Saturday Afternoon, and there was no line, but started to get full around 1pm.   They have an AYCE for $12.95 but the menu is limited (no sashimi, but lots of rolls etc) great for groups!  Lunch time, they have some great specials, including $7.95 for beef teriyaki and chicken teriyaki rolls (among a bunch of others). I thought they would give only a half portion of each (given that rolls on the menu range from $8), but they actually give you 2 full portions (12 pcs) along with miso and salad!  Because of this, in addition to my Sashimi Combo ($10.95), we got a Wakame Roll.  The sashimi was good and filling, with salad, miso and rice. Big thick pieces - nothing to write home about, but was okay. Wakame Roll wasn't amazing either, but still good. I thought it would be tuna sashim, but it was cooked, with sauce, maki dipped in tempura batter.   If you're in the area, and looking for a good lunch deal, come here.  No need to come out of your way, however."}
{"text":"The food was great, fresh and delicious. Great selection!!! The presentation was good, order delivery speed is good, service is good, serving portion size good, prices are reasonable. Location and hours are good too! Overall, my new favourite AYCE sushi :)"}
{"text":"First time trying this place and went together with 5 buddies for dinner, some of which are regulars so I had high hopes. They didn't have the widest selection of sushi/rolls/sashimi and an even narrower selection of cooked foods (no tempura shrimp and other staples), but the foods they did bring out were AMAZING. Classics like spicy Salmon rolls were incomparable to other sushi spots and they used actual strips of fresh salmon instead of a mashed mixture like other places use. Everything tasted great, except the jello which tasted watery (but who cares), and the service was phenomenal. The waitresses constantly filled up all of our glasses with water and never let it get empty although there also weren't a lot of customers at the time which may have been why. This excellent food and service led to us staying for a whopping 3 hours devouring this fishy goodness. Would definitely go again"}
{"text":"Service was extremely fast and the food was good. The menu had a nice wide selection of food and we were all quite full. Service wasn't very heavy on communication but if you dropped a chop stick, a new set was on the table before you could even ask. The tables were kind of close together, to the point where it felt like we were dining with the couple next to us. My only concern is that I feel like we were over charged. 3 all you can eat dinners at 21.95 each come out to under $66 but our bill was $81. We didn't realise until we already left but it seems very strange that that happened. But otherwise we were very full and happy when we left, other than the fact that we felt kind of scammed but we will deal with it another time if we return."}
{"text":"Decent Japanese restaurant  The price is reasonable, and the food quality is pretty good. The dishes are decorated extremely well, especially the unagi don, which was served on a traditional-looking bento box topped with extra unagi and sauce. The gyu beef don was also decorated in a very appealing way, with big portions.  The service was a little slow though--it took a long while before we could order, and the wait staff seems very reluctant to work there.  In any case, all in all this is a decent place for Japanese food!"}
{"text":"There aren't that many AYCE buffet sushi places near here (Downsview area). We came here twice, after playing Archery tag and also after playing Bubble soccer nearby. As you can see, we were realllllly hungry and decided to do it up AYCE style.  The sushi here is just OK. They don't try to rip you off entirely by filling you up with rice here. Also price is decent for the OK quality sushi.  I liked that they had like 5+ different chicken dishes here (I know, not worth it, but I like chicken).  See the beautiful photo of the spicy crab rolls and salmon rolls and feel free to salivate (we had a large group thus the massive amount of sushi ordered)."}
{"text":"Really good selection of bento box with reasonable price. I loved the wakame box. It came with a lot of different stuff plus soup, salad and green tea."}
{"text":"OH BOY! Can you believe that the rudeness of the staff from this restaurant has motivated me to start a yelp account?! The one star rating is mainly directed towards the customer service provided by (drumroll please) May (the server) and Erica (the manager). I have been to this restaurant several times before and the food has always been alright but due to the staff I will not be returning again.   I don't want this to seem too dramatic and I'll try to shorten the encounter as much as I can. Basically my boyfriend and I arrived at the restaurant around 9:30pm on a Monday night hoping to fulfill our late night craving for sushi. As soon as we got into the restaurant, we were told we can only order once before last call for the all you can eat option. I asked May what time the restaurant closed and she gave me a blank stare and said that the kitchen closes in 15mins which was not what I had asked her. I could tell she was starting to get rude with me. Finally asking her again, she told me the restaurant was open till 10:30. I don't understand how last call for AYCE sushi would be 45mins before the restaurant closes. Angered by this new policy, I had asked for the manager where May was felt reluctant to ask for her because she had been eating.   Finally, Erica arrives on the scene and backs up the policy of only ordering once before the kitchen closes at 9:45. She mentioned how they don't care if we don't get enough food for the all you can eat option and reaffirms that we can only order once. At one point, halfway through my question she rudely cuts me off saying \"Let me finish\". She was unprofessional and non accommodating.   It is definitely not worth coming to this restaurant. I also work in the service industry and have been taught that the moment a customer enters the restaurant it becomes an experience. I, alongside various other critics before me will agree that the customer service provided by the staff is definitely not worth the visit."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery. Got the veggie party tray and the gyoza tray. The time to receive the food was faster than pizza. Paid 3 bucks extra for delivery because I wasn't in range by like 2 kilometres(lol).The phone call was polite and the delivery guy was kind. Sushi was great. Not a fan of the cucumber roll(plain)so will opt out on the vege tray next time and probably purchase separate rolls( favourite roll is the fried yam roll) Gyoza's were delicious. Will definitely be ordering again or visiting to eat.  in."}
{"text":"Staff is rude - I used to come here every now and then but decided to write them off. I was introduced to this new place called Shitake Sushi - so far so good !  Service and food are great."}
{"text":"The sushi wasn't really big but I guess that good so you don't get full faster but the experience of struggle of putting a dynamite roll in your mouth is gone. The service was fine  and the price was kind of expensive. On Fridays,Saturdays and Sundays its $1 extra at lunch time and $2 at dinner time. I say that its expensive because I couldn't get my money's worth. I think because of all the rice that I got fuller faster but basically the restaurant won this."}
{"text":"Four of us went here for lunch. For a restaurant that came highly recommended, it was a big disappointment.  The rice was dry, hard and chewy. How can a sushi restaurant get it so wrong?   We also ordered three chicken dishes. All three were inedible.  The tempura was ok.  Our server had attitude which just compounded the negative experience we had there.  There are far too many decent sushi restaurants in the city to even think about coming back here."}
{"text":"Good place. Good choice of vegetarian options. Good taste and inexpensive. Quiet and cozy as well."}
{"text":"For the price, almost as good at it gets. I've never had a bad experience here (although service can be a bit slow at times). AYCE lunch is a great deal during weekdays, and the quality is consistently good. It's often fairly crowded-- understandable given the value it offers. As other commenters have noted: the upside of a busy location is that the turnover is high and ingredients are fresh. Respectable selection.  Updated review to reflect quality of surrounding, cheap-ish sushi places. Wakame no longer stands out, and the service isn't fantastic."}
{"text":"We use to eat here 2 yrs ago as it was still good. Sushi/food and service was great then. My friend and I decided to eat there last night. Arrive there before 9:30 and thought it's better to eat off the menu than ayce so we dont get rushed. But as soon as food arrived. They started cleaning. Place was still about 1/3 full. You cannot taste(enjoy) your meal bec they use a strong smell cleaning agents. No wasabi and no soy sauce, you had to ask. Rude response. No water refill. Nobody checks up on you until the bill came. Paid in cash and they had to make sure, and told us to give them atleast 10% for the nonexistent service."}
{"text":"I really enjoy this sushi. The prices are right! Delivery is fast and everything tastes fresh. Consistent"}
{"text":"Honestly, I keep coming back and every time I'm disappointed. Food is mediocre but the service is THE WORST! I'm saying it again, I'm never coming here again."}
{"text":"So you don't come to wakame for the service as it is non existent.     Sushi is VERY middle of the road and that is bing kind.    Sushi was much better when it opened but has gone down hill since.    Check your take out orders as they are notorious for forgetting items.    Shame it is the only decent in the area  UPDATE So we have it yet ANOTHER chance and surprise surprise another fail.  Rolls fell apart upon pick up, they forgot to bring soy sauce and wasabi and asked 2 people to Leo only to be ignored by both.  If you order the salad, before you dress it, empty out the copious amount of water left on the lettuce leaves.   Changing my rating from 2 stars to 1  Found a new place at Bathurst and Steeles called Sushi Wa. A must!!"}
{"text":"***This review is based on take-out only*** Atmosphere: Spacious & modern. Cleanliness: Average to good. Constructive criticism: N/A Cuisine: Japanese/Asian Facilities: N/A Food: Good quality, freshness and aroma. Likeliness of returning or recommending to others: Will return, will reccomend Parking: Private Portion Sizes: Large! Sushi pieces are on the larger side.  Price: Excellent Service: Quick and easy over the phone. 15 min wait only. Paid for food and out the door in a quick time frame. Selection: Their website has their online menu. Many items to choose from. Fantastic Pricing for ther lunch menu. My co-workers and I order all the time!"}
{"text":"Oh Wakame... what happened?! you guys used to have such good quality. I notice once you guys expanded it went downhill.   I had not gone to Wakame Suhsi for over a year or so (This used to be my go to Sushi join). I decides to take someone I know who is not a fan of sushi ( to convert them lol)  and was so embarrassed that I did.  The sushi was pretty much falling apart and not staying intact. There was hardly any fish on the sushi and maki rolls, and quality of the rice was not good.  Lets not forget the servers are just plan rude lol Everyone who has dined here knows that ;)"}
{"text":"I'm from out of town and needed to run to Best Buy and saw this place. I thought it was pretty good.  I wanted to order a la carte, but the server said that actually I would get a better deal for AYCE.  While I didn't order anything above my original order, apparently I saved $3!   The salmon sashimi was quite good and fresh and the green dragon roll had fresh avocado on top.  The tempura is good but the onion rings are more fast food like.    Be warned that the chocolate sundae has peanuts on top and I don't believe it says so on the menu.   4 stars, lost one star because the tablets that you order on should be wiped clean with alcohol between patrons.  Also, the soy sauce seemed watered down, it's not like the kind I use at home (same type/brand)."}
{"text":"I'm loving this place more every time I go.  This is I think the 3rd time now.  First times were AYCE, this time just popped in for a-la-carte.  Had the red dragon roll and the kamikaze roll - both were phenomenal, nice and fresh.  Also had a miso eggplant appetizer - very unique, and quite nice!  For the appetizer, 2 sets of rolls, bottomless pop, and green tea, came to $20 with the 10% cash discount.  That's pretty good value, considering the high quality of the food, and that fed 2 people (admittedly on the lighter side of a meal, but that's what we were going for).  AYCE I think is $21 or $22 pp - not really worth it unless you're a ravenous teenager or a ravenous glutton (hmm..  is there a such thing as a non-ravenous glutton?).  Anyways, those days are behind me (the teenage ones anyways.  I'm still a glutton at times).  Other notables - it's got a lot of tables (though still fills up but no trouble getting seats), it's clean, and service is fast and attentive.  I can't think of a single thing wrong with this visit.  Oh, wait, okay - the wasabi is slightly on the not-spicy-enough side, but I kind of liked that actually (I often unintentionally overspice my soy sauce elsewhere resulting in some hot flashes and/or tears).  Ok enough rambling - it's a 5 people.  If you're in the area, check them out.  Not many sushi places in this neck of the woods (Weston/401) but very easy to get off the 401 so if you're driving by and have a hankering, pop on in."}
{"text":"They deliver, posting cash gets you a discount. Really enjoy their food and their portion sizes. Definitely lots of bang for your buck. We eat here often."}
{"text":"Went here for all you can eat sushi mutiple times while visiting Canada for a month from the United States. Great sushi for a great price BUT the customer service was definitely lacking. During busy days, ie Friday  and Sat, can get quite crowded and be quite close to multiple other customers. (No elbow space). Most wait staff have no concern for customer satisfaction. Overall MENU choices and freshness brought me back again and again. My star rating is for the food options and quality, speed of service. Would have been 5 star if they could improve on customer service. The \"bad\" service may be a culture difference; I am not sure."}
{"text":"the food is great and they're fast to come to delivery I only have one problem I usually give tips to the drivers but once I had no change at all and he didn't either so he kept insisting to ask everyone in my family for change so I could give him a tip I did ask everyone if they had change  they said no  it was embarrassing because he made me do. he got mad cuz I didn't have no change so I had to tell hem that I am going to call the store that it's okay I don't want the order but then he said no it's okay next time you tip me this is why my rating is 3 starts otherwise will be 5 stars it was a really embarrassing moment for me I hope in the future I don't have a problem with a delivery guy no more. Otherwise the foot is grey deliver fast on The Price is fair"}
{"text":"its not bad but not amazing. the kimchi taste bad. the sushi is ok. the server are fast. if your looking for real sushi and sashimi  i will not suggest this place. :)"}
{"text":"Definitly one of the better restaurants in the area. They usually offer pretty good comnbos and deals tlhough I find their menu a bit complicated. The food is pretty decent - no real complaints to be honest but nothing to write home about either. I've got their Kyoto box on a few occassions which is fantastic value for money though I found their Chicken Teriyaki to be a bit strange. It was pretty much grilled/fried chicken with a side of Teriyaki sauce for me to pour over it. It didn't taste too bad but I was expecting something  bit different. Their sushi and maki rolls however are better. I believe they also have an AYCE option for lunch which again I believe is great value."}
{"text":"Did the all you can eat last night and was really satisfied with the quality of the food. It was all very fresh and tasty, even the deep fried items, which can often be stale at all you can eat places."}
{"text":"I was here today for an early dinner. Service was really quick, but they did forget some items, which they brought out equally fast as soon as we asked for them.  The sashimi is really fresh and loved it, but wasn't a fan of the rolls, except the avocado rolls. They do not have red bean ice cream, but their vanilla and mango ice cream is delicious.  The place got very loud and packed as the dinner rush came in. I am glad we were there a little earlier. It is a smaller place.  Overall, it's a good place to get some decent AYCE sushi."}
{"text":"The food are good, sushi are great , but we are not satisfy by services. We had to wait long time for next order. I think they dont have enough waitress ;)"}
{"text":"My last review was a little ambitious as I was trying to raise the rating of this place to the appropriate 4.0 level.   The restaurant is surprisingly large and very clean inside. The establishment is run by a large staff of servers and chefs. It's quite the operation during the lunch hours when it can get quite busy with workers coming in for the AYCE. I personally recommend the lunch specials which are quite good. Where else can you get 2 decent rolls, miso soup and salad for $5.95?!  For its price it's worth a place in my lunch rotation."}
{"text":"I was not happy at the quality of their food. I mainly came here for sashimi fish. The salmon sashimi arrived to our table the slices look very dark like old and it has black spots on most of the pieces. My bf and I Left this place after 10minutes of food serves us , the salmon pieces has little black spots we were suspicious why it hard that on the pieces. We ask that waitress if that is normal she insist us nothing wrong and the other table ate it.  We tried to eat afew piece and found more black spots on the fish pieces. we complaint again they said their nothing wrong with it again. No one took our concerns serious. I told them we will not eat it the salmon slice look sick and discolour with black small spots. Beware Please be careful if something look wrong don't eat it. I told the server the food doesnt look right  it didnt even taste right. If it doesnt taste fresh dont eat it. The restaurant is dim which most people can be fool be the look of the dish.  The manager said that we have to pay for one person meal price is about $30 tax include. I told her i should be paying I only ate a few surf clams. I feel if i dont post about my experience other people will regret going here too. 15minute later  i feel uncomfortable stomach upset I end up puking the food. I was disappointed they ask us to order more after this experience  I hope people read this review and take into consideration our health is important and these business should be shut down. They should be apologizing for serving people \"low quality salmon sashimi\" as the manager said .They still charge me one person meal when they should not. We ate a few piece of the other sashimi only which does not cost $30  I recommend people not to go here someone show send the food inspection.

{"text":"Food is less than mediocre at best. Servers were rude and totally ruin my experience here. Stay away unless you enjoy obnoxious waitress. Will never come here again. Ayce is not worth it.  Pic of half shrimp (?) counts as one piece!"}
{"text":"We sampled a few different types of sushi namely the green dragon roll, rainbow roll and the spicy tuna.  The sushi was okay, tasted fresh.  The fried food was very bland.  The price for the all you can eat was affordable.  The service, however, was atrocious.  The wait staff were rude and miserable.  I would not return or recommend this restaurant to anyone.  Save your money and head to the Annex for better sushi and definitely superior service."}
{"text":"First of all Do Not Take advantage of a holiday to put your prices up !!!! GREEDY!!!  I went there for Valentines Day with my boyfriend looking forward to the all you can eat lunch for him and the lunch bento box for me.   When we arrived there was a letter put up at the entrance saying \"No lunch menu will be served, only dinner menu available to order\" Therefore, they were charging dinner prices for lunch!!! And making patrons have to pay for it, because no one was going to turn around with their date and not eat.   I felt this was extremely greedy on there end.   On top of that my boyfriend paid in cash and  he was expecting change back so that he could select how much to tip.  Well the waitress took the money and never came back with the change!  I will not be coming back to this place again, primarily because of there work ethics and how they decided to profit from there customers. But also because the \"dinner\" I choose was not at all as good as the lunch would of been and it was the same size..... Smh..."}
{"text":"i have eaten at Wakame over the last three to four years. As it is walking distance from home. Excellence has never been a noun I would have ascribed to this establishment.  Food has been uneven and service abysmal. The latter to the point that on a recent visit I brought my own pencil for the all you can eat menu. In response to a previous time where we waited over ten minutes for one.   This week as I attempted to enter the place I was taken aback by the red Dine Safe sign affixed to the door stating the establishment is closed!  An order issued by Toronto's Medical Officer of Health. Done so as a follow-up to a conditional pass issued on March 27th. of this year. It's unfortunate that the owners were given nearly four months to clean up their act and failed to do so.   Now a secondary sign put up by the management reads (and I quote verbatim):  Restaurant Renovation Notice  Dear Our Value Customer To serve you better, we will closed for whole kitchen renovation, We will reopen soon! We are apologize for any inconvenience  Wakame Sushi management  The apology is more than a little late. Akin to a kid expressing regret after they were caught red handed with their hands in the cookie jar. One's health, while dining out and trusting an establishment, has far more potential impact if gone awry than been caught stealing a cookie. I walk by this restaurant several times a week and they're almost always full. So a lack of financial resources to redress the issue of the March conditional pass can't be the reason.  If and when they re-open, consider carefully whether this is a place you'd like to patronize."}
{"text":"Food is average but the service was horrible. They were not friendly we did not get everything we ordered and waited a long time to get the food."}
{"text":"Did AYCE for dinner on a Tuesday night. Sushi quality was excellent however there were limited sashimi options. Our waitress was not the friendliest but her service was good. The restaurant is clean and renovated, overall my experienve was good but didn't blow me out of the water."}
{"text":"Today I went with my boyfriend here and we had  an okay time .. Pros of this place - the dynamite California and seaweed salad was really good and shrimp tempura and spring rolls   Cons - the calamari tempura was too raw and chewy , the hand roll they put too much mayo .. In one of my rolls the avocado was no good and the water was bitter but what really made me disappointed is that the only dragon roll they don't have is the green one  the lunch menu   The staff is not really friendly too .. won't be going back for sure"}
{"text":"Visited here for lunch since I was in the area and I was optimistic to try this sushi place with mixed reviews.   It was awful and absolutely disappointing. Ordered from the A La Carte menu - Chirashi, Spicy Salmon Maki, Mushroom Maki and Vegetable Udon in Soup.   Chirashi was not fresh - the sashimi tasted like it was frozen and thawed to serve in other words it was not fresh. The Spicy Salmon Maki was meh, tasted strange and unlike any other I've had. Portion of the salmon is generous aside from that there was nothing impressive.   My friend ordered the noodles and asked for no onions but was served with onions. The broth tasted weird too and lacked any flavour whatsoever. She asked for no wasabi and ginger with her Mushroom Maki and it came with both. Our server was not apologetic and we had to get a hold of her to inform her each time of the mistakes.   Upon receiving the bill, we told our server the Spicy Salmon Maki tasted strange and wasn't fresh but her \"reason\" was there was nothing she could do about taste. The strange flavour could be due to the lack of freshness of the sashimi but how they store their sashimi. Who knows but if I get an upset stomach over this, I know where to point the blame to. I left upset and regretful that I wasted my time there.   I would rate this 0/5 stars if I could. Don't come here for sushi unless you want to waste your money. Not sure what others are saying about this place!"}
{"text":"Food is good. Limited beef options. Decor is nice & music is awesome. Not pricey for AYCE Washroom needs better lighting & service was quick and very friendly."}
{"text":"when i was living around the area, it was to go to sushi buffet. at  that time dinner is only $18.99 and if you pay cash 10% off. i always went wit hubby and spent less than $ 50 for a sushi buffet it was good. menu is good, not really that many  special rolls but they have red tuna roll which a lot of sushi buffet don't have. i love the volcano roll, it has 3 or 4 different type of fish in side and spicy crab outside. it was  really good.  my last visit is in June this year, i found out the price had been gone up to $20.99, which it  not bad at all but compare to other place with the same price range, its menu is not that compatible. i would rather go to other place to have more selection.  but if you are around and want to eat a lot of sushi, it is a not bad choice."}
{"text":"One of the servers was flat out napping, sprawled across a table when we got there around noon.  The all you can eat was very affordable but unremarkable. All the food seemed to arrive at once and then we had to seek out the bill after two hours there. It was busy but they did not rush us in any way. The tip option allowed for 10% on the credit card machine which surprised me and the server acted very happy when I left more.  The sink area of the bathroom was gross and in a state of disrepair.  Strange place. I don't think I will repeat but for what I paid they deserved more than one star."}
{"text":"The restaurant is clean and comfortable and the price of AYCA is good too. But once you talk about service and food, my talk start changing. Even thought the restaurant is small and it was not busy, the server didn't look at me, rarely came to my table, I needed to stand up and go call the server. Also about the service, they brought more food than we really ordered, and things that I don't eat (like tuna)... because of this, we left some (not much) pieces and they angrily charged us. The food is \"ok\", nothing so tasty... but like the average. I could come back just if I was near by and hungry. But I don't really recommend. :("}
{"text":"Gross. Nothing was fresh. We got the Osaka sushi from the regular menu because we weren't staying long and I'm glad we didn't get all you can eat. The salmon, octopus, shrimp, and even imitation crab meat wasn't fresh. I don't know if it's because it wasn't busy. I would have given it one star, but I gave an extra star for the nice atmosphere and furniture. Bottom line, go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Went to eat, saw they had a conditional pass on their last HEALTH INSPECTION. Asked Manager to show me the report and he said no. Walked out!(Reported it to Toronto Public Health as that is not legal). Will never eat there again!! What are they hiding??"}
{"text":"Ordered teriyaki salmon dinner for take out. Salmon was dry and tasteless, seemed like it was cooked twice just for good measure. The attempt to resurrect salmon using teriyaki sauce from little container failed miserably. I just could eat it. The dinner order came with miso soup and salad. Thankfully I also had premeditated order of coconut shrimp, which wasn't too bad, but could've been much better if it wasn't OVERCOOKED. The waitress from which I picked my order  at the restaurant clearly didn't want to be there. I'm glad I never came here for a sit-down meal."}
{"text":"Living in this area there's not a lot of sushi restaurant but this restaurant is the only place I would go to for sushi. Their all you can eat price is pretty reasonable. The rolls are great, specially their spicy samon rolls, their side food are okay. Overall it's a good place to eat if you live around the area plus it's cheap at lunch time :)"}
{"text":"This is about as average as sushi gets in Toronto; you'll find some good lunch deals but nothing really exceptional. The service here is generally very fast and I've never had my order mixed up in the many times I've been here. I like the cozy booth seating and the line moves fairly quickly too.  The salad could stand to be improved - it's very plain and sometimes it tastes a little frozen. This place probably stays busy because there are not many sushi restaurants up here in this area - I don't think Wakame could compete with most sushi places downtown."}
{"text":"Service was incredibly slow (likely because of two large groups about to leave), Even after they were gone, there was multiple instances where we tried to flag down a waitress, but none were in the dining area at all. We got double of things we ordered, and were missing some other items.  Food-wise, the beef short ribs (kalbi beef) was good. Very juicy and tender (and fatty). The salmon sashimi were large, thin slices but were falling apart. It tasted fine, and was really soft. The maki were less impressive and were poorly presented. The filling to rice ratio was good, but most of the black dragon roll was missing the unagi (eel) top! How they could forget to put the unagi on the rest of the roll, I'll never understand. The ends of the roll were uneven and looked rushed. The spicy salmon sushi had an okay-level of spiciness. The wasabi came in a pool of water.   Free parking (plaza) and cheap $21.95 dinner price on weekdays. They speak Mandarin and English.  Overall, it was average and good enough if I'm in the area because of it's low price."}
{"text":"As per the Yelp rating, this place was awh-ight.  I had reservations for my bf's dad's bday and we were gonna walk away as soon as we saw the \"Conditional Pass\" posted on the window, but we rolled the dice anyway!  Outcome?  No upset stomach, no diarrhea, but no blown away reaction about the food either.  Some people go to AYCE for the selection, others go to stuff their faces silly, some to celebrate an event (not of their own selection), and others, a combo off all of the above.  This was me - minus the stuffing my face silly as I knew I had to judge the Mississauga ribfest within a coupla hours after my trip to Wakame.  :(  To address the variety for lunch, there isn't too much here at Wakame.  Just the usual things, but I was surprised that they didn't have some standards like shrimp tempura.  How could you NOT have shrimp tempura?  Food was just meh, nothing really tasty or stood out.  Tea cups were filled, but service was more going-through-the-motions than actual happy servers."}
{"text":"After 2 years living in the area, I finally was able to swing by here and check it out.  I came in, it was packed. but we were able to be seated quickly and ordered.  It took a while for our food to come out but eventually it did. The waitress was nice but I had a few questions which seemed to trip her up. It wasn't anything too tricky though.  The food was mediocre, passable at most. I could live without it essentially. I found the rolls I ordered bland and the soup the best part of the meal.  I don't see the appeal to this place. I've got a long list of other places that Id go to over here.   That being said, maybe I'm just ordered the wrong things because Wakame has been there for a while and the place is consistently packed....Maybe I'm just wrong."}
{"text":"I've been to Wakame a few times now, and I do enjoy that they offer AYCE sushi and sashimi. Their cheese wontons are amazing, but I agree with some of the other reviewers that their hot food selections are little to be desired. Once while ordering the general tao chicken and the sesame chicken, they seemed like the same sauce, only the latter had sesame seeds thrown on top. As for their service, I can't complain too much. They are fairly busy, so I understand the rushed nature of the waitresses, however there have been a few times where orders have been completely forgotten. Overall, I can't complain...yummy food for a reasonable price!"}
{"text":"We went to Wakame Sushi restaurant for Sunday lunch. The restaurant is nicely decorated, but it was not very crowded. The restaurant was shut down several months ago for health violations, but has reopened. Wakame Sushi is operated by mainland Chinese. The service is grim and unfriendly.  They have an AYCE option, but we ordered the bento boxes. My brother had the sashimi bento box. I had the wakame bento box. My bento box came with 3 slices of sashimi. It has two fried shrimp and grilled chicken. The bento box was good in my opinion. My brother was happy with his bento box.  Would we go back? Probably since there isn't that many restaurants in that area."}
{"text":"Not terrible, but not far off. The fish is bland and tasteless, unless you come on an off-day and it's just got a nice canned tuna aroma. The meat is all chewy, fatty and obviously frozen. The service is pretty atrocious. Can't really think of one positive. Close to work?"}
{"text":"I am not a fan of sushi except for the Sushi at Blow Fish so can't review the sushi at Wakame Sushi but what I can tell you is that all the other 30 items I ordered that weren't sushi were Delicious!!!  First, DO THE ALL YOU CAN EAT ! totally worth it.  I am a big meat lover so I ordered almost every chicken/beef and salmon item on the menu and really pigged out :)  There's not a lot of veggie dishes but I ordered the few that are and these were really good too, especially the slices cabbage, carrots, onions one and the one with the bok choy.    Not a big fan of fried food but even their fried breaded veggies were good.  Again, Dessert - Fried Banana with ice cream ! Don't forget to have them add ice cream on the side for the fried banana.  Although also fried, a must have!"}
{"text":"Came here for ayce lunch and noticed the decor was awesome but that was probably the best part of my visit.  The food was mediocre and a few items that I had ordered many times at other sushi places were surprisingly very different and not in a good way. Tempura chicken with a little dipping bowl of weak tasting sweet and sour is not how sweet and sour chicken is done.  Service seemed erratic and like there wasn't very good communication between everyone. I had put in an order of 2 miso soups, and tempura zucchini along with their mug of Sapporo special, and after 20 minutes I had to remind them of the order.  The price of the lunch was more than what it was worth, I would most likely not come here again."}
{"text":"Very good all you can eat sushi place! Can be a bit slow due to large numbers on Friday and Saturday nights, but worth the wait. Delivers in the area which is a plus! Lunch specials very affordable!"}
{"text":"Food poisoning with a side of terrible service.  We've been ordering and going here for over a year. We know what we get when we go here, terrible service, passable sushi, good prices. You get what you pay for and we bite the bullet when go. We know exactly what to expect.  One thing we never expected was to get food poisoning. My wife and I were sick for almost a whole week. I won't be going back and we'll probably head up the street and pay a bit more money at another place to get safer food with better service."}
{"text":"First time visiter & loved every part of this sushi place. Had \"All you can eat\" (great value for money), quick service & pleasant waitresses. Would go again...hopefully soon."}
{"text":"I like the prices on the AYCE Sushi here. For 4 people 4 dinner it came to $92 incl. taxes. We love the cheese wontons with dipping sauce that are a feature here. Avoid anything labelled as spicy though, because it will be absolutely dripping with spicy mayonnaise to the point you can't taste anything else. With that one caveat, you should be happy here. Nice decor, good service, 10% discount if you pay cash, ATM on site."}
{"text":"Above average place, reasonable price, good food quality.  If you are looking for cheaper prices go on lunch time, if you want sashimi go for dinner.   The only problem is that every time I'm there with friends or family we had to call to remind the waiters to bring us water over 3 times."}
{"text":"Ordered take out: spicy salmon roll, avocado roll, dragon roll. Worst sushi I have ever had. The rice was so old and not chewable! Honestly what a waste of money. I will never order from this place again."}
{"text":"Good quality sushi bar. Love their lunch specials. It could be little bit difficult to find a parking during the lunch hours. However the food quality is good. Definitely recommend this place. Next time want to try their delivery."}
{"text":"Good, Consistent sushi - quick, convenient and their tuna is always fresh. Big recommend!"}
{"text":"I am writing the review as I am sitting in the restaurant. SERVICE SUCKS!!!!!!! All tables around us got served way before us and had to wave three times for any of the servers to pick up out order. Never coming back and I would never recommend it. Cheap rates kill the experience and the appetite I guess."}
{"text":"Good things: Beef/inoki, and beef green onions,  black dragon roll was good, same with green dragon roll, egg sushi was good, eel handroll was good.  -food came fast Bad things:  - the sushi chef coughed (with phlegm in his throat) today behind the counter while making sushi....! DISGUSTING.....they dont wear masks....so i hope he covered his mouth.. - they used chinese shanghainese noodles for their so-called \"yaki udon\" pan-friend udon noodles dish...so this was very disappointing !! There was also an overload on the sauce...which was a basic sweet teriyaki sauce that they also put on the beef/inoki, and the cold tofu.. so many of the dishes had the same flavor as a result.  - Asked for a spoon to help eat the fried rice. It never came.  - spicy salmon sushi pizza lacked flavor. it just tasted like deep fried rice with sashimi on top and some fish roe. -avocado salad was topped with a not so fresh brown avocado piece.. -they give plastic spoons for all clients to eat their ice cream....THIS IS AN EAT-IN RESTAURANT..... it shows the restaurant's lack of care to the environment and lack of commitment to the sustainability of the earth."}
{"text":"It's a decent AYCE sushi place, went here for lunch and was very busy. Service not so great but that's what you expect from AYCE during peak hours. This is the better sushi joint out of the very few in the neighbourhood."}
{"text":"The familia and I were having intense sushi cravings when a flyer for Wakame Sushi happened to be placed on our kitchen counter. Without much hesitation, we called and ordered some sushi for delivery, as we were in no mood to go out that night.   We ordered several sushi items, including the snow roll, mango roll, dragon roll, and some others I can't remember. We also ordered assorted vegetable tempura and scallop katsu.   The food arrived in about an hour and the total was $40. Not bad, I guess?   The tempura was really cold and didn't taste like tempura at all, and the scallop katsu pieces were TINY, which was sad because I was looking forward to it!   The sushi itself was decent. Fresh fish, I guess, but the sushi in the boxes were such a mess. I couldn't distinguish which sushi was which, so that wasn't fun. All ingredients seemed to be fresh, which earned the 3 stars.   Overall, I was a bit disappointed because my sushi craving was not fulfilled the way I had wanted it to. Maybe delivering sushi wasn't the best idea, but I don't want to blame myself for the terrible boxing of the sushi and the cold/disgusting tempura.   Maybe I'll try this place again, but no more delivery!"}
{"text":"Average AYCE sushi place with decent prices. The place isn't too busy so I've never had to wait for a table. The service is decent. They put too much rice for the nigiri I find and it's often pretty dry. The sashimi isn't cut evenly either, with a larger piece on one end.   Tip: 10% off when paying by cash, but everyone at the table has to pay by cash for the discount."}
{"text":"Lunch Specials at Wakame Sushi are cheap starting from $5.95.  Will I come back again? Not really!!  Narrow driving lanes and crazy drivers that doesn't follow the one way directions doesn't help with the experience.  Sushi Combo 4 ($7.50) - The shari rice was done quite good - The California Roll was A-OK! - The Nigiri sushi though really disappointing! Fish was sliced so thin and have the tuna looks frightfully red and the rest of the selections were kind of dry  Services though were fast and efficient!   I can definitely practice my Mandarin here as staffs were talking loudly to each other in the language.  AYCE during lunch is $12.95. I definitely going to pass on the offer!"}
{"text":"I am going to give it 4 stars for being what it is supposed to be - a good cheap local sushi hotspot.... there isn't much in the Downsview area, unless you bolt all the way over to the Yonge/Sheppard area which means driving, paying for parking and paying more (not thanks!!).   Today I visited there for lunch and we had the \"all you can eat menu\". This menu is typically $12.95 on weekdays and $13.95 on Saturdays/Sunday and Holidays. If you pay cash there is a 10% discount though. They will ask you this just before giving you your bill.   Having lived in Tokyo, Japan for 7 years, this obviously is not a world-renowned sushi spot, or for that matter, a star in the Toronto scene, but is a great local spot when you feel like some cheap sushi at lunch time... On a positive note as well, their Chicken Katsu wasn't too bad, as was the Yakitori. Wasn't impressed with the Crab rolls, but everything else was pretty good (salmon sushi, salmon/avocado rolls, tuna rolls, dynamite rolls, california rolls, red dragon rolls, etc...) - Squid tempura wasn't that great so wouldn't recommend ordering that...   Will be back again soon given that it is only a short 10 minute walk away!  D"}
{"text":"I've been going there since it opened, and it is hands down best japanese buffet food in the area. Its a great places to go becuase alot of the good buffets are far. Now the place has alot of buisness and I'm glad it wont close down from what I can see!"}
