{"text":"OMG.  Love their food.... My BF and I like to eat tapas so we always order a few appetizers and maybe a meal to share but tonight we ordered the steamed clams and the stuffed banana peppers.  The butter sauce my little clammies were swimming in was so yummy and the peppers were huge and oh so delish!  Highly recommend either or both. Our waitress.... humm, was it Tracy or Tara? Anyway, she was terrific.  The TV's are plastered everywhere so I'm guessing you won't miss a moment of any highlight.  It can be crowded at times especially on the weekends, so you may need to call ahead or belly up to the bar for a while.  That's OK they have huge 16oz. beers that are fairly inexpensive.  I totally recommend this place.  It doesn't disappoint."}
{"text":"Have consistently had great service and great food. Love the cheese pasta purses!"}
{"text":"Party of 6 for lunch.  Service was wonderful and everyone was very pleased with their meal choices. Loved my mahi wrap but did it minus the dressing.  Very flavorful.  Will definitely visit again when we are in the area."}
{"text":"Great bar/pub.  There burger with pimento cheese is amazing, although probably not very heart friendly! (You don't have burgers for your health so I guess it does not matter).  There ribs basted with coca cola were pretty good.  Only hint I have ever had there that could use some work is their chicken soup. it was pretty salty."}
{"text":"Love, love, love Killington's. Great family friendly atmosphere. Plenty of big screens with sports playing that my husband loves. My fav dish is the Salmon PLT. Salmon and pancetta fancied into the traditional BLT. Can't go wrong either with the black bean burger, fish fry, Killington's salad or the Caesar salad....which is my daughter's fav. They have awesome daily drink specials as well."}
{"text":"The food was excellent but I was disappointed they didn't have a larger beer selection. They were out of four or five draft beers at 7 o'clock on a Saturday night."}
{"text":"Dined here for the first time on Friday.  The decor and atmosphere was impressive.  It was very crowded but had no problem being seated near the bar.  Very comfortable mid-scale vibe.  The menu was impressive looking, but the food was disappointing.  The appetizers and entrees we ordered were bland and under seasoned.  My guess is that this was a product of who was in the kitchen on this patrticular night and not reflective of the food in general.  I would be willing to give this place one more chance, because it really is a nice concept."}
{"text":"Last time was terrible. Late night and no one cared. 
This time much better. Quick beer and appetizer at bar and all good. 
Had Crab Capreze. Low grade crab meat but the whole dish was tasty. 
Friendly \"what'll it be\" style of service. Is what it is. 

Will come again."}
{"text":"One of our favorite restaurants ever! We have never been disappointed here. The tomato bisque is delicious, salads are fresh and HUGE. My husband never strays from the gastro pub burger. The black bean burger is my new fave, but keep an eye on their daily specials too. I've only ever had room for dessert one time, and it was also excellent."}
{"text":"After reading the reviews and our daughter and son-in-law recommendation we went here after we arrived in Charlotte last evening. We ordered the quesadilla starter, which I thought was exceptionally heavy. The same applied to my chicken entree which was overwhelmed by the mozzarella and the mashed potatoes. The chicken itself was well seasoned. My wife called her shrimp salad boring. Out daughter liked her pasta purses, and was pleased she was offered cocked add-on. The final adult entree was the pork chop, which was thin, but the most successful. Kids enjoyed their food, especially the chicken fingers.
Will we go back? Probably not."}
{"text":"Can someone please open a halfway decent bar in huntersville?  How this place remains as busy as it is is a mystery to me. The service is among the worst I've ever had - whether it is busy or not expect the bartenders and servers to be completely in the weeds and generally unprofessional.  Food is just ok."}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice and it was not anything special. The staff is nice and attentive and the restaurant is very family friendly. During the day the interior is nice enough but at night the lighting is horrible. You feel as though you are under interrogation lights. Also, do not order the calamari! It is covered in some sesame goop so you can not even taste the calamari. The menu is very disjointed, trying to appeal to many different palates and not doing anything one thing really well. I would rather not go back but would not refuse if friends wanted to meet up, I would eat before hand and save the money."}
{"text":"This place needs to have babies and reproduce like wild fire. Everything is WONDERFUL here!!!! I go here all the time and have ordered almost everything on their menu. I have never had a complaint about anything. Def one of my faves!!"}
{"text":"Me and my wife have been here many times. We have yet to recieve poor service or a meal less than five stars. This is probably my favorite restaurant in the Charlotte area. 

I would recommend the meatloaf as it is one of the best dishes I have ever eaten. But anything on the menu is great. 

Seriously, why are you still reading this review....go and eat at Killingtons!"}
{"text":"For the money,  can't go wrong.  The smoked duck wrap and gastropub burger are rock'n. Salads are great too."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and always try something new. Everything is delicious. This time I had the smoked duck wrap. It was amazing. The homemade chips are delicious as a side.
There is no bad choice on the menu. 

Service is always good, one end is a bar so you can have a drink while waiting in a table although I've never had to wait. Great entrees and peanut butter pie for dessert."}
{"text":"Can get busy, food can take a while, but it's always good.. usually just go for lunch, and can only comment on the burger/French dip and meatloaf sandwich, but all 3 are stellar! Meatloaf sandwich is one of the best I have ever had. Just be mindful if you go at 12 noon, lunch service may take a while as they get very busy."}
{"text":"Really reasonably priced and delicious food. The grits, Mac and cheese, pimento cheeseburger, and so much more are amazing!"}
{"text":"This restaurant came highly recommended and I was highly disappointed.  I gave it two stars because it is easy to find, the parking was good and the waitress was pleasant enough and the restaurant was clean.  I ordered the Pub Fish Fry.  The menu  described as being topped with cucumber salad which turned out to be one very thin sliver of cucumber, one sliver or carrot and a slice of lemon.  The fish batter was pure grease and the fries beneath the fish were limp and greasier than the fish.  It came with a very small amount of citrus jalapeno slaw.  There was no citrus flavor and certainly no jalapeno whatsoever.  When the waitress came to remove my plate, 98% of my meal was left ... all the potatoes, all the greasy fish crust and about half the slaw.  Never was I asked by the waitress how my food was.  I left the restaurant starved,"}
{"text":"Three words... BLACK BEAN BURGER.  Even if you're not a vegetarian, do yourself a favor and order this.  It will change your life."}
{"text":"Been in the area for 2 weeks and this is my second time back. Food is very good and a nice tap selection. Service is great and asked for Victoria's section after the first visit. Will be back."}
{"text":"This is a great place for dinner and drinks on a Friday night. They serve my favorite Great Lakes beer and I've never had a bad meal. On the contrary, the menu has great variety and the kitchen takes care to put out fresh, well crafted food. And by the way, our server, Brittany was top notch. She never let my glass go dry."}
{"text":"Had a great dinner there last night!  I have to say the menu has something for everyone and the prices are very reasonable.

Had the steamed clams and chicken wings both very good.  I would recommend this place to a group of people with diverse tastes.

Good Luck!"}
{"text":"This is a great place in exit 23. Excellent for a nice meal and excellent for just sitting at the bar. Great service. The only con is that get pretty busy Friday and Saturday night. In the menu need more wings sauce alternatives and sometimes they tend to be small. Otherwise no complaints."}
{"text":"Good restaurant with a neighborhood feel. The server was pleasant and helpful. Food was tasty, although kinda safe in most regards, I did like the beer and wine selection. I wish there was more of a patio that was not right by the parking lot (unless I missed it). Nice bar area- I'm sure this is a good spot for televised games.  We'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Food is excellent. Really excellent. Kind of wish restaurant was in a more exciting spot, but food is so good I'll overlook it."}
{"text":"We've gotten food from here a few times when we're having a \"cheat day\" and everything has been really good! Our favorites include the cola braised ribs, sweet chili wings, and the white cheddar serrano grits. Consistently good food and service whether we dine in or get take-out!"}
{"text":"The food here is absolutely amazing. This place is truly a hidden gem. There tomato soup is awesome. I had the pasta purses which from tavern places as never been a good experience but this was truly awesome experience. Service was great. Staff seemed genuinely care about the experience that was happening around them and doing there best. The restaurant itself overall was very clean. I didn't get to meet/see management so I can't comment on how they are but everything else was great and that's why I rate this place the way I did."}
{"text":"I'm generally a fan of Killingtons. The place advertises itself as a \"gastropub,\" and though I'm more interested in the \"pub\" part, it's really good. Their burgers are normally to die for, and the beer list is reasonable. I've also had the Rosedale Chicken, which is good, and my father always orders the fish plate, which he loves. Portions are also big (of everything except the fries, it seems). The service was also good, and while the place is a bit minimalist, it's nice.

I have noticed that the food has fallen off just a bit from what I'm used to. I normally go to Killingtons every time I come into town to visit family, and this last time the burger wasn't quite as juicy. A minor thing, but rather disappointing as these were my favorite burgers."}
{"text":"Love this place! 
The food is always on par with an excellent selection of spirits, cold brew on tap, and wine! Last Friday I was in they had a band playing in the dining area building on a well established ambiance for all! 
The bar tenders rock as well- Big thanks to FOH/BOH staff for keeping it real! Cheers!"}
{"text":"I had a performance review/feedback lunch here with a couple of my bosses. I didn't know about this place but it seemed interesting. It was at Exit 23, just veer left as you exit but then stay on the right lane as you turn. It will be close to the Harris Teeter on the right side, after the first light, I believe. We got in at around 1130am so it was still a bit empty, but it got crowded as we finished. 

Okay, so on with the food. 

I ordered the shrimp and garlic ravioli ($15). It was described as having tomato basil cream sauce with sun-dried tomatoes. I am a big fan of all things tomato + cream or a mix of the classic pasta sauces so I was excited about this one!

The food came in about 10 minutes so it was reasonable. It was on a huge white deep plate and was mostly pink or light pink in color. I suppose there weren't enough tomatoes/tomato sauce in it. Still, it looked good. I would say there were about 10-12 pieces of ravioli - they weren't huge pieces, just big enough to be cut once in the middle with a fork.

The taste was excellent! It had a good balance of tomato-ey and creamy taste (even if it did look like it didn't have enough of the tomato part) and the raviolis were soft and warm. I couldn't taste much of the shrimp part though, mostly it was the garlic. Not that you were biting into garlic pieces in the ravioli, but the taste was a more garlic flavor. I also wish there were more sun-dried tomatoes because it really enhanced the flavor of the raviolis! Nonetheless, there was enough sauce for me to stay happy and I even had a piece of bread to really sweep the sauce off the plate!

My only peeve about this place is the crappy server. Good thing I can't remember her name, but she wasn't the usual cheery crew in every other restaurant. She didn't ask if I wanted more water, she just took my glass as I was holding it. She didn't ask if we liked our food or how our food was at least. Other than that, I would still try and go back to sample the other items in their menu. Parking was easy, the place wasn't loud even when the lunch crowd came in, and the furniture was comfortable and easy. I still recommend it with 4 stars!"}
{"text":"I've been to Killington's three times.  First time I went I thought I've found a new spot, but it hasn't quite worked out that way.  There's a lot that I really like about it, and sometimes it's been great but not consistently so for me.  So if it's just me I might eat there, but I'm not confident enough of the whole experience to bring someone else.

Food
Bacon Encrusted Meatloaf  was seriously good comfort food, the garlic mashed potatoes were the perfect side.  Really nicely put together.  Gastro Pub burger was big and tasty - there was plenty of it and I enjoyed it.  The Cuban sandwich just did not do it for me, more like a ham sandwich and definitely not Cuban bread.  How can you have a Cuban sandwich without the bread?  The Menu is impressive - maybe it's just challenging to consistently deliver on such a wide array of Wow items.   They apparently have quite a beer selection- this may be wonderful if that's your thing but it's not mine.

Service
Usually pretty quick and friendly but it depends.  The problem is I'm not exactly sure what it depends on.  Maybe the attitude is more like, make yourself at home.  Which is good, except I can't just go to the fridge, I need the waitstaff to bring it to me.

Environment
Always very clean which is a big plus.  The seating, decor, music are pretty straightforward, the environment doesn't seem to have received the extra special attention that the menu has.  

Value
When it works, the value is great!  But when it doesn't it feels really overpriced.

Bottom Line
Maybe I just don't understand Killingtons.  Maybe I'm looking at is as a restaurant, and it's actually more of a pub.  So if you're looking for a pub that has better than average food, this may be a great place for you.  That's not what I'm looking for."}
{"text":"I absolutely love this place! In the mood for a salad? They have great salads. In the mood for a great burger? They have a great burger - you know, the type that you so thoroughly enjoy so you have no regrets. Fish? Yep - love their options (esp. the salmon). Vegetarian? Yep - love the black bean pita sandwich. From up North? They have Beef on Weck and great fried fish. Great apps, great sides, great service. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"The food is very good, the service is great and they have a decent beer selection.   The place is clean, but noisy ..... what you would expect at a sports bar."}
{"text":"It had been over a year since we ate at Killinton's. Frankly our previous visit was not good. This visit to the causal restaurant was much different. The service was great and the food was excellent. This will turn into a monthly stop."}
{"text":"Service is spot on. Server checked on us and manager was also walking the floor checking on people. Never had a bad meal here except had a so-so meal Wednesday. I tried their special, roast beef sandwich on onion roll with fries. The beef was a little fatty, dry, and had chewy parts.  Service was 5 stars food 2 stars. I'll stick with what I know for next time."}
{"text":"The mushroom ravioli is absolutely amazing!!! Friend got the French dip sandwich and said it was alright, other friend got the fried fish meal and thought it was good. Big portions, especially the small plate of fish (nothing small about it!). Ambiance was a but loud, but otherwise fine. Wait staff was very nice. Seriously though, get the mushroom ravioli."}
{"text":"I had the best tomato soup ever and the Rosedale chicken is just awesome. I alway eat at this place when I'm close by. Never disappointed me. I will be going back for sure. Highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Nice atmosphere for a simple dinner or lunch. Menu is short and sweet and they have a good variety of drinks. Food was good and bartenders were humorous. Good place to watch sporting events. Not a bad place to bring children or girlfriends."}
{"text":"Excellent food and atmosphere. Traveling on I-77 - convenient off the highway. Nice area and very good food. I had the black bean burger on pita. Very large portion. Had Gouda Mac and cheese. Very good Mac and cheese, would've liked it better without the breaking around it though. Daughter had the mahi wrap as a pita. It was great. 
Very attentive service. Reasonable prices. Definitely will stop there again."}
{"text":"First visit here.  Had black bean burger with sweet potato and corn hash (had red/green peppers and onions).  Large portions, both excellent.  Good selection of beers both tap and bottle.  Nice kids menu that included fruit and a drink.  Quick, friendly service.  Much better than your average pub food.  Good place for families, friends or just stopping for a drink after work.  I will definitely go back ."}
{"text":"Loved this place.  Food came in large portions and was fresh, hot, and delicious.  Service was good.  Great location was walking distance from nice neighborhood.  I'll go again!"}
{"text":"I had the Cuban sandwich and homemade fries. I had ordered the same thing in a very popular Cuban restaurant in Ft. Lauderdale just 2 days ago and Killingtons was MUCH better in every way, the service was outstanding and very quick at lunch. This will be a regular stop for me when I am in the area."}
{"text":"Every time I have been in (lunch/dinner), the food was excellent! I have ordered to go and was just as pleased with my order. The staff is always around to check on us and don't disappear like in some places! Maybe once, my drank went empty a few minutes but this place still deserves 5 stars! 
I especially love your St. Patty's Day meal year after year!"}
{"text":"I though RI Ra's downtown was good, this place blows it away.  They advertise as  a pub, but the food is good, resturant quality.  The staff is FAST AND COUTEOUS.  ( YOU USUALLY DO NOT GET FAST SERVICE IN NC )  The food is excellent.  I like their burgers, fish, wings and salads.  3 people-  food, 4 beers and dessert == 60 bucks, including tip.  You will be happy."}
{"text":"The food is surprisingly good.
The staff is friendly and the kitchen is pretty fast.
It does get loud and you don't want to go when a major sporting event is going on."}
{"text":"This edition of Excited about Eating takes us north of Charlotte to Huntersville and to the first gastro pub in Mecklenburg County, Killington's Restaurant & Pub. This pub located in Rosedale Shopping Center has a great atmosphere with outstanding food and covered outdoor seating. They claim to serve \"high quality food in a casual atmosphere.\" After our experience, we'd agree.

As an appetizer, we ordered a cup of chili sprinkled with cheese, a smattering of onions and a few tortilla chips. This chili had robust flavor and included at least three different types of beans, chick, black and pinto, and the spice level was perfect. Dora here....coughing. Yeah, perfect for one of us. Maybe that's why I chugged two full glasses of iced tea before the main course arrived. Yowza! :) 

On weekends Killington's offers some additional brunch items to cover those appetites craving a breakfast alternative. I chose a brunch special: steak kabobs and poached eggs served over home fries with sourdough toast. The kabobs consisted of colorful red and green peppers and onions and were blanketed with salsa verde. The steak was cooked perfectly, the veggies still had a crunch, and the salsa verde was the perfect complement for the dish. Outstanding, and I'd definitely order this again!

Dora here. So many items on the menu were calling out my name, but I finally decided on the Monte Cristo, ham, turkey and Swiss cheese piled on sourdough French toast sprinkled with powdered sugar and raspberry preserve for dipping. Oh my!! It's been ages since I enjoyed a Monte Cristo. The batter on the bread was light and subtle, not eggy, and the raspberry jam took this sandwich from ordinary to lick-my-fingers delicious! 

Oh, and the outdoor covered patio was so relaxing, not too loud or hot, the best spot to enjoy this summer lunch. 

We rate this restaurant 5 forks out of 5 for a family friendly restaurant serving outstanding food.

{"text":"Just found this place and loved everything about it! 

The Fish and Chips was the table favorite the day we went for lunch. The servings are huge so we each had leftovers. Service was very good and the place overall just had a cool vibe. I will be back!"}
{"text":"All I can say is I will not be visiting this establishment again. We were looking for some place close to home that had good food and good draft beer. So, we checked out Yelp and decided to give this place a try.

Half of the beers they had on their menu were no longer on tap. The replacements were mediocre at best. The menu had pasta, coleslaw or mac n cheese as a side or main component in every dish. The dish descriptions made me think I was a diner at Ramsey's Kitchen Nightmares.

I decided to play it safe with Pub Fish and Chips and swapped out the coleslaw for a veggie. Big mistake...the fish was tasteless and the hand cut fries tasted like burnt grease. 

Hubby ordered the Linguine and Clams. He said the dish was good, but several of the clams were not open. He asked the waiter if the unopened clams could be replaced and they were after we had finished our meal.

The manager did come out and apologized. He also told us that the kitchen staff should have pried the unopened clams open. At that point I just cringed because the only reason a clam would not open on its own is because it was not cooked or it was dead before it hit the pan.
Hubby summed up the experience best with, \"We should have gone to Showmars.\""}
{"text":"I would give this 2.5, but since you can only do whole numbers I had to round down.  My husband and I went here for the first time on a Saturday night at about 7:30 or 8:00.  It was of course busy, but there wasn't a wait and there were a couple of empty tables.  We both ordered a beer, I was given the wrong beer and they didn't bring me a glass for my bottled beer which I thought was odd.  We ordered the spinach and cheese dip appetizer which was very cold and pretty unappetizing.  Then I ordered a spinach salad and my husband order a half rack of ribs.  Both were just so-so.  The service however could have redeemed this visit for us and made us want to give it another try but it was just such poor service that we definitely won't be back.  The waitress was inattentive, only stopping by sporadically and usually forgetting to bring whatever we asked for (I asked for a water which I never did get).  Plus she completely forgot about us after bringing the bill and after about 20 minutes of waiting my husband had to get up and take it to her to run our card.  All in all, mediocre food and very marginal service.  There are better places for a beer and a bite than this one."}
{"text":"Great restaurant.  We went here to celebrate a birthday.  My in-laws had been going frequently but did not share the details.  My therapist filled me in on some great dishes and desserts...and I just had to go!   I was not disappointed.  Our party of 8 was accommodated with an early reservation.   I look forward to returning but hopefully if the party is a large one...we can pull some tables together and move away from the entrance.  The booth was fine...just too close to all of the traffic coming into the restaurant.  I may just order the fish platter again...which was enough fish for at least 3 meals!!  And was very good.  The dessert...the peanut butter pie...was amazing!!!  And just so rich.  Looking forward to going back soon!"}
{"text":"We were looking for a place to get a beer and some good food with my boyfriend's family in Huntersville and stumbled upon Killingtons, and I am glad we did.  They have a small but concise beer menu, including Oskar Blues Gordon's Ale, which is a rare find on tap.  The food was perfect from appetizers to entrees.  

We had the toasted ravioli as an appetizer.  The cheese inside the ravioli was delicious, not to melty, not oily like some cheese can get when hot.  

I ordered a Caesar salad because I they make all their dressing in house.  I was expecting a small but well made salad.  Out comes this gigantic bowl of salad with every single piece of lettuce perfectly coated with dressing and Asiago & Parmegiano Reggiano cheeses.  I was so full from the huge salad that I had a hard time eating my entree!  

I ordered the Killingtons Dip, a French Dip with Au Jus.  They use medium rare top round and it tasted like it was just sliced.  It was perfect.  The Waitress said it was their most popular menu item and I can understand why.  I got the fries as a side, which were double fried, soft yet crispy.  

My boyfriend had the bacon encrusted meatloaf sandwich with mushroom gravy and homemade chips which he thoroughly enjoyed.  The chips were also wonderful, crunchy but not greasy. 

Everyone at the table was so pleased with their food that the next morning they suggested seeing if Killingtons served breakfast!

Our server was wonderful and patient with us.  It's a great place to grab a beer, watch a game on one of the numerous flat screen tvs or take your family out for dinner.  The menu is varied, from burgers to Grand Marnier spaghetti.   I just wish it was closer to us in Uptown!"}
{"text":"Excellent staff, food is much better than your standard bar/pub food. I've been here many times and never had a bad meal, drink, or service.  Everyone does a great job there and it is always clean."}
{"text":"Ok, so with a drink menu that includes a \"bacon old fashion\" and a food menu with \"bacon encrusted meatloaf\" can't be all bad, right? Damn straight right! Both of the above items are great by the way.

Nice casual  drinks and comfort food."}
{"text":"Went there for the first time on Friday.  This is definitely not a quiet restaurant.  It has a great bar atmosphere and the bartenders are friendly and know their stuff.   Sitting down to eat, the service was good for a very busy night.  

 I had the fish fry.  I think the fish was previously frozen. The batter coating was nice and crispy, but was bland.  The portion was huge.  I don't think I can recommend it."}
{"text":"Great wings, AHHMAZING stuffed banana peppers. The Bloody Mary are amazing. Vanessa is the best!!"}
{"text":"Good lunch spot. Haven't come back for late night drinks and appetizers.  However, food portions are massive and great value. Definitely consider sharing!"}
{"text":"What a nice surprise while driving up north for the holidays.  It was getting around dinner time, and we in in North Carolina, so searched for restaurants near us and didn't want a chain restaurant.  Killington's popped up and we liked what we saw on the menu so we stopped in.  It must be popular because there were few parking spots available within walking distance.  Everyone was friendly, the hostesses, our waitress and even the owner (manager) who stopped by our table to check on everything.    I ordered the toasted ravioli for an appetizer since I never had one.  I guess toasted is better than fried.  There was enough for two to share and they were very good.  My wife had the buffalo chicken soup which she enjoyed immensely.  Next came dinner; my wife had the salmon spinach salad and I, the small plate pub fish fry.  And I am glad I order the small plate because that piece was huge!  I couldn't finish it.  The salad was large also but my wife was hungry.  No desserts or specialty drinks and no problems here.  All in all, it is a friendly Gastro pub with a large portions and pleasant staff.  Will stop by, if we are in the area again."}
{"text":"I give this place 5 stars for the wings alone. I've had many other items from the menu as well and I'm never disappointed but if you want great WINGS, look no further. They are meaty, crispy, saucy & you can even get all drums if you'd like. Make sure to try the \"Gold Rush\" wings, perfect blend of heat & sweet. :)

Good service, great food, nice atmosphere (not like most bars), great place to watch the games or just have a drink."}
{"text":"Good food great beer selection. Service = hit and miss, usually it is a hit. I think they're trying to do too much. Too many items on the menu to do all of them great. Specialize in something and stick with it. If its good (French dip with horsey sauce and most appetizers) then it's real good. However some items are just a miss. All in all though I\"ll keep going especially on game days. Extremely good on NFL Sundays."}
{"text":"Overpriced, foods mediocre, they are supposed to be a gastro pub, it's seems they just say that so they can charge more. My mom got the rose dale chicken. It had spinach on the side that was way over salted. The staffs response was basically sucks for you heres your bill. I won't be going back. I will say the wings and blue cheese were good but over priced. Overall not as impressive as the check at the end of the night would lead you to believe."}
{"text":"Good meatloaf entree with mashed potato side and green beans. We had an early dinner and they had friendly service even with the crowds."}
{"text":"Sarah is awesome! She knew her beers. Made food suggestions, offered substitutions.
We have eaten so many places she is on point! 
Food wise..
The Mac and cheese was great. Creamy, baked with some bread crumb crust. Not typical cheese or noodles.
Friend dip was great, fresh, seasoned.
Bayou pasta great flavor,  cooked well. Lots of food. Chicken was not chewy cooked perfect.
Chicken rosedale was a breast not on the bone, side of awesome green beans and garlic potatoes. 
Before we left we asked Sara her choice of a shot... breakfast shit!!  BACON vodka , vanilla and ok chaser! 
Yumm
This place is a hidden jem! 
Oh forgot the Caesar salad the BEST Caesar dressing! 
Gladly drive 30 min to eat there again (and have 3 times before this) 

I can't come up with a complaint!!"}
{"text":"Delightful neighborhood restaurant that's quick for lunch and never sacrifices taste. Wonderful atmosphere inside, and great patio seating.. Kilingtons is one of my top places to go when we can't think of anywhere else. The Killingtons Dip, Turkey Pita, Meatloaf, Killingtons Salad... Are just a few excellent choices. I've never had a bad meal here. The clams are even delicious for a restaurant that doesn't consider themselves a seafood hot spot. Everything is hot, fresh, and plated beautifully. Service is great, and the vibe is wonderful."}
{"text":"This place is usually a pretty good lunch spot. For dinner not so much unless your good with pub food. Service tonight was awful however this is not always the case, I just think it was an off night. The best tip I can give you from this experience; don't order the $9.00 soup and salad combo. I also opted to add crab cakes another &6.00, not worth the price paid. The salad is not entree sized and lacks any substance. What you get is s side salad portion with greens and some shredded carrots and a couple cherry tomatoes. Don't look for any other veggies they are not hidden under the lettuce."}
{"text":"Stuffed banana peppers where the bomb. Another great place to visit next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"Terrible food compared to the hype that my hotel,  and the patrons next to me had prepared me for.  My queso appetizer was cold and my steak was tough, the only 2 things that mattered was good beer,  and a decent staff."}
{"text":"Nice place.  Stopped in for lunch and the place was pretty crowded.  Server was very nice and the food was really good.  Homemade dressings - you could tell after one bite.  Very fresh! Will definitely be back!"}
{"text":"Great service! Three different people stop to make sure our experience was amazing!  And the calamari was outstanding."}
{"text":"I'm just going to throw you guys another 5 star review, I still stop by from time to time, but forget to update.  Thanks for having some of the best bar food in Charlotte, much less Huntersville, it really means a lot.  Can't wait to see you again.

Love,

{"text":"good food ~ we picked up a burger, salad with salmon and cheesesteak plus peanut butter pie OMG do it!!!"}
{"text":"I have been here several times recently and have to say, it's the best I have had in the Huntersville/Lake Norman area. The environment is casual but the food is definitely upscale. I can't say enough how much I love the food here. Who would have thought to pair Whiskey  Maple Pork Chops with Grits and Asparagus? Yummy! Favorite sandwich here so far is the Turkey Pita with Avocado and a berry mayo, delicious! I haven't tried it all but I will because Killington's is our new spot!"}
{"text":"Killingtons is a great place to grab some food and drinks. I have been here several times and it is always consistent. The pepperjack spinach cheese dip is a great appetizer choice. They have excellent sandwich choices as well. It is a true pub and has a neighborhood feel to it. The staff and service is excellent as well as the atmosphere. I wouldn't bring kids here later on in the evening as it tends to have a bar feel to it."}
{"text":"Food is great. Quick out of the kitchen. The service however is very poor. Server started serving us and ended up across the bar without saying a word having drinks. The bartender that Took over gave ok service. The food is definitely way better than the service they should work on training for their servers and bartenders"}
{"text":"This place is way better than I expected it to be! From the outside, I couldn't tell that it would have an open feel, high ceilings, lots of TVs, new decor, and a huge space. 

It's not just your average neighborhood pub, either -- they have more than just greasy fish 'n' chips and Guinness on the menu. (Come to think of it, I'm not even sure they HAVE either of those things on the menu.) Try their chicken wings, but remember to get a big glass of water or a fresh beer before you dig into the hot garlic flavor. 

Friendly staff, quick service. Grab a seat at the bar and watch your favorite game, but remember to save a chair for me!"}
{"text":"I was in the area around lunch time and after looking at the reviews on Yelp, decided to stop in for a bite to eat.  I was seated immediately and quickly perused the menu.  

Initially, I was going to get a salad, but then I spied the Grilled Mahi Caesar Wrap. (chipotle rubbed mahi with romaine, parmesan, and caesar dressing, served in jalapeno cheddar wrap
for $8.75).   I asked them to serve the dressing on the side, and the fish was flavorful enough on its own so that I didn't even need the dressing.  I decided to splurge and order the hand-cut fries as my side. The fries were fresh and tasty.

The only downside to my meal was the service which was slow and just not quite up to par. However, the food was good and the prices were reasonable, so I would certainly eat here again if I happened to be in the neighborhood."}
{"text":"Killingtons has usually been pretty solid over the years. Don't know what's going on of late, but it's just been \"meh\".  Consistency in the food has been lacking.  Still, the \"go to\" has been the ribs, for me. 

Will stick my head in the door a few more times before I just pop smoke and say... \"OK, I'm done\"."}
{"text":"I have been going to Killingtons for awhile now. I've never had a bad meal and have ordered a variety of items. Their soups are made fresh everyday and by far the black bean burger is the best I have ever had. You can't go wrong. It's food is way above your standard \"bar food\". Everything is fresh and you can tell too. I'm there once a week and still trying new items and, well...they are amazing. Give it  try next time your hungry in Huntersville."}
{"text":"I had just gotten a facial and was hungry and decided to try Killingtons. I called in my order and it was ready upon my arrival. I ordered the steak salad and had them sub out the feta cheese for goat cheese which was perfection. I also tried the balsamic peppercorn dressing, I inhaled the salad.

I ordered a burger for my son. I'm sure it was good because he didn't complain. I almost inhaled his fries. The fries were great! I will be back to try other menu items. It was a typical pub-type restaurant with televisions playing sports and a sizeable bar area."}
{"text":"I was fairly impressed per my initial experience here. I used Yelp to scout this place, and was a little hesitant when I rolled up- I was expecting more \"Irish\"...? Anyway, I'm glad I decided to stick around. 

After we were seated and told the beer specials for that particular Tuesday, I was like \"oh hell yeah I'll take that Yuengling for $1.50!\" But, of course $1.50 for a 9oz beer is about right for that particular volume. Lol. Not bad though, I feel like I can sip and enjoy a more limited supply of brew like that than with the full pint. 

The menu was absolutely fantastic and definitely the joints best quality. I recommend giving it a try. I had the portobello wrap stuffed with portabello, roasted red peppers, lettuce, and feta cheese. It was pretty delish. Can't wait to go back for some of their pulled duck dishes!"}
{"text":"The food is consistently good, but nothing has knocked my socks off in by dozen or so ventures there. Solid wine menu and good location in huntersville. I have enjoyed watching the game at the bar there more than sitting and dining with my family. Service is inconsistent. Sometimes I get a happy and attentive server and other times I'm struggling to flag someone down."}
{"text":"Oh my! Where do I start? There is nothing on this menu that you will find on any other menu ! I love small town living but then places like this remind you of what it's like to live in the city. Let's start with the specialty drinks, I had the apple pie moonshine served in a mason jar and my better half had the Irish Sangria . Next the appitizers, the Crab Caprese, a chopped crab and garlic olive oil on top of a slice if mozzarella and tomato. Also we had the Pub Calamari a sweet chilli glazed wok fired served with pepper and onion. The entrees were, steak in the grass open faced sandwich, the bayou Pasta and the small plate of cola glazed baby back ribs. This is only the beginning of the awesome menu. I cannot type the greatness of the dishes, just go there and treat yourself to awesomeness! Update, went back Saturday just for the Monte Cristo. Haven't seen a restaurant have this in forever. But please, the Monte Cristo is not just for weekends! Put it on the regular menu!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time with the kids a couple weeks ago. Good atmosphere - good food and great place to bring kids as well."}
{"text":"Food and staff were perfect I would come back the pub burger was out of this world .... I would highly recommend you order the pub burger and dont use ketchup not needed  ....."}
{"text":"I had recently seen this place and wanted to give it a try. The service was amazing, I called in to ask if there was going to be a wait and she immediately put me down for a reservation and told me a table would be ready when we come. I got the BBQ Salmon. The salmon was cooked very well, except the char marks on the salmon was so intense it made the salmon very bitter so I ended up not eating much of the outside. The risotto was extremely buttery and very delicious. The asparagus was cooked very well, but I absolutely hated the drizzle of sauce on the asparagus. It was an odd kinda tang, it might be personal preference but it made my stomach hurt. The pickled cucumber and carrots on the salmon was, in my opinion, a weird combination because it was another tangy on top of another tangy. I tried bites of family's dishes too. The Salmon PLT was divine and such a good idea. The Rosedale Chicken was super delicious! The tomatoes and bell pepper on top tasted fresh and complemented the chicken very well. I will definitely come back!"}
{"text":"Lots of TVs for watching football. Menu is delicious. They have several 'different' items. A local favorite is the meatloaf sandwich. There mac n cheese s also to DIE FOR! Not great parking but that is because there are lots of other shops nearby."}
{"text":"Good location, wait staff was friendly & the food was pretty good. Really enjoyed their fried ravioli."}
{"text":"We come here for lunch quite a bit with people from work, and dinner sporadically. I usually order the steak salad and it is delicious. Tonight I ordered the tomato bisque as an appetizer. The soup was delicious. I also ordered the steak in the grass sandwich with a side of the Gouda Mac and cheese. The steak on the sandwich was cold and chewy, the bread it was served on was hard as a rock. When I tried to cut the sandwich (it is served open faced) the pressure needed to cut the sandwich caused the plate to slide across the bar, and scattered the ingredients of the sandwich. The Gouda Mac and cheese is obviously prepped ahead of time and reheated. Why even bother to have this on the menu?  It was tasteless and inedible. Very disappointing all around. The staff was friendly and the beer was cold. 

If I ever come back for dinner, I will stick to the steak salad, and steer clear of anything that has complexity or could be prepped in advance and heated and then served."}
{"text":"Killingtons is a hidden Huntersville gem! The toasted ravioli appetizer is delicious and perfect for sharing. The turkey pita is excellent and the berry mayonnaise is a perfect complement to the pita, I always end up needing more! If you save room, the apple pie is amazing, as well. It tastes homemade and is just wonderful!"}
{"text":"Best Food off of Gilead Road. A business casual bar and grille with locally crafted beer selections and gourmet prepared meals at surprisingly reasonable prices. I love the cast iron skillet steak and sweet potato hash. Don't forget to wash it down with your favorite glass of wine or Red Oak beer made in Greensboro."}
{"text":"Excellent food, excellent service, however, a piece of bread or roll should come with the meal, I thought that was pretty chintzy to charge $2.00 for a slice of bread with my soup. The owner really needs to rethink that, it's very poor business. I could see if I asked for more, but unfortunately that wasn't the case. It wasn't even worth bragging about, so this is why you got 4 stars. No business needs $2.00 bad enough to fracture your business with such petty nonsense. 
The food was good the waiter friendly and professional.
Suggestion to the owner, top charging for bread! It's really not that special!"}
{"text":"Great food. Good drink specials. Fast services. Not packed. They have live music some nights, check their websites."}
{"text":"My wife and I come here every Friday for dinner and drinks and we love it. Nice service, good food and great drinks."}
{"text":"Yooooooo I gotta admit, I had low expectations for this joint. Why? Cause it looks like an average pub kinda joint that offers so so food. I should've known better cause many of us know that some of the sketchiest joints have some of the best food, some of the dirtiest places have bomb food, and some of the average looking joints have food to die for. 

Some of my coworkers decided on this joint at the last meeting I didn't attend, so I was skeptical cause I didn't have a say. But I'm so glad they chose this place, one person in particular who I found out is a foodie. 

Our waitress was really fast, efficient and attentive. Some of us had complicated orders, asked a million questions, had food allergies, and took our time ordering. She was a pro.

There were so many good looking dishes, based on yelp pics and food that sound good, based on the descriptions of dishes on the menu. 

I didn't eat at all today, so I saved up all my calories and fat for a burger. The Astropub burger was slamming!!! I love pimento cheese. It was creamy and cheesy. My burger was cooked and seasoned perfectly. Was so juicy. The peppered bacon and grilled onions had this burger jumpin!! The fries were perfect. If you've read any of my previous reviews, you know I'm picky about my fries; crispy on the outside, soft and potatoey on the inside. 

The pics of the baked Gouda Mac and cheese looked really good, but I wasn't impressed after taking my first bite. I've made Mac and cheese with Gouda before and it wasn't the best but slightly better than what I had here, so I had to take a star off for that. It came out warm. But one of my coworkers who had it said it was great when it was hot but started to lose its appeal when it cooled down. Maybe that was the issue. 

I'd still recommend this joint and I'll definitely go back with the fam."}
{"text":"So I went back as I had promised.  I had the BBQ smoked duck wrap or something along those lines...it was great.  Even my non-duck-eating SO liked it.  I had the flavored mash as my side, which was pepperoni and mozzarella, and surprisingly better than I thought it would be.  SO had the black bean stack which was also real good and filling.  She had risotto as her side and it was, like everything else, tasty.  We will be back again!"}
{"text":"Another restaurant where the quality went down over time.  Used to be really good bar pub food. Now, food is marginal at best."}
{"text":"Food better than expected with decent selection of local beer. Plenty of TV's to catch the game.  Will be back next time I'm in town."}
{"text":"They have good beer specials depending on the night and the food is good.  I had their version of a French Dip and thought it was a good sandwich.  I will be frequenting this restaurant more often.."}
{"text":"Good food. Good atmosphere. Drink selection is good. Good little spot for dinner or lunch. Was one of the first places we stopped at after moving here. Overall enjoyable."}
{"text":"This place always exceeds expectations. Always great service and food that is delicious and beautifully presented. Very reasonably priced and a pleasant atmosphere."}
{"text":"I've been to Killingtons several times and have really enjoyed their wings. The noise was nearly unbearable even when the Restaurant and Pub weren't very busy on a weekday evening. I can't imagine how deafening it is when it's busy. Their beer selection is severely lacking  for a place that calls itself a Pub. If you go stick to the appetizers and wings. Anything else if a waste."}
{"text":"This is one of the best quality values & best kept secrets in the area.  The 5 stars are based on the type of place this is - friendly, casual, neighborhood, quality/creative food.  The food is always prepared fresh and the menu is creative.  The daily specials are also worth a look.  Have been here dozens of times over the years and is always my best \"go-to\" place.  Take friends and out-of-towners here too.  Everyone seems to like this place.  Lunch or dinner.

The final and best part is the mayor of Killington's - Frank.  He's the best.  Every time you enter (if he's working) you get a personal greeting and a friendly story!  Not the same if Frank isn't there, because it wouldn't be possible.  Will miss him when he decides to just enjoy Jack Daniels on his porch with his wife & daughter & an official full retirement!"}
{"text":"Close to our hotel, so we gave it a try. We sat at the bar and shared the chicken quesadilla and the meatloaf.  Both were fantastic. There were several other menu items would love to try another time."}
{"text":"Out shopping for cars today in Huntersville today and stopped in Killington's for lunch.  My wife loves this place and I've never been that impressed.

Ordered the Killington Dip which is their version of a French Dip.  The meat was rubbery and had little taste. For a side I have a side salad with a Balsamic Dressing that was way too sweet.

My wife had a bowl of soup and a Meatloaf Sandwich which she enjoyed.

Service wa adequat at best.  Restaurant atmosphere is kind of on the dark side with low lights.  Restaurant has been opened for a number of years and it's getting to the point where it could use a coat of paint and be refreshened."}
{"text":"Excellent food!  Good prices and great service!  We highly recommend Killingtons.
The turkey wrap, meatloaf, mac and cheese and cheese pasta purses were wonderful.  Portions were just a little more than some of us could finish."}
{"text":"First and foremost...Our waitress was amazing. She was quite chipper.  When the beverage my friend ordered wasn't what he expected, she immediately brought him something different. When he wanted his ordered customized, she said yes but also clarified with the kitchen if his request was doable. I had a burger with pimento cheese, bacon, and onion.....need I say more....it was yummy. Overall, great service and yummy interesting food."}
{"text":"The services was NOT great but NOT HORRIBLE. The restaurant is a nice size not to big (more like a bar feel). 

THE FOOD: my issue was that I ordered a egg wrap (from the breakfast menu) I wonder who thought using a toothpick (with the blue plastic paper at the tip) to make the wrap stay closed.... that made NO sense at all. The plastic was inside my wrap and also turned my eggs blue . Yes the food was good but they need to think of another way on how to make the wrap stay together...(SEE MY PHOTOS )"}
{"text":"We've been here several times now and the food is always good and the service has always been good. On the last visit we tried the stuffed banana pepper appetizer. Not bad, but nothing to write home about. Big banana peppers stuffed with bread crumbs and topped with melted cheese and balsamic vinaigrette. The bread crumbs were supposed to be seasoned with garlic, but I couldn't taste any. The fish and chips were good. The fish was huge so get a 1/2 order unless you're really hungry. The fries could have been a little more crispy, but they weren't bad."}
{"text":"Home grown favorite among locals.  Excellent food and service based on the steady stream of crowds.  

Rosedale chicken is awesome.   Nice brunch option on Weekends.   Parking a little challenging."}
{"text":"Huntersville has few choices in terms of American casual dining. There are the typical Mickey & Mooch and Birkdale flavors, but anything on Exit 23 is few to none. I've been to Killingtons over the years they've been opened and have noticed changes in quality and cooking styles. This is what prompted me to finally write my review of this restaurant. 

Based on my past experiences, I woud've easily given them a four like my fellow yelpers have. These past two experiences have brought it down to a three. I'm sure you must be thinking I'm being picky, but looking at the value and quality of the food, it just isn't there. And here's why. 

Let's start with my lunch here with my coworkers. We were seated quite quickly for their lunch rush and before that wouldn't have been possible. Already, there was a shift I noticed. I ordered their Crispy Jack Chicken with mashed potatoes. It came out ten minutes later in timely fashion along with the other orders. The potatoes were fine and I enjoyed them. The sandwich was what needed some attention. You get maybe two chicken tenders at max. Small tenders, mind you. And the bread takes up the whole plate. I couldn't even see the chicken tenders because the bread engulfed the pieces. Melted cheese, thrown on garnishes, and there you have it. Nothing really special, but the price is decent, if not a little high for what you get. 

The next dinner is what got me. Service was attentive and blah, blah, blah. I ordered the Bayou Pasta this time around; $16.25 for this dish to note. I expected something grand. Cajun infused seasoning and the typical garlic, onions, and red and black peppers. They got the checklist covered. Hardly though. Little garlics, onions, and peppers. All sauce. And by sauce I mean heavy cream. Almost as if they put tomatos sauce and heavy cream and mixed it together and then added the other ingredients. It lacked any seasoning. My brother and his girlfriend thought I was just being picky, but they tried it and thought the same. No taste. No cajun seasonings. And I paid $16 for that? Ouch. 

Each experience I've had eating here has just been going down and down. My friend the other day got their shrimp and grits, which was $14! It was like a cup and a few shrimps. Ouch again. I've had better shrimp and grits at the local Charlotte cafes for less than $8. 

Killingtons for lunch is a decent place to go to as long as you stick with their lunch sandwiches. Even then, their \"high-quality food\" is something you can get at other restaurants around the area for a better price."}
{"text":"Love this place. Lots of GF options. We've tried a few things off the menu and all have been great so far."}
{"text":"Great place to watch a game and have a drink.

The best meal available is the Black Bean burger. It's so good, and there's huge chance for leftovers because the dish is enormous. Some of the other items are good, especially the appetizers, but really, the Black Bean Burger is all that's needed."}
{"text":"If you're in Lake Norman, this spot is a must! Love it! Better than bar food. I can always get a healthy meal here while enjoying the energy of a down to earth bar. Paleo friendly. On the flip side, this is also the perfect spot for a cheat meal! :) Staff is great! Shanna is an awesome manager and Alan is one of the best bartenders in town."}
{"text":"Good food and a great place to watch football. The potato chips are killer. If you like the feel of your local pub combined with fine dining bar food you should give this place a try. My only concession is the pricing. A little steep for food but well worth it."}
{"text":"What all can I say. The bacon encrusted meatloaf spectacular, duck wrap to die for. Usually friendly fast service but today a little off. Kitchen on point though delivered hit delicious food in minutes. Split the duck wrap and meatloaf sandwich. Had parmesan green beans and citrus jalapeno slaw. Green beans need garlic or something and Cole slaw could use more jalapenos but both still great. The smoked duck wrap was amazing add the slaw to it to really set it off. Also had the white cheddar grits and sweet potato hash. Sweet potato hash so good. Finally a must get, the best grits you will ever get."}
{"text":"Sometimes it's great, other times you go and the fried food is soggy with grease because the fryer is too cold and the fries are too salty to eat. Beer selection is severely lacking."}
{"text":"This place is the bees knees. Get the meatloaf. Service is also very good. I would go as far as to say that this place is the cats pajamas."}
{"text":"So glad we ran into this amazing place! The food is so amazing! The service is out of this world with friendly staff and an amazing chef (I don't know him personally, but he did come out and speak to us). Our waitress was very sweet and attentive. We started our meals with the toasted ravioli and a cup of the tomato bisque soup. I have had both dishes in tons of places and none compare to this one. The soup was full and robust. The ravioli was perfectly toasted and the marinara full of flavor! For the main course I had the beef tenderloin with parmesan green beans and garlic mashed potatoes. The tenderloin was seasoned and cooked to perfection. The green beans and potatoes were a perfect pair to the dish. My friend had the shrimp and grits and this is when I say, if you're on the fence about ordering it, DON'T BE!! This is hands down the best shrimp and grits I have EVER had! Seriously there isn't anything bad I could say about this place! It is now going to be one of my favorite stops when I come to the area!!"}
{"text":"Have been here numerous times and always top notch. Have not had a bad meal yet. Today, Mother's Day, in addition to their regular menu they offered two specials. I had the scallops over lobster risotto. Excellent.

Only potential negative, was even though I had made reservations for 10, on line, and received a confirmation via email, the hostess didn't have me on her list. Fortunately, they were able to quickly put tables together to accommodate my party. Management may want to look into their reservation system.

Will continue to go here for good food and service."}
{"text":"Best pub food ever! Bourbon glazed pork chop, prosciutto wrapped meat loaf, and the Kilingtons salad."}
{"text":"Menu listed the fries as \"hand cut fries\". These are definitely not. They are frozen from Sysco, US foods or restaurant depot. I asked my server and she said these are \"hand cut\"..."}
{"text":"Do not bother coming here with a group of more than three people. I repeat, do not bother. 

I've been here with coworkers for the occasional birthday celebration and service has been bleak. Again, I've only been here with groups of at least six or more and we've all had to wait extended amounts of time for beverages and food. 

For my last visit (12-18-17), it took over a half hour for our food to be brought to our table. Mind you, we're all on our lunch break (thank God my job is pretty liberal when it comes to lunch 'hours') We were a table of eleven and every single person got hangry by the time the food arrived. 

A couple of people are fans of the black bean wrap and I have to agree that it's pretty delicious, let alone, provided with a large portion. I recommend the sweet potato hash to go with it. My last visit, I ordered the small fish plate and I was completely underwhelmed but I ate it because I was starving. The fish had no flavor, the cucumber salad was a nice touch. The cole slaw was also flavorless.

They do have happy hour and late night food and drink specials. This place is pretty good, not all dishes are winners. However, pack your patience and eat a snack if coming with a large group."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are not from this area but stopped in for lunch. Overall the food was decent but didn't blow us away.  I had the chicken sandwich which was good but ordered the Gouda Mac and cheese for my side...this is where my lunch fell flat...it had zero flavor and wash like eating rubber. My boyfriend had the Cuban with fries....I thought his fries tasted excellent and I should have ordered those with my meal too. Atmosphere is nice and seems to be a good place to catch a game on TV.  I probably wouldn't go out of my way to come here again."}
{"text":"Stopped here while on vacation almost a week ago.  Food was decent, but not great.  Good selection of beers on tap.  Service was friendly and efficient.  The menu is definitely of the gastropub variety, but there weren't a lot of dishes that immediately jumped out at me as \"must try.\"  If I were local, I'd probably check them out a few more times."}
{"text":"I've lived here in H'ville for 3 years, and have been coming here quite frequently.  In the beginning, I thought it was good.  Now, not so much.  The calamari used to be tender, last night it was so crunchy, i could hardly chew it!  Had the fish fry, it was tasteless & too greasy.  Also, they've had the same menu for 3 years!  Nothing has changed.  Think it ought to.  Service is very good, but food leaves a lot to be desired."}
{"text":"We decided to stop by here since bonefish grill was an hour wait and OMG I'm so glad we did. I love the area that this place is located in, and the food was divine. I ordered the Salmon PLT & my mom had the shrimp & grits. Salmon PLT was delicious, it wasn't greasy at all which was a plus. I tried a bit of my mom grits and legit they were the best grits I ever tried!! It had great flavor and not overly butterly or bland like the grits I had before! I also love how they have a wide variety of things to choose from their menu, Looking forward to coming back to try more of their food !"}
{"text":"This has become our close by, go to spot. The staff is very nice and the restaurant itself is always clean and not too loud. We have several favorites on the menu along with a good beer selection on tap and the prices are right."}
{"text":"The first time I went here I was not very impressed as we didn't get the best service, the last few times however were delicious and the food was awesome! I normally get tomato soup & smoked duck on a pretzel roll. DELICOUS! The chicken wings are phenomenal. I love their blue cheese dressing! I also love their black bean burger, one of the best I've had!"}
{"text":"Went for late lunch several months ago, was a nice gastro pub with variety of choices, dessert was excellent!  would definitely return for another meal or brunch!"}
{"text":"This place is conveniently located almost exactly equidistant between my parents' house and mine. We met for brunch there and I think they must have a good score for their lunch and dinner options. The eggs were rubbery; the bacon was fatty; the wait staff was friendly enough, but achingly slow. The entire experience was a notch below mediocre and downright forgettable."}
{"text":"Always great service and excellent food! This food will surprise you. It's not like other bar food. The chef is great and the service always excellent!

{"text":"This is a fantastic restaurant.  The quality of food and presentation is always great.   Best value in Huntersville.  I love a restaurant that provides quality food, presented well, at a great price.   The atmosphere is my style.  Dark wooden walls  with dim lights to share a dinner with a friend or lived one, while still having TV's to watch games and a large bar for fun nights."}
{"text":"Service was great with Hannah.  We were seated immediately.  I had the Guinness Ribeye & it was perfect medium temperature and the taste from the Guinness marinating was subtle enough to enjoy the meat & tasty enough to want to try it again.  Try the baked gouda mac & cheese.  The asparagus was also steamed just right.  Everyone at the table raved about the seasoning on the fries."}
{"text":"The food and service was amazing I had the Gastro Burger, wife had toasted Ravioli, daughter had bacon in crusted meatloaf. Chris the server was awesome."}
{"text":"My two friends and I went to Killington's 11-1-13. We are three middle aged professionals that were spending Friday night in town before attending the Renaissance Faire the next day. Two of us ordered alcoholic beverages and we all had dinners. The server disappeared after our food was delivered. We had to call the manager over for what we needed. Twice. Our server was talking to her colleagues and ignoring us. Then she was talking to a lady at a table right NEXT to us and never even looked at our table. She wasn't taking an order or taking care of this woman in any way. Just talking. She got zero tip. Hopefully she learned a lesson as I'm sure our table spent at least $90. The food was outstanding! I think if you get good service you will love this place. We paid our check and sat at the bar for another cocktail. The atmosphere is fun and the food is good."}
{"text":"Favorite local place to eat and drink. Best GastroPub in the area. Best of all I can walk here. 
Featured server tonight: Nick! He's amazing!"}
{"text":"Been here before but never checked in.  In the past I have enjoyed the French Dip sandwich.   This time I tried the Cuban.  It was good but I think that the French dip was better.  

This is a great hidden pub.   Will be back when the French Dip craving hits me."}
{"text":"My brother, best friend, and I went to this place for Sunday brunch.  Yum Yum.  First off they had the best spinach dip I have ever tasted.  Seriously.  It was like crack in a bowl.  I could sit there and eat it all day.  The portions were huge.  My best friend had the meatloaf and it's the biggest meatloaf I've ever seen in my life.  Great selection of beers on tap.  Great service.  We sat at the bar and the bartender was super friendly and helpful even though she was slammed since it was football sunday.  Go early.  This place fills up quick.  I will definitely go back when I'm home."}
{"text":"Updating my review. We used to like this place and gave 4 stars. But about a month ago, they admitted the cook was different when we asked. The food just wasn't good. And it was not a 1 time thing. Like...there was no batter on the beer battered fish. It was dusted with unseasoned flour. Nothing was right, just soggy or flavorless. Don't bother unless for drinks only."}
{"text":"Passing through town and met up with an old friend of mine, decided to go out to dinner and he's never been here, so we gave it a shot.

Table seating area which has ample space is located upon walkin and the host asked which one we wanted, decided to sit at the bar.

The place seemed under staffed, there was a little league team finishing up their meals, the bartender did not seem pleased, or amused. She really didn't pay us much attention for a solid 15-20 min.

Anyway, we get The Bacon Old Fashioneds, and to be honest, this was just sad. Like one of the worst mixed drinks Ive ever had. Had no soda, sugar, bitters or flavor of any kind. So I'd avoid that one, just go beer.  Had a Yingling after, it was solid.

Besides the slow and annoyed service, the kitchen was on point. Everything was solid and delicious, we got:

Loaded Chips- Solid
Stuffed Bannana Peppers- Delicious
The Kilingtons Dip- (buddy says not bad)
And the Honey Mustard Sandwhich.

Bottom line, solid 3. And thats all the kitchen. Service/ hire more people needs work.

Solid"}
{"text":"Although the air conditioning is way too high here their food is great!! I've taken a number of people here and they've all loved each of the different entrees we ordered. Will definitely be a return customer!!"}
{"text":"Solid selection of southern fair and classic American grill options. Amazing cast iron beef tenderloin served with Parmesan green beans (fresh) and sweet potato corn hash. Decent drink selection, both spirited and not. Great service - attentive but not intrusive.

Only nitpick... Clearly the restaurant AC was having a hard time tonight keeping up with the 100 degree NC Summer heat."}
{"text":"My first stop on my trip to Virginia was Killingtons! I was here for a service trip so we came in with a group of 12 at around 9PM and they had plenty of room for us.

Killingtons is a quaint restaurant not too far from the charlotte airport that gives off a sports bar feel without the loudness. The service here was great and with a big group, they were hasty and friendly.

In terms of food I had the Steak in the grass which is essentially a beef tenderloin on top of a toasted herb bread with a side of the gouda Mac and cheese. The beef tenderloin was tough to chew and was a little over cooked in certain portions but the seasoning was great and the bread it rested on top of gave a great crunch. The Gouda Mac and cheese didn't have a whole lot of the Gouda smoked taste to it that I was hoping for but was topped with a breadcrumb crust which I was happy about and you can't really mess up mac and cheese.

Overall three stars for the quality of the food, but 3.5 stars for the service!"}
{"text":"\"Blah\" We did take out and it was just mediocre.. I had the rosedale chicken which didn't have much flavor and had some sort of watery sauce. It's safe to say I'm not in any sort of hurry to go back."}
{"text":"It's a toss up with this place, every other visit something isn't up to par. I'd give up on this place entirely but that duck wrap is pretty amazing."}
{"text":"We had an amazing night at Killingtons. The food was great. The atmosphere was great. But mostly our waitress was amazing. Hannah had amazing energy that would have made any night more enjoyable. We will come here every night if we can have Hannah as our waitress."}
{"text":"Great casual restaurant at a great value.   The food is always consistent, but the atmosphere can be loud since the tables are very close together."}
{"text":"Gastropub Burger was really good.  Juicy, Cheesy, bacony, pickley goodness.  Fries were seasoned and extra tasty, ketchup not needed.  Service was on top of my drinks and food was served fast.  Solid three star establishment"}
{"text":"Wow! I've been here so many times and I can't believe that I haven't already written a review. So here it goes. Obviously since I've been here at least 5 to 10 times I love this place! The food is outstanding! Generous portions and definitely delicious. The customer service is always excellent. Very polite and attentive servers. We've dined inside and we've also had it delivered to our home (UberEats). If I had friends in town I would definitely bring them here for a great meal. The atmosphere is good too. Very laid-back and chill."}
{"text":"If your staying close in a hotel and need to place for a few beers to the game is on, not bad.  I had the duck app and it was way greasy but it was 930pm.  Will try again."}
{"text":"(I wish you could do half stars.)

Sandwich was good, and the hand cut fry's are delicious. But for $10 I only got 2 tenders, which seemed a little pricey. 

Boyfriend had a meatloaf sandwich, which was really good (not traditional meatloaf flavor, it had a small little kick to it) and some garlic mashed potatoes (which were very dry and tasted as though they came out of a instant bag).

All in all not bad, we will probably return."}
{"text":"Great food.   Wait staff was friendly.   Atmosphere is acceptable.  Service was quick."}
{"text":"Everything was great- next time will ask for the blue cheese on my steak salad on the side it was a little much but other than that it was on point! Everyone at the table enjoyed their burgers and the fries were good! Beer/drink selection was big and a good variety. Will be back when we are in the area"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem!!

Located in a small shopping center, the building itself is underwhelming. No fancy eating or atmosphere.

The food, however, is PHENOMENAL!! I have tried several different dishes with friends and almost everything is fantastic. 

Shrimp and grits - 12/10. Perhaps the best item on the menu!!
Meatloaf - 9/10
Mac n cheese - 12/10
Grits - 12/10
Chicken sandwich - 10/10
Chicken entree - 9/10
Tomato soup - 10/10, very creamy 

The only thing I think they could improve on is their breakfast. I had high expectations and it was mediocre. 

Love killingstons!!!!!"}
{"text":"Killington's is very good, the food is great and the service is some of the best. 

Just don't let them sit you in the booth next to the kitchen door. The constant in and out of the wait staff makes the booth shake everytime.  Also, the air conditioning blows right on this booth, even on a hot day, makes for a very chilly dinner. 

Otherwise, Fabulous!!! Great on St. Patrick's Day."}
{"text":"We stopped here for lunch on a Sunday while traveling North on 77.

There are Several TVs displaying today's football game - giving it a Sports Bar vibe.  The volume was set too loud -making it nearly impossible to have a conversation. 

We were pleasantly surprised by the fast service and were able to get back on the road in about a half hour.

It is a Comfortable, clean bar/restaurant.

The portions are generous and look amazing, but the food is bland.

I tried the French Dip and my husband has the Cuban-  both sandwiches looked great but really lacked seasoning.  The beef on my sandwich was dry.

The gouda mac and cheese has a nice gouda flavor, but could be creamier.

The food was served piping hot...which we love.

This place has a lot of potential and I really want to give it more stars because it is so cute, but the loud TVs ruined the atmosphere."}
{"text":"This is the best restaurant & bar in the Lake Norman Area, in my opinion.  The food is excellent and the prices are more than reasonable.  The drink specials are incredible and give you every reason to stick around for some drinks well after your meal is over.  $2.00 beers, $10.00 buckets, $5.75 pitchers... very rare pricing for the greater Charlotte area.  Even better, there's a big screen TV within 10-15 ft. of you, no matter where you sit.  The service is also solid every time.

FYI.. the Crispy Jack Chicken sandwich might be the best sandwich I've ever had in my life.  I struggle to go here and order anything else."}
{"text":"Really good ! In a cozy need neighborhood across from novant hospital in Huntersville,nc. I had the shrimp and grits the dish was pretty good for my first time eating it."}
{"text":"We had a late dinner here tonight, sitting in the outside area. A great, relaxing meal. I had a steak salad with a good choice of greens and blue cheese chunks. My wife had tomato soup and a side salad. Both were generous sizes"}
{"text":"I went for lunch and ordered the Killington's dip. I was disappointed as the roast beef tasted over cooked and somewhat tough. I selected the homemade chips and they were pretty good, nothing special. My husband ordered the Ruben which was the lunch special. He said it was okay only. His fries were good. Because of all the other rave reviews, I was disappointed. I will give them another try and order something else. I hear that they are known for their wings."}
{"text":"Great little gastro pub with tasty and fresh menu. We got the meatloaf and duck wrap. Excellent flavors and chill vibe. Come on by!"}
{"text":"Excellent service, food and atmosphere! The people who work there are friendly and fun to hang out with. The Toasted Ravioli is a great appetizer. Plus they have wi-fi Internet so it's a great place to work or catch up on emails!"}
{"text":"This place never fails to impress me. I usually don't go for vegetarian options but I can never pass off on their black bean burger. It is out of this world. We also ordered the stuffed banana peppers, which let me warn you, are mind-blowing but at the same time very heavy (after splitting those with my boyfriend, I could eat less than a quarter of my black bean burger and got to take it for next day's lunch, yay!). My boyfriend had the Gastro Pub burger which was delicious too. In fact, I have never had anything here that I didn't like. If only I could recollect all the things I've tasted here...
Their beer selection isn't as huge as I expected, but they have the regular beers and a few good ones on tap.
The last time we went there, somehow there were at least 20 kids in the house (with one long table reserved for kids!) so in spite of being a pub, it's good for kids too.
Service is always good and our food came out quick, despite how packed they were. All in all, I'm very impressed."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times and the quality and the styling of food is always impressive. Today I ate the Crispy Chicken Jack. It was delicious. I will get this again the next time I eat there. I wanted the peanut butter pie, but I decided against it for calorie sake."}
{"text":"This restaurant has great food, good location, good prices, fair ambience, and absolutely the worst, unfriendly, bartenders in the area. Their customer skills are poor. We like to eat there because of the menu is very good and as I said, great food. We have cut down on the frequency due the inefficient  unfriendly bar.  The owner needs to know this."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is casual, which is what I prefer, but the food was far from casual!  Very diverse menu!  The food came out with an A+ for presentation. Our server was wonderful as well. We'll definitely come back."}
{"text":"When I used to work in Huntersville, Killington's was a favorite choice for a super fresh, huge salad. And when I say huge I mean HUGE. Even the bowls are big! 

It's been a few months since I've been here, but I favor the Cobb, Crispy Chicken and Killington's salad. Every time I've popped in here for a quick but chic lunch the service has been spot on and my meal has arrived fresh and delicious. Nom. Price wise, the salads will run $7-$10 each - and once you see how large they are you'll probably agree that it's a pretty fair price! 

Inside Killington's does its best to emulate a gastropub - you'll spy lots of dark wood, low lighting and big 'ole booths. Next time I'm in the area and craving a tasty, fresh meal, Killington's is a solid choice."}
{"text":"Update November 21: I am docking two stars from my previous review for the following reasons. I recently went back to this restaurant to take my mom as I had been raving about how amazing it was. I ordered the dish I usually get: the mushroom ravioli. This time, though, the pepper on it was horrible. They used a pepper grinder that was obviously not set on the right setting. I almost broke a tooth on a piece before I realized what was going on. There were LARGE pieces of pepper all throughout the dish and I felt scared to eat the rest of it. My mom got the steak sandwich with spinach and cheese and seemed to enjoy the first few bites but after those the bread became completely soggy from the liquids and she lost interest in finishing the rest of her meal as well. Our waitress this time was also nowhere to be found throughout most of our meal and we kept having to ask her for our check which seemed to take forever. 

I'm really bummed about my latest experience because I had high hopes for this place. But with their high prices, especially their appetizers, I will probably go elsewhere from now on. 


My husband and I decided to check this place out since it has some amazing reviews. At first glance, it's not one of those places that I would have seen driving by and thought I have to eat there. But!!!!!! I'm so glad we listened to the great reviews. 

When we arrived we were lucky and got seated right away even though the place was packed on a Friday night. We sat in a very spacious booth which I really liked as we were more private than the other tables that are in the middle of the restaurant and thus more crowded. 

First time going: For the food: My husband ordered a beer which he said was really good but his comment was he wouldn't come just to try beers as there are several other places that have way larger selections of beers to choose from than Killingtons. He decided on the duck wrap with the homemade fries. I got the mushroom ravioli with the garlic bread. (I did ask them to leave off the blue cheese since I don't like it.) Both of our meals were fabulous!!!!!!! They smoke their duck in-house and you can definitely tell they take it seriously. It was delicious. So was the mushroom ravioli. It came with large slices of portobello mushrooms on top and the ravioli themselves were full of large pieces of mushrooms. The sauce was yummy and I soaked up the extra with my garlic bread which was delicious as well. Oh and the fries were fabulous as well!!!!

We will definitely be going back and recommending this place to others too."}
{"text":"Service was very good. Had Killingtons chicken with the special mashed potatoes. The chicken was seasoned great with tomatoes and melted cheese. The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5 is the cartilage in the chicken. This is just a pet peeve of mine that a lot of cooks overlook. I never like biting into cartilage. The mashed potatoes were a nice surprise. Had a bit of hot pepper in them but not too much.  This restaurant was a good value."}
{"text":"Love this place!!! Great bartenders! Great prime rib! We meet here for happy hour several times a month and eat here a few times a month! Always recommended!"}
{"text":"3 words - caramelized shallot risotto!  Oh my!  That alone made our visit worth it!!  But I digress. We visited on a Friday night after a long drive into town. The Yelp reviews looked interesting, so we checked it out around 6:30pm. The place was packed, but our wait was only the 10-15 minutes the hostess told us it would be. They do a great job turning tables!

We started with the pub chips (homemade chips covered in melted cheddar and bacon with a side of ranch). These were yummy, with a decent amount of cheese (most places lack this, so I was happy).  The chips themselves could have used more seasoning, but overall a decent starter. 

I had the beef dip sandwich with that amazing risotto on the side. First I have to say that I am hesitant to order the \"dip\" in most restaurants. I love them, but most places reduce the dip down until it is almost too salty. Not here!!!  It was perfect and beefy!  Lots of thin slices beef on the sandwich and ooey gooey cheese!  And that risotto!  I could have swam in an entire vat of the stuff!  The caramelized shallots sung in that dish - sweet and whatever cheese they used (can't remember - was blacked out in bliss) gave it a pleasant tang. The rice was cooked perfectly. 

Hubby had \"steak in the grass,\" but his way (spinach on the side and no cheese) - so basically it was tenderloin on a toasted garlic focaccia with a side of spinach. He's into steak - minus the frou frou. The meat was cooked to a mid-rare (he always orders rare), but he didn't mind. It was a good quality steak. What he raved about though was that wonderful garlic bread it was served on!  He said the side Caesar was good as well, not that I would know, I didn't try it as I was face first into that wonderful risotto!

Friendly, efficient service topped the night off (even the bar backs come to the table to see if you need a refill! This place is well managed) and guarantee that we will visit again when in the area."}
{"text":"Killington's is one of the better value restaurants in town. Don't let all the flat-screens and seasonal sports fans confuse you! It's more pricey than an average sports bar, but that's because the food is 10x better. The menu has a great variety of sandwiches, salads, entrees, apps, etc. 

Turkey pita w/ berry mayo is delicious, as is the vegetarian soup (creamy tomato w/ corn). Smoked duck wrap w/ crispy onions and jiacama is one of the best sandwiches I've ever had! Side choices are thoughtful (sweet potato/corn hash, cucumber salad, fruit, specialty mashed potatoes, veggies). Nice to have options beyond the usual chips/fries. 

Chili is incredible -- but warning... when they say \"big bowl,\" they ARE NOT kidding. Get the small bowl if you plan to eat anything else. Salads are all pretty good, and big portions... dressing are incredible (and seemingly all homeade). I usually don't get around to the entrees but most of the apps are amazing, and I've never seen someone not enjoy their meal there... men gravitate towards the crispy chicken sandwich. 

Several beers on tap, and lots more in bottles. Only complaint might be that there seems to be a revolving door on wait/bar/host staff. I go in all the time and often see staff I've never seen before, but it is a fairly big place, so they do probably have a lot of people on the payroll."}
{"text":"If you stop here, get the Gastropub Burger! If you don't get the gastropub burger, get the Duck Wrap! (And I'd recommend the cheese grits too! So much cheesy goodness, with just a hint of cayenne heat at the finish!) The French dip was okay, there wasn't anything BAD about it, but there's nothing memorable to set it apart either. 
We found Killington's on yelp while driving through NC on our way home to Florida. The restaurant was clean, the service was prompt and very friendly! I was a bit disappointed when I asked our server a question about one of the beers on tap and her response was \"I don't know, I don't really like beer\"...if you work in a bar you should at least be able to answer basic questions about the beers you sell, especially when they're local brews. All in all, this was a great place to eat, the food was hot, quick and tasty!"}
{"text":"Came here for a few drinks and some apps last night, the bartender couldn't have been any more pleasant, the food came out fast and was better than expected for bar type food.  Very impressed. I will definitely be returning."}
{"text":"Great for late night dinner.  Decent prices, good food and polite staff.  They have vegan and vegetarian options so everyone has something to enjoy."}
{"text":"My husbands friend was visiting from out of town so I looked up some restaurants in Huntersville where he was staying. I read previous reviews and decided to try this place out. I ordered the Killingstons dip, it was 
Very good! Lots of meat and cheese with au jus too. You get to choose a one side. They had so many choices I ended up paying for a second side. The green beans with Parmesan cheese was so yummy and the 
Cheddar Serrano Grits were amazing. I never had grits that way and I 
can not wait to go again. I am definitely hooked on those grits! My husband had Steak in the Grass and liked it. His friend had a nice piece of Salmon with vegetables and mash potatoes and he said he liked it as well. I will be visiting more once our home is built in Huntersville. We actually could walk to it."}
{"text":"I don't really understand the glowing reviews. We went here for dinner one Sunday night and the place was crowded (many families with children), noisy, and they played horrible music (Sirius's The Pulse, maybe?). The atmosphere also is not very appealing - it's quite spartan inside and the seating is close and not very comfortable. Service was attentive, but it took some time to get our food. While the food was good--loaded chips as an appetizer and two sandwiches--it was not good enough for us to want to return. Galway Hooker is a much better choice for upscale bar food in a classier atmosphere!"}
{"text":"My wife and I ate dinner here while passing through Huntersville.  We highly recommend this place. The food was terrific and staff was extremely polite and friendly. Service was quick and wait staff was attentive to our needs. The bacon encrusted meatloaf and the Pub fish and fries were excellent."}
{"text":"This place is another one of those hard to find but glad you did places. Tucked behind a gas station, the shopping center lets down the restaurant.

The decor is a bit odd, part of it feels like they want it to be a modern martini bar type joint, part feels like a sports bar, and part feels like a family restaurant. The concrete top bar is not as comfortable as a classic wooden one with a rail, but that only matters when you stay to watch the game.

The food here is the star of the show. The shrimp and grits is good, gastro-burger is really top notch. I have had pasta, shrimp, pretty much the whole menu. I have rarely been disappointed."}
{"text":"Traveling north from Florida and got stuck in Charlotte rush hour traffic so decided to bail and get dinner. Went to this place based on Yelp reviews and wasn't disappointed. Food was good but more important the service was excellent. We were in and out quickly and back on the road."}
{"text":"We had an awesome dinner here, words cannot speak for the superior food at modest prices! Highly recommend eating here!"}
{"text":"I ate lunch here yesterday with coworkers and loved it. We had the Spinach Pepper Jack Cheese Dip and the Smothered Chips. The Chips were awesome and the dip a little to heavy on the cream for me (it could have been warmer too). I had the crab cake salad and my coworker had the steak salad. I ate the entire large salad it was great - the blend of avocado, cilantro and crab worked well. 
My chief complaint with the restaurant is how hard it is to find. It was highly recommended by friends but it took me a while to find it in the shopping center."}
{"text":"Really nice vibe, decent beer & signature beer collection, great food.  We had the pretzels appetizer, served with a spicy mustard, and a sweet (honey chipotle maybe?) dip.  My boyfriend had the pub burger, and I had the chipotle honey chicken sandwich, with fries as our side.  The portions were huge, savory, and fresh.  We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Went there today with my wife and daughter, my wife was meeting an old friend nearby at a later time so we thought we would do dinner beforehand here.  First thing we noticed it was loud, that didn't bother us but worth noting if you are looking for a quiet place to eat, and you have to consider was Sunday, football games were on.  It is a pub after all and a lively one at that!~  

Wait staff was very nice and we started off with an appetizer they call loaded \"Loaded Chips\" similar to Irish Nachos and I have to say they were amazing!  Hand cut and cooked potato chips topped with melted cheese, bacon, banana peppers and a side of ranch dressing and it was truly amazing!  My wife and I split their version of Fish and Chips, \"Pub Fish Fry\" on their menu.  It was really good, but they do top with a cucumber salad that we didn't think was too great and we scraped it off, but the fish was battered and with their homemade tartar sauce was delicious.  They have a decent kids menu and they can color things on it as well.  We finished off with some time to kill before my wife's friend came into town so we decided to do desert and had the Peanut Butter Pie, have to say that was amazing and I really didn't need it, but was so good!!!   Great family place for afternoons and dinners, a little pricey but not outrageous."}
{"text":"This was my first time eating here.  I was very impressed with their late night menu, as most places have pretty basic and boring greasy bar food for the late night choices.  Not that I ate anything healthy, but they had a better selection than most.  I had their chicken wings which were absolutely the best wings I had ever had, sweet and spicy, cooked crispy to perfection.  I also had the toasted ravioli which was awesome.  I was very pleased with the service and staff.  Thursday is half off wine bottles. Yay!"}
{"text":"I'm really regretting my visit here.  It must be a Monday night thing,  because the people at the bar are not familiar.   I come in here often and have never been so under serviced, disregarded, etc. , etc., etc.,. I love the meatloaf,  that is why they got an extra star.  Although the meatloaf came out super cold in the middle,  and when they reheated (more than likely microwaved) it did not taste anywhere near  the same...and they returned it to me without the bacon... that is my final straw...."}
{"text":"Great place for a drink. Super atmosphere and good service. Was underwhelmed with the food, unfortunately. The wings were on the better side of good and an opening salvo to what I thought was going to be a great meal. 

My Entree was the Guinness Ribeye, and while it was perfectly cooked, other than the beer marinade, had NO other seasoning, as in NONE giving this a lack luster result. It was a similar experience with the baked gouda mac n' cheese. All the promise in the world, and a great presentation, but seriously lacking in the flavor department. The asparagus was cooked wonderfully, was fresh and tasty......"}
{"text":"Very good food and not bad pricing. In a very nice area too. The staff was good and the food was above average. May I suggest the black bean pita sandwich. Amazing!!!"}
{"text":"Sat at bar with friend. I was right next to the order pick-up area and drink delivery area for waitstaff. Good service (friendly and attentive). Tasty wings. Plenty of beer on tap. 

Just a heads-up, employee said wings were better than the burger. I agree (I had the burger on previous visit). 

Good place to go if you're looking for relaxed atmosphere, quality service, and pretty good food."}
{"text":"Always yummy here. Great service, great prices, and great food.  We enjoy the fact that we can watch our football here too!  Love this place."}
{"text":"I have been a fan for years but, no more.

Got carryout tonight and not sure why they call rhem 'garlic mashed potatos' when there was no garlic and no actual potato- those were Insta Mash-school cafeteria style.

What I really wanted and ordered was the $8 peanut butter pie. To bad you bagged it with hot food amd it turned into a puddle. What a waste...."}
{"text":"The honey chipotle chicken sandwich with the jalapeño bacon is awesome! Don't forget to get it with the sweet potato hash."}
{"text":"We got carryout St. Patty's dinner and couldn't have asked for more! The appetizer we ordered was Guinness wings, which were amazing. The sweet sauce was perfect and the chicken juicy and tender. I wonder if they have this all the time.  We had corned beef platter and a Reuben sandwich for dinner, which were equally outstanding. I look forward to returning here again."}
{"text":"This is the neatest little place you'd never notice unless someone referred you! The decor is cool, the layout is nice, it's convenient to Charlotte and LKN, and the most importantly, the food is always good! I recommend the burger and a beer!"}
{"text":"We eat here basically twice/week and always order the same thing- mahi wrap a crispy chicken salad and fried ravioli (however it is important to note we have had almost everything on the menu).  This is our favorite restaurant.  Period.  Killingtons has the best food in Huntersville which most is basic American and certainly some creative stuff and ALWAYS consistent.  Most importantly their quality is exceptional! Thank you for providing us our favorite dinner on a super regular basis! - Sara and Chris"}
{"text":"We found this place on Yelp and visited based on the other positive reviews.  We tried the duck wrap and the black bean burger, again based on the positive reviews and per the suggestion of the bartender.   Both were delicious and we thoroughly enjoyed them.  I had the grits as my side (crazy good!) and my husband had the corn and sweet potato hash (also super tasty. )  The service was friendly and attentive.   Highly recommended."}
{"text":"Okay so Killingtons is my guilty pleasure. We get food here weekly almost and yes it's that consistent. Killingtons doesn't skimp on portion sizes like most restaurants. You get your money's worth here. 

Some of my favorite entrees are the Rosedale chicken (chicken is ALWAYS cooked great), hot garlic wings, Cobb salad, Killingtons salad, and their soup is even delicious! Oh and their fries are good and the ranch is like crack. When they renovated recently and closed for a week I almost asked for an advance on my side of ranch. Yeah...

They have a great team of people working there and great bartenders! Reasonably priced drinks and not weak. 

Good luck taking my duchess crown here fellow yelpers. So good!"}
{"text":"This used to be such a great place. What an incredible decline. I couldn't even finish the nasty steak in the grass. And that was the replacement for the burnt first one. I'll have some beers here but never eating here again"}
{"text":"Okay. This review is really only to bring attention to the conditions of Killingtons beer lines. They are TERRIBLE. Dec 3rd, I had a Labatt Blue draft and a Blue Moon draft. BOTH beers smelled of vinegar in the glass. This is a line cleanliness issue which is easily corrected. I've reached out to them via Twitter and their email directly from their website, however my concerns seem to fall on deaf ears. Anyway, I'd stay away from all their draft beer until they remedy the problem."}
{"text":"Great food but prices have increased a lot since they opened. My favorite is the Killington Salad add Salmon!"}
{"text":"Risotto... that's all you need to remember when you order. Who would have guessed some strip mall irish pub-by place in Huntersville has awesome risotto as a side?! I think I may just go and win myself the lottery jackpot! 
We came here as a backup plan for dinner. We were up in the lake area for a friend's birthday, and his normal joint was packed. A few of us (who live south of LKN) were dying for food, and waiting over an hour for a table wasn't an option for our essential survival. So as much as we hated to run off, we had to and Killingtons was the choice.
I cannot attest to their sports watching quality, or their selection (and prices) of alcoholic beverages since I wasn't there for that, but from the look of it, it should be a decent spot for weekend binge football watching.
I can attest, however, to their bacon wrapped meatloaf (sandwich version) with a side of caramelized shallot risotto. For under $10, it was decent in size (I made 2 meals out of it). The presentation was lacking... but frankly I don't think anything smothered in white mushroom gravy can look good on a plate. The only suggestion I have is to make this an open face sandwich. Instead, it came with a chunk of meat sitting in between 2 garlicy toasts with gravy all over the top piece of bread. Since obviously picking it up like a real sandwich was not expected, then why would you rob me of my gravy by putting it directly on a piece of bread intead of the meatloaf?! After my desperate attempt to scrap off as much gravy off that piece of bread onto my meatloaf, I ended up asking for extra gravy, which I unfortunately had to pay $0.50 for. Oh well.
The meatloaf itself was solid. Literally. It was a big chunk of meat wrapped with bacon. It was by far the meatiest meatloaf I have seen (and by the weight of what was left of my plate in my to-go box, this was no joke). I guess who needs breading as filler when you can just have a block of meat?! I'm in. The seasoning was a bit lacking (same with the gravy) the day of, but leftover tasted great (and I did add some salt to both). But the best was yet to come when I forked myself a mouthful of the risotto (which I am still surprised to find on the menu as a side). HOLY MOTHER COW, it was delish! I could just eat that on its own as a meal. Great consistency, fabulous taste, just overall excellent. Risotto definitely stole the show and elevated the 3.5 stars meatloaf to another level.
The only down side of this place was service. Our waiter didn't have much presence, and by that I mean he didn't act like our waiter (I thought he was the water person at first) and he disappeared often. I thought confidently stating one's name and saying \"and I will be taking care of you all tonight\" is standard procedure but I guessed wrong. The service was not bad, just slow and a bit lacking. 
Overall I gave this place a 4-star because I applaud the place for its menu, and for the location it is a great spot (by gosh we know we don't need another Asian restaurant in this shopping center)."}
{"text":"What is the best thing about Killington's?  It is a neighborhood gem and I love that their menu is varied and well suited to my stomach craving upon arrival.  The food is always elegantly presented and tasteful.  On my recent visit, I enjoyed BBQ grilled salmon served with caramelized shallot risotto and asparagus.  The portion was perfect for one person and the dish was absolutely delightful.  

The place isn't huge so you must time your arrival to get a seat.  On a cold night, while waiting near the door, you will be chilled.  However, the bar area (sans kids) is a nice size where you can sit and warm yourself while waiting for a table."}
{"text":"Great food, great service! We got a French dip (forgot what they called it) and a cheeseburger. The meat was tender, flavorful and cooked the way we wanted it. The server kept ahead of us by bringing some things before we asked for them. He was so efficient that we felt a little rushed, but we did not think it was intentional (halfway through the meal he asked if we wanted boxes). We will return."}
{"text":"Had the Saturday night prime rib special a couple night ago. Awesome. What more needs to be said?"}
{"text":"Back and forth, 2 stars, 4 stars. Crapshoot on what it will be. Food is generally a 4, service is closer to 2. Drink prices are a 1. Latest frustration - \"local beers\" are on special for $3.50. The menu has an asterisk on 3 beers to say they're local. Got the check and my two \"local\" canned beers were $13. Apparently the special is on the one local draft? Asked the server and he said sorry, that happens all the time. Regardless of that last time, $13 for two cans of beer? Cmon man!"}
{"text":"We tried this place tonight on my co-workers recommendation, and I'm so glad we did! the food was absolutely delicious and there are plenty of reasonably priced dishes ($10-15 range) that all sounded great. We received fantastic service as well, even though we were one of just a few tables on their out of the way patio, and it was quite busy at 7:30 on a Friday evening.

We ordered hot wings for an appetizer and they came out hot and crispy with just the right amount of sauce. I ordered the Killington's salad - bib and romaine with dried cherries, goat cheese and candied pecans. I got the strawberry peppercorn dressing it usually comes with on the side because I wanted to try their fat free sweet and spicy dressing as well. Turns out I liked the fat free one better, and that certainly doesn't happen every day! My fiancé got a chicken dish with roasted red peppers topped with melted mozzarella cheese and a side of mashed potatoes. It wasn't to my liking, but that type of food usually isn't. He has no complaints though! All of their ingredients were high quality and tasty on their own, but the way they prepared, plated and composed the food was top notch. Everything was freshly prepared and hot things were hot, and cold things were cold. One of my biggest beefs is when someone piles something hot on my cold salad and my the time it gets from the kitchen to me the top layer of lettuce has been steamed. Ick. 

The service truly was outstanding; When our waitress was tied up after getting several tables seated back to back she ensured that other staff members checked on us. Even when she didn't ask though, if anyone passed by or peeked out the windows and saw we needed refills or dishes removed from the table they went out of their way to do so promptly and with pleasure.

While this place isn't exactly around the corner from us, we look forward to going back soon. Their menu is pretty large and so many things looked good! The recommended dish from my friend was the bacon encrusted meat loaf, which is also offered on their menu as a sandwich, so if meatloaf floats your boat, I bet you it'd be a home run!"}
{"text":"I just went to Killingtons for m second time. The first time I ordered a chicken sandwich but shortly after noticed that some osrt of meatloaf dish was offered in every section. I wished at that point i had ordered meatloaf. My chicken dish came and it was good but I had been waiting to go back and try this meatloaf.
Well i went back with a high expectation of a meatloaf dish, I personally love meatloaf anf make several kinds at home. I was pretty sure the meatloaf wasn't going to meat my expectations after all this time and anticipation. Well i ordered the bacon meatloaf sandwich. It was SOOOOO Good. The mushroom gravy that came with it was also excellent and really put the meal over the edge! I typically reserve a five star rating for fine dining but when you nail a specific dish like they do with the meatloaf, it has to be recognized."}
{"text":"Visited again and this time I had the crab cake salad.  It was prepared and dressed well.  Salad was tossed with a citrus vinaigrette and nice chunks of avocado and feta cheese, then piled up high in the center of the plate.  The two crab cakes were also well prepared with a good amount crab meat and not alot of filling, just the way I like them.  They had a nice crisp on the outside with a meaty inside. However, they were a bit fishy.   
This time I tried one of their desserts.  I had the BUTTER TART described as: raisins and pecans in a sweet butter tart topped with french vanilla ice cream.
I was afraid the raisins would overpower this whole tart but they didn't.  It was actually very good.  Tasted like a rich, buttery pecan pie.  Interesting dessert that I would most certainly order again."}
{"text":"Went up to Huntersville this weekend to cheer on friends doing the Huntersville Half Marathon.  Naturally, I had to get brunch after all that cheering and clapping.

No secret as to how this place got on my radar... Yelp-duh!  But I did see that they had a brunch menu so I was sold.  

Located off of Gilead Rd, Killingtons actually is tucked back behind the businesses directly off the road and is facing away from it!  Driving through the parking lot, there was a side that looked like the back (loading area), but we whipped around front and found the entrance.  Not to bad, but you do have to look for it with all the businesses and shops.  Careful about pedestrians and the 4 way stop signs here.

We got there early so we had to wait 8min in the car to wait for them to open up at 11am.  \"Technically\" they didn't flip the sign over until 11:03, but we did see them sweeping the front and getting ready.  We had a parallel parking space directly in front of the front door and people had parked behind us waiting for the restaurant to open.  Always a good sign.

Staff was nice and we started with mimosas.  I had the bacon-wrapped meatloaf benedict with grits.  It was delicious and I had no complaints.  Did notice the restaurant filled up pretty quickly for brunch, but everything was laid back (as brunch SHOULD be).  

I would defintitely go back to try their other menu items, but the grits alone would definitely have me sitting outside waiting for them to open the doors again."}
{"text":"This one star review may come as a surprise but after tonight I will never be back! Showed up after a long flight home, excited to eat here since I order it to go all the time working across the street. Tonight it's not about the food, the one star is for the no good, rude and disrespectful manager named shana. There was a problem with the bill where my discount wasn't taken off the way I thought it would. Shana comes to my table with a big attitude problem when the bill was already being taken care of. I was confused why she even showed up at my table to begin with. I explained what happened then she says my discount won't work for the table (of 2) but only for my individual meal. Ok well that's not usually how discounts work in my mind. I asked for it to be taken off the whole bill since I didn't know that. She kept arguing that she can't do that. I'm pretty annoyed at this point, you really want to lose a customer over $4??? Well I guess she did, she continued to have a big attitude problem, no apology, just a nasty rude attitude. I can't imagine how she talks to friends and family with the way she spoke to me. I go inside to ask my waitress for the name of the owner and how to let them know what had happened. Shana comes over breathing down my neck and in a very threatening way says \"if you have a problem with me we can go outside\" um like are you going to beat me up??? What is that supposed to mean. She is causing a scene at this point, demands me to leave at which time I respond I am doing nothing wrong, I am the customer, and I am getting the owners info to let her know how you treat people. She then gives me the info, again no apology for anything that has happened. Needless to say I WILL NEVER COME BACK! And neither should anyone reading this. I'm wondering if Shana, a former mortons manager really got fired and may have lied on her resume. May want to look into that."}
{"text":"I've had Killington's on my bookmark list for quite some time but would always seem to forget about it even though the place is just one exit away.  I finally remembered this week when out running around and decided to stop in for a lunchtime bite.

The restaurant was fairly crowded, including plenty of spots taken up at the bar by solo diners like me.  I found a bar seat and was greeted with a friendly smile and a menu.  About the menu... It's extensive with lots of different options and that sometimes is a cause for concern as places try to do too many things but on this visit at least, things worked out.  I ordered a dish that was a couple medallions of filet mignon topped with sauteed spinach, melted swiss cheese and served open faced on garlic toast.  I liked the fact that I could get a small salad as a side, especially given that the menu said the dressings are homemade.  I went that route and got blue cheese dressing.  The salad was a spring mix and the dressing was quite good and the sandwich was pretty tasty as well.  Not the highest quality filet but, good enough and a lot of it.  Was trying to figure how they weren't losing money on the sandwich actually.  

Service at the bar was friendly and all in all, this trip to Killington's was good enough to warrant a return on another day."}
{"text":"What a lovely experience. From the locals we met on the street who gave us their additional old style (people talking) review. to the reviews online, this is a good place for dinner for sure!
The joint was jumping and it sure looked like we got the last table in the place. Well I later found out there were a few more tables in the bar. The bar was spacious and long, and sure looks like a good watering hole too! We were driving another three hours after dinner, so,no watering for us. The Salmon and steamed vegetables was perfect. reall perfect, and the steak in the grass sandwich was quite nice. The menu has extensive choices and I am sure I could use another few trips to home in on the finest for m palate. Anyway there is something for everyone, even the kids, and would sure look this place up if I were local"}
{"text":"At 20 miles away it's definitely outside of my usual stomping grounds, but if you're up in the Hunterville area it's worth checking out.  It has a relaxed atmosphere which makes it great for business meetings along with friendly service and a nicely varied menu.  

The grilled mahi is my usual go-to when hitting this pub.  I've seen the other dishes which look awesome, but have yet to try them.  If you're looking for a casual place that still tickles the taste buds then I'd recommend this joint."}
