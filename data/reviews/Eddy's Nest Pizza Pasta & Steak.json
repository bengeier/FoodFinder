{"text":"Great pizza! EXCEPTIONAL service.  The bf and I ordered pizza from here last week. Got the ham and mushroom with fresh tomato. We ordered delivery. The pizza was quick and it was a really tasty. We don't order pizza very often but both enjoyed it so much we will be ordering from here again soon.  The day after we ordered we got a phone call from the owner calling to tell us that he had accidentally overcharged us a few dollars from the day before and he'd be crediting us. If he hadn't called we'd never have noticed but he was just so honest! Now we love this place even more.   Looking forward to their pizza on our next pizza night!"}

{"text":"Great takeout joint t I happened to discover as I live nearby. The pizza is decent but the chicken and ribs are great. On my first visit the proprietor gave me a discount as a new customer. Nice!"}
