{"text":"Verde Good Beans is such a cute coffee shop/restaurant located in Downtown Pittsburgh. The staff is super sweet. I had the blueberry mango quinoa salad and it was amazing. So fresh and full of flavor! The coffee drinks are really great-there are so many to choose from. The environment is very comfortable-there is seating in the front and the chairs are so comfy! I always follow on twitter to see what their specials are for the day. If you're looking for a lunch spot in Downtown-definitely give them a try for something new and different!"}
{"text":"Salads, hummus and bagels that can be combined to make a sandwich are always available.  They have daily specials, including soups, salads, sandwiches, etc.  Everything is really excellent.  They coffee and coffee drinks are really good as well.  The mom and daughter who own it are great.  I highly recommend going here for lunch."}
{"text":"The coffee and tea are nothing special, but the SOUPS!  Almost everyday there is a unique offering (no soup on Friday!) and it has not yet disappointed me.  The service is friendly and charming; the soup is healthy and fresh; and the price is very reasonable for the portions."}
