{"text":"03/30/17 I just went here ,I love it !.the guy in the drive thru was super nice ! and the bean and cheese with rice burrito was super bomb."}
{"text":"Thank goodness that these guys came into the East Valley! They just took over the old Rolibertos that was absolutely disgusting for years. The other few Filibertos around aren't a whole lot better. This place is actually pretty damn good! It's easy to think that every single one of these places is exactly the same but each one has just a touch different flare to their menus and this place is no exception. The prices are much more reasonable than Filibertos, and the actual spices that they put in their products make the food tastes so much better. Thumbs Up Guys!"}
{"text":"For late night was decent. I ordered carne asada burrito nothing but meat and guacamole w/LOTS of onions no rice or beans. Service was good. Also ordered chorizo tacos they were also decent."}
{"text":"11:50pm Sunday 3-26-17: Just called to see if the dining room was open 24 hours. A woman answered the phone and when I asked about it -- she replied with something I couldn't hear.  So I said I'm sorry -- what? And she hung up on me.  I called back figuring I'd give t a second try and after the phone rang a dozen times or more it went into voicemail.  Looks like I'll go somewhere else that is more interested in their customers.  How do these kinds of places stay in business?"}
{"text":"Hands down our favorite place to eat out or pick up . delicious fresh food.we eat here at least twice a week.one day we ate there twice!! It's THAT GOOD!.my favorite is the street tacos but I order them with cabbage only and my husband can't get enough of the shredded beef fried tacos.you won't be disappointed so good;)"}
{"text":"not 24/7. i was just there and the door was lock and no one was even in there. was hoping to give this a try since it was closer to my work."}
{"text":"Sorry but gross. .i come from San Diego where there's the best taco shops in the world &after eating here I was so disappointed in the food and the quality it lacked. I highly recommend Tosinos on power road you want good authentic Mexican food at a great price go there reminds me so much of taco shops in SD, you won't feel like you wasted your money as I felt choosing to eat here should've just stuck with what knew. Won't ever eat here again."}
{"text":"Great street tacos!!! Love this place been coming here since they opened!! Churros are very good and they have a great salsa bar"}
{"text":"This place has the best green chile burrito. The heat level is perfect and the tomatillo sauce is second to none. I wish I could get the recipe."}
{"text":"Don't go here, they are slow in the drive through and I was not impressed with the food and my order was not even correct! Go to Vaqueros next door. The rice was hard and crunchy and I ordered three beef tacos and I got three street tacos. The guy at the window was to busy talking to whoever was working with him"}
{"text":"Rigoberto's is another of those 24 hr. mexican food joints around the valley, this particular location has some great carnita and adobo tacos, we also had the chile relleno and it was fantastic. the tacos were very filling and big ($2.50 each). The horchata was just the regular drink you find at many other places, cold and the perfect amount of sweetness.
Hot sauce should have been spicier. Overall i would eat their food whether i was drunk of not, its the real deal!"}
{"text":"We arrived at 1 am as a party of 14 and they were very quick to respond. Food was very good, the place was very clean.  Chimichangas, carnitas and rolled tacos were delicious."}
{"text":"Every time I order my food is cold. Today I had a chimichanga from there and it was cold inside. I had to heat it up in the microwave before I ate it but it was still really bad. The lettuce underneath was brown. The rice was cold and hard. The cheese was not melted.
From now on I'll take a few extra steps and go to Vaqueros right next door. It's much better food.
****In response to the owner's response
I am being honest and fair. I would rather go to your restaurant but if you would rather take the time to explain/ defend the low quality of your food, I'm going to have to change where I decide to go from now on. Thanks"}
{"text":"Let the battle begin. Grand opening with $2.99 breakfast burros and $1 tacos priced to try and put Vaqueros next door out of business. So sad that one of these businesses will ultimately starve the other one out. The breakfast burros are good but slightly greasy and hard to eat the last few bites. Where is the passion for quality? Check out traditional kitchens like La Korita on the west side and taste the difference."}
{"text":"I was visiting from the Bay Area (our Mexican food here is too die for) and my sister said their food is delicious so got the cheese enchiladas with beans and rice. The beans were entirely too salty. The enchilada sauce was also a little salty. Maybe the top fell off the salt shaker. I'm sure they have other good options, but Issa NO for me"}
{"text":"The food is priced appropriately, the service is great here and the salsas are amazing. I'm really impressed on how clean the restaurant is! It's hard to find a taco spots that has a clean environment.


P.S i do recommend the carne asada. The pork al pastor were alright"}
{"text":"The 2 star means I've experienced better, and that fits my level of review for this restaurant.  The place was empty at 11:30 on a weekday.  It was however, very clean and the staff was very friendly.  Good selection of salsas from the salsa bar, but no chips (they charged extra even for dine-in).  My go-to is the beef tacos any time I try out a new Mexican restaurant, so I got the 2 taco combo plate.  Comes with rice and beans and 2 tacos with beef and lettuce....no cheese....$9.16 with tax.....and no drink.... So I thought, these have to be the best tasting tacos in the world, right?  Well, no.  No they weren't.  So 2 tacos, rice, beans, no chips, no drink, almost $10.  Sorry, there's something wrong with this business model.  I don't feel the need to go back just for the cleanliness of the dining area."}
{"text":"I was iffy to try this place because on the outside it looked kinda ghetto but I'm SO glad we did because the food is SO tasty! We love to get the Bacon Breakfast Burritos and the Carne Asada Burritos. SUPER tasy, huge burritos with amazing flavor. My mouth waters just thinking of it. I love the green salsa but the red they have is good too. Oh and their Horchata isn't too sweet, pretty tasty ;)

The inside is actually pretty nice compared to the outside but we usually just use the drive though."}
{"text":"Second time here. They're 24 hours, offer small and regular sized street tacos and the prices are reasonable."}
{"text":"This place just opened up. I'm not going to lie, seeing it was another -bertos restaurant scared me because they are usually terrible. However, this place was pretty good. Definitely not the best Mexican food, but I will continue to go. For 5 street tacos, a large drink, and a churro, it was about $14. Each taco is $1.29 The Carne and al pastor were good and so was the churro. The green salsa was pretty good too. The best thing about this place is that it is open 24 hours for both lobby and drive thru (at least that is how it is advertised). That means late night tacos whenever we want. You can tell the employees are new though. The girl at the drive thru was a little slow and still getting used to everything. That will all change with some practice though. I can't comment on the inside because we went through the drive thru. Overall, a good Mexican restaurant with cheap eats. Definitely will be back."}
{"text":"The food is so good! The carnitas street tacos are my favorite. All of the salsa is tasty (Not watered down like other places) inside the restaurant is very clean and the staff is friendly. You can't beat 1.49 street tacos!"}
{"text":"Great food and a well stocked salsa bar!  I've been here multiple times and experienced great service!"}
{"text":"I love this place and go there probably more than I should. Super friendly staff, especially Irving. He has such a positive and friendly demeanor. Carne asada street tacos are always amazing and the California fries are great. If you like it really spicy, get the spicy California fries. You can't beat their Big Breakfast burrito for only 3.99 between 5:30 and 10:30. The salsa verde is probably one of the best I've had short of making it myself. The red is the right amount of heat and super spicy the way I like it. This is my go to place for Mexican food."}
{"text":"Great place. Love the street tacos! . Quick friendly service. 100% better that Filibertos."}
{"text":"Very tasty fresh fast Mexican. They totally redid the inside of this old building. This is the cleanest the place had been in 20 years.

Green sauce is bomb. They have a thick green sauce that is super spicy.  The red sauce though is lacking or it's a different type of red sauce. I've tried it three times and the red just didn't go well, but the green was great.

They server thier Street Tacos on doubled up small corn tortillas. So you can make two tacos out of one."}
{"text":"I don't understand all the good reviews here. Sorry but this place sucks big time. The kitchen lady never changed her gloves after using the phone , touching this and that , Grabbing meat with her hands with those dirty gloves gross! Cross contamination ppl!!! Pp should take this seriously. Definitely not coming back!  Oh and my girlfriend torta looked like a semi tuck ran over it 3 times !!"}
{"text":"I had 2 great plates before but today we had the large hard shell tacos that were disgusting. The shells were so over cooked they totally exploded on the forst bite, the pastor mest was tough and also over cooked. Asked for the works like before including guac. And got only chopped onions. My lady asked for only cheese and got a ton of chopped onions which she cant eat. Way down hill from the previous visits which were great. A total dissapointment."}
{"text":"Tempe store just opened. My co worker and I ordered tostada's. They put 2 tostada's in 1 container with a layer of paper between them. My tostada on the bottom was smooshed. Food was still good but thought the packaging was unexceptable."}
{"text":"I can't believe it they have a breakfast burrito less than four bucks and it's huge and really good and you cannot beat their fish burrito"}
{"text":"Waited in the drive-thru on a Saturday morning around 9:30 - only car in line - for a breakfast burrito (made to order assuming from the 10 minute wait) that was nothing fancy, just eggs, cheese, and potatoes. Got it home and it was the blandest breakfast burrito I have ever had. No salt. No pepper. Nothing. Definitely not worth the almost $6 I spent on it."}
{"text":"Okay so the only reason I'm giving Rigoberto's 4 out of 5 stars is because I'm currently on a diet and it's not diet friendly. So I'll write the rest of the review based on my pre-diet dining. 

This place is some serious mexican food. Not the fancy stuff, the good, mexican-at-home style. It's good at 6am, lunch, dinner, midnight, and even the 2am drunk-I'm-hungry meal. I have three favorites here.

1. Bean and cheese burrito w/sour cream - the beans are refried with good ol' grease. It's delicious and the cheese is legit cheddar.

2. Super Nachos - I don't understand how you can not finish this one. They give you a ridiculous amount of chips with a mexican buffet on top, but once you get the hot sauce on it, you can't stop.

3. Carne Asada burrito, no pico, with sour cream and Guacamole - Cooked fresh on the grill and wrapped in the biggest tastiest flour tortilla. They even will sell you the tortillas by themselves if you ask. 

Enjoy!"}
{"text":"This probably the best Mexican food restaurant I've eaten at in a long time. It's very simple..no chips and salsa at your table but great food at a reasonable price. We're HOOKED"}
{"text":"First time here... I ordered the street tacos today.  Omg! The meat is so tough and dry it's not even edible. And they poured the onions on so thick...there's more onion than meat! Save your money and go somewhere else! What a waste."}
{"text":"Ordered the fish taco combo (#20) and pollo asado burrito to go. Got home with food.  Major disapointment.  Two tacos come in the combo. Had to pick around the grated lettuce to find any fish.  What they did was take a 4-inch battered fish fillet and cut in half and then brake each half into tiny morsels and place it in each taco.  This tiny little 4 inch fish fillet set me back 8.49 before tax.  The pollo asado burrito was just a tortilla filled with guacamole sauce and the \"shreded lettuce\" and a few chopped chicken pieces.  The rice in the combo platter was what could be called crispy rice (undercooked) and had no flavor.  Just enough tomato bouillon in the cooking water to give it that red color.  The beans were okay.  All in all, don't waste your money.  You would be better going next door to Vaqueros."}
{"text":"If you want this kind of Mexican go to Filiberto's instead. The quality is much better and they actually give you full servings. Every time I come to this location I have to wait 15 minutes for my food and it is either too salty or they don't give me enough of anything. Ordered a beef taco and a bean tostada and instead got a salad"}
{"text":"I got the carne asada fries and my wife got the street tacos. Both were good. The horchata was the best I think I have had anywhere. But the service was the best. We ordered a kids meal for my boy and couldn't decide between fries and beans and rice.  We decided on beans and rice, but they brought both. The owner also brought out crayons and paper for us, along with two quarters. My son wanted a toy out of the machines, but we had no quarters. He heard and brought it without even being asked. I just moved here and they just got one dedicated family."}
{"text":"Went there this morning and got 2 street tacos with beans and rice. The street tacos were good and had great flavor. However the beans were way to salty and the rice was absolutely disgusting. The rice tasted as if it was burnt and came from the bottom of the pan. It was way to hard and hurt my teeth to eat. I only got to bites in and couldn't finish it."}
{"text":"There are two types of people in the world. The kind that go to Filberto's and the kind that go to Riliberto's when they have late night munchies. It's a battle of the Bertos out here. 

I pulled up to the drive thru and saw that they had pictures on their menu. I like that. My eyes darted to the Carne Asada fries because that's my go to, but to my disappointment I saw shiny guacamole.  You never want shine in your guac...everybody knows that. So I steered away from that part of the menu and decided to play it safe and go with street tacos. Good choice. They were Rili good. I'm going to pledge my allegiance to team Rili for the time being. But matte guac can easily change the game."}
{"text":"My first time must've been a random lucky night for me cuz the second time was MEH, and the last time I found some plastic piece in my food!! Sick for hours after, had to throw it all out. *gag*"}
{"text":"Food cooked to order and huge burritos at 2am. Open 24hrs so nice to get authentic Mexican food anytime, especially thru drive thru. Loved chorizo burrito which was huge, hot and tasty. California burrito was very good, huge too which had fries in it with tasty beef bites. Never had so good surprise. Rolled beef tacos were crunchy, but nothing special. In fact kind of bland so salsa or sauce is a must. Speaking of sauce/salsa, their tiny cups of red sauce given are freaking HOT and not for the lightweights who can't handle spicy. Green sauce was good and mild. I didn't like their guacamole, though I'm not much for avocados or guacamole anyways, but if it tastes good I can deal with it, but theirs was not good. 

Definitely will go back and get burritos and other things to try. Especially since the other 24hr franchise place sucks and gone down hill. This place is better in food and service and convenience of 24hr drivethru. Prices are decent and they don't skimp on serving sizes."}
{"text":"Guess I shouldn't expect quality when ordering from a 24hr taco spot. The pork tasted as it had been cooking ALL day, very dry and overcooked. Carne asada was okay. I did order quite a few tacos and they came out pretty fast... not the greatest but also not the worst."}
{"text":"Terrible!!! I went through the drive thru and made my order. I got to the window and had to repeat my order several times. Very annoying. Then they messed up my order and didn't even give me what I asked for! Plus it was cold! They need to get it together. I thought they might be competition for Vaqueros, but there is NO contest. Vaqueros for the win!"}
{"text":"I ordered the #14, 4 rolled tacos with rice and beans.  Everything was slopped all together in an open container and had the appearance of dog food.  First I tried the rolled tacos.  The guacamole covering them was brown and tart.  After scraping as much as I could off, I tried the tacos.  Ice cold and chewy.  The rice and beans were lukewarm at best.  Absolutely disgusting.  I should have suspected something when I saw the 1 other customer in the restaurant throwing away several plates of food that they didn't want to eat.  I will never go back and will be sure to warn everyone I know to avoid this place at all costs."}
{"text":"A remodel on an old Wendy's building isn't enough to make up for the garbage this place serves and the worthless staff."}
{"text":"I went through the drive-thru for fish tacos this was the third place that I went to to find the tacos so I was already frustrated and was extremely alarmed when the woman told me she did not know what kind of fish was in the taco she said that they had a bag with the fish in it & she said the bag didn't say what kind so I'm wondering how it is legal to serve something when you have no idea what it is.....I was completely caught off guard. And will NEVER eat there. I was a first-time customer but instead I went next door where they knew exactly what was on their menu. NOT ACCEPTABLE.

I even lied and told her I was allergic to certain types of fish to see if that would make a difference and she didn't care. Scary."}
{"text":"OPEN 24 HOURS, this is the hero we all deserve. Came intoxicated around 3am after a night out. The food is probably whatever sober, but under the influence it was fire. Machacha burrito was really good and the salsa bar on point. Beats any other joint at 3am."}
{"text":"I had this place for the 1st. The girl at the window was more than willing to assist in getting my order just right. I do feel the price was a bit high but the food wasn't so bad. I'll be back to try other things."}
{"text":"The owners probably should have named this place differently, because although the name implies it might be similar to something like Filiberto's, that wasn't the case at all.  The California burrito (a difficult menu item to find in AZ) had the most tender and flavorful meat I've ever had in a fast food Mexican restaurant.  In fact, all the ingredients were rock solid--the fries were crispy and freshly prepared, the guac and pico were tasty, and the tortilla was a nice mix of chewy and crispy.  The street tacos were also very good--again, probably more in the league of a Baja Fresh than a Filiberto's.  

The dining experience itself was well above expectations--the staff were quite friendly and professional, everything was very clean, the furniture and flooring were upgraded beyond what you might expect, and there was a clear investment in technology, such as the menu that spanned four flat screen monitors and had a slideshow displaying high-res photos of various dishes.  

I can only hope they put one in Chandler eventually, as it would beat all the local Mexican fast food joints in my neighborhood.  I'm feeling a pretty strong 5 on this one."}
{"text":"Paid just about 9 bucks for a small tasteless California burrito. Will never go back."}
{"text":"I tried to order a simple taco salad without any vegetables and was told it was impossible to make because the meat was already precooked for the day ... refusing to make a custom taco salad out of laziness takes the \"fresh Mexican food\" label you claim away in my book."}
{"text":"My guilty pleasure when I need my breakfast Mexican fix! Probably the only place I like to get my breakfast burritos because they make them all day long! I only like an egg, cheese, and sour cream as my ingredients, so it's nice that they are able to make them like that. The restaurant is cleaner than the other Haus of Bertos I've been to, and the staff is very friendly and courteous. Great salsa bar too!"}
{"text":"Actually really good. Came here for the cheap breakfast burrito not expecting much...Well, I was a little worried. I think its $3.99 and I went thorugh the drivce through. I am always nervous of the drive through at any \"'ertos\" location due to time sat waiting...and waiting. Well, not so much the case here at all. I ordered two one for me, one for my boyfriends sister. It was about eight bucks. The friendly younger girl was polite at the window, the order came out quick and the green salsa was really good. The burrito consisted of egg, ham and cheese. I was actually happy there was no poatoes because I consider them a boring \"filler\". They were HUGE, cheap and tatsed fresh and great. I will get them again for sure :)"}
{"text":"Don't plan on getting the right order. Also didn't appreciate being called a pinche guerro when I came back in to get the right order. I just got my money back instead due to their attitude and refusing to replace my 15 minute old order with fresh food.
Find another taco shop. There are 2 within a mile of this one. Do yourself a favor and go there instead."}
{"text":"What a piece of crap place. Ordered delivery. Told 30 minutes. An hour later called and everyone claimed they didn't speak English,  even though everyone spoke English when I ordered. The delivery service had to get involved to get the manager on the phone and admit that they all spoke English and were messing with me."}
{"text":"Stopped in this morning.
Many special throughout the week.
Today was a bean burrito.
Street tacos are a $1.49 each. 8 different types of meat to choose from.
I opted to go with two Carne Asada (hard shell) tacos standard size. Cost-$8.65 without a drink.
Pretty pricey in my opinion! 
Salsa Bar- about 5 different blends to select. Hot Carrots and Jalapeños too!
Meal was average, atmosphere pleasant, restaurant is very clean including the restroom."}
{"text":"Tacos de pastor are super yummy! Great flavor and a good portion of meat in a double tortilla taco, the breakfast burrito (2.99) is as big as my for arm and well filled. A great mix of cheese eggs and ham, the carne asada was not my favorite, but as long as they keep making latir I'll be back"}
{"text":"Well the food is FRESH, that's the good thing. Not a lot of unnecessary seasonings -which is good for health but a lack of seasonings dulled down the WOW MEXICAN FLAVOR we were seeking today.  I'd be willing to bet this food is more low sodium than most establishments in the metroplex. An easy bet! Having said as much you can not beat the cleanliness or the friendliness of the staff. This was an awesome spot to dine at today especially since I just so happen to be watching my sodium intake. However for the lack of succulent seasonings the $25.00 that we paid for two meals was too much. We ordered the #20 FISH TACOS & the #15 Carne Asada Platter. We ate very little of it because there was no YUM factor & while that's good for our calorie intake, it's not so good for our economics."}
{"text":"This place is so good. I love our Arizona-touch on Mexican food so much, however when it comes to street tacos, nothing beats good ol' authentic street tacos in Mexico. The street tacos here are the closest second I've come across and they are so good! I come here at least a couple times a month for these things. They are always so prompt and pleasant as well. Highly recommend."}
{"text":"This is the second time ive visited this place and both times they have gotten my order wrong. My first visit I was dining in and asked for no lettuce and extra sauce on an order of enchiladas, what I received was plate of enchiladas that looked like they purposely drizzled sauce on since I had asked for extra, which I was charged for. I took it back up to the counter and the guy acted like it was an inconvenience to have to get me extra sauce. My second visit was through drive through I asked first what came in their California burrito because each place is different in what they put in it. The lady tells me steak/cheese/French fries/guacamole/pico de Gallo. So I asked is it steak or carne asada, because there is a difference. She tells me carne asada, which is fine but I thought it weird to tell someone it's steak when it is not. I then ask if she could please substitute sour cream for the guacamole as I'm allergic to avocado and no pico de Gallo,she tells me sure I'll have your total at the window. Now this burrito is already priced at $7.00 since for some reason places think it's ok to charge an obscene amount for anything that includes avocados, well she charges extra for the sour cream and tells me the burrito is $9.00 and some change. But it is what it is, I then get to work and guess what kind of burrito I have....a burrito that is 90% French fries and pico de Gallo, no cheese no sour cream and couple of pieces of meat tossed in. This place is a joke and I would not recommend eating here ever unless you like paying extra for something you didn't even order."}
{"text":"Terrible first experience here. Ordered a breakfast burrito in the drive through with no other cars there... took more than 5 minutes for someone to answer the window after I pulled around, then she asked for my order again... 5+ minutes later I finally get the burrito but the steak is too burned to even eat it. I literally threw it away. Not planning on ever  returning. Vaqueros is literally right next door and is way better."}
{"text":"These are the best street tacos in town. Very fresh, well seasoned, dee-lish!!! So many choices, carne asada, chicken, on and on...really worth the trip!!"}
{"text":"They charge more than filibertos and give less cheese and guacamole....all the time. I thought maybe it was the first few times I visited but nope they are really stingy with the guacamole and cheese and they charge to much. Very disappointed because the flavor is great."}
{"text":"2 out of 3 meals were inedible. The beef has a horrible smell and flavor. The only thing good were the chips. Even the salsa had no taste. How can you screw up salsa? Big disappointment!"}
