{"text":"So far so good! Very friendly staff very nice atmosphere food looks great.  I'll uptate later"}
{"text":"This a great neighborhood bar! I had the lobster bisque and wings. The lobster bisque is the best around, yum! Wings were large and done perfectly. This is a great new place!"}
{"text":"Their clientele sucks. Never been there and NOT seen a fight break out. Otherwise decent food."}
{"text":"Stopped in to have a quick app and drinks. To sum it up, it's another Parma bar. The good: they cleaned the place up and it looks clean and fresh. The couscous and shrimp was excellent. Service was great.  Lots of tvs. The not so good: we ordered the most unique thing on the menu, other than that it's regular bar food you can get anywhere (would love to see more like the couscous or lighter/vegetarian options). No craft drafts. No live entertainment aside from karaoke and trivia. No keno. No dart boards. All in all it was fine but nothing screams \"I have to come back!!\""}
{"text":"If I could leave no stars, I would. The bartender had too Google drinks, and the cook was clearly drunk and told us all the food was just \" frozen shit\" 
We used too to several nights a week when it was grillers and had a great menu. 
Our group will not be going back."}
{"text":"Stopped by with a friend since we live so close. Interior was super clean and there are a ton of tvs right next to the bar. I had the Carolina gold wings and they were high quality and tasty. Definitely beat goldfinger wings from winking lizard. The beer selection does seem a little sparse but that could always change. Overall one of the better bars in the area I think!"}
{"text":"This place is a hidden gem.  Very nice \"corner bar\" with the feel of a family and neighborhood. The food is amazing with a price tag that dose not go deep in the pocket. Food specials and happy hour makes you want to stay all day."}
{"text":"I used to love the bar that was here before since I live within walking distance so I was anxiously waiting for this place to open. I stopped in with a friend to try it out last night. To start, the inside is really nice and some major improvements were made. There were new tables, chairs, the place was repainted and it overall looks bigger inside. The menu is really nice and they have some good daily specials. I had the Carolina gold wings and a mixed drink. The wings were really good, decently sized and priced well. My only complaint is that they only come in packs of 10. I really wanted to try a couple different flavors. The service was great- it was the bartenders first day and she was really nice and attentive to all her guests. I will definitely come here again."}
