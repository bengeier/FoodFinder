{"text":"A friend and I some time to kill before seeing a movie at the Scotiabank Theater so we went to Sushi Time and grabbed a bite to eat.  We ordered edamame as an appetizer and a few orders of cucumber and avocado maki. Well, we got our maki first, and it was good. It was a bit on the big side and loosely wrapped, but on the bright side, the avocado and cucumber were fresh. The edamame appeared after we had finished about half of the maki.  The service was friendly and we got our order quickly, but at the end of the meal we waited about ten minutes for a bill. Every moment one of the staff would go by we'd try and wave at them, but they'd come rushing past us.   Overall it was okay. It's a decent spot to go before a movie, but I probably wouldn't seek it out on at any other time."}
{"text":"Really not impressed. The sushi rolls were too big to eat properly; I almost choked a few times. The rolls also didn't hold up very well, and usually fell apart on the way to my mouth (which is maybe a good thing, considering my previous point). The fish in the rolls was also not cut properly - it was basically one giant chunk of salmon instead of easy-to-eat smaller pieces. Really not an enjoyable eating experience.  Most annoyingly, the service was terrible. We were waited on briefly by our waitress, who we never saw again for the rest of the afternoon. At least, not stopping by our table - we saw her sitting a few tables over eating her lunch. Our drinks were empty for 30+ minutes and we were staring at her, but she never came to help us out.  Given the amount of sushi places in the area, there has to be somewhere much better."}
{"text":"I've visited Sushi Time on two separate occasions. There won't be a third...  On the first occasion, during my lunch hour, I order a sashimi combo. It was slightly better than mediocre and the price was right. As for the service, it wasn't bad nor great - it was just sort of there. The location is just a couple of blocks away from my workplace, so I decided to give it another try for lunch.    On that second visit, the service was mind-blowingly awful. It was around 12:30 and while the restaurant was fairly busy, it shouldn't have been unmanageable for a downtown sushi restaurant such as Sushi Time. I waited at the storefront to be seated (there were two or three tables available, so I figured it wouldn't be long). Five minutes passed. Two separate servers looked directly at me as they passed by, but neither of them greeted me. My existence was barely acknowledged. There was no \"I'll be right with you\" or \"Just one moment please.\" I understand that some people have default faces that may not represent how they actually feel, but both servers appeared to be miserable.   Ultimately I decided to abort my Sushi Time lunch plans after another five minutes and. It was clear that the servers noticed that I was leaving as a result of not being properly acknowledged; they just didn't care. I will not care that much either when Sushi Time goes under and is replaced by a more customer service-, quality-oriented establishment. The turnover for Queen Street West businesses is high after all."}
{"text":"If you like diarrhea shooting out of your bung hole in the middle of the night this is a perfect date spot for you!   Put down that phone and cancel that colonics appointment because you've found a cheaper alternative.  Disgusting. Avoid."}
{"text":"Such a bad place, rude attitude even cannot speak good English. Waited more then 40 mins for a take out item. Never come again, not recommend. Lunch box is not good as the other sushi places."}
{"text":"Good food at great price  Very responsive servers  Korean ribs were a bit tough but the tempura was good For 9.95 a bento box, it is simply worth a visit"}
{"text":"If you need a meal to sustain you for a long period of time. Go for the Curry Beef or Chicken Don. It's served with miso soup and a salad. It's affordable and the portion of food served for eat in our take out is amazing! They don't skim! I appreciate that the most next to the fact that the food is consistent and mouthwatering!"}
{"text":"Initially, when i tried this chain on bloor street, I was not an instant fan of the sushi.  I typically ordered their bento box or sushi platters. However, I have tried the place again at the Queen street location, and now it is my \"to go\" place if i'm looking for basic sashimi. I like the sashimi and its a great place if you are looking for value for money. The football sashimi platter has 24 pieces in it (3 pieces of 4 dif kinds of sashimi - salmon, tuna, butterfish, and hamachi, 3 pieces of shrimp sashimi, 3 pieces of surf clam, and shredded pieces of squid). The meal comes with miso soup, salad, and a bowl of rice. They also serve green tea.  The meal came to $18.50 plus tax and tip.  The only thing that is underwhelming is the tuna sashimi...everything else is pretty good."}
{"text":"Sushi Time is my latest favourite sushi place. The food is fresh, staff is prompt and friendly, prices reasonable. I often go there on Friday nights with large groups and they always welcome us without a reservation. Lately I've taken a real liking to their sushi pizza, nice a thin, fresh rice patty. Always good edamame there too."}
{"text":"Not bad, but not great value for the price either.  The maki was ok tasting, but the rice in it was undercooked with a gritty texture.  Who does that?  The green tea was kind of gross.  For $15 (maki and tempura) you can get a better value elsewhere.  The service was actually good though, quick and friendly."}
{"text":"Their lunch prices are great, you can get a full meal for about $10 and you'll leave feeling full. I've been there twice and I've tried both a roll special and a bento box.  For the roll I got the Spicy Salmon & Yam Tempura combo, I was a bit hesitant at first since I assumed they would be tiny 6 piece rolls but I pleasantly found out that they come as decent sized pieces and 16 rolls in total. It came with a salad and miso soup as well, as do most Japanese restaurants. The rolls weren't the prettiest but it tasted pretty good. And for only $7.99, it was a great lunch.  All the bento boxes on the lunch menu were listed at $8.99. I like having a teriyaki and tempura so I opted for the beef & croquette bento box. The bento was massive. It had about 6-7 pieces of tempura (one of which was shrimp), a potato croquette, a portion of beef teriyaki, a bowl of rice, and an orange slice. For the price, this was amazing value. For the bento I paid around $11 including tax and tip.  Not bad for a cheap and quick lunch!"}
{"text":"Not sure what happened to this place. Remember going years ago and liking it.   But this has got to be one of the worst sushi places I've tried. Ingredients weren't fresh, rice was hard and dry, and shockingly difficult to swallow.   Not recommended."}
{"text":"First off, service deserves a 1-star. Just outright awful. Our waitress had no patience when taking our orders.   W: \"Are you ready yet?\" (stone-faced) Me: \"Can we get the Wednesday lunch special?\" W: \"Not available\" Me: \"Oh.. then.. *flips through menu again*\" W: \"Ok, you're not ready then\" and walks off  Her attitude was so horrible I don't think she's on the right career path. Unfortunately Sushi Time does not have quality food to make up for the bad service.   We went home and had a stomachache.. I don't think the tuna was fresh. The sauce on our salad starter was sour, and did not look or taste fresh (the lettuce was soggy instead of crispy).   I wouldn't return for the above reasons. You've been warned!"}
{"text":"I was here for a business meeting last week during TIFF, and I found it to be a solid experience and a refreshing change from my usual go-to sushi place in Toronto (Oniwa, across from Roy Thomson Hall).  I had the Ski Bento Box (chicken), which took some time to actually arrive at our table, but was well-made and tasty. I wouldn't call it amazing, but it certainly got the job done, and the portion size was about in line with what I expected.  The ambience was quite nice, and it was fairly subdued for a Thursday evening (and with every table filled, no less). The service was somewhat slow, and I had to go up and ask for our bills to be delivered because the waitress looked distracted.  Other than, I was quite pleasantly surprised by the experience, and I will certainly visit again in the future."}
{"text":"I'm a bit surprised by the reviews. I've eaten here twice and had great meals both times. Staff were kind and attentive. Food was quick and tasty. Really liked the saki as well."}
{"text":"I am so not happy because the food was undercooked, the salad and vegetables tasted like water without the in H2O. I asked for a fork and the guy as playing with it in his hands before he got to my table. The reason why I gave 2 stars is because the ice and water was good!!! Nothing taste good"}
{"text":"I did the take out the Kimchi Box it was awful and a waste of money the short ribs were dry and barely any meat just fat was so disappointing the tempura was so oily and soggy the rice in the rolls were dry. I would never eat or take out with them again."}
{"text":"On a scale of 1-5, 3.5 for the food, 0 for the service. This was supposed to be the end of my comm but since yelp said it was too short, so I'll add a few more. I was served with miso soup without a spoon, waters came 10 mins after being seated, that's about all I could recall, cuz food was too meh to remember"}
{"text":"A let down in my opinion - I'm not a fan of Sushi Time at all. The Sushi combos consist of average quality sushi (at best) with poor selection. I hope you like Salmon because your going to get a lot of it.   Service was quick and efficient which differs from some of the other reviews. I arrived on a Friday at 11:30am and the place was empty.  I ordered the \"Football\" sushi combo at $17 which I didn't think was good value at all (see below).   The combo was completely uninspiring - 3 Salman Maki, 3 pieces of Salmon sushi, a giant Salmon hand roll, Cucumber Maki, Ebi, imitation crab sushi and then one piece each of Red & White Tuna and Tako.  Definitely not worth $17.   The combo was served with the standard salad and Miso soup. Way to much salad dressing on the salad - I didn't eat it. Also ordered a Diet Coke which was served in the worlds smallest glass.  One could go to Yuzu around the corner and get the Sushi lunch combo for 50 cents more ($18). An extra $5 would get you the fish bowl at JaBistro ($23) - also a block or two away. Although priced similarly, Sushi Time is not even in the same universe as Yuzu / JaBistro.  Absolutely no reason for me to return....     BK"}
{"text":"I've been a fan of Sushi Time since they were at the old location a few doors down. This Queen West sushi joint went through a move and some major decor changes in the last few years. Where it used to be a mishmash of sports paraphernalia, the new location has a classier look to it, especially the booths in the back.  In terms of service, I would give this place a 4 out of 5. It's generally very quick and efficient. Sometimes, when it gets busy, which happens often, the service can be a little slow but I've never really complained about the speed of service. If you order a combo, you'll usually get your Miso soup and salad within 5 minutes of ordering. If you order tea, it'll usually be refiled before it gets empty.  The food options are varied for the sushi lovers and those that prefer not to eat raw fish (it's all in their head I tell ya!). My favourite appetizers are the Gyoza (5 amazing little dumplings for $3!), chicken karage (Japanese style deep fried chicken morsels), and the endemame. Sushi Time's sushi combos and Bento boxes offer anything from maki rolls and nigiri of all sorts to a variety of tempura and teriyaki options (salmon, beef and chicken). The Dynamic roll (maki roll with shrimp tempura, japanese mayo and avocado) is highly recomended! For desert, you have to try the green tea ice cream. It's not unique to Sushi Time but it's amazing!  The best part of Sushi Time is that although there isn't anything special about the menu (you can get the same kind of food at about any other sushi place in Toronto), you can have appetizers, a meal and some tea to drink and the bill for two people will generally be less than $30! If you've been to sushi restaurants in other places, you'll know that they can get very pricey.   So for the average sushi, decent and friendly service and really good value I give this place a 4 out of 5."}
{"text":"Introduced the family to sushi pizza here. Decent reliable sushi. Quick service."}
{"text":"Nothing horrendous to report, fairly average sushi bar, reasonable selection of rolls ,service was reasonably quick.  A serviceable choice if your favorite is over-run. Decor is 1970's disco, perhaps that is still in fashion in Toronto."}
{"text":"I've been going here since high school and I must say this place has gotten better and better over the years.  I don't quite understand why the reviews are so low, as this place offers very well priced sushi and is quite good for the value.  I used to always order the Basketball or Hockey bento box and they never disappoint.  I ask  anyone on yelp to try and find a better price for a bento box with a side of sushi in Toronto!  The servers are always friendly and after the revamp of the restaurant the place looks a lot better than it did before.  The owner seems to be a great guy and he is often seen working as a server or helping out behind the sushi bar as well.  He always thanks the customers and sometimes comes by to ask how the food and service is.  Overall I will continue coming back here as long as they keep up the great service and sushi prices!"}
{"text":"Decent Sushi place that has fried cheese for some reason and a good selection of dishes."}
{"text":"Was really in the mood for sushi so thought we'd try this place out. Should have gone to any of the other sushi places nearby.  First of all, the menu has the same page printed on it twice, which is weird. Secondly, some of the pictures aren't actually on the menu and don't have any descriptions. I got screwed ordering the summer roll - it intrigued me in the picture but I couldn't find a description. I ordered it anyway. Strawberry on top, banana and mayonnaise with salmon in the middle. Disgusting.   I guess it was my own fault - should have asked what was in it before ordering so I'll take part of the hit on that!  Also ordered the CN Tower roll and it was useless. The rice wasn't fresh, it wasn't put together great and the whole meal was remarkably unremarkable.   Will not be going back to this place."}
{"text":"I had a bad experience with Sushi Xtra with their delivery service, so I ordered from here right after. GREAT customer service and food! Definitely ordering from here from now on."}
{"text":"Went here for a change of pace and left disappointed.  I ordered some edamame as an appetizer and it was pretty standard/unremarkable. I also ordered makimono set C, which includes green dragon roll, spicy salmon roll, and spicy tuna roll. They were all pretty horrible and very difficult to tell apart.   This place is utterly lacking in flavour and left a bizarre after taste.   Given that we are fishing our seas dry, I would hope such a precious resource would be prepared with more care and attention."}
{"text":"Sushi time is the right balance between a decent sushi and a fair price. It's been around for quite some time now, which in my opinion means only one thing: business is good like the food it serves.   The menu is nothing too fancy; it has whatever any other sushi place has but thank god it doesn't have all you can eat so you get a bit more variety and with a higher quality.   The service is prompt and courteous but it could surely use a bit more \"be warm and smile\" type of attitude. However, that's not a critic: I'm just thinking out loud as long as the service keeps the standard it always provided since I started to come here back in 2005.   Price wise the restaurant is reasonable. You can have several portions and a beer for a mere $20/$25 dollars.   If you happen to be on the Queen strip between University and Spadina where it's getting harder and harder to find a decent food joint (Stelvio is an exception of superb Italian restaurant), stop by: I guarantee you that you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Terrible sushi...rice is mushy and NOT sushi grade rice.  Flavorless food- we had the tempura udon- the tempura pieces were tasteless. Like eating air + cardboard. the agedashi tofu was absolutely tasteless as well.  The gyoza...what the hell meat is that? BEEF? What happened to pork or even chicken?  The only thing passable there is the Salmon Sushi Pizza and the service was pretty good. For the same price, I could have gone to Guu and had a 5* meal.  PASS!"}
{"text":"Ive been coming here the past few months and love it  I dont understand the negative reviews !  usually do takeout, their lunch specials are great, i usually order two to go  spicy tuna roll, spicy salmon roll and dynamite rolls are fantastic   only complaint is they charge $2 if you want to substitute, even if youre substituting a cheaper kind of roll than whats in the combo!    Still the best local sushi for the price  and Ive never gotten sick once in my months of eating here so Im confused why so many people are. Maybe reading the reviews here are giving people the wrong mind set when they come  try it for yourself though"}
{"text":"I'm surprised by some of the harsh reviews here because my experience today was really quite pleasant. I went with a friend for lunch, and while I was a bit disappointed that they didn't have a full-sized lunch menu of any kind, the Basketball Bento Box that I ordered was really good, and not ridiculously priced (I think $10).   The soup was delicious, and the salmon and cucumber makis were of decent size. I ordered the beef teriyaki and it too was delicious, although parts of the meat were a bit tough. The gyoza was yummy, as were the salad and tempera. What I found interesting was that the tempera not only included the regular eggplan and sweet potato, but also shrimp, white fish, and a piece of crab. Neat!   Service was quick and efficient. No complaints there. The place is really clean as well.  I'll probably be back here."}
{"text":"We were supposed to eat at another sushi place in the area but they told us we were too late for their ayce sushi and ended up here.   The food is good with a reasonable price. Our favourite is the platinum roll, it never disappoints and we get it all the time. Service could use some improvement but overall, we always find ourselves eating here when in the area"}
{"text":"The quality of the food here at Sushi Time wasn't very good.  The Bulgogi beef was quite tough to chew through and wasn't authentic Korean Bulgogi beef -- I guess hard to expect much since we were at a Japanese restaurant and not Korean one.  The Green Salad was decent with the light dressing but the greens in it weren't completely the freshest.  The tempura was good!  I liked the shrimp and vegetable temperas as they were all lightly battered and fried."}
{"text":"More like Sucky Sushi Time.   My boyfriend was too lazy to walk \"all the way\" to Aji Sai so we decided to try Sushi Time. Do you ever regret the calories you use up at a bad restaurant? Well I do, and Sushi Time is a big caloric regret for me.   First off the menu was so nice with all of these seemingly legit photo's of the dishes. All of the food looked really nice that we actually had a hard time deciding. Finally I got the Golf Box and my beau ordered the Korean Box.   Each of our boxes came with 3 pieces of salmon and 3 pieces of cucumber maki - aka teensy morsels of salmon loosely wrapped in rice and nori. They were the smallest maki's we had ever seen. Next off the rice that came in my box was cold and therefore hard. Weird. The gyoza was painfully bland and so so SO oily that one bite was more than enough.   The prices were the same if not more than Aji Sai, the service is fine, the food is sub-par and I will definitely not be returning. Ever.   I hate to complain so much, and I only do when necessary. This rating is solely for the quality of food...or lack there of."}
{"text":"Love going here for the lunch specials on my work break. Call ahead before you pick up. You get so much food for under $10!"}
{"text":"What's in a name?  Well, at Sushi Time that's what you get.  Fast fast fast service.  It seemed as if we had 3 different servers at any given time.  They almost stumbled over each other taking orders, pouring water and dropping off our first round of food.  This small Queen St. mainstay is always busy, no matter what time of day.  They have a winning combination. Very good (not spectacular) Japanese food, strong price point and awesome service.   I tend to be conservative when ordering Japanese food so this place is perfect on the risky scale.  If I were to be a bit more adventurous, I would probably lean toward a higher end spot like Blowfish or Ki.  But for a good, easy and fast after work dinner, this is the spot.  I especially like that the tempura order comes in multiples of 2.  Nothing makes me as angry as having to debate with your dinner partner who gets the third and final piece.  It inevitably ends up in a game of Rock Paper Scissors (unless of course you are eating with your significant other, in which case there is no argument).     Sushi Time does deliver but the food tends to be cold by the time its gets there.    On another very cool note, I asked the couple sitting next to me if they would mind if I snapped a photo of their bento boxes (as seen above).  When I told them why I was being such a creepy guy, they said \"Yelp, I've heard of Yelp\".  They actually recognized the name from a sticker at a café in Chicago.  We Yelpers are taking over one big city at time.  If you guys are reading this, thanks for the chat and welcome to Yelp."}
{"text":"I knew something was. wrong when we stopped in and the place was dead! the sushi pizza nothing like it used to be, no scallions, no spices on it obviously they just cut corners. Even thee gyozas were different and could not compare. how could you run a good restaurant like this into the ground. so sad I took my bf there to turn him onto sushi pizza and it was sub par :'(    also the green salad was mixed greens I missed the silly iceberg and the crunch of it!"}
{"text":"Based on the average dining experience and food alone, it would have gotten 2 stars. Food was well below average, but what you would expect coming from a Chinese-owned sushi restaurant. I had the Ski bento box and there was a decent amount of food, but don't expect anything for quality.   However, I'm giving it only 1 star for a reason. I had left my purse in the restaurant and realized around 20 minutes later. After I went to pick it up, I noticed that 5 dollars was missing from my purse. Of course, someone else could have taken it but it was unlikely as it was slow then and they had mostly found it when clearing the table.   5 dollars might not be a lot but to me, it speaks volumes about the type of business I contribute to when I eat at their restaurant and I'd rather not pay and tip an establishment that lacks integrity."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time at least 10 years ago. Moved onto other Japanese restaurants since then. Once in awhile I would try lunch here while I was in the area. It's a decent local Japanese sushi place that serves sushi for the masses. Seems like the same owner this whole time. Recently I've been getting takeout from here and getting back into it. Just eats has online ordering for this place. Apparently delivers but haven't tried. The last lunch I got takeout I had a dragon roll and sushi salad roll. Yesterday I had takeout for dinner and ordered Makimono set B, dragonroll and toronto roll. The green dragon roll in the Makimono set came without the avocado on top. They missed that entirely. Not too happy with that. Overall decent sushi at good prices for a quick fix."}
{"text":"Been here a couple of times, Once in the daytime and evening. Evening sushi service was way better, the sushi tasted more fresh and flavourful along with our side dishes. I got the scallops sauteed with veggies, scallops tasted great but the veggies tasted soggy :( my friend got the seaweed salad along with chicken teriyaki.  I never had seaweed salad before but i gotta say it tasted different but sweet, I would try it again!  Our rolls, Dynamite, Spider, Chicken and Spring. All tasted great, average sized, but service was quite slow...the only downside of this place."}
{"text":"Ordered sashimi. Salmon was quite good, tuna was hard and quite bad and butter fish was the worst butter fish I've ever had - hard and chewy.  I used to go here frequently years ago and decided to try again - but I think I'm done. Terrible value for money as it's kind of pricey too."}
{"text":"It's always time for Sushi Time! I love this cute little Japanese restaurant right in the heart of Queen West. It's a great place to people watch, the service is always great and best of all the food is delicious and very well priced.   My favourite part of these restaurant is how they name their bento boxes - ski, basketball, baseball and golf! How random is that? Each one comes with a mound of food - teriyaki, salad, rice, tempura. Last time I went there, it was about $9 for a bento box and I could not finish all my food.   The edamame here is also very tasty and the sushi is also a hit.   For the price, service and the tasty food, you really can't go wrong with sushi time!"}
{"text":"Horrible Food (Quality) ... Horrible Service (messing up on orders, attentiveness)...  Went with a Group of four ... Everyone was greatly disappointed .... Take my advice if you see the place Keep Walking !! Sorry Sushi Time You really need to do a better job ..."}
{"text":"The sushi pizza and the CN Tower roll were good. Very generous portions for ice cream, unlike many sushi restaurants that charge you $3.25 for two little scoops. Decor was really nice as well. Service could have been better. The servers were quite inattentive and took a very long time to get my orders (the restaurant wasn't even that busy at the time!). It took me a while to get my server's attention when I was ready to order and it took them even longer to come over to my table when I wanted to get a look at the menu again for desserts."}
{"text":"I sure am glad so many people have complained about this place cuz I think they stepped up their game and lowered their prices as a result!  I was drawn in by the Sunday - Thursday dinner specials.  I saw all kinds of chicken for $3.50 and 2 frickin' rolls for $6.99!    My boyfriend and I expected some average, sloppy sushi but we were pleasantly surprised.  Our waiter was nice and very quick to take our menus away and I don't know why.  Perhaps because he was about to unload a heaping pile of chicken on the table, and there was simply not enough room.    The $3.50 Chicken Karage was absolutely delicious.  My only constructive criticisms are the appearance of the rolls and the breaded cartilage chunks in the chicken.  Don't do that to me again Sushi Time. I'm not kidding. The salmon and sweet potato roll looked like an overconfident baby made them. The cartilage chunks were breaded so it was disturbing biting into them; it felt like I bit right into the chicken's kneecaps.  I know what's on the inside of a chicken's knee caps now.  Its surprising that the reviews are so bad at this place. Maybe if I find a feather in my roll I'll boycott....or if I bite into a beak like some of these other yelpers might have, I will not return. Until then, 4 stars!!"}
{"text":"First off, the waitresses. They're kind of bad at their job. I've been served by the same waitress twice and she was rude both times, clearly was not having a good day and both times just disappeared and never came back.  Also, sometimes this place has a weird funky smell. I can't really place my finger on it, but it's weird.  The plus side, the interior is ok and the lunches are ridiculously cheap and pretty good.   I'll come back, but only for the lunches since they're so cheap. Other than that don't come here expecting great customer service. Come for the cheap sushi deals during lunch. And DEFINITELY don't bring a date here."}
{"text":"The specialty rolls were pretty good, but the basic rolls (california, tuna, salmon, etc.) seemed like they weren't even trying.  On the other hand, the unagi was the best I've ever had."}
{"text":"It's been a long time since I've been here, but I ordered a makimoto (B) with 3 rolls (dynamite, spicy tuna, and something else).  It was a little bit too much for one person, but they delivered what was on the menu.  The quality was just ok.  But it was a super quick sushi fix, and they were prompt with service."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I came into Sushi Time for lunch.  I hadn't been there in years, but the $6.99 lunch specials were tempting.  I had the spicy salmon/avocado and sweet potato roll.  My boyfriend had the teriyaki chicken.  The restaurant itself was fine; it was clean.  The bathrooms are not accessible.  The service was quick, but the food was kind of sad.  I mean, I'm used to crappy Japanese miso soups and salad.  I won't fault them for that.  What I do fault them for is the sad, sad maki rolls I received.  The restaurant wasn't even busy!  As someone who has worked in a sushi restaurant, and had to roll hundreds of orders a day, shame on the guy working at the sushi counter.  My rolls were falling apart on the plate when I received them.  The rice and the ingredients were fresh and delicious, but the presentation was lacking.  I will not be returning."}
{"text":"Cute little spot and delicious sushi! Mainly order a variety of maki rolls and sushi pizza, but it's absolutely great! definitely recommend it!"}
{"text":"Edible though definately not incredible. Though the atmosphere is cute, the facility clean, and the service prompt the food was not so great. Unless of course uncooled sushi rice, and warm raw salmon in your rolls, and chewy pungent seaweed is your type deal. The miso soup was actually pretty great though.  Very hot and lots of tofu and nori and what not. but all in all it's a PASS."}
{"text":"The atmosphere is nice, the service is fast, the prices are reasonable, and the food itself is only \"decent\".  I got a bento box, which off the bat was a few bucks cheaper than at other places I've been to, and the price is the same regardless of whether you want chicken, beef, or salmon.  I found that everything vegetable related was very fresh and full of flavour. The miso soup had more green stuff in it (whatever it is, I'm too busy eating!) than at other restaurants, and the vegetables in the sushi rolls really stood out.  For everything else, I'd say it was just decent. The seaweed on the sushi rolls was hard, and the rolls kept falling apart. Everything else was decent, but just didn't have as much flavour as other places I've been to.  Service was very fast and friendly. The decor and atmosphere isn't going to blow your mind or anything, but it's a lot nicer than most of the Japanese places in the area.  In comparison to other Japanese places in the area, I would choose Ho Su Bistro across the road first, Aji Sai to the west second, and then this place. I found the food to just taste better overall at those restaurants, but I'd say this place is a little cheaper."}
{"text":"Sushi Time continues to be one of my favorite Japanese restaurants in Toronto. If they would give the bathroom a coat of fresh paint, I would give them a 4.5.   Why do I like Sushi Time so much?  1. They let you sit where you want, at any table open, even the booths that could seat 6 people.   2. The prices for the high quality, are the best around.   3. They make the best Salmon Don   4. Usually easy to get parking in front.   5. Service is good and quick.   6. They have great value for their bento boxes with sport theme names that are easy to remember (I.e. Hockey Sushi).   If you're looking for a non-AYCE sushi place on Queen near Spadina, you'll like Sushi Time."}
{"text":"This place was okay. I got a bento. It was a good price. I think its worth it. Things could be more flavourful though. When I went it was basically empty."}
{"text":"I'm a bit baffled by the low overall ratings. I dined here last night with my friend (his recommendation) and really enjoyed my meal. The restaurant had a very nice décor and the bathroom was immaculate (I always tend to check out the restrooms). For appetizer, we shared the mixed tempura and salmon pizza which was to die for. Fresh salmon was delicately placed on fried rice (which served as the \"crust\"). Afterwards we shared the CN Tower special roll and the Sky Dome---both were equally delicious and the seafood was fresh. We were offered ice cream on the house which I thought was really nice. I chose the red bean--very good. I am a huge Sushi fan and in my opinion, this restaurant delivered!! Btw---the prices are very reasonable."}
{"text":"The dynamic roll gave me food poisoning! Server brought me a cup of water stained with lipstick!  Sushi CRIME. This place is a pathetic waste of space!!!"}
{"text":"I went to Sushi Time for the first time on a Saturday evening. It was simply okay. Definitely not the best sushi in the city. It's a nice atmosphere, although there was quite a large noisy crowd there that night. My friend and I ordered a few maki rolls (dynamic roll, red dragon roll, spicy salmon roll). and the tempura appetizer. Tempura was good and sushi was bad. Only cons was the pieces were cut a bit big and there was too much avocado in the rolls. Service was okay; waitresses were friendly but a bit hard to flag down at times; they'd just rush past you. Price was average."}
{"text":"All the rolls tasted the same. The quality of the rolls were okay. The staff were attentive. I wouldn't go back because there are much better places around."}
{"text":"Awful! I would not recommend this place to people who like sushi, or service at a restaurant. I went here with my husband and we ordered one of the sushi combos to share, plus other apps. The spicy tuna rolls that were in the combo were INEDIBLE! they tasted really bad, and like they were expired! which is a complete no go for sushi. I literally spit it out. The service is also sub par. They loom, and like rush you into ordering. Like stand next to you, as you read the menu, and stare at you...and then bring the orders out and like balance the orders on top of each other to minimize the amount of trips they have to take. I'm sorry, but I'd rather not have one of my scallops touching the bottom of my dinner plate. Again, if you love, like, semi-enjoy sushi--don't waste your time here."}
{"text":"First time coming here. Came here for lunch.  Environment: great ambiance.  Cosy. Not too busy.. Service: overall good and moderately fast. I didnt have to wait very long. Food: ordered the \"basketball\" bento box. It was great...much better than other similar chicken terriyaki bento boxes I have had at the other restaurant. Presentation was good with a good mix of different tempura. My partner ordered the vegitarian bento box and she was also enjoyed her meal. She liked the tofu which was smothered in terriyaki sauce. The vegetables were cooked well but could have had more flavour. See pictures.  Overall impression: I would come back here when im in queen west again."}
{"text":"Sushi TIme used to be THE sushi place.  No more.  It's now filled with Queen Street 905 day-trippers who don't know good sushi from a mac and cheese with ketchup and hot dogs dinner if you know what I mean.  Sushi Time used to be the definition of downtown sushi, now its the McDonald's of sushi.  Asians don't even eat there (which is the telling sign for any Asian food establishment, by the way).  With being the go-to, a full house all the time means that they've let the quality slip.  The udon soup was lukewarm, it took them 5 minutes to bring a spoon and never offered the hot chili pepper that goes with it.  The sushi pizza we ordered came 5 minutes after we finished our other food.  The manager skulked over my shoulder waiting for our money because there was a lineup out the door.  Lucky I didn't tip.  You'd be better to walk a few minutes to either Aji Sai, Sushi Queen or Hosu across the street -- go figure, the Koreans make better sushi than the Chinese folks who run most of the sushi places in this town."}
{"text":"Like Melissa J., I wanted to like Sushi Time, since I'd heard decent things about it.  So, in the interests of public safety, I agreed with myself to forsake my usual Queen West sushi joint (Ho Su, always good times) this one time ONLY and never again - for Sushi Time.  First, service.  It was non-existent.  The servers, such as they were, spent a good 20 minutes after we sat down floating randomly around the restaurant and chit-chatting with one another at the front preparation bar.  We didn't even get to place a drink order until we physically flagged someone down.  And when we did, the server acted as if she was doing us a favour.  Secondly, the food.  It was merely ok - it kinda looked ok, and kinda tasted ok I guess.  The rolls were kinda gigantor due to what appeared to be multi-layered rice, but otherwise...it was ok I guess.  My issue is that for a place that looks this fancypants (decor is nice), you'd better deliver an artfully prepared, delightfully presented and fresh and savoury result.  This was merely ok.  Thirdly, Ho Su is basically across the street, so save yourself aggravation and mediocrity and go there instead."}
{"text":"The service is awful! Really! But the food is good and portion is great! If it's not for the service, it should be rated as 5/5."}
{"text":"Such a classic shame when new owners cut corners an run a once great place into the ground.  Sushi Time was once a favorite go-to for me. Reasonably priced good with above average quality. The service used to be consistent and fast  not impeccable or anything fancy, but consistent.   Went there tonight and we waited almost 30 minutes for service. I had to go up to the cash to get a waitress to come over and take our orders. The tables around us were also getting bad service with the nearest one asking for their appetizers for most the time we were there only to get them after the mains had arrived.   Although they offered us a pile of chewy, ice cold seaweed to appease us, it was still another 15 mins by the time my companion got her main with mine not yet arrived.   I went to the bathroom and returned to find some deep fried tofu waiting on the table, which we had. It ordered so we sent it back and I watched the waiters flail their hands trying to figure it all out. My companion got the CNE roll with red tuna... Except what arrived was the white variety. I asked her to eat up as she was hungry. My food arrived when we was halfway done her meal (mercifully eating slowly to wait for me).   I got the hockey sushi combo (the waitress was not sure which it was and was struggling to remember) and was perturbed by the wet to the touch sushi and the less than fresh looking piece of octopus tentacle. I love tako but I thought better of eating that piece to avoid a go of food poisoning.   Such a shame."}
{"text":"Just your typical sushi place. Nothing too special here. The teriyaki sauce is nice. The lunch menu is a little lacking. Prices are average for downtown sushi.   Nothing bad really, just nothing great either."}
{"text":"Really bad quality of service with regards to the good.  How can you miss leaving a string in a dish??"}
{"text":"Very sweet people...they don't really know their wines but we're super accommodating.  Lunch specials are inexpensive and very good.  Sushi fresh and nicely presented.  Always a full house at lunchtime."}
{"text":"Wouldn't have willingly gone here if it weren't for the collective vote of team lunch. It's fast and can accommodate large groups - that's all it really has going for it. We sat in the back where it was dark, but not enough to hide that the tables weren't wiped down yet from the previous diners. Sushi was falling apart and certain cuts of fish seemed discoloured/not fresh.   Questionable raw meat is not cool."}
{"text":"I used to always go here. It's one of my favourite dine in menu sushi place. Service is always good. Food is yummy.. Sushi pizza is a must try."}
{"text":"I found myself at Sushi Time because it was  the closest  sushi establishment as per the great oracle (aka yelp). The atmosphere was strange - serious poppy hip hop music was playing loudly, the server seemed confused and overworked running back and forth to help the four tables eating. I order a spicy tuna roll and a dragon roll, both were just okay - below par in this city of a million sushi joints. The quality of the fish was not the finest and my edamame were cold. The prices were average. I do not plan to have time for this sushi again."}
{"text":"Rude customer service and the salmon gave my friend diarrhea, but the sweet potato maki roll was good.  PART 2: PERSPECTIVE OF MY FRIEND, so when I first walked in, I thought it would've been better than their competitor, but no it wasn't. FIRSTLY, they used tea from a wooden bucket and I saw them pour the tea that customers didn't finish back into the bucket (very non-sanitary!) So when ordering the food, the menu had quite reasonable prices but compared to the service... OH MY the service was HORRIBALE! The man that came to take our order seemed like the superior or something, he gave many death stares and it made us feel really uncomfortable! He asked if we were ready and we were, so ordering was a hassle because we had many allergies but, he said we couldn't change unless we paid, which we agreed! But, he didn't end up changing, and it was quite rude because my friend was severely allergic to avocados! Going on to the food, we found curly hairs in the rolls! Is that normal?!?? NO! THE CHEF MOST likely had been scratching his pubic region and hair got on the rolls and we did not eat them! Them the spicy salmon was the worst since the salmon had a bad smell like when someone has a UTI!! The fish was out of date!!! Didn't eat + the soup tasted like bleach and salad was saltier than the server himself! Surrounded by a group of Asians talking in a foreign language and pointing at us made us feel SEVERELY uncomfortable! Never go to this restaurant! Had only a few pieces of the spicy salmon and a sip of soup and now been stuck at the toilet for 1 hr!! This place is horrible and will never go again!"}
{"text":"I was in the area looking for a quick sushi fix and decided to check into Sushi Time. I was surprised to see so many fowl reviews, especially since this place was the first sushi bar I had ever tried more than 10 years ago. Hungry as hell and maybe even curious about their horrible rating, I decided to pop by anyways and order a makimono set.  Well I definitely remember enjoying sushi here before but maybe my tastes have broadened or their quality has declined or both...  The soup and salad were good as per usual so props for not botching that up. The rolls were big and full of rice... I wasn't too impressed with the flavour either. The spicy tuna was odd... there was no spicy mayo, instead it was a roll of tuna with a spicy salt. Even the dynamite roll was kind of meh.  Would I protest angrily if someone insisted we come here? No, but with so many awesome sushi joints n this city and the immediate area, there is no need to subject myself to lacklustre sushi."}
{"text":"Nope. Just, no.  My miso soup bowl was dirty, there wasn't a clean spot to hold the bowl.  The broccoli tempura went bad and they still served it - the broccoli was a mud-ish brown. California roll was okay, the Dynamite roll was uneven - some pieces just had shrimp tempura.  Service is hella slow. They will blatantly ignore you when you wave them down and keep on walking."}
{"text":"I want to like Sushi Time, I really do, but it was always mediocre at best. After several mediocre visits, I had two experiences that made my decision for me.   Bad Visit #1: Servers \"forgot\" to place our orders. After 30 minutes, we received our deep fried tofu appetizer, and that was it. Then after we said something, it took another 45 minutes. They gave us free green tea ice cream at the end, but my stomach holds a grudge and it was not pleased with the hour and a half of total waiting time for food that wasn't even great.  Bad Visit #2: Ordered a bento box with a little bit of sashimi and sushi rolls. Received chunks of fish on plate, followed by chunks of fish wrapped in an inch-thick layer of rice. They were actually cube-shaped. And they were hard. And stringy. The maki were so big I had to take three bites to finish them, but I couldn't even bite through the fish because it was all stringed together....anyway, you get the point. It was gross.  I have not gone back since bad visit #2, simply because I am afraid of the fish they use, and their giant rolls. This place is too much of a gamble for me. There are so many sushi joints in this strip, try somewhere else."}
{"text":"Picked up a sushi combo for lunch at Sushi Time the other day. When I got back to the office and opened it up I found that all the avocado was brown and rotten. Firstly, how a sushi joint can run out of fresh avocados is beyond me. Secondly, and more disconcerting, there is no way that the sushi chef could have made my meal without noticing that the avocado was off, but he served it anyways. That is just shameful."}
{"text":"I only go hear if my friends want Sushi. I've been too quite a few sushi places, the food has a lot to be desired. Service was okay but they forgot one of our bills but they did give us separate which is great. Table was a little sticky. My friends do seem to enjoy the food that why I gave it two stars."}
{"text":"The food is plentiful, but the service is excruciatingly slow. During the office lunch hour, restaurants around the area are consistently fast - they have to be, given their principally corporate clientele. Sushi Time, however, gets their Bento boxes out slow, and while they're a fairly good value; most people in the area don't have the luxury of waiting thirty minutes for food to emerge from the kitchen.  Food quality was par for the course - but Ho Su Bistro is right down the street, and while it isn't spectacular either, it's at least fast."}
{"text":"Sushi just wasn't good. It was sloppily made, didn't seem fresh, and tasted crumby. Good service though."}
{"text":"I used to come here all the time but I will never go again.  I'm at work and went to get takeout for dinner.  I ordered the makimono set B which comes with dynamite, spicy tuna, and cne which is salmon and avocodo.   I brought it back to work and was very much looking forward to the spicy tuna as it is my favourite roll. It was salmon........100%...I'm a girl who knows her sushi and I never order spicy salmon because I find it too fishy.  I was gonna say screw it but decided to go back. I told the man it's not tuna it's salmon and he looked at it in the light and said it's tuna. I said no it's not I tasted it, and it's pink not red like tuna, I eat sushi all the time. So the sushi chef took it back and made me a new roll.  Well guess what?  I brought it back to work and it's salmon again. I'm not going back because there's no point but this is the definition of getting scammed. Everyone knows salmon is cheaper than tuna and they probably think I'm some stupid white girl who doesn't know the difference.   I will NEVER go back. They are thieves."}
