{"text":"took the wife over to lakeshore to check out what the hype was all about, pizza was very good. Not your normal fast food pizza joint, very high quality. The dude working there i think his name was sean, very friendly, good kid. we actually swapped numbers hes gonna help me find a car from his friends at roy foss. Anyways we dined in and enjoyed the cool space. Will definately be back!!! and sean if you read this you better not forget to call for the car!!! ha ha  just kidding brother. GREAT PIZZA!!!"}
{"text":"I'm not a big fan of run of the mill pizza and thought this please would be different.

The first time I ordered an extra large pizza with basil tomato and cheese. It did not change my view of pizza, Given, that they a wood burning oven I expected to be like the pizza I had in Naples, Italy. I was so disappointed.

The service is very slow and found that 30+ buck for a large pizza it a bit expensive."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza in the city! Fresh ingredients and friendly staff. I love it! The homemade pepperoncini dipping sauce is out of this world. I hope they start selling in by the jar."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I were driving along Lakeshore trying to find a new place to eat at, and we decided to finally try FBI. It' a little on the pricy side if you load on the toppings, but we just got mushrooms and sun dried tomatoes. We saw the guy using fresh dough, which is a testament to how fresh their ingredients are. The dough was amazing, and the sauce was also real good. We wanted to try the dips, but one of the guys working there told us that one was on back order from italy, and their dip machine broke and theyre awaiting repairs. The owner (I think? Maybe manager) overheard and gave us a dessert to make up for the sauce. Excellent customer service, excellent quality, and decent prices. I will definitely be returning!"}
{"text":"Messed up my simple order (asked for white and got loads of tomato sauce) and the pizza itself was beyond mediocre. Asked for hot peppers and I thought it was plain at first look they skimped so hard on them. Taste? Like shitty thin crust Pizza Pizza. Threw it out after 1 attempt at a slice.

Brother got a calzone, he also didn't like it. Overly saucy and just bland.

Our group also got a large pepperoni, also wasn't received well. Pretty sure most of it was thrown out. Apparently it tasted better cold, but that's not much of a compliment that it's decent as left-over scraps.

Goes without saying I'm/we're not going back."}
{"text":"What happened?

Like the last reviewer, I always turned to FBI when I wanted a delivery pizza that was actually good real food. Our pizza tonight was terrible. They messed up the first order (we had ordered thin crust) and offered to send another pizza along saying it would be here in 25 minutes. The first pizza was crazy greasy, there was barely any crust hanging out, and the crust itself was on par with something like Pizza Nova, (which has it's place but it's a 15 dollar pizza)  - not the blistery tasty crust they used to have. 

Our new pizza arrived an hour later, thin crust, like we'd always ordered in the past, burnt to a crisp, cheese burnt, just as greasy - gross really. Can barely chew through the thin crust. 

Don't know what happened here, but will stick with North of Brooklyn from now on if we're going to get delivery. This was a $26 plain cheese and basil pizza. No full blooded Italian would serve pizza this terrible. Too bad."}
{"text":"Tried FBI pizza for the first time...not impressed. The girl taking the order over the phone had no clue about the advertised special on the website.  An hour later my cold pizza arrived with 2 toppings instead of 3 (even though all toppings were on the receipt), no drinks, no dipping sauce.  I asked the driver about the drinks and he told me that I could have drinks OR salad (the advertised special includes both).  He gave me a coupon for a free salad but after review, the coupon expired in November 2012???
I called back to explain the mistakes and asked to speak to a manager. The girl answering the phone said the only people working were herself and the cook. She offered to send another pizza. Thanks, but I didn't want to wait another hour.  

The pizza was delicious but having to deal with incompetent employees is just not worth the trouble.  One would think that the people working there would know what the advertised specials are..."}
{"text":"Never ordered from here before cuz I thought I was out of the delivery area. So glad I'm not. Late night weekend delivery and the pizza is delicious. My new favourite!"}
{"text":"ordered last night, 2 pizzas one veg. one thin crust. I live half a block from their location on Lake Shore West and when the pizzas arrive half of the toppings on both pizzas were on the cardboard boxes. The toppings were watery so they did a \"landslide\" off the crust! Expensive, so I expected them to taste awesome, but the taste is only a little bit better than BIg Slice (downtown) and Il Pasaeno. I ordered an all vegy one and a half and half anchovies and pepperoni for the \"test\". Just ok, not great. Take it from me ppl I know what good pizza tastes like. I eat out all the time. I've dined in fine restaurants, US and Canada. I like cold pizza too,. so when I dont finish on the first sitting I'd put it in the fridge. Took it out this morning and tried to eat it.........soggy, like mush. That's another true test of a good pizza.

To all the ppl that say it tastes good.............you need to develop your taste buds."}
{"text":"Aside from a big increase in prices recently*

Good toppings/crust, wings are huge, sandwiches are great, nutella pizza is amazing but a couple times has been burnt on the bottom center."}
{"text":"BY FAR the best pizza in Toronto!!! - After hearing (and reading)  so many great reviews, my boyfriend and I finally went to FBI pizza for dinner; we entered with high expectations and left with nothing but satisfaction! The pizza was amazing, the staff were incredible and the service was quick and fantastic!! We sat in with a fine dining experience and got to kick back and watch the game while we ate... All in all I would consider this the best pizza in Toronto... Full blooded, Italian, perfection!"}
{"text":"We order from them quite often. Probably the best pizza in the area. Margherita special with thin crust is our go to favorite. Wait can be long for delivery when they're busy so we often prefer to pick up."}
{"text":"Have only ordered for delivery from FBI in Vaughan.  Their pizza is good, cut into 6  large slices (big size).  Once pizza arrived, 40 mins later, (standard) it was not hot, which was disappointing. 
I do feel they are overpriced. The \"big\" size pizza price starts just under $10 and each additional topping is $2.25.  End up spending about $20 for one pizza with only two toppings."}
{"text":"I've ordered their pizza before and it was good. Lots of better pizza in the city, but most of the better places don't deliver and FBI is way better than a chain delivery joint. But delivery is terrible. This last time I Ordered a pizza, I waited 90 minutes that the confirmation said it would take. Called them at 90+ mins and they hadn't started making it and said it would take another 90 minutes. They offered us 50% off. Wow, save myself $15, who cares. And that's why chains exist....."}
{"text":"Love their walk-in margherita special, I get it often coming home from work or we have a busy weekend. It tastes much healthier than the box chains, fresher ingredients, less processed. I usually call ahead and it's ready and hot when I get there 15 minutes later."}
{"text":"Being a FBI myself I know good pizza. This place is comparable to pizza I've got in Italy. Fantastic and would highly recommend. Whoever said pizzapizza is better in their review doesn't know what real pizza is, typical caker."}
{"text":"First time trying this place and it sucked. Pizza took  almost an hour and a half. After an hour of waiting they called and said they ran out of one of the toppings. Pizza showed up cold and the guy didn't have change. Definitely wouldn't  recommend  this place at all. Way too expensive. Pizza Pizza would've been better. Frozen would've been better."}
{"text":"I have been ordering delivery pizza for a while, however as of recent, the service went down hill. Orders are inaccurate. Delivery takes more than 1 hour. Yesterday I waited 2 hours for my pizza!! When I called to check in after 1.5 hours of waiting the receptionist told me that the driver was on the way (I live 8 minutes away by car). After 20 more minutes still nothing. After two hours I called back and said that I was not going to pay for the order as 2 hour wait without any late notice is unacceptable. Thankfully they agreed. When I opened up the pizza, it was the wrong bloody pizza!! They put basil in it instead of cherry tomatoes - how the hell do you mess that up!? It was gross. We were starving so we had a couple of slices but it was utterly unsatisfying. The driver's reason for being so late was that the order before me was 25 pizzas - that's not my problem. And also that he couldn't find where I live......there is GPS for that. Clearly you can't handle the volume of orders, so please hire more staff or tell your customers that the wait times are longer than normal. It's called integrity. I could have ordered from somewhere else instead of getting an hour late delivery of the wrong pizza. You just lost a customer. I am never ordering from you again.

**on another note - I browsed through your answers to other people's reviews on Google and boy \"really\" and \"lol\" responses are unprofessional! I am not sure who answers these, but you should take up some customer service courses - because this is extremely rude and dismissing."}
{"text":"FBI pizza is the best pie I've had this side of Toronto, and probably all of Toronto.  Excellent crust,  sauce,  and toppings,  even the asiago dip kicks ass.  The pizza here can get a bit expensive if you go crazy with toppings but I assure you it will not dissapoint."}
{"text":"I've been here a few times since updating my review. I find the pizza to still be good. I love the thin crust. I usually pop in for a personal size pizza. However, I now find it expensive. Two small personal pizzas and 2 drinks for $30! They also recently changed the place and now you can't see the pizzas anymore. I liked it better before when I could see and pick what I wanted.  I also recently tried delivery and it was unfortunately slow. For a few reasons I'm now downgraded my review. But I still recommend and hope they can turn things around for the better."}
{"text":"Ordered a Canadese pizza on a Saturday night on a recommendation from a friend who used to love this spot a few years ago before she moved to NYC. Since she's back in town for a bit we decided to try this spot and make her extra happy. Like most reviewers we were shocked at how nonchalant they were about the 90 minute delivery time. 90 minutes! That's freaking nuts! Anyways we ordered, it was slightly late whatever. The pizza wasn't bad, it was pretty salty but not inedible. Definitely not worth the wait. My friend told us it used to be much better. We weren't completely disappointed but I won't order from here again."}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place but I was hugely disappointed. Too much sauce, not enough cheese and toppings. Keep looking."}
{"text":"I am ready to do cartwheels all the way down the Lakeshore I'm so happy! Finally, FINALLY, there is something edible on the Lakeshore. Not just edible, delicious. I ordered a thin crust pizza with mushrooms, black olives and zucchini (with tomato sauce) and it was so good. So so good. One of the best pizzas I've had in the city. I read or heard that they are owned by or affiliated with Queen Margherita Pizza so it's not surprising that it was so good. THANK YOU FBI PIZZA I LOVE YOU!"}
{"text":"I eat FBI at least once a week, it's so addicting. Glad to see nice places like this in Mimico. Family favourite is The Rocco and personal fav is The Canadese. Go and dine in, they've got really friendly service and the ambience is great. Clean, classy washrooms also a plus. Overall great place!"}
{"text":"FBI pizza is amazing !!! Favourite pizza place ever!! The people are very welcoming and the food is always fresh and tasty."}
{"text":"Finally I was able to stop by FBI on a weekend afternoon to find out why so many people are raving about this place. To be honest I don't understand why. The pizza tastes rather average whereas the price is above average and size below average. In other words not the best value for your money compared to other Italian pizza places in the west end. The other reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is the long wait time. There were less than 10 people in the restaurant and it still took them over half an hour to get a simple pizza Margarita on the table! don't think I'll be back. Sorry."}
{"text":"This is one of my favorite pizza places to order from in Toronto. I used to get the \"bigger special\" but it has unfortunately been discontinued. 

I always get the bigger size pizza. It's enough for two people to be very full and I often have some leftovers... I get the thin crust margarita and add cherry tomatoes to it... Delicious! I've had regular crust and I didn't like it, so I recommend ordering the thin crust! 

I also order the radicchio salad (I think there's another lettuce in it too) and the dressing is delicious! 

Their new wings are so good too. They are large, crispy and they taste so fresh.

Their dipping sauces are delicious as well. I've tried the Asiago, the barbecue wing sauce (which is more like a homemade Medium wing sauce), the marinara, and the pepperoncini... I'm kind of a sauce junkie. 

Everything here is homemade, made from quality ingredients and authentic Italian. HIGHLY RECOMMENDED!!!"}
{"text":"The pizza was not the best I have eaten; it's not something I would recommend. The lady who took the order and the delivery guy were nice. The price is reasonable. The pizza is was a disappointment. I doubt I'll order from FBI again. I really wanted to like the pizza."}
{"text":"Awful!
We had heard great reviews so we gave it a try. 

The toppings were not fresh tasting or well prepared. We threw the pizza in the garbage and had upset stomachs from the small amount we did eat.
Normally not picky and practically a crime to thow out pizza in our house. Stay away from this place unless you like overpriced yet gross tasting pizza"}
{"text":"Being a fairly big advocate of Pizzeria Libretto I have to give F.B.I Pizza top marks for being the closest to restaurant quality pizza from a delivery joint, it's all
about the sauce and fresh toppings. This place offers quality toppings such as thin sliced prosciutto Di Parma DOP, Porchetta, Pancetta, Caramelized onions roasted Zucchini, Bocconcini to name a few... If you live on the east end of Toronto you shouldn't have an issue with delivery, they are pretty accommodating"}
{"text":"Aww man, this place is so heartbreaking to me! There was a period, maybe six months ago, when we ordered from FBI *very regularly.* Like, \"more often than human beings should eat pizza\" kinda regularly. Because it was so darn delicious! But then the steep decline began. 
On top of consistently getting our order *just slightly* wrong (toppings missing though charged), we began to wonder if they had ended their partnership with Queen Margherita. We were told they hadn't, but the sudden difference in their crust was HUGE, changing without warning from perfect, NYC-style thin crust to dry, tough, and (rough though this sounds) worse than Pizza Pizza. For real. We're talking bad pizza. 
So...Maybe they hired someone new to make their pizzas? Or maybe the pizza master is still there, and we just happened to order on the exact days when s/he was off sick? Who knows! But when the pizza is as expensive as it is at FBI, we're just not going to risk it. We stopped ordering after a number of bad experiences in a row.  Give it a try -- maybe you'll experience FBI at its best? Because FBI at its best is pretty great.
OR, try North of Brooklyn -- delicious."}
{"text":"Was excited to try it, but the lack of service or even common decency compelled me to write my first Yelp review. Congrats FBI! 

Entered the restaurant and was promptly seated with a menu. 

Server asks me if I'm ready to order when I've barely had a couple moments with it. 

Another server says she needs to take my drink menu for a second and I politely comply. 

Never returns the menu (No biggie I suppose since I wasn't going to order any booze). 

Waited a while for one of the 3 servers to take my order. 

Raised my hand for a while too trying to catch eye contact with one of them, but two of them are flirting with a customer behind a bar. 

Decide to leave since nobody took my order (which I have maybe only ever done once before because I consider myself a patient person). 

Bummed out because I wanted to try it, but won't be coming back. 

1 star for no service and therefore no food."}
{"text":"Well, I have had FBI pizza and it is pretty good and it should be given the high price but no where near as good as San Remo but San Remo doesn't deliver.  The delivery is what my issue is about.  I ordered a pizza at 5:45 and was told it would be 90 minutes which wasn't great but my guests and I decided to go with it.  At 7:15 I called the store to check on status and was told my pizza was on the way.  At 8:00 my pizza had not arrived.  At this point we were sooooo hungry that we had to walk to another pizza  place in the neighbourhood to pick up a pizza.  Not good at all.  While we were walking to get the pizza from another place the pizza arrived from FBI....how fresh could it be given it left the store 60 minutes before?  Needless to say I wasn't at home and didn't accept the pizza.  They lost a sale and money because they finally made the pizza.   I won't order from FBI again and not because of this one issue but because they didn't call to apologize or reset expectations about the delay etc.  Not good business people and there are  a lot of choice.  I expect that FBI will go the way of the doo doo bird if they do not improve service."}
{"text":"I love this place. Best pizza. You can taste the difference in quality. They use top notch flour for their za's and it makes the dough/crust taste POPPINGTON! I recommend the diavola, the wings (which were freakin HUGE)! I recommend takeout but dining in can be nice, as they have ice cold beer (chilled glasses) and TV's which usually have the game on. Follow these guys on Instagram... They're always UP TO SOMETHING - DJ Khaled"}
{"text":"Worst customer service and pizza is not at par with other local joints.

We decided to give FBI another try, despite the pizza, but it turned out to the be the worst customer service experience.

Our pizza was extremely late and instead of being apologetic the manager was very argumentative and very rude.  

This place is always late with their orders, their pizza tastes ok and their service is HORRIBLE."}
{"text":"Best delivery pizza in Toronto! Greasy NYC style street pizza. Great value and delivered in 40 min!"}
{"text":"There's a number of small pizza places in this area and with a friend who lives a few doors down form this FBI location it was an easy place to drop it. He's had several issues with poor success through delivery, so we tried dining in and service was fair. The staff seemed overwhelmed, even with what appeared to be eight employees on hand. They do a lot of take out business. 

This location is small, but has about 10 tables and a flat screen TV to watch games if you'd like to eat in. There's no soda machine, just bottled drinks in the fridge and the menu is dominated by pizza. Meanwhile, there are a few salad choices which are made when ordered and you'll enjoy them. They are fresh and made with better than iceberg lettuce. 

However, folks come for the pizza and while the crust tastes great, the entire slice is just above average. Our pizza had almost no sauce, but their fresh topping won't give you anything to complain about. If you live close by I'm sure this would become a regular take-out spot. The pizza is fair to good and while it won't be your favorite ever, it'll satisify."}
{"text":"Burned Pizza. Burned Pizza.... Let that sink in. They burn pizza and call it fresh."}
{"text":"Great pizza I have become a regular yes you pay a little more but your paying for quality. There flower and sauce is impoted from Italy dopio zero flour and San marzano tomatoes. Don't put a price on things you put down your mouth. Very good place  good food. Try the hoagies and salads they are amazing a cesear salad with panchetta wow. Keep up the good work. FBI PIZZA"}
{"text":"It's a decent pizza. Nothing to write home about. Not the best pizza in Vaughan. It's just Ok."}
{"text":"FBI Pizza (Full Blooded Italian Pizza) has landed in Vaughan. A spin-off of the highly successful Queen Margherita Pizza downtown, FBI pizza brings the same quality ingredients and traditions to their delivery and take out based operation. Their first location opened in the West end of Toronto and delivers high quality traditional Italian pizza. They serve their pizzas as Big or Bigger, and come with top quality san marzano tomato sauce and fior di latte mozzarella cheese to give it that authentic Italian taste. They also have a choice of regular or whole wheat dough. You can choose from regular and gourmet toppings to customize your pizza. If you pop in and are looking for a quick slice, FBI serves up Pizzette, (which are little pizzas) that are personal size and come in a few different styles. You have your plain Margherita, and a couple other options including a spicy pizza called the Diavola and a Pizzette Rocco, which comes with sausage, red onions and gorgonzola(blue) cheese. They also have dipping sauces for their pizza, your choice of asiago or a spicy pepporoncini one. If you are looking for something other than pizza they have some porchetta (specially seasoned Italian Pulled Pork) sandwiches and a few choice salad dishes. And best of all they deliver! So order in or come on by and try for yourself some delicious Full Blooded Italian Pizza!"}
{"text":"I have been a repeat customer several times but my most recent experience was very poor. We ordered at 6:30pm from their website and were told it would be 90 minutes for delivery. Thought this was insane for pizza but it was a Friday night and we really love their pizza, so fine we can wait 90 minutes. After 90 minutes passed I called the restaurant for an update. They said that there were still 4 orders ahead of mine but that it should be ready in about 25 mins and that he would put a rush on it. I said ok, well could you offer a discount or something for this terribly long wait? We are loyal customers and 90 minutes has already passed. He said \"I'll see what I can do.\" We hang up and the pizza arrives at 9:00PM (remember, we ordered at 6:30). The delivery lady was very nice but the bill had no discount applied, nor was there anything else added for free (like free dessert or even dipping sauce). I felt really disappointed. The pizza was good but this is not good customer service guys. If your delivery is going to be way over the estimated time, throw in some pop and dips for free - common sense for customer service. Now I will not order delivery again and would advise others against it on Friday nights. Sorry FBI, you dropped the ball. Good pizza though."}
{"text":"I took a chance based on the Yelp reviews and headed over with no expectations.  The decor was boring, the lighting harsh, and the service was anything but professional.  So far, just what I expected another bad pizza joint. But wait, the pizza was actually quite good. I'm originally from Montreal and know good pizza and pretty much gave up on Toronto on that subject. Not like what you would find in Montreal, but definitely good and definitely Italian thin crust (ask for thin crust).
When I got into my car to take my pizza home, I noticed an unusual smell, the smell was something i wasn't  use to in Toronto, the smell of good pizza.
The ingredients seemed extremely fresh, flavorful, plentiful  including the olives which were amazing. I would definitely go back.
I watched as they made my pizza,  you can see the pride they put into each pizza. Like the French they treat your pizza with a lot of respect.They even showed it to me before they closed the box, a nice touch.
All this for an eight dollar personal sized pizza.
Five stars for sure, I'm not sure it was real or a dream, so I am playing it safe until my next visit.

UPDATE: Been back a second time and it was better than the first if that is possible.  I don't live any where close to this place yet I find myself getting the urge to go for a drive for a pie.  Its real good!"}
{"text":"I have order from fbi twice...first time our order took 2 hours to be deilvered...and I only live 5mins down the road. When we did eventually get the pizza...it wasnt very good and over priced. We decided to give them a second chance. One hour after placing our order..they called us to advise that they are out of whole wheat pizza. We cancelled our order. Thanks for wasting our time FBI pizza."}
{"text":"If you are like me and you get an overwhelming feeling of sadness every time you think about Terroni's delivering and realize that this can never be....  then this is the solution for you. 

We ordered FBI last night for delivery. We ordered the Thin crust Big Pizza (they have two sizes.. Big and Bigger... If it's just two of you Big is definitely enough.. 8 slices!) with Panchetta, pepperoni, mushrooms and black olives (they were whole olives... pitted and amazing). I highly recommend getting the hot pepper dip.. (it's more of a hot pepper paste similar to Terroni's hot peppers).. Let's just say.. this was THE BEST pizza that has ever been delivered to my door. 

The price is right, the man I spoke to on the phone was helpful and lovely and the pizza... I honestly can't say enough good things about it... 

The only draw back to getting this place to deliver to you is if it's during a busy time, they may not be able to deliver to you depending on your location... but hey, who doesn't like a 1am pizza?"}
{"text":"I really do not understand why the rating is so low on this great local pizza joint. I feel like maybe it is people trying to sabotage it? Anyways, the pizza is fantastic and the renovations are great, its a fun place to get together with friends and enjoy all the yummy menu items they have to offer. The cook, Anthony, is funny as hell and really customer-oriented. With all the pizza places opening up in the area, this is the best for dine-in and take-out. Mon-Wed they also have an amazing deal (buy a pitcher get a free XL pizza) what more can you ask for?! Also, the dipping sauces are outstanding and made in-house and you absolutely have to try the nutella mouse for dessert. Did I mention the dipping sauce? MMMMMM."}
{"text":"I could eat this pizza all day and not get sick of it. Their asiago dipping sauce is making my mouth water as I write this. Sean is also really cool :)"}
{"text":"I ordered a personal margherita pizza for lunch.  It took awhile because they made it fresh...but worth the wait.  The crust is nice and thin with a slight crisp.  Sauce is good and they put a good amount of cheese.  Basil is fresh and even saw the chef smell it to make sure.  It's not made in a wood fire oven but is made with quality ingredients and made fresh.  Will order a bigger pizza next time."}
{"text":"One of the first things I learned when immigrating from Italy is that no amount of training can make up for the ingredients. Your cook could have studied in Naples for 5 years, if he comes back and can't use the same tomatoes, it's not gonna taste right. This is where FBI shines - their quality of ingredients absolutely sets them apart, and delivers a flavor that's very close to what I grew up with. This, and the bombo pazza (one of the best pizzas I've ever had), are what sets FBI apart for me.

That said, the place is not above some constructive criticism. They advertise that they cook their pizzas in an electric oven for a unique taste: There is nothing unique about a Canadian pizza cooked in an electric oven, that's exactly how Pizza Pizza, Double Double, Domino's et al do their pizzas. It's not better or unique, it's just cheaper and easier for a restaurant than running a wood fire all day. Honestly it's not something to draw attention to, and FBI should consider dropping it from their marketing. If you're on the hunt for authenticity, Oro Di Napoli up the road makes that last effort. 

I also sampled their dessert - a Nutella cannolo. (Their menu says cannoli, which is pluralized. You only get one.)

It's not a cannolo, like, not even close. Cannoli are a southern Italian specialty - crisp, flaky, fried pastry dough around a creamy cheese filling. The best analog I can give you is a \"cheesecake taco\". FBI's \"cannoli\" is a closed tube of baked pizza dough stuffed with Nutella. It wasn't necessarily bad, but it's not what I ordered if that makes sense. I ordered something light, crisp, cold and creamy to finish off my meal, but got something hot, doughy, oozing and way too heavy. I'm sure lots of people enjoy it, but I can't see anyone who's a fan of cannoli being anything but disappointed.

They should also really consider stocking one dessert that isn't Nutella-centric. I understand that Nutella is kinda new here and seeing a bit of a fad, but it's just hazelnut-chocolate frosting guys. It makes for a dessert menu that comes off as kinda monotonous and uninspiring. Alternatives don't need to be anything fancy, seriously just a scoop of vanilla ice cream and I'd be ordering dessert way more often.

All in all, a great place with friendly staff and absolutely awesome pizza that falls juuuust short of being the best in the city."}
{"text":"I don't get it. Not sure why everyone is raving about this place. 

Just had a pizza and it had no flavour,  there was barely any sauce. Last week I had a pizza at earls and it had soooo much flavour,  it's sad that a restaurant chain can make better pizza. 

I bought a tiny thing of hot sauce,  cost $2.50 and it was gross,  tastes like card board. I was struggling to get some flavour so I ordered a tiny container of tomato sauce,  not bad but another $2.50.

Spent over $37 for 2 people,  that's a bit crazy. 

Best pizza place is eatmypie.Ca in barrie,  haven't had anything compare to that in the gta.

I had this pizza 6 months ago and thought it was good then,  maybe they changed something or I was just super hungry then,  either way,  will never return"}
{"text":"Totally love this place!  Huge slices, homemade sauce and fresh ingredients. A little pricey, but well worth it.  Chicken wings tasted like they were homemade and were huge... One con:  pizza was on the saltier side (I ordered half pepperoni, half veggies). Regardless, I will be a repeat customer!"}
{"text":"I haven't had such a good tasting pizza in the GTA in ages.

The crust is delicious, thin or thick, the tomato sauce is fresh and great tasting, unlike the sour taste some big chains have.  The assortment of premium toppings won't leave you disappointing, but even a plain cheese pizza is a treat here."}
{"text":"We had been meaning to try this place for a awhile and finally got around to it while we had a few friends over one night. The pizza here is legit! We had the Bomba pizza which was sweet and spicy in the best way possible! The pizza is very authentic and is right up there with my favourite place in the city, Pizzeria Libretto. The prices are high but still worth it. We loved the pizza so much that a couple hours later when our friends left we ordered another, will definitely try this place again!"}
{"text":"I originally raved about this place, but after a year of ordering with these guys, I have to post a revised edition. They get something wrong every. damn. time. Sometimes it's the wrong cheese, or an ingredient is missing, or they forget your salad dressing, or they give you the wrong size salad. It's always something. And after waiting 1-1.5hrs for dinner, not getting what you ordered can be quite frustrating. 
At first, I was OK with it - they really don't give you a hard time and add credits easily, as if they are used to their orders being incomplete. I appreciate the credits but seriously, when you're paying this much for pizza you'd think they'd ensure the orders are done correctly. 
Anyway, my last straw with this place was last week - I called on a Sunday and the order time was 1.5-2 hours. She asked if I was OK with that and I said 'actually, no thanks. I'm too hungry\" and before I could even finish speaking she hung up on me. I was mid-sentence!
Honestly, I have spent hundreds of dollars there over the last 12 months and a little respect for repeat customers would go a LONG way. 
I think I still have a $10 credit in my name there but I don't even want to spend the money on them to use it. 
Oh, and they stopped offering the specials - so really they just want as much money from you as possible."}
{"text":"The pizza here is amazing. The crust is perfect thickness (when I order, I order regular crust), perfect consistency, and perfect taste. The sauce is real italian tomato sauce, no disgusting sweet stuff like pizza pizza. I usually just order the margherita because its so good, and the other day I ordered half pizza with the soppresata and mushrooms and it was AMAZING. So much better than pepperoni and the right taste too, like not old dried gamey meat. I also get the salads here which are really big and fresh, good dressing as well. The dipping sauces omg even the DIPPING SAUCES are good - i like the spicy peperoncino and the san marzano tomato dipping sauce. Honestly this place is so good. It's real italian pizza, and this is coming from someone who loves real pizza in NYC and who is Italian. It's actually really good, one of the best pizzas in the city that I have ever had. AND the price is ON POINT too!"}
{"text":"Soo delicious! The margherita pizza was delicious, as well as the rocco pizza. Definitely crowd pleasers. Have never been to the restaurant itself, only gotten delivery. Would 100% recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This pepperoni pizza is my I'm-at-home-looking-disgusting sidekick. 

Due to it being relatively close, we choose to pick up and wait times are standard -- 20 minutes. 

But, I don't know if it's the type of pepperoni or sauce but this thing is fantastic! 

Out of all the pizza delivery places, this might be my fav. Pizza Nova used to have my heart but the one in my area's service and quality is horrendous so I'm an FBI convert and there's no looking back!"}
{"text":"After my review, I received numerous messages - stating that I am garbage, that I have no taste, and that FBI pizza has the greatest pizza, I was told I am a degenerated c*nt.... this went on and on, I blocked the account, and the person continued to make multiple accounts to insult me... All because I didn't like the pizza. This went on for weeks. The account was clearly from somebody who was deeply affiliated with the business - I'd assume an owner as the my went to all the trouble to insult me.   
The person even went to the effort of photoshopping reviews from me that were completely falsified. I attempted to post the conversation however it was taken down by yelp due to the profanity. The account had only positive reviews for FBI pizza and negative reviews for competing pizza places in the neighborhood. 

After blocking 3 accounts the person decided to give up, the overall experience left a worse taste in my mouth than the pizza itself. Perhaps their other location is good, but I would NEVER even consider trying it after this horrible experience. 

I can only assume a person who was so passionate about harassing someone on yelp had to be affiliated with the business itself. So even worse experience besides my pizza. Wish I could say maybe it was a one time thing, but I will never eat here again."}
{"text":"It's impossible to understand how this place could have been recommended. What's worse was my assumption at seeing the menu prices - very high - that this would ensure good food. I ordered a plain cheese pizza - took very long to arrive and the cheese was off the pizza, but only for half the pie, what there was was barely edible..! My son and I had a good laugh, but went to bed hungry. Never again FBI."}
{"text":"You MUST try the Great Canadian in Italy Pizza. Incredible!

This is what real Italian pizza is. It's funny that most of the people who dismiss FBI as great pizza do so because of the prices... this isn't a Fast Food Chain. If you want cardboard and ketchup sauce, go the \"popular\" pizza spots. In life you get what you pay for, and I'd rather spend a few more dollars on quality stuff than scrounge my pennies and have massive heartburn later."}
{"text":"Ordered for delivery took about an hour which they said i am probably at the border for delivery
Ordered pepperoni mushroom extra cheese Mon. Special so great value
Next time no extra cheese a
 But pizza was very good
I'll definitely order again
Driver friendly and person who took order also.
Noticed after they have on line"}
{"text":"Their pizza is so good!

I love pizza and I can eat it anytime, any place and no matter what. I can say I will eat it with almost any toppings. And I truly appreciate a GREAT pie. This place is amazing!

I would upload a pic of my pizza but I ate it so fast I completely forgot to snap a pic. Next time i guess. lol

I can't say anything about their other menu items but their pizza's are worth 5 stars."}
{"text":"We stopped ordering from FBI as we were fed with the long delivery times. They also slightly messed up on two of our orders and in one case, forgot to include a side dish. The pizza is good but not worth the wait."}
{"text":"The absolute best chicken wings I have ever had in my life.
They are big, juicy and made from free range  chicken! Get the garlic Parmesan dipping sauce because it tastes like heaven. Worth the extra couple of bucks, as NO OTHER chicken wing competes!"}
{"text":"Some of the best pizza and wings. Love the crust and breaded wings. Their in-house dips are great! I usually take the garlic Parmesan and buffalo dip. Goes with the pizza and wings. I make it a point to go here once a week. I usually pick my own toppings. They have red chillies that I find hard to come by at other pizzerias. Good sized portions. Meal for two can cost anywhere between $40-$50. A must try!"}
{"text":"FBI has awesome pizza...  most of the ingredients are imported from Italy including the tomatoes and flour... FBI pizza stands for full-blooded Italian and it certainly lives up to its name... Delish!"}
{"text":"Salty pizza!! Omg I'm so disappointed. Im italian, and this..full blooded italian ..my ass! Don't do it. Order pizza pizza instead. I can't deal with eating a pizza that tastes like I'm eating a brick of salt."}
{"text":"not. worth. it.

the points:

*ridiculously overpriced

*ridiculous delivery times--1.5-2 hours!

*unacceptable temperature--food arrives cold! what's the point of delivery if you have to heat it up when it arrives?!?

*made mistake on our 1st order by bringing the wrong pizza. when phoned back, guy on phone was nice & said he'd put a credit for a replacement of same pizza for our next order. 

*when taking advantage of aforementioned replacement, they brought the wrong pizza again.

*decent calzone.

*no specials or combos

*mediocre pizza

*delivery fee.  and the fee doesn't even go to the driver.

bottom line: waste money someplace else."}
{"text":"Perfect thin crust pizza. Crunchy and soft at the same time. Not over-filling. I ate 4 slices in 10mins!"}
{"text":"Twice we've ordered from this place and twice the food showed up ice cold. Correct me if I'm wrong, but pizza should be hot or at least warm. Unless you wake up after a hangover and want cold dirty bootleg FBI pizza!?!? Don't eat or order from this place!!"}
{"text":"One of my fav pizza's in the city. I had a Big pizza and 2 topping. So tasty and filling. The price isn't bad if you don't get too many toppings. 

The one issue I had with this place is that is costs $2 for a tiny dipping sauce."}
{"text":"First trying the famous FBI pizza and they did not disappoint.  Even the delivery guy was cool so good on you guys!

Pizza was absolutely yummers"}
{"text":"I really wanted to like this place since.

The first time I ordered an extra large pizza with basil olives and pepperoni . It wasn't the best but the best I could find in this etobicoke area. Good enough that I said ok this is now the new pizza place to order from. .

This second time we ordered an extra large pizza that was recommended from fBI themselves . It had Italian sausage, Gorgonzola, olives, and red onion .

It was deathly salty . No it's not the ingredients themselves . It was the sauce because I took off all the toppings after the first few bites. It he sauce was so nasty and un edible. 

I called them to tell them... All she said was \"we're so sorry . \"

Are you serious ? That's pathetic.   $40 bux for a pizza that taste like shit and was clearly made wrong. Likely by accident. We paid for this accident of theirs and all we get is a sorry ."}
{"text":"After reading all of these amazing reviews I felt compelled to try this place out. I live close by so I ordered for pick up. Walked in, everyone was real nice, they claimed they had \"the best pizza in the city\" so I was excited to get home.

Man was I disappointed. The pizza wasn't cut at all, the middle was cold, there was way too much cheese, it was greasy as hell and even after cutting it myself, every topping would slide off of very slice I tried to pick up.

I'm not a picky guy so I attempted to eat a slice with a fork and a knife and to be honest, it didn't taste all that great. At that point I had paid $25 for a meal I wasn't at all happy with. So I called and they delivered another pizza free of charge.

This time it was cooked and cut much better, but it still didn't taste all that good. I'm not a complainer but not only was FBI pizza no where near the best pizza in the city, it was one of the worst pizza's I've ever had.

Better? Marconi's in Sauga is by far the best in the GTA and then Nino Daversa or even il Gato Nero are both great as well. All are authentic Italian and never disappoint."}
{"text":"this is very good pizza...  you can make a case that alongside IL PAESANO and CALIBREZE it's the best in etobicoke.
downside is PRICE.  it's too expensive; i switched to the other places for price; too costly for 4 people.  plus NO slices in store."}
{"text":"Having bad experience with delivery in the path I should have known better.
I SPECIFICALLY asked what the delivery time was and was told an hour and 15 minutes. Two hours later I am told another 30 minutes. What a joke of a delivery operation.DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME."}
{"text":"Breaded chicken wings were big and juice! The breading was crunchy which I love.

BUT...

The breading was overfried. I think the recipe needs to change in order to make it a bit less salty and more flavourful. They need to look at how stores like Popeyes successfully bread their chicken. 

Well worth the money."}
{"text":"The pizza is pretty good. I thought it's a bit over priced, the dough/crust could be better."}
{"text":"Ordered the \"biggest pizza\" recently for the first time, which is true to it's name. It's simply solid take-out gourmet pizza. Everything is proportioned. Had two slices and I was down for the count, but was glad to have leftovers."}
{"text":"Hot damnnnn, that is good pizza. Ordered for delivery from FBI last night and loved it!!! Everything about the pizza was top notch - super fresh, high-quality ingredients, and awesome crust. Since it was my first order, kept it simple with a \"bigger\" pepperoni pizza on white, thin crust. It was delectable. 

Delivery (to Roncesvalles) did take awhile, about an hour (ordered 9ish on a Friday night). The pizza didn't arrive super hot, but 2 minutes in the toaster oven and it was perfection. 

I regularly order from Vesuvio, and this is far tastier. Also ordered a yummy Nutella mousse for dessert - the fact that this can be at my door in an hour is dangerous!!! :) Looking forward to ordering again!!"}
{"text":"Just moved to the area but this is quickly becoming one of my go to spots. PizZa is amazing and the service is one of the best you can get, you hand to try the margarita with chicken... Outstanding!"}
{"text":"I have to say this pizza is awesome. You can really taste the quality ingredients. With Vaughan having so many pizzas place around I feel FBI had an edge because of the quality. There chef creations are well thought own and tasty."}
{"text":"This place has gotten terribly over priced and has gone totally down hill since they painted the front of it- we paid $75 after tax delivery and tip for 2 large 4 topping pizzas- the crust was like cardboard and not nearly as authentic as it used to be- try the napoli pizzeria on lakeshore instead - much better quality and value"}
{"text":"Ich! Salty ++, flabby soggy crust.
Half cooked bacon.Cheese 1/2 instead of Double,  as ordered.Insipid flavour. THIS full blooded Italian= insult to Italy!"}
{"text":"Went here for the first time tonight, and skipped delivery since I'd read the prior reviews. First off, my pizza was ready when I arrived, but unfortunately there was a mix-up with the toppings. When I pointed this out, the staff member was really friendly about it and remade it on the spot.
So while the experience wasn't 100% perfect, the pizza was DELICIOUS. Seriously, the \"margherita extra\" is to die for. We live pretty close to \"850 degrees\" which also makes excellent pizza, but I think this will be my new regular spot. Huge pizzas, really, truly excellent toppings (so flavourful) and while it's not budget pizza, the taste can't be beat."}
{"text":"I've been meaning to write an update for quite some time now because my husband and I order from FBI almost every Friday night.

First, the reviewers that are knocking the flavour with only one or two stars maybe prefer the large chain store pizzas.  Second, regarding delivery: I've had very large orders delivered to my office on two separate occasions and the pizzas arrived right on time, piping hot, friendly service and more than enough disposables.

The first large order I placed to our office was for the Take Our Kids to Work event.  Let me tell you, I came off as a star because, almost everyone at the event, said it was the best pizza they ever ate.  One of my colleagues described it as \"real Authentic New York style\".  The second event at my office was for a group of 30 and again, timely, fresh and hot delivery.  I didn't have one complaint - some people (guys and girls) were gorging themselves on four to five slices.  I keep getting requests to order from FBI again.

My best friend hates pizza - I know, who hates pizza ... anyway, we had her and two other friends over so I ordered a Calabrese and a Rocco and now she's hooked. She and my other guests said it was the best pizza they ever ate.  Every time she comes down to my place, she's always begging us to order from FBI.  Without question, it's the best pizza in south Etobicoke."}
{"text":"Ordered a margherita pizza.  They baked the fresh basil along with the pizza. 

Wrong!  Which part of Italy are these guys from?

Ordered for pick up.  Was told to come in 30 mins.  Pizza was cold.   How?
 
Second strike.  

I'm not sure these guys are worth a third strike."}
{"text":"Since my last review I have given them another chance and have to say this is now my go-to pizza place. Their $10 walk-in special is my go-to since I just live a block away. For $10 you will not find a better pepperoni pizza anywhere in the city. Delicious cheese, a nice light crust and tasty pepperoni always cooked to perfection. I am so happy this place is in Mimico and definitely say it is worth the visit!"}
{"text":"After hearing a lot about this place from a friend, I decided to make a trip to try it out. This place is apparently known for their heavy basis on being able to customize your own pizza. While that was an option I decided to try out one of their \"pre-selected\" pizzas. The pizza I had featured a medley of veggies and chicken. While it was good, I wouldn't necessarily say it was worth the price. The pizza tasted quite pedestrian and was to me almost along the lines of Pizza Pizza or Pizza Nova. 

Service wasn't that stellar initially, but as our server \"warmed up to us\" the service became marginally better. But I suppose you come to this place for the pizza and not the service so this shouldn't really matter. 

If you are looking for a new pizza joint, perhaps give this place a shot, you might like it more than I did."}
{"text":"Good stuff..  Tasty lots of options and premium toppings but even the basic pepperoni was great!  They forgot our dipping sauces but not a huge deal still a good first experience there..  Only 15-20 minute wait for walk in order"}
{"text":"The pizza here is good but service is terrible. The delivery estimate online was 1.5 hours, which is already very long. Instead it took 3 hours to reach us and we live down the road from the Toronto location.  We had to phone multiple times to follow up, and half the time the phone system wasn't working. 

We also ordered chicken wings. I'll  post pictures of what the product looks like on the website (screen shot) versus what was delivered. It smelled old and was inedible."}
{"text":"Living in Toronto's Little Italy, I'm never a stone's throw away from many a fantastic pizza joint. Names like Libretto, Bitondo and Terroni immediately come to mind.

But on a frigid winter Saturday evening, my mates and I decided to roll the dice (it was board game night, so pun is intended) on some delivery pies. Enter FBI Pizza: The city's newest take-out and delivery spot situated out in south Etobicoke with major buzz about it's no-nonsense quality ingredients and gourmet toppings.

We ordered two of the standard thin crust \"Big\" pies with mushrooms and caramelized onions on one and hot soppressata salami on the other. Delivery was quick, probably about 30 mins from my call to my friend's apartment at King & Bathurst. 

Upon consumption we were thrown for quite a loop...because these pies were among the best (deilvery) thin crust pizzas any of us had tasted in the city. The caramelized onion & mushroom pie in particular was heavenly, with creamy fior-de-latte mozzarella and tangy but not bitter tomato sauce blending beautifilly with sweet, thinly sliced onions & earthy mushrooms. The thickness of the crust as well amazed; not too thin, but substantial enough to satiate us. Almost like an upgraded version of a Mamma's Pizza pie.

Do yourself a favor and call up the FBI - Full Blooded Italians - if you're looking for a decent delivery option at a reasonable price (two of their regular pizzas with aforementioned toppings for $35 including tip). The name might be gimmicky, but the pizza is sublime."}
{"text":"I was a frequent visitor to the woodbridge location and after them closing that one down, I had a hankering for some FBI so I made the drive to etobicoke. I won't be back again. 
The IFC hoagie, which I used to love is a disappointment now - it used to be a huge sandwich. I could barely finish half (and if I did finish half, I would have no room for pizza). Well it's been shrunk (I finished half in about 5 bites), the bread is not the same - the new bread falls apart and can't handle the toppings. It was also lacking chicken - a lot of breading and coating fell out of my sandwich but there wasn't much chicken and it didn't seem to have all the toppings it used to 
Onto to the pizza. This used to be my favorite pizza I loved the dough, the sauce, the cheesiness and I loved that it could be picked up like a real slice. 
Well changes have been made here too - the dough doesn't have the taste it used to, eating the crust was not good (pizza nova dough is tastier), the sauce was also flat and not much on the pizza (didn't have much taste at all). The amount of toppings was good but it just lost everything that made it good. 
Before, if I ordered a hoagie and a large pizza between 2 people, we'd walk out with 90% of the pizza... Now, we left still feeling unsatisfied 
Seems like they r focusing too much on being a bar and less about being a restaurant"}
{"text":"Review based on pizza ** 

FBI has been on the list for quite some time. Initially wanted to try out the Chicken Hoagie sandwich, based on gram pictures. Once we got to the place gave the pizza a shot, place is called FBI pizza might as well. Nice location, great for groups, looks like a good place to catch a game. 

Rich list of ingredients that you dont normally find at other locations. They had some pre made suggestions but mostly vegetarian and pork combinations. Was advised on the menu that the sizing is one step larger than normal. End of the day decided to go with a large chicken, with half hot peppers and caramelized onions / half portobello mushrooms and sundried tomatoes. 

To begin with the large size looked like any regular large pizza, not sure what the upsizing was about. The crust and sauce was, meh. The toppings and cheese is where the money's at. Was expecting typical hot peppers, but these things were actually spicy. The portobello mushrooms and sundried tomatoes was a good mix. Good amount of great toppings. 

That said, I just dont see it. For the commute ( if your going out of your way ), pizza, and more importantly the price its really hard to justify. My colleague and I agreed that Pizza Nova would have been an equal/better alternative at a much lower price. To be fair I want to try out their other options, especially that hoagie. In conclusion I would not recommend or go again solely for the pizza.

1.5/2"}
{"text":"I love the dough at FBI it makes for a nice crunchy crust. The ingredients are always fresh and the pizza itself is very tasty."}
{"text":"I live in Maple in the Belleria Towers and FBI Pizza Woodbridge is my go to pizza place. I always order a really big white with basil, cherry tomatoes, and bocconcini the ultimate combination.  Also you must order their asiago and hot pepperoncini sauce since it goes perfect with each slice.  This place serves quality fresh ingredients and it may cost a bit more but it is worth it.  Btw my pizzas have always arrived nice and hot. -Richard"}
{"text":"Pretty good pizza.  Just a little slow.  Like the quality of the ingredients.  Would go back for sure."}
{"text":"Absolutely loved the pizza with the pancetta, onions, goat cheese and Asiago. We also ordered the JUMBO chicken wings, and maybe a little too many. We weren't expecting them to be as big as drumsticks. The wings were good but I don't think I will be getting them again. They put fennel in their bread crumbs and that just made me feel like I was eating taralli. Will definitely be going back for the pizza."}
{"text":"Very tasty pizza!
Eaten here a few times, eating in on all occasions. It is pretty small for eating in, only a few tables. Very busy take out business though and their delivery range is huge.
Their thin crust is sooooo good, and you can't go wrong with DOP prosciutto on your pizza!
Give them a try!"}
{"text":"My wife insisted me to go there. It was about year ago, I really never had time to write review. I don't really remember what pizza I had but it was really good. In fact, I give it a try once again in this week."}
{"text":"Best pizza in town!!!! The customer service is great! The girls are super friendly and helpful! I love this place!"}
{"text":"This place is solid.   So you gotta wait a bit sometimes?    This shit is fantastic it takes time.  And sometimes they really really busy cause alot of people like me are big big big fans.   Hoagies is fire"}
{"text":"Awesome experience.  I'm a pizza junkie, born and raised in Montreal where the pizza is fantastic with many great options.   Ordered from FBI for the first time and it was fantastic.   Ordered the Diavola.   Amazing. Fresh toppings with not a hint of mass produced chemical processed items.   Great tasting sauce, high quality cheese, sopressata with a nice amount of spice..... The crust was perfect.   

I read some negative reviews but ignore them.  Service was quick as sell, maybe since it was later in the evening, but we ended up ordering a second one an hour later !

Don't listed to the hatters that did not enjoy their experience.  If you like authentic and \"full blooded Italian\" pizza, you will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"Mm mm mm mmm liiiizza lllLiiza you tearing me up Leeezaaa oooooooooooo pretty good food tho."}
{"text":"Not the the cheapest pizza around but IMO worth the price!! There wings are also pretty good!"}
{"text":"Inconsistent. When it is good, it is REALLY good. Other times just passable. Ingredients are quality and the real deal, but the crust can be beautiful or cardboard depending on the day. And, alas, same can be said of the service. Sometimes I order a pizza on a Friday night and it is here in 40 minutes, piping hot. Sometimes stone cold. Today (Wednesday) I ordered a pizza and called an hour and a half later when still no pie was at my door. Woman on the phone was apologetic, said she'd \"put it in the oven right now\". No offer of free stuff, no \"this order is on us\". Sigh. I wish Via Mercanti delivered. Not sure I'll be ordering again from here soon, and I have been a regular."}
{"text":"Arrest me and lock me up because I can come here everyday if I could afford it as my daily meal. This place is delicious! Best pizza joint in the area! I went here with two others and we ordered French fries (not skinny fries and it's not the super thick ones but are equivalent to the thickness of Costco fries which is BOMB), 12pc breaded chicken wings and two medium pizzas. We got the Calabrese and Capricciosa pizzas. Not one thing I can complain about. Wings are BOMB, pizzas are BOMB, French fries are BOMB! Definitely would come back here !"}
{"text":"Went here last night and it was Pretty hot inside to we all decided to wait outside until our pizzas were ready. The owner told us to come inside and told us the air conditioning was broken and gave us 2 pounds of wings while we waited for the pizza.  Easily the best wings I've ever had. The wings were smoking hot that I had to wait 5 minutes before eating them. The pizza here is always good and incomparable to any place in Toronto. Excellent customer service and even greater food. That's the key to win me as a customer. Definitely going back here again!"}
{"text":"Ok the pizza is tasty and the wings are crazy large but wowsers this place can hut your wallet and quickly!  We probably got over excited ordering but if thus is one of your splurges for the week its well worth it."}
{"text":"We have eaten here twice in the last month. Both experiences have been great. The service was great. I loved the look and feel of the menus. The food was great. The pizza was well prepared. All the ingredients were fresh. The crust was the proper thickness. I asked for \"well done\" and it was cooked properly. We finished our mean with a dessert pizza that was delicious. 
The establishment was clean and tastefully decorated. Prices are reasonable for the quality of food. I will definitely be back."}
{"text":"2 Yums WAY UP!  I went to the Lakeshore location too and OMG OMG.

The dough was cooked perfectly and the sauce was incredible. Not overpowering. 

Yum. Yum. Yum"}
{"text":"Ok I ordered a medium pepperoni pizza with extra pepperoni and a coke (you can check the photo I posted) it got delivered pretty quick, I wasn't far away. I paid a total of $30 that included a 3$ tip. The pizza was ok tasting but it didn't look like they added extra pepperoni slices? Anyways for 30$ you be the judge. For me it's actually insulting to charge that much. I'm never going there again that's for sure"}
{"text":"First of all, FBI makes AMAZING pizza.  Thin crust, perfect toppings (no matter what it is, it's good!) and the dipping sauces are from another planet.  However, I have to say, the delivery is super frustrating.  I have never heard of something so ludicrous as a 2 hour wait time!!  My husband ordered a pizza, and was told that it would take 1h30 - came at 2h10, when we were starving and ready to cancel the order.  I would recommend that the company limit the delivery radius or just stop offering delivery altogether (or sign up to one of those Just Eat or Uber Eats platforms) to avoid disappointing customers.  One more thing; pizza is SUPER expensive... however, somehow after you bite into a slice you seem to forget all of those frustrations...."}
{"text":"If you are hungry, DON'T expect that this place will deliver on time, move on and get some other means of feeding yourself! 

It's super funny when they call themselves \"Toronto\" location when they literally, utterly failed to deliver the pizza when they had 90min!! An hour and half!! 

I called and without any remorse or any apologies, they sounded like it's not a big deal! Trust me, when any living soul is hungry, that kind of attitude will piss you off. It was already pass 90minutes! Not just an hour, more than one hour and 30min!! 

Yet, there they are saying driver will be there in next 30 min! Seriously, Would you wait for a pizza for 2hours?!?!? When did Pizza got so fussy? Lol

My one word for this? Ridiculous. Plain simple ridiculous pizza delivery business. If you are gonna do this, just don't offer \"delivery\"- when it's real clear fact that you can't do this right. 

Maybe they are right- I should have drive all the way to mimico to get their pizza! Lol"}
{"text":"The restaurant is a little small, but their menu isn't! Soo many options. I had the margherita pizza with their homemade garlic dipping sauce, which is UNREAL. I sat at the bar and interacted with the super cool staff."}
{"text":"Never again. One of the worst pizzas I've ever had. Ridiculously over-priced, with so little toppings, and covered with so much oil it took a number of napkins to sop it all up. Definitely will not be calling them again."}
{"text":"Great food, clean space. Their patio is dog friendly which was awesome when we were visiting friends with Simba and needed to grab a bite to eat. The thin crust pesto base is the one i would definitely recommend. A bit on the pricey side compared to other places however. They need to have other promotions rather than a free pitcher of beer after you spend x amount, $$ not everyone drinks."}
{"text":"been waiting to try this place for a bit, I went and I feel MEH about it. 
the food is ok, a bit overpriced for me for the quality and flavors that I experienced make me reluctant to come back in the future. the service is great and the restaurant is spotless, just to me feels overwhelming to say the least. the mention of the double 0 flour is nice, and the statement about the olive oil also is nice, and lastly, the blurb about the tomatoes is also nice. I guess the biggest confusion about it was that it was abbreviated, which lead me to going oh...? oh! got it! the porchetta sandwich was great with a great sauce. the pizza left something more to be desired, not sure how they can say the pizza sizing is one sizing larger then normal? 
street parking is possible if you can find it, and transit options is the 501 streetcar line."}
{"text":"Pizza is good but I order from there 80% less because they tell you 1.5 hours and it takes 2.5. Tonight they said two hours and it's been almost three hours and it's not here yet. For as popular as you are, can you not just hire like double the drivers on weekends? Back to Gigi or Albany. Sad times FBI from an ex loyal customer. Also last two times it arrived super late and super cold."}
{"text":"A rather amazing pizza I have just consumed... I think i just found my favorite new york style pizza joint.. That was rather quick.. Thought would be hunting the city inside out to find something to compromise with.. The base, the crust, the cheesey goodness and the humongous size have left me speechless... Bro n I raved about it in every bite... Best dinner since I've been back home. TRUE STORY!"}
{"text":"The best takeout pizza I've had and I've tried all the popular choices in Etobicoke. Delicious crust and sauce and great choice of gourmet toppings. I reheated after bringing it home and the crust had the perfect amount of chewiness and crunch. I would order from here again."}
