{"text":"I've been going to Bolsa for a few years now and I just realized I've never written a review for it.  I love Bolsa. I usually get beef pho with a side of spring rolls.  Yum!  But recently, I've branched out and tried other things on the menu. My favourite so far has to be Happy's Coconut Rice - phenomenal.  And the homemade hoisin sauce is outstanding - I don't like sweet very much and the sauce has just enough sweet without going overboard.  I introduced some friends to Bolsa and now it seems Bolsa gets picked whenever someone celebrates a birthday.  Highly recommend Bolsa!"}
{"text":"Probably the fastest, friendliest service of great Vietnamese food in the crowded Calgary Viet food scene.  Possibly something better in the NE but south of downtown Bolsa can't be beat."}
{"text":"Their beef satay soup is awesome, one of the best Vietnamese if not the best in the city. I always order a large spicy lol. \"Mama\" pours her heart into making the perfect broth from the night before (she told me). She's friendly and positive. Their menu is more pricey than other restaurants in the NE area, but I keep going back to Bolsa because of their customer service."}
{"text":"This is an excellent restaurant with great service and run by the owners who are so genuine. Lots of room to park. All three dishes we ordered were delicious. Would definitely go back!"}
{"text":"I can't say enough good things about Bolsa!!  We recently started going there when we were still on the hunt for our \"go to\" Vietnamese restaurant.  Our search stopped here.  Food is amazing and \"Mama\" and the staff treat you like family.  We always walk out of here with a smile :)"}
{"text":"It may look like a hole in the wall but the food is absolutely delicious. Went right before closing and still had amazing service and great food. The cook came out to greet us and was very friendly and entertaining to talk to.

The Phó Bà was the best Phó I have ever had."}
{"text":"One of the best Vietnamese restaurants in Calgary. The food is great and the people that run it are incredibly friendly. I have had a number of dishes there and all have been great. 
Try the hot pots you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"I was absolutely blown away by the waaaaay above average service and food! This is definitely my favourite Vietnamese restaurant! The owner is extremely friendly and attentive. She goes above and beyond to ensure that her guests are happy and comfortable. The food...well my boyfriend is Vietnamese and he said it is even better than his mom's cooking :O better hope his mom doesn't find out about that haha 
I have yet to find better and I must say that I will definitely be returning in the near future!
Way to go staff and owners of Bolsa! You definitely know what you're doing and have raised the bar for Vietnamese food in Calgary!"}
{"text":"Best pho in Calgary. \"Mamma\"makes you feel like part of the family and she only feeds her family with quality and love!"}
{"text":"WOW. Our family has been to almost every Phõ place in the city, this one hands down is a keeper.  This was our first time here and we were very impressed. 

Our kids shared a bowl of Rare beef and meatball Phõ. And my husband and I each had the Chicken Phõ.   The kids quickly slurped up their soup and tea so you know it's good.   The broth is what makes or breaks the Phõ in my opinion.  The broth tasted home made and had plenty of flavour. The toasted onions added a delicious smokey flavour and the fresh cilantro was a nice change.  

The atmosphere is nice and relaxed, not trendy or fancy. Lots of goldfish tanks around to keep the kids occupied during the short wait for our meal and desert.   

BUT the cherry on top of our night was the customer service.  This wonderful lady -who I believe is the owner.  Took the time to go around to each table and talk for a bit.  Making sure everyone was enjoying her soup and was having s good time.  She was a joy and we are definitely making this our regular place to Phõ.  HIGHLY RECOMMENDED."}
{"text":"We used to live on the south side and started going to this restaurant and loved it from day 1! The pho is delicious and the owners make you feel at home! We have since moved downtown but still drive to Bolsa whenever we want pho. We can go in and the owners know exactly what we want and we don't even have to look at the menus. They saw me picking out the onions one day and remembered from that day on that I don't like onions. Mama is the kindest person you could ever meet and her and her husband really show everyone that they care for and appreciate every one of their customers. You'd have to look for a long time to find customer service as good as this place."}
{"text":"My personal favourite Vietnamese Restaurant, Ever!  The owners are the sweetest friendliest people!  The service is fast - and the food is unbelievably delicious!  This is a top notch restaurant; I go there twice a month, and the food, friendliness, and delish food never varies.  I will be a regular here, forever."}
{"text":"Bolsa is my favourite Vietnamese restaurant in Calgary, and Ive been to a ton of them.
The family that owns the tiny restaurant are always friendly and welcoming.
They know all their regulars orders,and make sure to always checking to see if your food came the way you wanted it. 
They do not skimp on the portion sizes, and have the BEST Won Ton Soup Ive had.
A great little place for a casual meal or take out."}
{"text":"One of the best Vietnamese restaurants in the city, and you don't have to go to the NE or forest lawn lol.
Great location, great food, great staff/owners."}
{"text":"I went to Bolsa at about 330, and I was the only customer sitting down inside. 
I ordered Vietnamese spring rolls to start which came out swiftly, hot and delicious. 
I also ordered a chicken sate Phö with veggies and NO CILANTRO!!!
.. I hate to be a cilantro party pooper, but you either hate it or love it. 

Well, soup came out with tons of cilantro.... She dropped it quickly and left. Guessing she noticed the mistake, and didn't want to hear the complaints. I waited about 10 mins, and walked up to the counter to wait for someone to come out from the kitchen... No one came. I needed water and napkins!

I sat back down and began picking my cilantro out and eating my soup. Well, there was so much of it, and I had no available drink either! 

When I was finished barely eating my soup, and I just walked to the counter and the gentleman apologized for my cilantro, and when I mentioned it to him, he just said \"next time, next time.\" He was on the phone shouting at someone in Vietnamese, and just typed a number into his calculator and showed me 21.99! For a small soup and spring rolls? 

Usually, I have good service here, the owner is bubbly and facetious. 

I won't return."}
{"text":"Great owners.  They're super friendly and make a point of remembering you.  And the food is great too!  From delicious satay soup to chicken curry to beef stew, it's definitely made with love and full of flavour!"}
{"text":"Great food great service!  This place has owners who treat you like family and care about the food and service.  Mom and pop businesses are being replaced by franchises.  This restaurant shows you why we need to support the locally owned restaurants and keep them in business with our patronage."}
{"text":"Ordered the #10 which at the moment can't remember exactly what it's title was but it was a Pho and spring rolls.  Both were excellent.  Staff was very helpful with reserving us a table, taking our order and attending to our needs even though there was a slight difficulty understanding each other.  Would recommend to anyone and everyone.  As others have said, this is a family oriented restaurant with a very family ran mom and pop feel.  My daughter loved looking at the fish tanks throughout the restaurant and her child size Wonton soup.  After supper the staff on two separate occasions returned to our table to give our daughter lollipops and to tell us how beautiful she is.  I will make this a regular stop when in Calgary and will be a big booster of this place."}
{"text":"Fantastic soup and vermicelli with NO MSG!

Very friendly service, obviously family run. (The mom told my wife she needed to eat more :). 

I had the lemon grass chicken on vermicelli (spicy version) and my wife the chicken soup with extra vegetables.

The food came quickly and everything was nicely presented. The soup had the usual bean sprouts and lime on the side.

Although there was a bit of fat on the chicken, everything in the soup was fresh and delicious.

My vermicelli had a good amount of spice and again, was also delicious. We'll definitely be coming back here!"}
{"text":"Great little Vietnamese restaurant in the south end of Calgary.  I would definitely return!"}
{"text":"I had a chance to check out what Yelp reviewers were saying was the best bowl of pho in town. I tried the special (#8 pho dac biet) with the owner's recommendation to have it prepared extra spicy. I have to admit it is probably the best bowl of rice beef noodle soup I've ever had. The broth is top notch and the balance of meats was perfect.  No need to drown it in Sriracha and Hoisin. The portion was good and the price was a little higher than what I would pay in Chinatown.

The atmosphere was really good and I enjoyed the booth-only seating style with high backs and a centre wall divider which gave you plenty of dining privacy. They also played western music instead of the traditional tunes some places shoot for, which I also liked.

The place comes across as clean, reasonably contemporary, but still has that down to Earth 'dive' feeling that I've come to associate with quality Viet food. Service was really quick. Definitely worth a shot."}
{"text":"I went to this restaurant because of the high rankings and positive reviews. Maybe I have too high expectations. The food was ok, but I couldn't stand the smell of the place, gross... I am a bit concerned about the sanitary issues they have. Luckily I didn't get food poison (which I am already thinking while eating). Barely understand the language they speak, and my waitress was not that nice..."}
{"text":"Huge servings and the best food. Been going here for years and I can say that this is one of the hidden gems in Calgary! The owners are so nice too"}
{"text":"Just OK. Ordered the rare beef satay (#10) at lunch and arrived at my table with 2 minutes. I like fast but that is way too fast, kind of worries me.

Service was good, I think I met Mama. Nice enough but I felt a little too well cared for. I like to get in, eat, and leave. I just felt she was constantly at my table telling me how to eat (drink more water it's spicy!). Reminded me well..of a Mom, but I don't need or want that.

Food was just ok. Honestly there are better places like Pho Pasteur Saigon. I got the large but it was mostly broth, not much meat or noodles. Spice and broth was good, but I left hungry.

May try it one more time. This end of town the choices are slim for this type of food. If your nearby and can't find anywhere else then check it out."}
{"text":"Bolsa has absolutely amazing pho! The proprietor is a sweet little Vietnamese lady who refers to herself as \"Mama.\" Mama greets you with a huge smile and tons of energy. This was my first pho experience so Mama assured me that she would \"take care of me,\" and she definitely made good on that promise. She recommended #10, which is a spicy sliced beef pho. It was OFF THE CHARTS delicious! Enough heat to make my nose run and give my lips that subtle burn when I was done eating, but not that scorching heat the sends you diving for your beverage or doing your best to ease your flaming tongue. The broth has an amazing flavor that is accentuated with bursts of cilantro. The noodles were perfectly cook and the beef was very tender. My only complaint is that I live in the U.S., and can't return regularly for Mama's wonderful personality and delicious pho!"}
{"text":"Just recently moved into the area and have eaten in once and picked up take out once.   We ate in later in the evening and received a lot of attention from Mama.  Take out was on the wknd and it was packed with ppl waiting for their orders as well...that should tell you how good it is.Both times were very delicious."}
{"text":"Going to Bolsa is not just going out for a meal, it's an experience! The food is the best Vietnamese you will find in Calgary, maybe Alberta. The owners are like your favourite Aunt and Uncle that you love to visit and they welcome you with big smiles. I never have to order, they know what I like and how I like it. I highly recommend you treat yourself. #14 Satay beef Pho is to die for!"}
{"text":"Cute Family Owned Restaurant.

A date took me there the other night. Great food quite atmosphere, very friendly and warm staff. Will go again and recommend others to go as well.
it. 

Ingredient Quaility: Good"}
{"text":"The food is great! Owners and workers are wonderfully friendly people. Very kind and generous. Polite and respectful. As well, the food tastes great and quick! Been here many times."}
{"text":"I ordered the vegetarian egg noodle soup and it was just not good. Few slices of carrots, mini tofu, green onions. That was it. I have never seen a pho soup with cauliflower. It wasn't authentic Vietnamese. I've had a lot of veggie pho soup in the past that were way better and authentic than this place. I didn't like the salad roll either, just mediocre. The peanut sauce was good though. I eat with my eyes so the presentation is very important to me but the way they plate their food was unappetizing. The soup was not hot at all. It seemed like it has been prepared way earlier than the rest of the order. Some in the group seemed to like their food that's why I'm giving this place 3 stars. Sorry."}
{"text":"Ordered online from skipthedish.  When we went in to pick up we got in trouble because we shouldn't have used skipthedish to order with them.  Apparently skipthedish takes a 20% cut.  Personally if this is what happens then maybe the restaurant should not use these services?   We ordered a soup (which was delicious!) and two different rice vermicelli bowls.  They on the other hand were quite dry.   Lady but not least other then getting a lecture on why to call mama and not order online, everyone was very friendly!"}
{"text":"We came to Calgary to our favorite Ginger Beef joint. Unfortunately it was closed for renos. We found this place via Yelp. It is our new favorite for Vietnamese. It was all that the other reviewers said it was. Just try it. You won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"A friend from work suggested this restaurant as his favourite Pho restaurant in Calgary. I found that the customer service is fast and excellent with owners engaging with everyone of their customers during busy lunch time. The food was authentic Vietnamese, well prepared and very flavour full. I highly recommend this place."}
{"text":"Great food and great service!! 
I'm so happy I found a Vietnamese restaurant in walking distance from my home. 

I got the pho with tendon, tripe, etc (yum), my sister got the pho with just brisket and my other sister got spring rolls on rice. We were all really happy with our meals. The pho was flavourful and so filling. I don't really have any complaints except that I wished there was more tendon in my pho.  

They have these awesome fish tanks with some pretty crazy fish, my 4 month daughter mesmerized. It's definitely a family friendly restaurant. 
It wasn't crazy busy but there was still a constant stream of customers. 

The owner, I believe she's the owner, was so great!! She talked with us a bit and fawned over my little one :)  she was really nice. 

I'm looking forward to going back. There's a ton on the menu I want to try. Yuuuuumy!"}
{"text":"Best Vietnamese in Calgary, the owner \"mama\" never forgets a face and will always welcome you back with the biggest smile, she is the cutest! Never ever been disappointed in the food ever even when I made special off the menu requests, she provided! Only negative I have to say is that it's a bit more expensive than a lot of the other Vietnamese places but well worth it."}
{"text":"A favourite for pho-and bun. Pho has great broth and always fresh. Nice folks. Price is a bit high, but I adjust my tip to match the prices of other similarly good Vietnamese restaurants."}
{"text":"I loved meeting \"mama\". She's such a friendly and attentive person! I mentioned that I'd like to try a phillipino beer to my friends, and mama appeared with one in seconds. I'm not sure she was in the room when I said it, so I am impressed but also scared. The service here was amazing, the food was great, the price was just right. Thanks for a great dinner!"}
{"text":"Fast friendly service. All the classics you expect and all done really well. Been a couple of times and food quality and portions have been spot on every time. Bowls are a good size and always end up extremely full having finished all the food in front of me. 

Mama will always come by and see how the meal was and then tell you how to order your dish the next time to get it perfect. She is adorable.

Good value for money and normally the restaurant is pretty full come lunch time. We try get in a little early before 12 to get seated straight away."}
{"text":"We went to Bolsa on a miserable cold Monday evening and it was warm, the owners were so welcoming, the food and drinks were served quickly, we asked for it spicy and they made it perfect. The place was half full on a -25degree Monday night. The food was bursting with flavour, I had the lemongrass chicken with more veg than noodles and the husband had the pork chops, veggies & rice. His came out sizzling and mine was awesome. He'd never been there before and having lived in the area for 14 years commented on how we've been missing out. The food is healthy and delicious! Would recommend to all my friends and we'll be back soon."}
{"text":"Great Vietnamese restaurant in the SW.  The food always comes out fresh and hot and tasty.  And the staff are all extremely friendly and helpful!  Definitely our go-to for when we are craving Vietnamese... or even just when we want a quick dinner to-go!"}
{"text":"My family and I have come to Bolsa for years and love it! Coming to Bolsa you will be greeted by Mama who, especially if you're a regular, will be very inviting and excited to see you! In fact all staff are very friendly. We absolutely love Bolsa's soups especially; they truly stand out as stellar when it comes to flavour and freshness."}
{"text":"I give it this rating because 3.5 isn't available. 
Went in and found out from Viet that Momma was cooking. Briefly talked about Vietnamese street food, and came to the inaccurate conclusion that here in Canada it's very hard to duplicate (check out Pure Vietnamese on 8th Ave downtown!). As well, Bolsa doesn't serve shaken (cubed) beef stew or spiced catfish. 
Read good things about Bolsa, but once the standard of excellence has been set in Asia closer to truly genuine street food, it's a stretch for anyone not at that standard to match it.
Their approximation of 'pho bun hoe' was only so-so. The flavours were missing because the spices that Momma used don't approximate what is available 'back home.' The mixture of meats - beef and two kinds of pork sausages - were okay, and the agreed-upon 'round' noodles were overcooked, and not at all close in quality or flavour to authentic Vietnam noodles. The broth underwhelming. Disappointed.
The Indo-Chinese music was excellent, and for sure added to the atmosphere there!
Yes, the service by Viet and Momma was exemplary, but the food just not there. We will try it again in the future, but it's certainly not worthy of anything over 3.5 so far."}
{"text":"I tried the satay beef noodle soup and Vietnamese spring roll.  The magic is in the broth.  Service was considerate and home like.  Price is on the high side compared to my personal favorite Tho Kim Vietnamese in the NW but it is still great overall.  Happy to return next time."}
{"text":"Happened to try out this Vietnamese place, when shopping in the area. Was not disappointed. We ordered the beef sate pho and were asked how spicy we wanted it. Never been asked this before and considering that I LOVE super spicy food, I went with super spicy. The pho came out and just smelling it, you could tell just how spicy this was. This was hands down my favorite pho from Calgary so far. There was a strong peanut flavour in the pho, which I have not tasted before. It was amazing! And it was super, super spicy! Some other places I have went to, have spicy menu items, but they are never as spicy as I desire. This definitely was! Finished the entire bowl! Also got the deep fried wontons and they were also really good!! Definitely recommend this place to other spicy pho lovers!"}
{"text":"You know you're in good hands when the person who greets you at the door takes a look at your sleeveless top and insists that you sit on the other side of the room because it will be warmer for you as the air-conditioning is very cold! Dan is the proprietess at Bolsa Restaurant, a  motherly figure who is obviously well-liked by her regulars. 
I am early so I sit at my table, play a game on my phone and watch as patron after patron is greeted by name or even with a hug by Dan. I peruse the menu and find that it is interesting that the pictures in the menu aren't of the dishes. At each corner of pages are pictures of beautiful women modelling the National costume of Vietnam or else pictures of the beautiful scenery of the country. (see photo) It is an extensive menu; each item given its Vietnamese name and then a listing in english of what the dish is made up of. 
I order an appetizer of Deep Fried Vietnamese Rolls, It is 5 for $5.95. When trying a restaurant, I always like to order at least one of the staples to test it out. My philosophy is: you can tell if the food is going to be good if they can do a standard dish of that cuisine well. The springs rolls arrive just as my guest seats himself. They are nice and hot, a bit over-fried but the filling is a good balance of meat, vegetables and vermicelli. The next test is the Noc cham. It is a sauce made from fish sauce, vinegar or lime juice, sugar and sometimes a dash of hot chilli paste. This is an everyday condiment, and determines how good the Bún or spring rolls are going to taste. The sauce is everything I can hope for. This is a great sign that the rest of the food will be good. 
Dan is obviously proud of her establishment and food and tells us that we must try her food and then go around to all the other restaurants and then make up our minds. She is sure that she has the best! We elect to have Bún which is a choice of meat or spring rolls or both served over rice vermicelli and shredded vegetables (usually bean sprouts, lettuce and carrots). I opt for the Bolsa Special which is Vietnamese sausage, Ground Shrimp and BBQ pork and Spring rolls. My companion has the Combo which has BBQ Shrimp, beef and chicken. There are 2 sizes at Bolsa. This is fairly unusual as most restaurants will only have the one size for Bún. The regular is $10.95 and the XL $12.95. The regular is a bit on the smallish side in comparison with other restaurants but tastes great. Vietnamese sausage is bit like spam but more al dente in texture. The pork is well seasoned. There is less vermicelli in the dish than I have seen in most other restaurants. The dish is still filling and leaves one satisfied. My companion had no complaints about his meal either.
While we were waiting for the Bún to arrive, Dan would make sure she stopped and showed us the dishes that were going to other tables and tell us: \"See, it's good food, taste great!\". Along the way she stops to tell us that it's a slow night. There has been a steady stream of customers from what I observed. She tells us it's slow because it's the Tuesday after a long weekend, during the weekends the line up is out the door and around the corner. She suggests that next time I come I should taste the hot pots. It seems to be a common dish being ordered by other patrons; I nod my agreement. 
If you're a fan of Vietnamese food then this place is a must for you. It's great to see a family-run place. The dining experience is made complete by the friendliness of the owners and staff. Who doesn't want to go somewhere where they'll get to know you by name? I'm looking forward to my next visit. Bolsa is located at Macleod Plaza which is between Macleod Tr and Bonaventure Dr on 94 Ave SE."}
{"text":"Three star food and five star service. I will split the difference and give it four stars. Not my go to place for Viet but close to home. Service here is very friendly and attentive. Best service of any Viet place I have been to."}
{"text":"Food here is fantastic. 'Mama' is so sweet.  I went once with a friend that was fighting a cold. She could hear it in her voice and Mama said she'd bring her something to help. Out comes warm water with lemons and she insists she drink this before we eat. She really cards about her customers. 

It's fast. It's good. And it's reasonably priced.  Definitely worth going. Just don't judge this place on the decor."}
{"text":"This is a busy place for lunch, they have nicely spiced beef sate with a kind and good wait staff. The restaurant itself is dated and a little dingy, however, it's got a certain charm. This is by no means comparable to some of the best pho spots in the city, but it's a good spot to drop in for a quick bowl."}
{"text":"the food is quite good.  I liked the pictures food here.  IT good yumy taste yes now in belly bum.  The price reasonable as well good yum yum."}
{"text":"All the sauces are home made here!  It's fantastic!  And service is great!  It's a great little lunch spot that's off the beaten track. Definitely a spot I will return to. If for nothing else, the great sauce!"}
{"text":"awful. i ordered a seafood vermicelli dish. received some kind of terrible egg noodle slop dish and was told that it was vermicelli.  i wasted my money here and they don't seem to care. continued to tell me i'm wrong. 

there's only one kind of vermicelli noodle."}
{"text":"So good, and so fast! Don't skip the spring rolls, and the Vietnamese subs are fantastic."}
{"text":"How can you not just love this place! The food is wonderful and the family that owns it are just lovely. Mama gives you such a warm welcome, she remembers everyone and their orders. It is the best of what a neighbourhood restaurant shouts be."}
{"text":"Amazing vermicelli, spring rolls and pho.   I would come back here anytime.  Ambience isn't great but the service and food were"}
{"text":"I've been to Bolsa about three times now and it's always a fun experience. The food is decent Vietnamese fare, great spring rolls, good curries, and tasty Pho. The Pho is all about the broth and these guys do it well, all the food I've tried here is very good and I would say is on the better end of almost any Vietnamese you'll find in the city. One of the nice things about this restaurant is they make their own sauces, so the hoisin and the sambal is all homemade and that makes the difference.

What makes the dining experience here that much better than some others in this category is the owners, they really take pride in their food and it shows. They walk around engaging the tables, in a nice way, and always asking if you like the food \"spicy\", then the big smile. You can tell there are plenty of regulars and repeat customers and that's always a good sign. But even if it's your first visit, they are so welcoming that you feel like you've been there before, but just been away for a while. 

This place is a must!"}
{"text":"When we first started going here, the cook, mama, comes out to get to know us.  Now she knows what we want to order.  She also knows one of the clients I take there is celiac and requires GF meals.  Service is great... this is unusual as most Vietnamese restaurants have that we've been to usually have mediocre to bad service.  The food is fresh!  There is no MSG which is pretty rare with Vietnamese foods.  The cost is very reasonable.  High recommend!"}
{"text":"So great. From the iced Vietnamese Coffee, to the fast, friendly service. Love this place."}
{"text":"BEST VIETNAMESE IN CALGARY BY FAR. The owners and their family are so amazing, and will remember you after eating there once. The food is home made and everything is delicious. I have been there more times than I can remember, have always had amazing service, the pho has always been DELICIOUS, everything has always been delicious. I have been to so many different Vietnamese restaurants, and a lot of them are delicious, but nothing beats Bolsa. Go see Mama and you will never look at Vietnamese food the same way."}
{"text":"I was immediately struck by how friendly the owner was as she took us to a table and handed us the menus. The next thing I learned about the owner was how proud she was of her cooking, and that she had learned  her cooking skills from her mother in Saigon. She recommended a couple of dishes for my son and I, that she was sure that we would enjoy after talking to us, and we took her advice. When she came back to see how we liked the dishes and we replied wonderful, fantastic and delicious, she just beamed and smiled in delight about our thoughts about the dishes.  My feeling about my visit to Bolsa is best described as this is about as close as it gets to be in the home of someone and eating the best food they can make for you!"}
{"text":"One thing I've found about Vietnamese restaurants is that it's all about the atmosphere. I find that most Vietnamese places all pretty much taste the same but it's about the people who are serving you and the restaurant itself.

My friend and I went here for a late lunch today - based on her suggestion. I had never heard of it before and it's tucked away in a strip mall just off Macleod.

I googled it before I went there and based on a comment, saw that someone said they had great pho so I decided to try that. I got beef and shrimp with spring rolls to start and an Avocado shake.

What I really liked is that the lady serving us (I'd guess mid 40's) kept calling me her son and was always talking about something when she came to our table. Asking us how the food was, making small talk, etc. One of the times she came, she picked up my shake and moved it away from my food...telling me that I had to save it for dessert lol.

I would definitely recommend going here if you're in the south and craving some Vietnamese. If not for the lady :)"}
{"text":"Bolsa might be better known as the site of an unfortunate New Year's Day shooting a few years back, but the truth is... it's actually one of the better pho places in Calgary. 

Customer service is great; I haven't been in the restaurant for over a year and the owner still knows I take the #12 Not Spicy. The pho itself is pretty decent, with flavorful broth (on the saltier end), firm and fresh noodles (with firm I mean not overcooked), and plenty of meat. My friend commented that the satay was on the spicier side (compared to what she was used to), but again, not bad. 

The prices are comparable to other pho places in Calgary as well (8.95 Reg, 10.95 Large) although I would advise you to make sure that you are clear with the size that you want when they take your order. I say this because I'm not entirely sure they asked us properly at the beginning, and my friend and I ended up with large bowls. Well, I'm not sure exactly what size we were served, but I definitely paid for the large ones.

Anyway, I would still come back for another bowl. Bolsa is one of the few Vietnamese restaurants in Calgary that does pho right."}
{"text":"Fast and friendly service. Pho with well done beef and beef balls was nowhere near as good as other pho I have had in Edmonton or Calgary. Broth tasted very watered down. It's a shame because the homemade meatballs were decent but the rest just didn't live up to the hype. The search continues..."}
{"text":"Friendly staff but bland food.   I ordered a Vietnamese sub which was not spicy despite me asking them to make it spicy. The beef I found to be overloaded with soy sauce and unappealing. And on top of that it was more expensive than other restaurants. I can't speak for the other food but if you're looking for a good Vietnamese sub this is not the place."}
{"text":"Best vietnamese I've had in the city. \"Mama\" makes the trip worthwhile. She's super friendly, and gives hugs are arm-squeezes to everyone that comes in. You'll have no idea what she's saying most of the time, but you know it's full of kindness!

Order the \"hot plate\". Spicy, but SUCH a good meal."}
{"text":"There is so much good to be said about this place that I don't know where to start.

The owners take such pride in their place that it's more like visiting home than eating out. They make their place so warm and inviting that you just want to go over and over and over.

The food is delicious and fresh. The rare beef noodle soup (pho tai) is delicious, and arrives almost too hot. The vermicelli (bun) is some of the best in the city. Get the large size and you're in for a food coma.

Trying to get a table at lunch time is very difficult as it is a very popular place. 

The service is simply amazing. Attentive and engaging, and if you go more than three or four times, \"Mama\" will have your order memorized. It's simply amazing."}
{"text":"Good but the moat expensive pho i've had
17 buck? Too many other good ones for less.
I's noodles and broth? Why so much."}
{"text":"Friendly service. 
Reasonably priced. 
Clean
Good portion. 

I usually order pho or rice vermicelli."}
{"text":"I think Bolsa makes the best pho in the city. I'm normally more of a vermicelli guy, but at Bolsa the pho wins by far. My go to is the rare beef pho with chili on the side. The broth is amazing. The lady owner told us once how she does it, I forget the details, but basically you have to simmer for a long time to get the flavours develop.

Great place for a quick lunch when I'm in the area."}
{"text":"Having worked at a Vietnamese restaurant and developing my love for pho, I compare every pho to the one I used to serve. 

This place is a what I call \"a hole in the wall\" kind of place which I dig. It's clean, the service is great and I loved the pho! 

Similar to another yelper, I was asked if I like spicy and I said yes!  So I received the spicier pho which I thoroughly enjoyed. I still added hoisin and sriracha to every sumptuous bite, and I'm hooked on the spicy version for sure. 
The spring rolls are lovely as well and the peanut sauce is great. 

I normally treat myself to a Vietnamese coffee, alas I had no more room! 

I recommend this resto for sure! And it's just off of Macleod and near box stores.   Oh and if you overindulge there's a \"fit for less\" a stones through away."}
{"text":"My new favourite place. No pretense looks like the owners are the servers, very friendly good food decent price!"}
{"text":"Gross not fresh and a dirty restaurant!
Ordered Lemongrass Beef Vermicelli but got Chicken.
They took away scraped off most of the chicken and then topped it up with beef.
Yuk!!
Ordered a Vietnamese iced coffee and the condensed milk tasted sour? How is that even possible?
Go to Oriental Phoenix or Colonial Fusion if you want GOOD Vietnamese food!"}
{"text":"Review #5 of Yelp's 30 Day Challenge 2012

Bolsa has such a welcoming and comfortable environment that I feel like I am dining at home when I go there for food. The owners are always checking each table if their food is ok or if the customers are getting what they need. They' re like your parents who are so excited to see you and couldn't wait to feed you after being away from home for so long. Also the younger generation (who look like their kids maybe?) were also very friendly, always ready to fill our glasses and bring us utensils/bowls before we can ask for them. 

On our very first visit , the very helpful lady suggested what their best sellers are and her suggestions did not disappoint! When we came the first time, we were soooo tired and hungry from yoga and most of the time that tricks me into thinking that the food I'm served is better so I postponed doing a review until after my second visit. The food suggested on my second my visit was also as satisfying as the first! I suggest getting the spring rolls (their sauce is different from other Vietnamese places I've been to) ,Special Wonton Soup, #57 (beef in some spicy sauce) and #59 (chicken and veggies in a sizzling plate).

I don't think I'm ever gonna run out of nice things to say about this place but if you're in the area try it! Service and food will not disappoint :)"}
{"text":"This is the best Vietnamese cuisine I have had in Calgary, let alone Canada so far. The Pho is fantastic. The broth has one of the most unique tastes I've ever experienced. I'm heading back there today.

The service is also great. They make you feel very welcome when you visit. Come by as soon as possible! Do it!"}
{"text":"I have been to Bolsa many times and feel the quality of their food and service is going downhill. I was there last night and it took close to 10 minutes to get our order taken and it wasn't super busy. The food did not have a fresh taste and I will probably try a different Vietnamese restaurant next time."}
{"text":"I found this place via Yelp. It was the perfect chilly day for a nice hot bowl of Pho. Upon arrival nothing too impressive on an atmosphere a bit of a hole in the wall to be honest. I was greeted by a very friendly and very busy Vietnamese woman who referred to herself as Mama. Don't expect too much for atmosphere or even the most prompt service however, what you can expect is hands-down the best bowl of Pho you'll ever taste. Generous portions for a reasonable price and just a delicious broth that satisfies beyond words. I went with beef meatballs , brisket , tendon ( held off on the tripe) extra spciy. Every spoonful and bite were just delicious. Mama really made the experience quite enjoyable as she's very passionate about her food and the people she serves it to. She told me she cooks the broth slow and low overnight. If you're in the area and want to experience one hell of a bowl of Pho I highly suggest it. There's a big parking lot as it's part of them all so no need to worry about that. In the words of my former governor I'll be back."}
{"text":"I chose Bolsa as my first Vietnamese experience and I have to tell ya peeps....absolutely amazing!

I was not disappointed at all. The staff were very friendly and the food was delicious. So many options to choose from and I look forward to trying another menu item"}
{"text":"One of the best Pho lunches I have had.   Ordered 9c / spicy...  Delicious.  Fast.  Fresh!!"}
{"text":"Four stars because I will go back. I ordered number nine, the standard rare beef pho. He asked, \"you don't want it spicy?\" I said make it a little bit spicy. He nodded.

Soup came out fast. 

The broth had a nice coconut type sweet flavour to it. The bowl wasn't huge but it was satisfying and I liked the taste of the beef.

There was also something charming about the ambiance. Windows but not a lot of light, very casual with cushy unstable booths. Yet somehow, comfortable enough to sit and talk for a while. 

I only stayed for half an hour. I sat in the back to the left where there is a small aquarium all to myself and in the very back another large aquarium with a huge fish."}
{"text":"One of my favourite Vietnamese restaurants in calgary... I have been here 3 times now, and everything I have tried is just delicious!!.. My favorite I think would be the pork in hot pot, but is a hard decision, as everything is awesome!!... I cannot give them less than 5 stars, because they really deserve them!.. Is not easy to find a place where everything is great!.. And you never have anything bad!!.. In addition to the great food, the service is super friendly!.. This restaurant is now one of my favorites in town for Vietnamese food!!.. I definitely agree with most of the yelp reviews!!.."}
{"text":"The couple that runs this place is very friendly.  My parents have become regulars and the owners cook something special for them every time and don't even bother with menus anymore.  

The menu is pretty standard as Vietnamese goes but the quality is superb.   The owners say the difference with their food is that they use fresh vermicelli and not dehydrated like most restaurants.

You need to try this place!"}
{"text":"Just ordered from here and as a Vietnamese person myself i don't think it's not as good as pho dau bo's satay broth. The regular broth not bad and their quail is not as good as pho Kim's butter quail. Overall I give it 3 star because I am impressed with how much meat they put in their pho! Was really happy about that"}
{"text":"The best I've ever had.   Vietnamese Pho prepared with enough careful detail to compete with great Japanese Ramen."}
{"text":"The moment we walked in we had been pleasantly greeted by 'Mama' the proprietor.  Unknown to us at the time, she is somewhat of a local celebrity, known for high positive energy attention to her clientele.  After sitting down I believe her husband came by to promptly take our order.  With the mix of accents at play it was a bit challenging to understanding everything he said.  But we managed to get it figured it quickly.  

Orders went in and after a few minutes the food came out.  Into the trunk it went for a six hour ride back to the States.  We finished off one order yesterday which was AMAZING and will finish off the second order tonight.  The vegetarian noodle soup was nicely spiced and seasoned.  The broth was great but I question if it was actually vegetarian.  I suspect they may have just strained the meat out.  

If that is important to you be sure to verify.  The heavy layer of lard on the top of the cooled soup was a giveaway.  It seemed a little excessive to just be oil.  Not going to fuss about it though on this first pass through.  

The decor is run down and on the used but what I thought was great was the sparkling clean fish tanks.  Each of the many tanks was crystal clear.  The fish seems fat and happy.  If the kitchen looked anything like those tanks - no worries.  

Eat up.  Will be stopping back on next trip out of town.

TIP - the first parking spot is so heavily used that two deep potholes have formed right under where the front tires would normally rest.  Causing the front end of your car to rest on the curb.  Use any other spot or don't pull up all the way."}
{"text":"So many vietnamese places to choose in the area, but gave Bolsa a shot to compete with my other favourite place on MacLeod. 

The owners are facetious and cute, there are tons of aquariums around which would be cool if you brought children with you.

Standard Vietnamese menu, I ordered the lemongrass beef - my benchmark when comparing new places.   Mine came out and it was chicken.    I mentioned this to our server, and she told me that \"the beef was no good today\" and I should have the chicken.  Not sure if this was her covering for a mistake, or the truth.  Either way I'm not one of those people who sends food back, so I ate it and enjoyed it.

Bolsa has a nice flavour in their fish sauce that is more unique than other places, but as fare as Vietnamese, still not my favourite."}
{"text":"Quit watering down the damn hoisin sauce, cheap asses. I dunno what's up with this place but I've tried to continue supporting this local pho restaurant but it's just not tasty or authentic we prob won't be back.. just my 2cents. Great service though we love momma"}
