{"text":"I met a friend here and was a bit skeptical due to previous reviews. I am glad that did not change my mind about this place. It's more of a bar than a lounge, but thats ok. I still had a good time. 

The people there was nice and didn't mind talking. A pool league was playing was tgat was interesting to watch. 

I don't know how this place was in the past, but my experince was great.   The bartender was interactive with the patrons. She made an awesome drink.

I would definitely go back if i have the opportunity.

They are definitely  Raider fans. I prefer the Packers!"}
{"text":"Been to this bar a couple of times before. To my surprise, it's really clean and kept up. You wouldn't be able to tell from the outside though. They have a couple of pool tables and had a dj. My girlfriends and I had the best ASADA FRIES N GARLIC PARMESAN FRIES EVER!!! The only disappointment was, the blonde bartender took forever to serve us our drinks but overall it was a fun atmosphere :) we will definitely be back."}
{"text":"Arriving here it seemed that the neighborhood was a bit bad. But inside, the people were friendly. I guess it gets crazy busy. This is a Raider Fan bar. All bars with super fans are crazy. lol. Inside it looked on the old side. But Vegas is old.  I'm just used to newer parts of Vegas."}
{"text":"Raider nation bar, friendly bar tender and very informative. Do not let the outside appearance keep you away. clean and very non divey on the inside. They also serve food but we had already eaten."}
{"text":"Raiders bar!! Always a good time. 

Good wings and poppers, and very crowded on game days."}
{"text":"WHAT A DAMN SHAME! 

New owners come in fire all the bartenders FOR WHAT?!?! An over weight, non personality having, 1980's perm wearing NOBODY! Who is to busy flirting with the guys playing pool to serve paying customers!?!?!?!!? Are y'all serious? The place is so dead the bartenders personality is dead. And the sad looking girl charged me for drinks when I had money in the machine, which should have been comped cause i was playing. That goes to show how desperate they are for money.

All in all I wont be coming back thanks for ruining my neighborhood bar by firing all the dope bartenders for your wack a$$ wife to bartender who sucks and is too busy flirting with the customers over pool to serve us.

Yall ruined a good neighborhood bar! Wont ever be coming back thanks!"}
{"text":"Family atmosphere with amazing customer service.  I drove clear across town just to see what this place was all about.  The atmosphere is very, \"Cheers\" like for the fact that everyone was friendly and inviting.  Justin happened to be my bartender on this particular occasion.  Kudos to Justin on his unparalleled guest service.  I will definitely come back to this establishment.  Thank you for such a wonderful experience!!!

Happy hour sampler platter was amazing.  Also beers are cheap and the atmosphere is great!"}
{"text":"This is a great bar. The staff and the drink prices are gr8. Come once after that your family"}
{"text":"Lucie's Lounge is a cool little bar that knows exactly what it is.  THe bartenders there are range from super nice and great with drinks to inattentive at worst, but they never get in the way. The best part of this place is that the drinks are super cheap Happy hour or not, you can get your moneys worth of whatever you want. Whats also cool about this bar is that they have comedy shows occasionally and on saturdays they do karaoke, which never falls short of entertaining. Its a great local bar, and its one that likely gets passed by because of its location and that the exterior doesn't make it stand out at all. But if you like dive bars then this'll be a great place for you"}
