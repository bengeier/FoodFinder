{"text":"The bar was packed with people drinking. I ordered the shepards pie. It had over cooked ground beef with canned vegtable and gravey. One scoop of boxed mashed potatoes on the center. The irish egg rolls were good. I tried the place once never to return"}
{"text":"Good food with great service ! I came with a date and we wanted to experience to the fullest !   The actual place is huge and has plenty of seating. The number of TVs is too many to count, a great location to catch any type of sporting event.  The server was nice and welcoming, took our order in perfect time.   The food was good across the board from app. to entr√©e. I would recommend the hooley house corn beef sandwich, the cheddar bacon burger, and the French onion soup. The portions are very large and go with an excellent price , plenty of take home food.   Overall a good experience. Only comment would be to narrow down the menu. The menu is huge, my opinion is that a smaller menu would increase the quality of the food."}
{"text":"My friend and I ordered the shared appetizer. It was very disappointing bar food. Our waitress was rude and very short with us. The only real reason to go is to watch a sports event on one of their many televisions."}
{"text":"Amazing TV setup for watching games and the food is fantastic!"}
{"text":"UPDATE: Now the latest is that the acclaimed Irish Bar\" discontinued their well established \"Irish Wednesday \" specials.  Gone are the Guinness  & Jameson specials. Surprise to all the long time regulars. Hooley has officially \"jumped the shark\". No wonder patronage is scare in the evenings. Might as well close at 8 pm since only the day time crowd seems to matter anymore. As for $6 Guinness drafts, those can be found anywhere and you actually get them in Guinness glassware at other establishments. No need to come to Hooley for that. Now, there are still some nice staff here but the price points really equate to a less desirable experience.   This used to be one of my favorite sipping posts but I don't so many kinds words as of late. It's hard to argue that it is a better place or experience from what it was in year one. The only constant is that is the head scratching changes. When the Brooklyn location opened in 2014 there was so much more to love about the place. They were open to 0230 every night and offered great, friendly service & prices.  They tried different entertainment such as open mic Mondays. They formerly had one of the best perk programs around. Now even that is half of what it used to be. Plus the prices have soared. The few specials they had are all but gone. They rarely offer new draft selections. And the live entertainment is all but extinct. There's not much incentive for stopping by at 10 pm on a Friday or after 7 pm most days.  It seems like they bank on St. Paddy's Day and football Sundays to carry them through the year. Why not do more to draw people in all year round? What happened to the regular Friday/Saturday bands? Overall, Hooley Brooklyn lacks an identity and direction. It doesn't even seem like an Irish bar most days. The last time they played Irish music was probably March 17. But, they sure like to play plenty of pop/dance music.  By the way, what kind of Irish bar doesn't offer Harp on draft? They can't even pour a true half and half draft! Brooklyn is the only Hooley, out of the 4 locations, that doesn't offer Harp on draft. And what's the allure of the roof top inflatables? That doesn't seem to draw more people in. Maybe the increased prices go to pay for the increased placement of inflatables!"}
{"text":"Great customer service, Jamie is AWESOME! Lunch is usually prompt & yummy. Recommend to anyone"}
{"text":"I wasn't too impress with this place. Its a sport bar so their will be a bunch of drunks but I was hoping the employees could keep them in check. Had an issue with a drunk I was there and the employees just stood there and watch."}
{"text":"Went here for the first time to watch the Cavs game. This place is perfect for a sports game. The food was delicious and the service was very good as well. I will definitely be going back here!"}
{"text":"One and done. Horrible service and food was terrible. Not a fan of Irish food I went with friends. I ordered a veggie wrap and could have bought the extra salty Morningstar black bean burger myself.   Too loud to have a conversation at our table and we were one of two tables in the bar area. Did I mention that service was horrible?   Would not recommend."}
{"text":"I got the Irish  stuffed boxty it was good but needed sauerkraut. And to add its a dollar but worth it."}
{"text":"The food was excellent, but the service SUCKED!  Nothing but rude and snotty employees... I won't go back!"}
{"text":"Let me give you a clue.... upon walking in, many staff were on break, outside, on the regular patio, smoking cigarettes.  I walked in to get a table for six. This was around 10pm ... well after dining hours. It took the hostess several minutes to even walk over to great us. Immediately she told me that we probably would not be able to get a table and shrugged... as if she could literally care less. Looking at the seating chart I immediately saw 4 tables unseated. I looked around and saw where they were. So I inquired about the seating. She told me that they were 4 tops and probably couldn't find any chairs to make tables. Yadda yadda. She just did not care about us at all.  A second hostess came up and I expressed my concern about not feeling welcome and I explained how we had wanted a table.   Long story short, this was my first time here and my first impression with the hosts was awful. WHY I HAD 5O WORK SO HARD TO GIVE THEM BUSINESS IS BEYOND ME.  I ended up expressing my feelings towards the manager but by that point we had made a decision to go across the street to TGIF.   We had wanted to celebrate a family moment and the service here was anything but welcoming.  I highly discourage you from attending this place. It's horrible. One of the worst places I've ever been to and by far the worst Yelp review I've had to write in a long time."}
{"text":"Food is really good. I ordered food to go today and the bar tender accidentally adds himself a 52 percent tip. This is ridiculous!!!! This should have never happened."}
{"text":"The only reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is because my pomegranate cosmo was pretty good and the fries were delicious. The service here is the worst I've ever had. Michael was completely inattentive. Every time we needed our water refilled, he was nowhere to be found. For what we got, the food took too long to come out. They ran out of mushrooms, so my philly cheesesteak sandwich was basically just meat and cheese - like a horrible knockoff french dip. I will never go back and highly recommend no one else goes there either."}
{"text":"Went there with family for a browns game last week.  It took us 15 minutes to get our drinks to start.  It was downhill from there.  We had to ask for for everything.  I haven't had that bad of service at a sports bar ever. I definitely don't want to go back."}
{"text":"I just visited Hooley House, and both the food and service were pretty terrible.  My wings had floppy skin and flavorless meat.  I also tried the reuben with mac & cheese.  The corned beef was actually pretty tasty; but the griddled bread was too greasy and couldn't stand up to the juices in the sandwich.  Even though I ate my sandwich right away, the bottom piece of bread on my sandwich was a soggy mess.  The mac & cheese was fine, but nothing I'd want to eat again.  My server was MIA after taking my order, letting food runners bring my food while he chit chatted in the kitchen (I could see directly in there from the bar area).  So, my awful wings and wish for a side of thousand island were not addressed.  Just yuck."}
{"text":"We placed our order around 730 and around 750, the manager came by and explained that the order was never placed it would be placed right away and the meals would be on the house they also gave us a gift card.   The food was good and fairly priced It was very loud. Even though it was only 20% full it was very loud.   Upon leaving we walked through two employees smoke as they puffed away at the front door"}
{"text":"Came in on a Friday night. Cavs was wrapping up and they had a good crowd, but plenty of room to sit. Never been here before so we stood at the hostess station for a few minutes before someone came over and asked if we had been helped?  \"No, I'm just standing here to observe the bar\" is what I wanted to say, but all they heard was no.   Sat in the big room. Lots of TVs, including the Illinois game playing on one of the smaller ones. As the Cavs game ended, Mr. Remote Control drifted by and willingly changed a tv next to my table to the Illinois game.   We ordered some appetizers, which seemed to take quite a while to appear. Jess had the garlic parm wings with sweet potato fries. I'm not a fan of sweet potatoes, bit these fries were great!  Regarding the wings, however, my daughter said \"they're not BW3\". Whoa. That's not a compliment.   I got the pretzel sticks and cheese. The cheese was the consistency of chocolate milk. Tasty, but snot would stick to the pretzel better than this watered down stuff.  The Great Lakes Christmas Ale was good.  And the waitress short changed me. There goes another star."}
{"text":"Waited for 10 minutes at our table and no one ever approached us to take our order and even ask what we wanted to drinks. Terrible service. We walked out and told the hostess and she was looked at us dumb founded. Walked across the street to TGI FRIDAYS and the service was amazing!!"}
{"text":"The truth is I am no longer a big Bar goer... those days passed me up when I had my kids. I know plenty of men and women who continue going to bars and that is fine, and I like to do it Sometimes but the majority of my eating and drinking establishments are family based.  I hear there have been changes to specials at the Hooley and that is fine, it's not affected me directly. My family enjoys specials they have, my kids enjoy the food, and we come out not feeling like our wallets have been decimated.   The service has been great at both locations I have been to, it has been friendly and prompt. Excellent meals and bar foods. Very good wings."}
{"text":"This is my second time here and since I am not from the area I never know when I will be back.   My first time here I ordered an appetizer that included two sliders some onion rings and some boneless chicken wings.   Well the cheeseburger sliders was very tasty, the onion rings were very breaded and not crispy which I am sure some people enjoy it just wasn't my thing. The boneless chicken wings I had done in their bourbon sauce and they were good but maybe a wee overcooked or I may be picky.   My next trip I asked what the waitress recommended she suggested a couple of thing but one was their stuffed boxie. I got it with the steak, onions and mushrooms.   Well the boxie was unseasoned hash browns 4 small pieces of sirloin steak about 2-3 ounces. Some portabella mushroom slices and some onions. Thankfully I ordered bourbon to go with dinner.   Would I come back again, well if in the area for work again I would only because it is walking distance from the hotel and I would like to think I can find something on the menu that I love."}
{"text":"Don't be discouraged by the couple picky reviews on here. I came her for my birthday with my whole family (of many ages 18 to 60). The experience was wonderful, we had a group of ten and our wait wasn't that long for 630 on a Saturday.  Our server Mary was very attentive and amazing, and don't get me started on the food. Everyone in our group was happy with what they ordered and the pricing of everything is pretty fair. The bartenders definitely know what they're doing, and are pretty personable. This is definitely a place that you should experience for yourself before writing it off. My family and I enjoyed it."}
{"text":"First time here. Met a friend and his wife for dinner. Service was prompt and friendly. We ordered the nachos and our friends ordered the pretzel sticks. Both were good though the nacho toppings were a bit sparse if you ask me.   I tried the boneless wings with hot BBQ. Got a full order just because it was my first time here and I'm not sure how big the servings were. Good God did I get a lot of wings. And they were big, juicy and the sauce was awesome. Also ordered the BBQ burger cooked medium. It was very good.   The gf got a Philly cheesesteak wrap with potato pancakes called a boxty. She said her meal was excellent.   Plus they have a rewards card. For every $100 you spend they give you $10 toward another meal. Pretty good deal if you ask me. We will definitely be back."}
{"text":"This is a bigger restaurant but with a very friendly atmosphere. The food was great (especially the potato skins and the onion rings!), and the service was even better. Rob was funny and charming and I will DEFINITELY request him next time we go. Everything was fresh and timely, no plates that looked like they had been sitting under a heat lamp. The manager and other employees were friendly and pleasant as well. There was another server though who we asked a question and she was not very helpful and a little snarky. Wouldn't have her wait on us (Shandy?). Overall I definitely give this place 5 stars and can't wait to go again!"}
{"text":"Met two co workers here at 705PM. They were already seated and had drinks although empty. It's 737 and no one has come by to check on food or their empty drinks or take my order..."}
{"text":"Food is good but they paid no attention to acoustics whatsoever.   The sound bounces around inside the bar and it is hard to hear yourself think.   The drunks get louder and tell the bartender to turn it up which they readily do. If they hung 10 panels in the metal deck ceiling it would solve the problem. But I would be surprised if they ever address it.  The dining room is not as bad but it is still a problem."}
{"text":"Holy shnikeys!  MUCH improved over the horrible new orleans showboat restaurant.  Solid bar food, cool bar, good beer choices.  This is my new happy hour place.  Good stuff!  The only thing that'd make it a 5 star would be using better quality / fresh ingredients.  It's decent standard bar food, don't expect anything outstanding on your plate."}
{"text":"Nice, casual bar. Pretty tasty food as well."}
{"text":"I love going there whenever I can. The last time kinda made me wonder though. Got told in a basically empty table area I had to keep it down the last couple seconds of a cavs game where we lost by a couple points. I literally only shouted stuff towards the last few mins of the game and I've been there before where grown men had said far worse and way louder than I. Plus it's a sports bar. Why the heck do I have to sit like a child and silently clap like I'm at a golf tournament? Upon asking some of the other servers what's up they all confirmed nobody had a problem and my friend and I figured out the one who shushed me was actually a manager not just an angry entitled female. The place and food and basically all other staff are wonderful however if u r gonna work at a sports bar u should be able to freely shout for ur Cleveland teams without worry. That's the point of a sports bar. I'm not at red lobster. And if u read this female manager who avoided our table like the plague after we figured out who u r (probably so I couldn't ask why I actually was being shushed when according to ur servers nobody has a problem) please lighten up and stop killing people's vibes for being passionate."}
{"text":"We decided on this place because it was within walking distance of out hotel.    Nice atmosphere with lots of TVs.  We were seated in the bar area and our server was not very attentive.  They were very busy, so maybe that is why.  The food was average at best.  Reuben sandwich was missing the Swiss cheese and the waitress never came to check so we never got it.  No celery came with chicken wings either, although it was on the menu that way.  My husband got some kind of potato pancakes with his Rueben and they were literally dripping with grease.  Not a great experience."}
{"text":"Nasty fried overpriced bar food in a dirty atmosphere served by rude teenagers.  Woohoo."}
{"text":"Last night went to the bar to wait for the family,  and the bartender became our best friend. Nice, friendly and knowledgeable. Then with the family I ordered the fish and taster tots, excellent.  Better than my husband's fries. Worth visiting again, specially the bar"}
{"text":"First time here and we will definitely return. Burgers were cooked perfectly and seasoned well. Fresh pub fries were thick and crunchy but were not greasy and this was a plus! Menu has a great selection of burgers, wraps, pizza, appetizers etc. atmosphere was fun with plenty of TV's to watch THE TRIBE or whatever your sports preference. Outside patio will be fun to enjoy dinner this summer. Server was very friendly and attentive. Looking forward to another visit."}
{"text":"Visited because they were one of the few places open late and walking distance from my hotel.   I sure am glad I did.  Stephanie was very helpful when it came to selecting my meal.   I went with the Irish Boxty.   This has got to be the best Boxty I have ever eaten.     I will be returning next time I am in town."}
{"text":"One of my favorite places in the area. Good service and food, at a reasonable price. Sometimes you might get a bad server.. One that caters to the better looking tables. But.. The spinach artichoke dip and steak boxy are my favorite items from their menu. Can't ever go wrong with Hooley house for the night out or dinner. :)"}
{"text":"Those of you that follow my reviews know that there are two things I'm not a fan of, big noisy crowds and sports. It's for these two reasons that I've been hesitant to make my way to the Hooley House. I simply don't suffer fools (or sports fans) well. On a recent Saturday evening, my wife and I decided to stray outside of our comfort zone. We were looking for some good pub grub and something close to home. We set out with low expectation and empty bellies. The result? Pleasant surprise, overly filled bellies and thoughts of another visit.  Hooley House is a sports bar painted with a brush dipped in a little Irish pub. The space is large, the menu even larger and they are comfortable in their skin. Located right in the middle of restaurant chain America, the Hooley House is the lone standout. The original location is in Mentor and this spot has only been open about a year (several restaurants have occupied this space, including a Don Pablo's). Hooley House added an open patio with a gas fireplace that looks really cozy, too.  Did I mention that this place is big? As others have said, even when the parking lot looks full, inside there's probably still plenty of seating. The ceilings are tall, there are booths lining the perimeter, tables scattered about and a stage where they hold regular live entertainment shows. Like I said before, this is a sports bar and this is clearly evident with the dozens of flatscreens lining the walls. Not my thing, but if that gets you off you won't be disappointed. The space is separated into two distinct areas with the bar off to the right when you enter and the main dining/entertainment area in the back.  Our server, Nyesha, was great. She was everything you could want in a server, friendly, attentive, an advocate of the establishment. She made sure we had everything we wanted and kept tabs on our progress without being intrusive.  There's also a clear bent toward the drinking crowd at the Hooley. They've got an extensive drink menu with traditional cocktails, beer cocktails, island drinks, fancy martinis, bombs of several varieties, wine and, of course, beer. Speaking of which, they've got 14 taps, mostly macros with a smattering of local and regional micros. During our visit they were featuring several holiday brews including locals Great Lakes Christmas Ale and Fat Head's Holly Jolly. Two of my personal favorites this time of year. If you're looking to imbibe you've got plenty of options here.  The menu here is pretty massive. It's filled with everything from wings and burgers to wraps and, as the name of the place implies, some Irish-inspired fare like shepherd's pie and boxty. They've also got several varieties of mac and cheese and grilled cheese. This is not a place to come if you're watching what you eat, but for the occasional cheat meal it's perfect. Tonight was one of those nights for us:  Loaded tots - I love tater tots. Such a simple comfort food and these were perfect. Crunchy, hot, smothered in ooey-gooey cheese, chopped scallions and bacon. The side of sour cream a nice addition.  Wings - I opted for a half order of the hot garlic sauce variety. Crispy and smothered in an orange buttery hot sauce. Not terribly spicy but addicting. I recommend eating them quickly lest they get soggy.   Slider sampler - I went this route so I could give all of their slider options a try. One each of cheeseburger, crispy chicken, corned beef, and turkey served on soft, white fluffbread buns. Not bad. I should have asked for some mayo as they were a bit on the dry side, but still tasty.  Tuna melt - Traditional. Tuna salad (mayo, relish, dill, tuna) topped with tomato and cheddar cheese on rye bread. A tad greasy but overall a solid offering. Crispy bread, melted cheese, nice seasoning.  Cole slaw - This is how slaw is done. Creamy, slightly sweet, crispy cabbage, onions some carrot. No funny business here.  Mac and cheese - Comfort food 101. A small crock of cheddar mac and cheese elbows the top slightly charred and crispy. Ridiculously good. This should be served on top of the loaded tots.  Hooley House was a good time for us. We got to sit at a comfy booth, had a fantastic server, and stuffed our guts with fat and carbs until we walked funny. We got exactly what we wanted and some of what we didn't expect."}
{"text":"Burger and salad were good, nice restaurant all decorated for Halloween. Service is so so. There were only two other tables with customers and it took forever to get a refill and check."}
{"text":"Tonight I dropped my cat off in the ER and I was totaling bumming. I couldn't figure out how to order ice cream on the app.  I'm pathetic, I know.  I called for help but was I was just frustrated and found myself balling my eyes out about my day and not getting any ice cream. I ordered my meal and when it arrived they had included ice cream in my order.  It was super nice and not necessary but completely appreciated.  Thank you guys so so much!"}
{"text":"I had heard about their wings from coworkers and decided to try them out.DH and I visited on early Friday evening. They had live music band and happy hour was until 7p. The drink and appetizer specials were decently priced for happy hour. The wings bone in and boneless were very good. The drink was made right and the atmosphere was great. The only thing negative I can say about this place ...when we placed our order the server made it seem like fries came with our meal and that when we asked to substitute fries for a house salad that would be ok, but then when our check arrive we were charged for a house salad. Overall, good place."}
{"text":"We enjoyed it. We came in on a Thursday evening and the patio was pretty full but we sat inside at the bar. We had the corned beef egg rolls and nachos. The egg rolls were very tasty! The nachos needed more cheese despite the bartender telling us there was adequate cheese and they were a bit greasy.   We also enjoyed two apple pie shots and they turned into an apple pie martini. Out of the two, the shot was better but would've been great chilled. All in all, it was a nice new experience."}
{"text":"This place is a great sports bar off the highway- convenient while traveling through Cleveland.  Get the Hooley Hunks! Delicious! We also loved their corned beef sliders... Their \"Perfect Snack\" featured both sliders & hunks.. Served alongside crispy onion rings."}
{"text":"I've eaten here several times for lunch and most recently for my moms birthday dinner. I have found the food to be very good, especially the turkey sandwich on a pretzel roll. When my moms Shepards Pie came out cold, Jason the DM bent over backwards to make it right for us. I would recommend the Hooley House as a good place to eat with several very good menu choices at a fair price. The gestures Jason made to make my moms meal right were just another reason I will be back. Well done!"}
{"text":"The Brooklyn location has the same great menu, but poor service, waitress had tables all over the building and outside. The food preparation was far superior at the Westlake location. Management needs some work here."}
{"text":"Quite possibly one of my favorite bars. The staff are all great and attentive. The food is great. They also have a Hooley Rewards card I def recommend getting. The more you drink and eat there....the more you earn. The new fireplace patio is also great. A ton of daily specials including tall drafts during all Cleveland sporting events."}
{"text":"Best Mac n cheese I have ever had! Got an order of boneless wings which were pretty good and the buffalo chicken mac n cheese which was amazing. Got everything to go. Server was quick and friendly supplying me with beers while I waited. The price was reasonable as well."}
{"text":"Stopped by to see a band. Great stage area and pretty good music venue! Only problem (and it's a big one) was that our server brought me a similar, but different wine than I had ordered. I was not familiar with this brand, so didn't notice until I got the check... And of course the wine she brought was more expensive! Just a warning to be very careful with ordering here!"}
{"text":"Food was great.  Portions were wonderful.    Only negative:  We had a big group (12).  For whatever reason, they split us into two groups."}
{"text":"Definitely a mixed bag. We came at happy hour on a Friday...with a party of 6. It's an after work celebration to boot so we were ready to socialize AND drink! 2 hours and $100 later...our table wasn't cleared, we remain thirsty, and decided to go down the street. I spent a bill myself (with 20% tip) plus my 5 friends averaged $40 tabs themselves with drinks and appetizers. I shared our reason for leaving with our server and the manager who served us two flights while our server was elsewhere. I also appreciate that management apologized (someone called off and they had huge business party in main hall) but at the end of the day...I just wanted to have fun and celebrate my co-worker's new opportunity. But If we had ordered from the bar while occupying floor space...we'd be &$$holes. So we hoped it would get better...and it didn't...so we left. I just thought y'all should know. #hooleyhouse #brooklyn #2starexperience"}
{"text":"Visited 1/2013 - A good Irish pub...Guinness is fresh ,,, food was typical pub fare...noise level high"}
{"text":"Went to the Grande Opening Party for the newest Hooley House, on Cascade Crossing, behind TGIFridays in Brooklyn.  Just off 480 & Tiedeman. The big Hooley House is the 2nd site for owners John & Colleen Reece, Richie & Christina Reece, Paul & Peggy Baker and Ward Lawson. Food was good - love their Turkey Pretzel Roll, tator tots, and to have a sembalnce of health, a side salad.    Full complement of beers on tap, in bottle and all the top shelf liquors. Plenty of seating and a pation with a fire pit. They will soon have Smithwicks too.  Staff very friendly, 55 tv screens - the best of Irish pubs meets the best of Sports pubs.  had a great time and will go back, often."}
{"text":"In town for work, this was close to my hotel.  I almost didn't go based on some reviews, I did and I liked it.  Bartenders were super friendly, Fat Tire was cold and the wings were pretty darn good.  Must have been happy hour, but my check was pretty cheap compared to where I live.  I'll go back if I'm back in the area."}
{"text":"Very Poor Service. Sat at table for 20 minutes and no one asked if I wanted to order. If I had Cubs gear on I could understand."}
{"text":"Really bad food. Tastes like everything was taken out of the freezer, microwaved, and served. Nothing tastes fresh here. Even the french fries are awful and taste like they've been microwaved. I'm unsure as to how this place stays in business serving food like this. To be fair, the restaurant was far from packed during dinner time which should've been a tell tale sign to leave. But since we were in a hurry, we settled. If I wanted a frozen meal I would've gone to the grocery store and picked one up in the freezer aisle."}
{"text":"Real nice place. Very good food. But I'm not sure if it's more of a bar or a family establishment."}
{"text":"My wife and I decided to check this place out, having been there as part of our St Patties day bus bar hop. What we found was good, fresh food, craft beer, and very reasonable prices. We shared one of the chicken nugget concoctions as an appetizer, and as advertised, it was obviously made from fresh chicken breast pieces, lightly breaded, fried, and served with your choice of sauce. We always try the basic hot sauce when checking out wings or nuggets, just to get a good baseline. The light breading didn't hold a lot of the frying oil, and the chicken inside was moist and tasty. We opted for the sweet potato fries with the chicken and they were also perfectly done. My wife ordered a Reuben sandwich and tater tots, and raved about the sandwich. I ordered the turkey wrap with the house made chips, and it too, was tasty. The chips were crisp without being burned, and quite satisfying. We both brought half of our sandwiches and sides home, an I'm enjoying my wrap as I write this. My wife opted for one of the many ipa's, and thoroughly enjoyed it. I opted for soda, and my drink was always full. The service was great and the atmosphere friendly. We will be back!"}
{"text":"first time here .. ordered the fish + chips .. did not feel like one of the offered sides so I opted to try the mac + cheese .. I could have lubed a car w/the grease/oil coming off of it but it was cheesy .. a bit to rich for me to finish but tasty enough .. pretzel appetizer was good .. had both the cheese dipper + honey mustard dipper sauces .. found it odd that they offer only 2 items for dessert .. not on the menu .. had to ask the waitress .. neither sounded appetizing & gotta say she did nothing to make them sound appealing either .. so we passed on that .. more than likely will give it another try .."}
{"text":"I love this place!! Yeah they have regular bar food like wings and burger but I swear these cooks put some type of love drug in here because I can't stop coming back for more! And this is the one place that serve tator tots!!!! I would definitely recommend anyone to try the loaded carnivore tots!! These tots are served with corned beef and an over easy egg! The menu is accommodating to healthy eaters as well with heart healthy salads that is full of delicious toppings depending on which one you get.  And if you have to modify your foods to be grilled or steamed they will do just that!  My friends and I have been coming here every week for the past year and this place still never disappoints!"}
{"text":"This was my first time here.  My review is primarily for the service. I met a friend here for lunch when they opened their doors at 11:00. So we were literally the first people here.  Our waitress was cheerful and thorough, allowing my friend and I time to catch up while I'm sure we were annoying as we kept asking for more time.  She was very accommodating and we placed our lunch order.  My friend had a simple cheeseburger which came out cooked to temp and he said it was just fine.  I ordered a philly wrap with French onion soup. The soup came out first, and though I was a bit weary of the red hue? It was quite good. The wrap however,  just slipped someone's attention in the kitchen.  Even though I have never been here before, I doubt this was their best work.  I don't need to go into details, it was just off. Let me also add that I am 9 months pregnant, so because of this I lost my appetite.  Now here is where I put the weight of my review...  I realize everything that comes out of a kitchen isn't going to be perfect.. And I know  I'm not ordering a 50 dollar porterhouse, but much too often I have seen ( or not seen) management show no concern about a single persons experience.  This was not the case. They could have easily said \" do you want a box? No? Ok\"  and give us a bill and call it a day. The actions of the staff is why I will be back.  Not only was the waitress genuinely concerned, she wanted to know exactly what I didn't like , and how they could fix the situation. I really was not looking for them to take it off the bill, I just didn't care for it. Soon after, a manager ( I am assuming) came to the table to apologize and try to rectify the situation. This was what sealed the deal for me.  The loyalty the staff had to their patrons, no matter how big their check is... Made my day.  They did take it off the bill, and even though I insisted I didn't want anything else, they made sure I had a new wrap to take home with me just in case.  And I will say, I just ate it for a late lunch,and it was like a different sandwich!  spot on.  Thank you Hooley House. For making me feel like I matter."}
{"text":"Great environment to watch sports or generally drink. However, the food is hit or miss. I enjoyed my burger, but the chicken hunks had a weird aftertaste, and the specialty wings are large and fatty; not my ideal for good wings. Service on a Sunday afternoon was excellent though. Overall, I would return to watch sports, throw back some beers, and maybe have an appetizer."}
{"text":"Short walk from hotel good. Kentucky Bourbon Ale on tap good great bar staff good. Tried the Shepard  Pie. I cannot think of the words to describe how bad it was. Great bar staff graciously offered me another choice. Tried the Philly good god it was even worse well at least equally bad compared to the Shepards stuff. All food had a very frozen for a very long time taste. Enjoy the friendly staff at the bar for a drink. If you want food run Forest run."}
{"text":"I came here with the expectations that this would be a sort of chainey restaurant. I had a buy one get one free coupon and I'm on a budget, and this was nearby and open past 9pm on a sunday, so hooley house it is. What a pleasant surprise! Locally owned, with irish-ish options, they get a bit creative but not too far outside the box. Theres a big bar with some decent looking craft brew options too. And it seems like they're dabbling in the hand crafted cocktail pool, so I must try the next time we go (I only drank a soda this past time). Our waitresses were friendly and attentive, and I really liked the food (but I have a soft spot for bar food). We split some mozzarella sticks, I ordered the buffalo chicken mac and cheese, he got the irish boxty. Both decent dishes with huge portions. I like this place, its no frills, kid friendly, and they have a great looking patio. I have a feeling we'll be back."}
{"text":"The worst experience of my life!!! The food is horrible and the service is even worse !!"}
{"text":"Date/Time: Thursday 5pm -- 1st time visit  My reviews come with a caveat when warranted. The Hooley House is a place you'd go to get Irish food. So if you order non-Irish menu items, you might not be getting \"the full experience\". That said, if a restaurant only excels in their particularly themed items, they shouldn't have a four page, widely varied menu.   That out of the way, it was advertised Build Your Own 1.2 pound \"hooley burger\" as a happy hour special. So yeah, burgers are a good litmus test for any restaurant, so okay. I order a burger with bacon, mushrooms and onions. Pretty simple. Waitress comes back and says they're out of mushrooms. That soured me because I love mushrooms to an obsessive extent. Okay fine, slap an egg on it. Well, burger comes and egg is overcooked as in no runny yolk. The gooey yolk is the entire reason for putting egg on a burger. The meat had relatively no taste to it as if it were completely unseasoned before cooking and it was medium, not \"still mooing\" medium rare as I requested.   My companion had wings, the firecracker sauce. He said they were okay but as I've mentioned in other reviews, he pretty much eats anything so his reviews aren't quite as discerning.   As I initially wrote, maybe if I'd went here with a bunch of people to drink Irish beer and eat Irish food, I'd have had a better experience so Yelp readers, if that's what you're after, your mileage may vary.   Service was okay, though one waitress was in tight NIKE yoga pants which last I checked weren't really for work.  Also something funny that happened here - I flipped open the lid to the ketchup and without my even squeezing it, holding it upright, it starts squirting out and goes into my palm and all down my arm. I'm not sure if it was filled too fully or what, but I've never that that happen before, lol."}
{"text":"We visited Hooley on a Wednesday around 6 pm while the Indians were in the middle of winning Game 5 of the division series. I didn't think we'd get a table anywhere, but this place (although it was packed) is HUGE and we were greeted and seated immediately.  The first thing I noticed was the decorations. Someone went to a lot of trouble to make the place look extra Halloween-y (Halloweenie? Can I say that on Yelp?). It was really festive and fun and I very much enjoyed the little alcove we sat in. The seats were very comfortable and I felt like I was in someones house, just relaxing.   Great views of the TV from everywhere in the place and although it was crowded and loud, it wasn't deafening.  Our service was excellent. Very attentive server who checked on us regularly but didn't hassle us when we wanted to sit too long and watch the end of the game. The kitchen kept up with the rapid pace and servers were busy running but also adding to the excitement of the Tribe win. Pounding on the wall, chanting with us... they made it a really fun atmosphere. I'm so glad we picked Hooley to watch the game.  Our food was awesome. We started with the Irish Egg Rolls, which were about the best thing I've eaten all month. Corned beef, sauerkraut, and swiss cheese all rolled up and deep fried to perfect golden deliciousness. Served with a tangy 1000 Island sauce that was lip smacking. The pair was only $8.50 and was really quite enough for 4 people to share. The boyfriend really loved the Hooley Club sandwich and my Fish and Chips were cooked perfectly.  I can't wait to go back. Perhaps for Game 1 of the World Series??!!!"}
{"text":"Our group (8 in total) experience for a Sat lunch @11:30 was pretty good. Everyone liked their food. I had pulled pork and substituted fries for broccoli, and was given a pretty good amount of the veggie. Not always the case at other restaurants. We were especially happy with our server LINDSEY. Friendly and efficient ~ a good server seems to be hard to find these days and I wanted to send kudos her way. My only hiccup; I emailed and asked a question and no one ever followed up."}
{"text":"I've talked about their nacho's may times since visiting.  Alas, it was because I think they were the worst nacho's we've ever had.  Nacho's.  I mean, seriously...how can that even go wrong?  We were there with a group and as a drinking establishment, I think it's A-OK.  We were there and had appetizers only, which resulted in plenty of fried and previously frozen foods as well as the aforementioned nachos.    Not worth dinner, but go ahead and head over there for a game."}
