{"text":"Good ambiance, but they have a small menu. Food, alcohol and dessert choices are limited. They only have browny and cheesecake as dessert. And the foods' tastes are not very wonderful, they are kind of heavy."}
{"text":"First time visit to this place (Toronto tourist) and came in at 10pm as a group of 6. Servers were friendly, accommodating and fun!   - pricing is comparable to other izakayas  - tried the Taru Taru, ramen and chirashi and they were all delicious - fave part of the place is the decor and atmosphere"}
{"text":"Great!!!! More choice at dinner than lunch!! Would like to come back again"}
{"text":"Really enjoyed this place, especially the small plates/bar style and the upbeat ambiance. We ordered about 4 plates, but word of warning: the okonomiyaki is a pretty big portion for 2 people and will fill you right up! The candied salmon was great and came out piping hot.   I had a lychee mojito which didn't have much of a lychee flavor to it, but it was good anyway."}
{"text":"I took the chirashi. The bowl was smaller than what I had anticipated. But it was amazing. Everything in that bowl was delicious. The salmon had that yummy quality taste - not like the cheap salmons you would find in Japanese sushi buffet. Their eel was perfect tasted heavenly. I would definitely go back.this place is definitely better than many other places i have been in montreal so far! I just wished they made their portions just a bit bigger!"}
{"text":"We ordered three dishes. Ramen noodles were really mediocre. The noodles were too soft and seemed to be instant noodles. The sushi salad was good though with eel. The entree was fried chicken. 4 tiny pieces for 9 dollars. A bit pricy."}
{"text":"Really tasty food and pretty affordable. For 2 people, 1 beer and about 7 plates we paid about $70 CAD without tip.   The octopus and salmon skewers are so good, especially the octopus: smokey and sweet! The candied salmon was better the first time I went here but good nonetheless. I felt it was a bit more cooked as opposed to candied and glazed, compared to the first time.  Recommended as a good casual place to go to before going to the museums around Place-des-Arts."}
{"text":"My family and I were disappointed that we didn't get to try this place. We went in the restaurant and as soon as we got in they told us sorry but no children allowed. It was disappointing that we didn't know this before hand due to us walking about 15 minutes from the hotel to get to the restaurant."}
{"text":"I booked a reservation to Biiru while on vacation in Montreal and I was completely pleased with my experience.  The customer service was friendly, attentive and prompt.  The atmosphere was also fantastic.  The attention to detail in all the design pieces (I particularly loved the sake bottle lamps and the bird cage with paper cranes) was really well executed.  Watching the bartender take two guys through the process of a sake bomb was also fun to watch!  I only had one cocktail (the Shinobi) and the combination of sour tamarind and gin was refreshing, well-balanced and clever.  We sampled a handful of things from the menu- highlights were the fried chicken with scallions, gyoza and a salmon sashimi dish with a tasty dressing and an unexpected dried fruit (raisins?) that I'd never tried together with salmon before- so delicious!  Some great takes on Japanese favourites.  Would definitely recommend this place if you are looking for a great date location or a fun night out with friends!  I'll be back to try out the patio next time I'm in town and try a Sake Bomb!"}
{"text":"hello friends,  It's been a while I know, lots of drama going on behind the scenes, anyways. Maybe getting back to writing reveiws will be therapeutic for me so here goes...  We went here a few months back, they had just opened like the week before and we thought well it's always Kazu or Imadake, it's time we found a new izakaya to add variety, and so Biiru pops up...  We had no rsvp, but we got a table. Which was nice. We ordered a whole bunch of things, from ribs, shortrib, soba noodles, gyoza to okonomiyake, fried chicken and yakitori. The only thing we couldn't get was ramen, which they didn't have yet.  I told the waitress sarcastically, you expect me to come back for the ramen? I don't think so. But in the end I told her since the food was so good I would come back to check out the ramen.   The single best dish was the ribs, fall off the bones, juicy and tender, a little on the sweet side, but since we were four, I only had 2 pieces and the sweetness didn't get to me. The second best thing was the soba noodles which had some bacon bits and kimchi dressing which was easily the most original thing I've had this year.  The rest of the food was very good also, but nothing stood out like the ribs and the soba, we finished with a sake bomb and some japanese cheese cake. The place definitely has ambience. I still have not gone back to try the ramen yet but I will soon."}
{"text":"If your on the prowl for the best izakaya in Montreal look no further. This place will delight your palette from beginning to end. The genius minds behind the menu are constantly changing the menu with the seasons to reflect the best raw ingredients available. I've eaten some of the best things I've ever had at this restaurant. An absolute must if your in the area."}
{"text":"Go for quick drinks and snacks since they time your seating (1 hour? Even dinner time!!)  I'm mostly disappointed with the service we got. We were a group of 10, was never advised about the timed seating during reservation but only midway through, and all the staff could do was insist that the person who confirms our reservation did tell us. I understand you want to enforce your house rule, but what position does that put the client? At that point, I don't even see the point of us staying for the whole dinner, but we did. We rushed to order, we rushed to eat, we were rushed to pay (couldn't even pay separately as we asked at the beginning). That was the worst dining experience. We were good Samaritans and left your restaurant 10 mins before 8:30, your second service. I didn't see any groups waiting after our table, there was no lineup, there were even empty tables. That's unacceptable as a restaurant, in the service industry, to treat paying customers. It's a disgusting money-making gimmick."}
{"text":"We dropped by for a business lunch, maybe we ordered the wrong things, but I don't think I would go back again... Everything had way too much sauce. I'd like to give them 3 stars and maybe give them a 2nd chance with the dinner menu."}
{"text":"Cool little izakaya ,started with the wakame salad was really good then went for there ribs they were delicious, i highly suggest there cocktails it served in a vintage champagne glass looked a bit small but waitress explained that its still has the same alcohol then martini glasses, service was good and prices were really unexpensive wouldn't be surprised if they go up.  Will be Back   Mat!!"}
{"text":"One of the best restaurants experiences. We ordered almost everything on the menu and everything is amazing. Top two favorites was the salmon sashimi and the fried chicken.  Also some of the best cocktails I've ever had. Wish I could give more stars."}
{"text":"Ça faisait un bout de temps que j'avais cet endroit à l'il et j'y suis finalement allé avec un groupe pour l'anniversaire de deux amies. En gang, nous avons pris à peu près tout ce qu'il y avait sur le menu (j'exagère à peine) et avons partagé. Verdict : comment on dit \" délicieux \" en japonais ? J'y retournerais demain matin sans hésitation (quoique le soir, c'est mieux, pas sûr qu'ils sont ouverts le matin ;) ). Seul petit défaut, on est un peu tassés, les tables sont trop près les unes des autres. Mais bon, service impeccable, bouffe de première qualité, on ne se plaindra pas parce qu'il faut se coller un peu, quand même."}
{"text":"Fun place for a casual night out or after work drinks! I came here for poutine week but unfortunately they had sold out :(   I had a mushroom okonomyaki instead which was amazing on flavour and portion size. I was really happy with the vibe of the seating area which isn't particularly large but feels spacious. The decor verges on a spoof of itself with the coloured lantern, plastic japanese masks and music. Overall, the noise level of the restaurant is quite high so it can be hard to have a normal conversation without leaning into a table closely or yelling across.   In the summer I believe they have a patio out back. I would come back for drinks and a bite to eat but maybe not an overly long meal."}
{"text":"Everything we had that night was awesome, except for the salmon skewer which was a bit bland and dry, thus the 4 stars. Def worth a visit if you're in montreal!"}
{"text":"Overall, this restaurant was good, but I've been to better izakayas in Montreal. I found the portions a bit small compared to other places, so we had to order more than expected and my bill at the end made my heart skip a beat (actually, I think I can speak on behalf of everyone at the table). The decor is cool! The wall paintings are really nice and I like the use of the chalk in the bathroom. The music is a bit loud, but I have to say we were a big group and I was at the far end of the table. The atmosphere is otherwise calm, unlike Imadake and Kinka, but it depends what you're in the mood for.  To start off, I had the avocado cocktail... Let's just say I expected it to be way bigger for the price... I was disappointed by that, but I have to say it was good! For the food, if you're a big group, I would suggest breaking up into groups of 3-4 people to order, otherwise, it could get a bit difficult. Everything on skewers was really delicious (we had the eel, salmon and octopus). The fried chicken is a must as well: very tender and yummy with the yuzu sauce. I recommend the dish with watermelon, salmon, crispy noodles and ponzu sauce. It was really tasty; a good mix, really! The beef ribs and gyozas were REALLY good! However, I've had better ramen (not sure about the idea of putting cheese in it...). I found it to be a bit bland... there seemed to be something missing. What I was disappointed of most was the fact that they did not have any sort of japanese style dessert (I particularly love green tea based desserts and it's one of the first things I search for on an izakaya menu). We still decided to take a dessert and went for the Maltesers brownie, which was fantastic! Also, sake bombs are always fun ;) (but not as exciting as at Imadake, sorry!)"}
{"text":"i had the ribs, okonomiyaki, dumplings and driks. The ribs were really good but thats it, everything else were were bad, the dumplings were tastesless the okonomiyaki was the same, i went there hoping to find something like kazu with good drinks but i was really disappointed. Even the drinks were way to sweet and i couldnt taste the alcohol, service was ok but it was wayto expensive for what you get imadake is wayyyyy better that this place."}
{"text":"Nous sommes arrivées sans attente, ni réservation. Même si l'endroit semblait plein, nous avons eu une place rapidement, un service efficace et sympathique. Tous les plats se partagent bien à deux. Moment amusant."}
{"text":"I love this place! Nice quality. The menu doesn't have much variety which I don't mind because every plate is delicious."}
{"text":"Very, very good food - I had the salmon \"bonbons\" (spicy caramel flavor) and the chirashi sushi - very fresh fish.  Also had the \"godzilla brownie\" which was quite tasty.  Only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the amount of fish in the chirashi was pretty minimal - I'd almost recommend ordering an extra salmon sashimi and plopping it on top of the chirashi!  Oh, and great service too (I ate at the bar)."}
{"text":"The first night we came here they were full, so we made sure to get a reservation on Saturday night.   The food was great (small plates let you sample a selection).  We had the pork ribs (fall-off-the-bone yummy), the mushroom cabbage pancake (which actually tasted more  of fish, but still good), and a couple of skewers.  My drink was really tasty as well.   Since it started to pour halfway through our meal, we got to experience the patio and the inside restaurant, which were both pleasant in their own way!    The server was very helpful and good at making recommendations.  A great experience overall!"}
{"text":"We had a really great Japanese themed meal at Biiru last night. I'd highly recommend this place to anyone. Great value too. We didn't make a reservation, but they squeezed us in at the bar. The bar tender Alex was awesome! So much fun! We tried a lot of their fancy drinks and loved them all!! I also enjoyed the laser buttons in the washroom! Pew pew pew! We WILL be back. I want to try the whole menu!"}
{"text":"With the opening of Kazu and his huge popularity, Montreal's restaurant scene was bound to change. In the last years and probably the next ones too, izayakas (which translate to japanese bar) are going to be everywhere. And Biiru jumped on the occasion to open a new trendy and eclectic restaurant in an area where young profesionnals are always looking to have a good time and spend some cash on good drinks and good food. Yes the place is beautiful with high ceilings, good music and a what will look like a beautiful terrace in summer. But, when it comes to food, Biiru unfortunately does not  deliver. The seaweed salad was too citrusy and lack some flavour. The gyoza were just OK nothing to die for. And the chirazhi sushi that I had was lacking something..maybe some texture? Overall go for the vibe and the dexor if you are in the area but with the excellent selection of trendy and lively place in Montreal that offer good food at good price, your hard earned cash can do better in term of food."}
{"text":"Had the best salmon sashimi extremely flavors.. you dont need to put anything addtional sauce. love love love... also corn on the cob was amazing.. very different and unique taste.. will definitely eat this plc again. Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This is a great place! Very nice decor, great food, good ambience for an evening with co-workers or casual night out, and good customer service. I have come here many times, and I have 2 favourite waitresses; friendly, talkative and social. (I had a 3rd waitress one other time and her service was bad - not social, didn't know to at least make an effort to say 'Hi', couldn't speak Eng/Fre... well, could have been her first day as a waitress...ever.)  I recommend the fried chicken, candied salmon, ribs (beef + pork), mushroom pancake....and of course their specialty drinks!  Definitely a repeat customer, and I have introduced this place to all of my friends to which they have visited at least twice and are repeat customers too!    Remember to make reservations!!!  ... and cool bathrooms!"}
{"text":"I tried two yakitori options: chicken thighs and mochi bacon. Both were fantastically grilled and delicious - would definitely order again. The drinks were quite good too,and I want to give a special shout out to Gavin behind the bar who was super friendly, knowledgeable, and even made a custom drink for me based on flavor profiles. Finished off with the decadent Godzilla brownie."}
{"text":"Great Japanese inspired bar. Loved the cocktails. Every dish was unique in its own way. Wanted to try so much more but the Okiniomaki did the job!!! Share all your dishes and try as much as you can."}
{"text":"I've never really been adventurous enough to stop and eat at a restaurant without first researching it extensively on the web, but last night, I'm glad we did. After setting out to go to two separate Japanese restaurants and finding that they both weren't accepting any more clients, we were discouraged enough to go home, heat up some leftovers, and call it a night. However, on the way back, I looked up and saw some bright lanterns swinging above a patio - from there, we decided to reroute to biiru.   When we entered the restaurant, every table was full except one in the corner, conveniently a table for two. The outside deck was closed for the night (not sure why), which was a bit disappointing at first, but the immediately apparent trendy interior made up for it. Later, I found that even the washroom was cool. Ultimately, the decoration could be summed up as a mix of traditional and classic Japanese gaming culture. Key features included a huge wall mural, pac man neon wall pieces, and a neon lucky cat sign.    The service was pretty good considering how packed they were, and we ended up ordering 10-15 minutes after we first sat down. We got karaage; two plates of two skewers each, one of grilled eel and one of chicken thighs; and two house specials, shoyu ramen and the mushroom okonomiyaki. I didn't manage to get a picture of everything we ordered before we ate it all, but my favourites were the eel and okonomiyaki. Personally, I wouldn't order the ramen again as I wasn't a big fan of the pulled pork in the ramen and the flavour of the broth.  I can't believe I've never heard about this place before - I'll definitely be coming back soon!"}
{"text":"I like trying new isakaka because the portion are small. Go there with friends for drink and the ambiance. Dont hesitate to order many dish to share. That tofu and mushroom okonomiaki is delish. My friend love her pork sparerib, they look darn good! The service was slow but who care you are here to have a good time!"}
{"text":"The food was good and service was decent.   But I must say that we had a very bad experience there. I was sitting on one of their stools when the top of it broke off and I went crashing down on the floor. I banged my head, my hip, my elbow, and my shin.  I'm 45 years old so I'm lucky I didn't end up breaking anything.    The restaurant manager was super kind and helpful. They brought me an ice pack, did not charge for my dinner, and paid for my cab.    Here's the not-so-cool thing. The restaurant manager never once apologized for their faulty stool.  And after my husband and doctor friend REPEATEDLY told them to put away this stool and their other faulty stools that apparently were lined up against the wall, the manager refused to acknowledge them.  (My husband and doctor friend checked the other stools near us that's how they knew about there being more faulty stools.)  This place loses so many stars for the following two reasons:  1.  They never apologized.  This shows a serious lack of responsibility.   1.  There were many faulty stools so mine was not just a fluke.  This makes them negligent.    2.  The management never agreed to remove the faulty stools upon our request.  This shows their lack of good judgement .   Dine there at your own risk."}
{"text":"Amazing service all night and we were quickly seated even though we came in on a Friday Night on Poutine Week. Great music and venue. I loved the decorations in the place.   The food was price amazing and the portions were large for the amount. The Japanese style poutine was out of this world. As well their Godzilla Brownie too ! It was great I went with many friends so we split different items and shared.   It ended up being a cheap night. The only downfall I do not understand which bathroom was for women and which was for men.   I also highly recommend the sake bomb as you do it with friends and enjoy the night. They get you to count on Japanese to three and pound your fist on the table to make the shot drop in the glass."}
{"text":"Yes. It is quite delicious and a fun/lively atmosphere. The ribs are clearly a moment of divine inspiration. I got the ramen, which was good, albeit a bit unconventional. I'd probably not order it again. Looking forward to trying a few more things here, tho.  1 Star: Avoid the town in which this place is located just to be safe.   2 Star: With so many great places to choose from, why risk this one? 3 Star: I'll try it again or consume here in a pinch. 4 Star: I go here regularly if financially and/or calorically feasible. 5 Star: I look forward to taking my wife or friends here."}
{"text":"Good izakaya downtown, I enjoy it more during summer time for the terrace at the back after work. To me the food is not the best, it's fine, but there are better izakaya near Guy metro. The chirashi bowl and Gyoza were my favourite. Original cocktail list."}
{"text":"Loved that restaurant. It was definitely a discovery. When ordering, do consider that the portion of the dishes are small, so the idea is to try a couple of dishes and share if you are with someone.  Ask the waiter for advices if need be. I was lucky enough to have a very good waiter that gave us good suggestions. Specially the pink sake. Delicious. And do try the drinks."}
{"text":"Food from poor (fried chicken, gyoza) to meh to very good (the pork ribs and chicken yakitori).   The fried chicken arrived a minute after we ordered it. How is that possible? It tasted like one of those President's Choice readymades. Memories of Kyoto? The gyoza were dry and swimming in their own sauce. On the other hand the ribs were awesome.  Good prices. Friendly service. Terrace is a rare find in that neighbourhood."}
{"text":"Des mets de très grandes qualités,beaucoup de finesses. Un cadre sympa. Ce restaurant vaut vraiment le détour pour sa cuisine"}
{"text":"What a fun and trendy place to visit for dinner! Not sure if they are Imadake competitors or owned by the same person, but this place was awesome (maybe more awesome than Imadake even....).  Service was hands down, the FASTEST I've ever seen in the city (5 dishes out in less than 7 minutes!!!), and done with big smiles and good overall energy.  We decided to go for a few dishes so that we could sample everything and ended up with the following: 1. Salmon sashimi on watermelon - disappointing. Salmon tasted not fresh and didn't really work with the watermelon. 2/5 2. Fried chicken with black pepper mayo - pretty good..not too much breading and good portion size. 4/5 3. Pork ribs - amazing!!!! 5 or 6 large ribs with a very yummy sauce that was slightly sweet but not overpowering. 6/5 4. Japadog - Not a fan but hubby liked it. Interesting concept though! 3/5 5. Edamame   Then for dessert we went for the:  6. Kitkat brownie - holy amazingness. One of the best brownies I've ever had! 8/5 (haha) 7. Japanese cheesecake - not so good...weird texture and not too flavorful 1/5.  Overall, we were in and out in under an hour, and all the dishes above plus 2 glasses of wine were only $80, so super decent price for the quality of food presented!  I strongly encourage you to go and check it out and try to sample different items from the menu because they have a lot of interesting options! I will definitely be back!  Bon apetit!"}
{"text":"Absolutely loved this place! It's my new favorite izakaya. Food and service were impeccable."}
{"text":"Restaurant japonais qui est sur une rue moins passante.  Le restaurant est sombre et a une belle terrasse à l'arrière.  J'y ai été à 4 reprises, car c'est un restaurant original dans le coin du centre-ville, mais qui ressemble au Imadake et autres bars japonais en ville au niveau de l'ambiance.  La nourriture est bien. Le midi, j'aime bien le chirashi zushi qui est une assiette de riz servie avec du poisson frais et cru, comme au Japon. C'est un plat que j'ai mangé à Tokyo et qu'on ne retrouve pas souvent ici. On prend aussi les gyoza, soit des raviolis japonais, qui sont bonnes, sans être extraordinaires (moins bonne que Jatoba ou Renaissance).   Le soir, il y a le saumon bonbon qui est des petites bouchées de saumon laquées qui sont succulentes. De même que les assiettes de côtes levées de porc et de buf qui sont très bonnes. Le ramen était ordinaire, il y a des restos qui en font des meilleures comme misoya et le yokato yokobai. Le sashimi de saumon avec melon d'eau était original et bien. Le karaage était bien, un plat de poulet frit.   Une belle ambiance pour les 5a7 apres le travail."}
{"text":"Very enjoyable place but not authentic. More like Americanised Japanese food but the taste is great. The portions are small finger food style and range from $9-$14.  We took fried chicken with onion sauce ($9), great batter and tasted superb. The short ribs (~$12) were also delicious and very tender. We also took Salmon Candied ($9) which was warm and cooked to perfection. Their serving speed is really fast, food comes alnosti instantaneously.  Try their cocktails, mostly original recipes so you won't get them anywhere else. We tried Abacado (or something like that) which was an avocado blended cocktail, had mild spice tones but a great drink in my opinion. A cooler drink was the Oseno (or something like that) which had a blend of asian fruits (kiwi, guava and the likes). Enjoyed both the drinks.  It's better to make reservations beforehand.  All in all, great place but not a Japanese place. More like an American shack with japanese themes."}
{"text":"Wow! Initially it annoyed me how difficult it was to get a reservation here (we were finally able to book a table a week in advance and then 2hs before we got a call saying there were no tables and we would have to sit at the bar - which we accepted), but that didn't get in the way of enjoying how GREAT it was! It's mainly a small plates restaurant, so for 2 people you could order like 4 or 5 dishes and share. Every single one was AMAZING, creative, original and absolutely delicious! The cheese gyozas were to die for and I strongly recommend the signature dishes, both are amazing. Great cocktails as well! Hopefully it will get easier to find a table here as time goes by.....I definitely want to come back, but I'm not the type to wait in line for hours....."}
{"text":"This is a shot in the dark at Japanese food. A couple things hit: The karaage and the okonomiyaki were good - okonomiyaki with truffle oil, nice upgrade. The rest was blah or just plain wrong. Side of rice - wrong rice, too dry and too... sweet? Yes, too sweet. The Yakitori items were correct but seemed a bit old. Sadly, this is mostly a no from me and my Japanese wife. Hope it improves."}
{"text":"I've been here years ago when it just opened and went back again this year. The food just got better! The salmon tartare don is amazing as it has some crisps in it and very flavorful. The beef tataki and takoyaki are also very yummy. The okonomiyaki was mushroom based and the texture was odd.   Very nice place to chill with friends after a long day of work. It's always better to reserve as we had to sit in a tiny table since it was the only one available."}
{"text":"J'avoue que le principal mauvais point que je donne à ce lieu est le bruit extrême qui y règne... trop de musique forte, tue la musique forte.  Et c'est vraiment dommage (pour une personne comme moi qui y est sensible) car le lieu est agréable, tout comme les serveurs-ses, et propice aux retrouvailles entre amis. J'ai testé la poutine qui était à la carte pour la semaine de la poutine et je l'ai vraiment beaucoup aimé! Les associations étaient très bonnes et j'ai aimé le fait quelle soit dans un format non-bourratif car j'ai pu testé une entrée à partager qui était très bonne aussi. Mon cocktail était un peu trop sucré cependant..."}
{"text":"Really great! Definitely go to this place again. Better to reserve seats because it is very popular."}
{"text":"Had a really great time here with a friend last night. I rarely hang out downtown, so it was nice to have a tasty, trendy option in the middle of tourist/shopping/business land.  For the most part, the food and cocktails were excellent. Everything was easy to share and really yummy, except for the ramen, which was incredibly disappointing. The broth was just plain bland and lacked depth. It had a wonderful colour, but the taste just wasn't there. There are a few really good ramen places in town and I suggest going elsewhere to get that fix. We mentioned this to the server, who agreed with us and gave us shots to make up for it.   I highly recommend this place, it's fun, delicious and really friendly. A perfect spot if you're stuck downtown and want a drink and something to eat. Have the fried pork!"}
{"text":"Tout simplement incroyable comme spot !! Ce petit restaurant caché dans le centre ville est parfait !   J'ai honnetement mangé les meilleures dumpling de ma vie dans ce restaurant ! La terasse est super belle et le service est impeccable    Bref, c'est maintenant un de mes nouveau spot pref à mtl !!"}
{"text":"If you tried to find authentic Japanese food, this place might not be the right choice. But if you just want to have some drinks and chats after your work, I think that's what they are there for. Pork ribs might be the only thing I like, I mean who else would put goat cheese in their ramen??!! And also it's a bit overpriced, with the fact it cost me 9$ for a can beer and 11$ for a cocktail drink."}
{"text":"The food was good but the restaurant was very unaccommodating to allergies and food sensitivities. Someone in the group was not able to have rice or noodles so she asked if those could be replaced with vegetables in several dishes and he would not do it for any of the dishes... it was such a simple request :/  The service was very fast which was great cause we went during our lunch hour."}
{"text":"Une merveille....vous ne saurez que choisir tellement tout paraît délicieux.... Si vous êtes férus de cuisine japonaise....courrez y des maintenant!  La décoration et la lumière tamisée en font un endroit intimiste.....mais très fréquenté.... Si je pouvais j'irais Y manger tous les jours!  J'ai eu deux coups de coeur durant mon repas, l'un pour les cotes de buf qui sont d'une tendresse absolue et pour les deux desserts qui sont phénoménaux: brownie godailla et le marcha passion cake!"}
{"text":"Wait staff and food were exceptional. We had to wait for the couple who were meeting us and we were kindly sat and brought cocktails of our choice. The waiter was extremely courteous and provided us with an awesome selection of food. We ended up choosing the ramen to split, pork ribs, mushroom truffle pancake and a couple of drinks. Nothing fell short. We were so happy and full. My cocktail was the spirulina cocktail which I have not yet had but I love gin so I went for it. Loved it. Super delicate and looked great. Perfect for the meal. Pork ribs were well seasoned and extremely tender. The pancake was full of mushroom savory deliciousness. We all had a really great time. The biggest impression on us was that we had accidentally made a mistake during our order and our waiter handled the situation so exceptionally well :) I believe his name was Jonathan. The whole experience was great and set an awesome tone for the rest of the night !!"}
{"text":"I really did not like this restaurant. Its way too loud. I felt pressured to eat because the dishes kept coming so quickly. Last but not least it was so cold all I wanted to do was leave. So many other Japanese restaurants in montreal are better than that.   We ordered the gyoza which were not very tasty. How are ribs or corn in any way Japanese? The only decent dish was eda mame."}
{"text":"4 stars for the food & decor and 3 or so for the service. Asian fusion with not much Audi here so beware. There are lots of real sushi places in the neighborhood so if that's what you want for dinner don't come here. They have a nice outdoor area and cute lanterns throughout. We sat inside which was fine and the air conditioning was great. The hostess fit us in without a reservation - hard working girl all over the restaurant and she did a great job. It took a while for the waitress to notice us which started to get somewhat annoying but finally we got noticed. Lots of small plates versus big plates, and everything was excellent - pork ribs, pork gyoza, salmon sashimi (which I don't recall ordering at $15, but it was excellent with small bits of salmon, rice and sheets of seaweed), chirazu sushi (this was supposed robe the sushi, salmon and eel, but while it was tasty i found more tofu and veggies than sushi) and the candied salmon balls which were excellent but searing hot (ouch!). $95 tax and tip for 2 plus beer kind of expensive but a very good meal in a fun, eclectic place."}
{"text":"Really great atmosphere, excellent cocktails, small but interesting menu, but plenty of good options, pork spareribs, the spicy salmon bowl is a solid choice too Service was outstanding too, would definitely repeat"}
{"text":"Finally got a chance to try Biiru. I spied it back when it opened and thought the location was original and neat, tucked away on a small street that no one ever really uses anymore. The experience was pretty much as I was expecting, with one or two surprises thrown it. I would say my rating is more a 3.5/5 but since the service was good, I'm rounding up instead of down! First, the alcoholic pitcher they offer (forgot the name, but it's the only pitcher on their menu, $45) is very tasty, stronger than I expected them to make, (considering most Japanese places here in Montreal seem to prefer watered-down versions of drinks), but also a tad too expensive. Nevertheless, I would probably order it again haha. The chicken thigh yakitori were pretty tasty (sweet) but the accompanying tangy coleslaw (I believe it was made out of celeri rave/turnip) didn't do anything for the dish. I would still order it again, since there was a good amount of protein on each stick. The salmon bowl (I think the Taru Taru) was good and had all the requisite ingredients we expect in a raw salmon bowl. Unfortunately, in hindsight, it didn't stand out from any other salmon bowl you can get from Kazu, Imadake, Yokato, or any other Japanese, etc, and the portion was just too small for the price ($13). Now onto the ramen (Ramen 2.0, I think they call it). First, I do usually prefer the richness and saltiness of a tonkotsu based broth; for whatever reason, I find the milky texture of the fatty liquefied pork bones comforting (sorry if I just grossed someone out!). Here, I believe it is a shoyu broth- so lighter in texture, and chicken broth based. The broth was strong enough, and held its own against the ingredients. It came with pulled pork, which I now know is not going to be my first choice of topping, but that's just a personal preference. The cheese curds were fun, and actually seemed to belong in the dish, even if it's an odd choice! It would definitely overwhelm a richer broth, however. The egg was fine, but I prefer the ones from Schlouppe or Imadake &Yokato. They need to reduce the greens they put in the ramen. It was a veritable forest in there! (watercress if I remember correctly, and bean sprouts). Overall, I would order the ramen again (hold the greens!), and more yakitori if I went back. Would I go back, though? Only on a semi-full stomach. I had about $33 (before tax) worth of food, and left only maybe half full. I can think of a lot of places, Asian or other, where I could get a lot more bang for my buck and still have a fun ambiance. But yes, go for drinks, the lively atmosphere and some skewers!"}
{"text":"Really great japanese food.  Great service.  Very highly recommend."}
{"text":"My \"it\" place! Every thing on the menu is great! Service is great! NO wait time! (Well I go early so avoid the wait time) Also, the price is good. One down thing is... they don't? teach their customer how to eat some of the food... so i see many ppl eat Japanese food weird way... Yes.. the Biiru workers are not obligated? to teach but still.. if the customer is eating like \"oddly\" shouldn't they help? I understand the worker's side too but some other places they do help customers if they see them eat... oddly... almost half of my visit I spotted? ppl eating \"oddly\"... Overall... Biiru is my favorite place! food is amazing. ramen is the best of the best! better than all of mtl ramen places!"}
{"text":"Super endroit, très très bien décoré, avec beaucoup de cachet, dans une ambiance japonaise underground. Les plats de type tapas donnent tous envie de les essayer, et les drinks et cocktails sont assez variés et recherchés pour certains. Service excellent, aux petits soins. La poutine de la poutine week est vraiment excellente. Vous pourrez faire des \"sakés\" traditionnels en cognant fort sur la table tout en comptant jusqu'à trois en japonais, ou regarder les autres le faire.. ;) Bref, à essayer à tout prix!!"}
{"text":"Had the tasters menu with a large group. The range in the quality of the dishes was huge, from delicious to horrible and everything in between. Not a place which is pulling me to go back."}
{"text":"Just had a yummy meal at Biiru. The Raijin cocktail looked like a milkshake but it's actually acidic and quite refreshing. The tapas style small dishes to share are really tasty also. We had the ramen salad, the ribs, the salmon sashimi, the moshi skewer and the okonomiyaki. I would order them again without hesitation! Highly recommended!"}
{"text":"This place is so good, very welcoming. Dim lights, good service, the waiter would come by often to see how we're doing, didn't even need to call for him to give us more water ykno. Food was great too BTW, delicious and adorable.  We got the salmon salad dish(forgot what it's called) that was great! Definetly going back there again & Ofc I'd recommend this place"}
{"text":"I have tried a lot of Isakayas in Mtl and this one is definetly a favourite! Love the whole experience there! The ecclectic decor, the paintings, the bar, the lights! The waiter was really helpful, the food and the drinks were original and very tasty. Its a bit pricey, but I feel like theres a bit more research behind the plates! Another plus is the location! Right on St-Catherine street! If theres only one little tiny thing I disliked is the noise, it was a little bit loud there, but it worked out fine. Will go back!"}
{"text":"Wow, toute une découverte.  Ma copine et des amis me parlait de cet endroit depuis longtemps et je dois dire que je n'ai pas été déçu. Nous étions 5.  4 personnes (dont moi) avons pris un menu dégustation et l'autre à mangé végétalien (et selon elle, c'était excellent). Pour le menu dégustation, le serveur calcul 30 $ de plat par personnes et fait un menu à partir de nos suggestions et de son expérience. Ensuite, les plats à partager arrivent les uns à la suite des autres. TOUT,  mais absolument tout était bon.  Il y a autant de plats très viande (poulet frit, côtes levées) que des plats sans viandes tel que d'excellent et surprenant morceaux de melon d'eau dans une sauce piquante avec des jalapenos (miam !) ou des légumes marinés et grillés (ou sauté)...   Vraiment, j'ai adoré mon expérience au Biir?. Le seul bémol, c'est que le rythme de livraison des plats était assez rapide (un peu trop), mais j'imagine que l'on aurait demandé d'aller moins vite... En plus, le serveur est sympatique, ouvert aux questions et aux explications !!  Autre point positif : la décoration est très belle et original !"}
{"text":"This is definitely one of my favourite izakayas in MTL. I really enjoyed the lively ambiance, cool decor, the terrace, and of course the food and the drinks! The waiters were so helpful and they know the menu well. Some days they don't take reservations, but of course it's always good to call and check. Sit in the terrace if you can.   I had the pork ribs, which was probably one of the most famous dishes there, and they were delicious. The meet fell off the bones and the sauce made me lick my fingers (which I don't normally do, lol). The sweetness of the ribs paired well with my other dish, the salmon tartar, which was a bit on the spicy side. I absolutely loved the salmon tartar - it's delicious and fresh. It was on a bed of rice surrounded by small crunchy crispies and seaweed leaves. I tried the brownie dessert, but I wasn't too crazy about it. They only had 2 choices on the dessert section. I think I would skip the dessert in this place.   Lastly, the drink: I had the Abocado. Avocado cocktail? Yummy, light and refreshing, like nothing I've tried before (in a good way). Unlike many cocktails (which can taste similar to other cocktails), Abokado is new to my tongue and I loved it!   I will return to try more items!"}
{"text":"Well located, good vibe - izakaya style. Best to go there to share a few dishes and eat light, antipasti-style, and have one of their famous cocktails.  PROS / What I'd go back for: - Izakaya atmosphere which is essentially like an exotic happy hour - Great cocktails - especially the one with avocado - Small tasty plates to share - get some skewers or squid/calamari  CONS / Keep in mind: - Gets expensive fast if you're hungry - Can be hard to make a reservation - The food is good and appropriate for the style, but is not high-end"}
{"text":"This rating is lower than what I would give but for a one-time event only. They had a ramen poutine and it was so-so.  It had the ramen elements minus the ramen. If they played it better they could've gotten a 5 star from me but they used hash brown mini taters as the fries base. Perhaps they could've used thinly shredded potatoes to simulate ramen noodles and would've made it a more balanced dish. Otherwise their standard fare is pretty good and consistent--I've been there on 3 separate occasions.  A couple of the wait staff make me think trendy, hipster and they totally rock. It's a fun place to chill after work, I've yet to try sitting outside in their terrace in the summer!"}
{"text":"I had high expectations coming here. We ordered a variety of dishes and they were hit and miss. I was excited to see agadashi tofu on the menu but when it arrived it was very bland. The fried chicken was just ok. Not very juicy, just a step up from frozen chicken fingers. The drinks were delicious.  With the selection of upscale restaurants we have in the city it'll be a while before I come back here."}
{"text":"J'ai découvert ce bar japonais en venant essayer leur poutine dans le cadre de la poutine week. Leur revisite de la poutine était un véritable délice, tous les ingrédients étaient là avec les saveurs japonaises en plus, un vrai régal. Le cadre et les serveurs font aussi de lieu un incontournable."}
{"text":"We had a great time here for dinner with friends after work. We ordered a bunch of different items off the menu and they were all delicious! Also had sake bombs which was fun!"}
{"text":"Extremely tasty- many different flavours. Traditional choices with a new age spin !! Share plates are great for trying plenty of different choices on their menu. Ambiance is fantastic !"}
{"text":"BEWARE OF FOOD POISONING I ordered their chirashi which was the worst chirashi i've ever had in my life! The rice is definitely leftovers, rock hard! And the salmon sashimi was not fresh! I felt nausea right after and started having cramps. I have been dealing with severe diarrhea for four days since my visit."}
{"text":"Taken here by event sponsors, my companions and I expected  middling-quality \"Japanese food.\"  Instead we were treated to a 10-course omakase/chef's choice that went from amazing to out of this world. The salmon roe over rice, the final course had us cursing how much of the previous courses we had eaten.  I would absolutely return and would trust the chef implicitly to feed me.   Our only complaint is that, like so many restaurants these days, it has a high ceiling and is very loud, more so when it gets full. I'm all for a restaurant of animated talking, but they must turn down the music so people don't have to yell."}
{"text":"A word to the wise: if you're not a fan of Wasabi, do tell the waiters before you order the Chirashi you might have your eye on.   If you're looking for authenticity, you will only find pretentiousness, especially in the menu. They try so hard to tell you pokuribu (pork ribs) and shotoribu (short ribs) and Chikin (chicken) ramen but really that's just romanized Japanese.   Otherwise the food was decent."}
{"text":"Really good food. Me and the party of 5 shared plates and had great drinks. Enjoyed ourselves."}
{"text":"Where do I even start?  Great drinks, great ambiance, great staff, great food.  I don't have to say much because I was really impressed.   Although it can get noisy, I wouldn't really advise you to bring a date that is kinda quiet."}
{"text":"I just had dinner here with my fiancée. We had high expectations since it was rated decently and we weren't able to make reservations.   Service was fast but the food is salty and lacked originality. We ordered 5 dishes to share and only one impressed us - the Kamo Tataki. The duck was nothing we've tasted before for a duck dish so that gave our tastebuds a surprise and the apple salad complimented it very well.  The mushroom omelette was very greasy and half of it was burnt. I couldn't believe the chef would let that go out of kitchen. The short ribs was overdressed making it extremely salty. We sat there waiting for more water from all the sodium but no one came by to fill our glasses.  Trying it once is all I'd do, onto the next Izakaya venue."}
{"text":"Our bridal party was passing by in the area and quickly Yelped and found this spot. We were seated outside and I loved the decor, which depicted Japanese sumos and other characters along the walls. The ribs I got were extremely flavorful and needed rice to accompany it, while the ramen a friend ordered was extremely bland. The age tofu app was more sweet than I liked but I did like the fried chicken app and the drinks were all very unique and really good as well. I'd recommend this spot for drinks in the outdoor seating area to have with some snacks but would skip the food."}
{"text":"One of the best restaurant in town, service is fast, food is delicious....every ingredients are there to spend a great moment with the people you are with. The owners are always open to suggestion like the one I gave on their cheescake ;) Now go there, eat, drink and enjoy this fabulous moment."}
{"text":"This was a pretty good Japanese place, and I'm pretty picky about Japanese restaurants outside of Japan, having lived in the country for 5 years. The atmosphere was good and location convenient to downtown Montreal. Can be a bit on the pricey side, but otherwise, no complaints."}
{"text":"Love the food here!! Our waiter Jonathan was very friendly, helpful, and patient when we were deciding what to order. It's a bit pricey but it's well worth it!"}
{"text":"Super tasty salmon tartar. I'd probably skip the overly-hyped pork ribs. A bit on the heavy and greasy side. The sashimi bowl with eel was also yummy. I'd would try to avoid the lunch crowd."}
{"text":"I'd have to say probably one of my favourite restaurants in Mtl. You've probably driven past it without knowing that there was a tasty amazing gem inside. Perfect for a date (great sharing dishes) or a big dinner (even more sharing opportunities!). Amazing music, cozy yet fun atmosphere, delicious food. Went for my birthday dinner and everyone was so happy with the food and said they would all be coming back. Thanks Biiru for such a memorable experience!"}
{"text":"OUI ALLO! C'est l'heure du dîner, le restaurant est rempli mais contrairement à ce que disent beaucoup de reviews, c'est peu bruyant. La musique est juste assez forte pour qu'on l'entende en fond.  Service extra, c'est rapide même si la place est bondée, accueil chaleureux, la bouffe est excellente.   C'est vrai que le gérant (en tout cas, il semble gérer des commandes et des humains) est désagréable à souhait. Ca me m'a pas particulièrement affectée jusqu'à ce que je l'entende gueuler au téléphone et que je remarque son air désespéré. Mais non, pas question qu'il gâche mon repas!  Ma recommandation: les ramen. Choix simple, mais tellement délicieux. Vous allez vouloir vous en injecter tellement c'est bon.  Vous offrirez une tisane à la camomille au dude en colère de ma part!"}
{"text":"Drinks were good! Service was great! Food, I would have to say it's a 3.5 stars as I've had more tasting Japanese dishes elsewhere. The decor is unique and nice, that I must say. Price is little higher then the norm for what they are offering. I would come back to try their yakitori dishes if available."}
{"text":"Un petit japon au milieu du centre ville. Le décor de l'izakaya est top et la nourriture réconfortante. Le chirachi au saumon,  les gyoza et les côtes de boeuf que j'ai mangé étaient tous très bons même si j'ai une préférence pour kazu. Le resto vaut le détour"}
{"text":"Excellent cocktails, excellent staff, and OH MY GOD THE PORKRIBS...  Seriously, just get the ribs.  They are a beautiful stack of porky goodness that would make even a Jewish person lose their faith and dig in.  We also had some things from the robatta, all good.  The shumai were also a big win, and I would recommend them as a perfect starter, FOR THE RIBS (nom)."}
{"text":"Do not be fooled - this is not a Japanese restaurant per say, although several of the dishes boats Japanese names. A lot of the cuisine should be considered \"fusion\", rather than authentically Japanese.  The ambiance and decor are outstanding, with nice glass windows letting in natural light at lunch time, which is when I went.  Suika Sarrada (watermelon salad) was fresh with generous portions of salmon sashimi. It is the perfect summer dish.  P?kuribu (pork ribs) was very good, with a finger-licking good coating sauce. Presentation was A+, simple elegance.  Japadawg (Japanese hot-dog) was interesting and also very tasty.   Overall, this place works like for tapas, numerous small dishes. Go with a large group of friends to sample everything on their menu."}
{"text":"Déco sympa, service cool. L'emplacement est bon et je pense que la terrasse doit vraiment être profitable pendant l'été Les plats sont bons ou on l'air bon quand on les voit passer. Bonnes frites ! Nous avons aussi pris des cocktails. C'était assez sucré et peut être pas très fin au niveau du gout, pas très enthousiasmé sur cela. Les prix sont raisonnables Pour info il est possible de réserver ! Le seul point qui m'a dérangé et fait perdre une étoile c'est le bruit, vraiment trop bruyant à mon gout :( Au moins je connaîtrais un endroit pour manger dans le coin car c'est toujours compliqué de trouver quelque chose de qualité et non attrape touriste. A retester pendant l'été !"}
{"text":"When I worked near Place-des-Arts, I used to go every now and then for lunch. Their food is great, but I feel like it's a bit overpriced, especially for their small portions of appetizers."}
{"text":"I just went here for lunch and I really enjoyed it! Great food, great ambiance, and great service. I want to go back when it gets warmer to eat on the terrace. We were a large group and 6 of us decided to share several dishes which the waiter chose for us. Ended up pretty full for about $30 before tax and tip, so it's definitely a little pricier for lunch but about the same as other Japanese izakayas I've been to."}
{"text":"Great izakaya -- small plates with beer (and shochu, sake, etc).  I had karaage, ramen, and gyu tataki -- all Japanese classics -- and they were flawless.  Service is really good, too -- despite a busy restaurant, no delays.  Nice indoor and especially outdoor seating, great location downtown.  Would definitely return!"}
{"text":"Love the atmosphere, it's unique.  The food is sooo good but so pricey for the portions.  Overall love it, just gotta save up to afford he splurge personally. i recommend getting the brownie dessert to complete your meal, it'll fill you up like there's no tomorrow, it's so dense and delicious!"}
{"text":"Si vous n'y êtes jamais allé, arrêtez dès maintenant votre lecture et courrez-y! LES meilleurs dumplings que j'ai mangé de ma viiiie! C'tait succulent du début à la fin! On essayait de mettre nos tapas en ordre de satisfaction et nous avions que des numbers one!   Le concept est bien, à choisir environ 5 plats à partager si vous êtes deux (même 4 suffit pour les petits appétits!). Nous avons mangé les raviolis au porc, les ramens, les deux spécialités, le boeuf et le poulet Sakagee (je doute de mon ortographe ici). Bref, c'était tellement bon, on n'en pouvait plus de s'esclamer!  L'ambiance est génial, la serveuse était super, les bières étaient froides et la terrasse est superbe et donne vu sur la cathédrale sur ste-catherine (tsé veut dire!)  En plus, nous avons mangé BEAUCOUP trop (6 plats) et deux bières pis ça nous a coûté seulement 90$!!! UNE AUBAINE surtout en plein milieu de Ste-Catherine!!!"}
{"text":"I loveee this place! Every time I come the food is great and the atmosphere is wonderful. Both the inside and the outside are decorated in a cool way, you have wonderful graffiti and wall art as well as a really pretty terrace in the summer. The servers are really helpful and polite (and also cute), and I always try a different thing when I come here and end up being satisfied with my order.  The calamari, watermelon and caviar salad, and sashimi are some of my favourites there. All fresh and delish!  Also it's in a great area in Montreal! You're surrounded by other great restaurants if you can't make it in there (Escondite, Jatoba) and its just a walk away from both old port and uptown. So definitely come and check the place out and make a reservation to get a spot!"}
{"text":"Man, this place is so cool (but expensive)!!! It would be awesome to come back for celebratory drinks or quick tapas before heading off to an event. The atmosphere is lively and you can hear a mix of English and French (if you strained your ears to decipher the hodgepodge mess of words, of course).  You get seated quickly if you come earlier during the night, and the tables are all cramped together. You get a water jug of water but when you run out they don't refill it, which is unfortunate because I drink a crazy amount. For two people the waiters recommended us on getting 4-6 tapas, so we got a mix of fried and raw dishes!  The dishes are definitely Asian-style food with a twist. To be honest a lot of non-Asians frequent this place as opposed to Asians, so it's less authentic food but definitely super trendy and also delicious. The average cost for each dish would be ~$10, but it does fill you up when you finish the meal.  Biir? is a casual but modern restaurant that is great for pre- or post- party. You should definitely come by when you're feeling for an interesting new take on Asian food!"}
{"text":"like going to Biiru because you can eat well and it's affordable, the food is really good as well. Always reserve, especially during the weekend. They also have a vnery nice terrasse that they open during the summer."}
{"text":"Great food , super fresh,funky drink menu unique decor, very well priced. Loved this place"}
{"text":"This was a completely unique experience.  I was elated.  No other way to describe it except \"dope\".  The food, beyond excellent, the service exceptional and the atmosphere fun.  Great choice.  I was too busy eating to remember to take pictures.  About half way through each plate I said OH S**T the picture..."}
{"text":"We went there with friends without reservation, they manage to fit us in although the restaurant was almost full. So many choices so the waiter propose a discovery menu at 25$ per person, so good, so many good thinks. I will go back for sure!"}
{"text":"Awesome place. We had beef tataki, salmon tartar, gyoza, ramen noodle dried, salmon and mini octopus and avocado drink. Beef tataki is a must try and avocado drink is so good. Love the place would come again."}
{"text":"Not authentic, expensive for taste that is lacking. Went due to the hype at the beginning but didn't go back."}
{"text":"J'aime bien! Le Biiru est un petit bistro d'influence japonaise au cur de la rue Sainte-Catherine. Je ne dirais pas qu'il s'agit d'un véritable Isakawa, car les établissements de ce type au Japon sont plus abordables, mais l'ambiance est vraiment cool et le décor est unique. Le menu est limité mais la bouffe est excellente. Les petites brochettes sont succulentes, surtout celles à l'anguille. Je vous les recommande. J'irais même jusqu'à dire que j'ai gouté ici le meilleur Ramens de Montréal.   Mes reproches maintenant : 9.50$ pour une pinte de Saporo c'est très cher. La plupart des plats sont offerts sous l'agaçante formule demi-portion. C'est-à-dire payer le plein prix mais recevez une portion réduite. On vous incite donc à commander deux ou trois plats pour constituer un repas convenable, ce qui a pour effet final de gonfler votre facture.  Je déteste ce genre de resto et généralement, je les évite. Mais ici, puisque quelques plats sont offerts en portion régulières, dont le Ramens, alors je tolère. J'enlève tout de même une étoile."}
{"text":"We were a group of two wanting to try out Japanese on our trip to Montreal. We called the hotel ahead to confirm that they had vegetarian options before we headed over. They said yes and we walked over to the restaurant (we were staying in a hotel that was a few blocks away).  We were greeted immediately and were given a choice to either sit inside or outside (it is a small section that does have a roof). We decided that we preferred the outside section and we were seated immediately.   The hostess was very helpful and since this was our first time, he walked us through the drinks and food menu. We went for the sweet sake and for food we ordered a tomato salad, seaweed salad, Japanese veggie ravioli, fried tofu and mushroom pancakes. With the exception of the burnt taste of wild mushrooms on the pancakes (more a personal preference), the food was wonderful. Also, they are all small plates, so while it seems that we ordered a lot, the amount was perfect.  Also, the group that was seated outside in the order tables were all speaking to each other. They were all about to partake in a few rounds of a sake bomb. For those who don't know about it (we didn't at that time), you balance a sake shot glass on two chopsticks that have been placed on a beer glass. You are supposed to shout out inchi ni sam, sake bomb and bang the table. This makes the shot glass fall into the beer glass and then you drink the mixture immediately. We decided, what the heck, lets have some fun !! So there we were, our meal completely forgotten, doing sake bomb and listening to drinking songs of Quebec. Also, I loved the spirit of Montreal that day. The folks there, who seemed to be locals, understood that we were not from around and asked us where we were from. When we said that we were from California, they started singing \"Hotel California\" and welcomed us with such beauty. That was a night of good food, great company and group sake bombs !!  Also, as we paid our bill and were walking back to the hotel, we realized that the restaurant had not charged us for the sake bombs. We rushed back to pay for them. When we explained to them that they had forgotten to charge us, they were really nice and shooed us away saying that it was on the house !!"}
{"text":"A friendly place with a young crowd.   The Pork Ribs were amazing, and the portion was bigger than I expected.  The Fried Chicken  was very good and the Yakitori was really solid.  Fast service, a nice patio, and lots of happy people.   The beer was priced a little high, but we will be back"}
{"text":"Good food, tiny portions. The flavours are wonderful, intense, fruity, well-balanced - I just wish there were more! I ended up having to order a few dishes to feel full, and this place is a little more expensive than I would like for a multi-dish place!"}
{"text":"Artistic dishes wirh generous portions. Pretty wait staff who know their dishes and provide excellent service. Very friendly owner who likes to check in with his guests.   Fusion Japanese done right. Would blow many of the Japanese restaurants in the SF Bay Area out of the water. Dishes range from $8-15. The jazz music in the background work great with the Japanese art and the candlelight.   Open for 7 months, but I can see it'll be around for quite a long time.   Wish they had one in San Mateo. Maybe next year!"}
{"text":"A great spot to grab some lunch or dinner downtown - at last !  Good food, great flavours and a very cute terrace during the summer season. However, the prices are higher than our usual Izakayas. Also, I believe they have a very short wine list- better stick to tea and beers !"}
{"text":"Inspired Japan food. Good atmosphere! Drinks are awesome. You must try the cheese ravioli they are insane.  Reservation is kind of necessary."}
{"text":"Un super 4 étoiles pour le Biiru (le frère de l'Escondite d'ailleurs, excellent restaurant mexicain situé tout près du Biiru)! J'adore cet endroit. Je m'y étais rendue à l'occasion d'un souper d'équipe pour le travail et nous avions tous adoré nos plats. Ainsi, lorsqu'est venu le temps de choisir un resto au centre-ville pour un souper en tête à tête, j'ai sauté sur l'occasion pour répéter l'expérience. C'est cette 2e expérience que je vous partage. Toit d'abord, il faut absolument réserver. Peu importe le jour de la semaine et l'heure, c'est un must. Le resto ne contient pas beaucoup de places et il est très en demande. Nous avons débuté le repas avec des cocktails. Les noms m'échappent, mais je vous invite à demander conseil au serveur et à faire des découvertes. Pour ma part, les cocktails contiennent plusieurs ingrédients que je ne connais pas alors je trouve intéressant de goûter et découvrir. Ensuite, le choix des plats. Pas facile, je vous le dis tout de suite! On a le goût de goûter à tout, et tout est bon! Ce qui est intéressant toutefois c'est le fait que 2 à 3 plats par personne sont conseillés pour constituer un repas complet alors on a l'occasion de goûter à plusieurs choses. Pour notre part, nous avons opté pour les plats suivants: Tataki de boeuf - saveurs intéressantes, mais n'étant pas une grande fan de boeuf je n'ai pas été éblouie) Soupe ramen - Vraiment bonne. Bouillon ultra goûteux et que dire du fromage en grain qu'on retrouve à profusion, en plus du porc effiloché qu'on y retrouve (le plus tendre que j'ai mangé) !  Tartare de saumon - il vient dans un grand bol contenant du saumon, du riz, du tempura et de l'avocat. Les textures sont super intéressantes, mais les saveurs sont exceptionnelles. Je ne sais pas dans quoi marine le saumon mais il fond dans la bouche et est ultra concentré en saveurs. C'est un must ce plat.  Gyoza de porc - un classique! Rien à redire!  Niveau bouffe, c'est donc une note parfaite. J'enlève toutefois 1 étoile pour l'ambiance, un peu trop stressante à mon goût. Ça parle fort, notre table est littéralement collée à celle du voisin, le service est très rapide. Ce n'est pas l'endroit tout indiqué pour un rendez-vous romantique qui s'étirera sur de longues heures. Niveau prix, il nous en a coûté 77$ pour l'ensemble des cocktails et plats énumérés ci-haut, plus le pourboire. Je conseille ce resto et n'hésiterais pas à y retourner!"}
{"text":"Amazing vibe, awesome service. Very fun experience!  Delicious food! Interesting drinks!  Amazing atmosphere. Happy we visited."}
{"text":"Very good Izakaya. The Yuzu beer was excellent, and so was the fried chicken, beef tartare and salmon bonbon. The service was a bit slow, but the wait staff was nice and made very good recommendations.   A bit crowded, there was some confusion as to whether or not we could reserve ahead (their website said they don't take reservations for less than 6 people) but we were seated immediately and overall had a pleasant experience.   TL;DR: we left full and tipsy. So it was a good evening. I'd go back."}
{"text":"I booked this restaurant as a plan B since Imadake was fully booked for Saturday. I must say our group of 10ppl were not disappointed. This izayaka is a gem, tucked away in the corner street and all you see is a Japanese flag glowing. Decor is super edgy and artistic, nice ambience, tint more trendy than a bar. I just wish the music was a bit more toned down, I wanted to hear the waitress and the buzzing sounds of ppl chatting.   My Meal review:   1. Pork ribs - Omg mouth watering! Fall off the bone goodness, hint of sweetness where it's not overly done. 4.5/5   2. Bowl Chirashi Zushi - I was in heaven! Nice pieces of butter like salmon, nice flavors with the pickled cucumbers! Yum! I keep dreaming of it. 4.5/5   3. Yakitori - baby octopus, I was excited about this one because I'm such a seafood lover. This one I wasn't sure, I think the marinade might have made it to jelly like. I was expecting more of a char to the tentacles. Still very tasty. It was 3/5. I would have liked to see grilled squid instead!   4. Beef short ribs - I have a thing for fat and a bit if cartilage. This delicious meat was smoky and sweet. 4.5/5   5. Cheese ravioli - meh. Not my favorite. 1/5   6. Fried chicken - ohhhh crispy goodness!! Recommend you get this. Lightly battered. 4/5   That's my thoughts on the food. Oh FYI the drinks are very good! we agreed the food was an overall 4/5. I wish they had a bit more options with grilled food! That's what I want to eat with a beer.   Overall I would totally go back :)   Vana"}
{"text":"Service was quite bad on Friday evening even though the food was good. The staff tries too hard to kick people out of the restaurant so that more guests can get a table, but the way how they do it is just wrong: they literally pulled my dish away from the table even though I am not done with my food, that was really rude. We ordered the salmon sashimi (my fav), the mushroom pancake, the tuna poke, the beef tataki and the octopus balls, all of them are quite amazing. I would recommend people to avoid going there on Friday or weekend because it is crazily packed and the waiters are really not nice and patient, but at least the food is not bad."}
{"text":"The decor is a kind of traditional Japanese pictures mixed with a modern bistro vibe. Waiters were really nice, they explain the place, it's like tapas with Japanese food, Izakaya as they called it. Everything you order is to share.  We had beef tataki, a little spicy but delicious, salmons bonbons, that's salmon with a sweet soya sauce, ramen salad, a cold dishes with vegetables, mushroom okonomiyaki, the portion is big but it's good and mochi wrapped with bacon, to describe, it's rice cakes with a spicy sauce served with skewers.  For two people, the total amount was $60. I don't think that the service was slow, actually, it was quite fast.    Nevertheless, it's quite hard to make a reservation as you need to have a party of at least 6.  I would definitely go back, maybe with more people to try their other dishes, they've recommended me to order pork ribs but I have not tried yet."}
{"text":"If I could give this place 3.5 stars I definitely would but Yelp won't let me so there.  Biiru has a great vibe and both the outdoor patio and the restaurant interior are well designed. The big murals and the interesting lighting fixtures give it an artsy feel and the overall tone of the place is pretty cool which is rare for a downtown Montreal spot.  They have a nice little Isakaya style menu with food that's best for sharesies and a good choice of asian beers and cocktails.  Although the food itself didn't blow my mind, it's pretty solid overall and the general experience was quite fun.   This is a great spot for a small group of friends that wants something nice but casual. I'd say it's definitely worth trying out if you're downtown and looking for a place that is not packed with cheesy 9 to 5ers or tourists."}
{"text":"good ambiance.nice terrace in the back, cool decorations. service was slow. food: - agedashi tofu, not enough taste to it,and not soft tofu on the inside.even sushi buffets make it better than them  -mochi with bacon wrap. a signiture dish at the restaurant according to the menu. nothin special,just tasted bacon  -gyoza: LOL frozen bought dumplings,add a bit of sauce and some sesame and voila!  -candy salmon,nothing special.glazed on the out with a bit of sweetness and cook salmon in cube pieces.  the only descent thing was the mushroom and cabbage pancake,but over priced for 13 bux  if u want a place with a nice ambiance but mediocre food.go there.or else not recommended."}
{"text":"My girlfriend and I walked into to Biiru on a Friday night and the place was nearly packed. The hostess said she could squeeze us in until 8:45 a group reservation was to arrive, which gave us about 55 minutes. The atmosphere was a highlight, including interesting artwork, people doing a Sake Bombs and friendly wait staff who spoke English and French.  It would fun spot to go with friends to eat and order a couple bottles of Sake before a night out.  We ordered the 300ml Pink bottle of Sake. 10/10. Would buy again. For an app we had the soba, which to our delightful surprise was marinated in Korean sauces and Kimchi - definitely a nice choice. Onto the ramen; I had just eaten ramen the night before at a competitor and thoroughly enjoyed it, so I had high hopes. Their ramen included two kinds of pork, minced and a strip of pork, along with veg and an egg. In an interesting twist, they added poutine cheese, which I see as an interesting Quebec-meets-Japan experiment, and I respected the creativity. I wouldn't say the poutine cheese took away anything from the ramen, but it didn't really add anything either, flavor wise. Purists would probably not like it, though there is something to be said about a good poutine cheese and I just haven't quite figured out what that is yet.  I rank their ramen among the best ramens I've ever tasted, and certainly among the best in Montreal.  I'd definitely come back to try this place again, particularly before a night out to drink some sake bombs."}
{"text":"Many people in a limited space. It's a little noisy but may be good for ones who like to enjoy crowds. The food is OK and normal. Not bad but also not as good as we expected."}
{"text":"Great food and service. Comfortable venue. Will come back soon. The desert was really the most interesting ever. Nothing was bad except the Japanese mojito."}
{"text":"I frequently coerce new people to do our dinners here. Any yakitori for appetizer and I seriously suggest the Chirashi Zushi. I also suggest not agreeing to share it with anyone lest you want to face serious regret. If you like sweet drinks: Chinobi."}
{"text":"Stumbled upon this restaurant after craving Japanese food during vacation in Montreal and, man, this place did not disappoint! To clear things up, Biiru isn't an authentic Japanese restaurant, it's more of a \"fusion\" restaurant with a Japanese influence.  I didn't know I had to make a reservation in order to get a table, but the hostess sat us at the bar since all the tables were booked for the night. Flying in from California, I wasn't able to call and place a reservation so sitting at the bar was totally fine. After a couple minutes of looking at the menu, the bartender Alexander helped us choose the first couple of dishes and drinks. He was extremely helpful and my mom and I ordered the chicken thigh yakitori, beef and cheese yakitori, gyoza, and two cocktails for starter. The gyoza came out first and was very good! The chicken thigh yakitori was so tasty; the chicken was grilled perfectly and the sauce was delicious! The beef and cheese yakitori, on the other hand, was okay. We then ordered more chicken thighs and a bowl of sashimi (forgot what it was called).  As much as I loved the chicken thigh yakitori, I think I loved the drinks more. Since my mom and I sat at the bar, we watched Alexander make all the drinks in front of us. My mom ordered the Onsen while I ordered the Daruma and we both loved the drinks!! If you're looking for something refreshing, go for the Onsen! The Daruma (my personal favorite) had a very fragrant spice in the cocktail which I found very enjoyable!"}
{"text":"The place was packed and it looked very popular. There's a wait at the door before we're seated, and the waitress tells us that we have a time limit to eat because the table is booked at - so and so O'clock.   I'm seated at a little table and chairs touching chairs.. more like jackets touching jackets to the neighbors next to us and I always wonder about the fire and hazard regulations when I'm seated like this.   I was taken to this restaurant and was told it's a Japanese Tapas restaurant.  All the dishes that came left me a little confused. WHY?! cause they were all mixed Asian foods. Some were Korean, some were Chinese, some were Japanese.  At one point someone served us an interesting dish only to take it back soon after we took some pictures of it because it turns out we hadn't ordered it. Thank god they caught on to that! cause it looked good.   I loved the Modern Western Japanese twist Art that are on the walls, and the sleek decor. But I felt cramped in the busy and somewhat loud restaurant. After paying the bill and after leaving, I felt it was a little too over priced for food that wasn't that spectacularly good."}
{"text":"I'm not a big connoisseur in Japanese cuisine. I never cook it at home, and very rarely go out in Japanese restaurants. So when we decided to go to Biir? for dinner before going out to see a concert, I had very few expectations.  As we didn't have a reservation, we had to sit at the bar. Not the most comfortable bar stools. At least the food was very good. We took a selection of various plates and they were good. The fried chicken with the yuzu mayo was the least spectacular, but it was well executed. The absolute star was the Chirashi Zushi, a salad with salmon sashimi and eel. Absolutely fantastic.  The cocktails were very original and tasty. Bonus points for them.  Overall, I wouldn't make a detour to go there, but I would definitely consider it if I was in the area."}
{"text":"Hier soir nous sommes allés chez Biiru et nous avons été très bien reçu à la porte et par notre serveur. La nourriture était très bonne et les assiettes étaient très savoureuses et juste de la bonne grosseur. Un endroit chaleureux et un atmosphère détendu."}
{"text":"Great food, drinks and atmosphere! We sat at the bar and had great service. We ordered the gyoza's which tasted just like those in Japan. We also ordered the ramen noodles, fried chicken and the spicy salmon bowl. Dessert was also delicious, a rich dense brownie with ice cream and hazelnut crumble. Definitely recommend! Friday and Saturdays require reservations."}
{"text":"First place we had dinner while visiting and it didn't disappoint. Place is fun, neon signs, masks and art on wall. Waiter was really kool made some great food and drink reccomendations (get the pork ribs and Shinobi drink). He even gave us reccomendations for new years....Mentioned that they opened a Mexican restaurant nearby as well, on the list for the next visit!"}
{"text":"Une de mes places préférées en centre ville après le boulot, pour rejoindre des amis et partager des plats. Joli décor dépaysant, intime, belle terrasse, très bons cocktails. Délicieux tapas . Seul hic , un ou deux types de bouchées trop salées... mais facile à compenser avec un petit bol de riz à côté. Mon plat préféré là bas: le tartare de saumon épicé fondant croquant ...miam !"}
{"text":"the food here is solid. probably the best approximation to an izakaya that i can find in town. very hip and stylish locale too. only quibble is that the service is somewhat spotty (i.e., average is good - but there's more variance than a 5 star rating would allow). nonetheless, i plan to add this joint to my montreal go-to spots. thank you!  price is quite attractive as well."}
{"text":"5 star for the environment (i LOVE the wall painting) and 3 stars for the food!  For example, the ramen tastes amazing for your 1st bite but it is greasy due to the massive amount of cheese they put in...Even you order a bunch of dishes to share, you can only enjoy them if you don't eat more than 2-3 bites of each plate before you get \"bored\"/\"exhausted\" by the flavors."}
{"text":"J'ai bcp aimé la qualité de nos assiettes , bonne saveurs , assez d'ambiance entre amis et terrasse disponible."}
{"text":"Not open on Sunday despite indications on Yelp. It was a cold day in Montreal and I was downtown. It was a Sunday at 4:30pm. Before going home my wife asked me for a decent Asian restaurant. I opened Yelp and found this good reviewed Japanese restaurant opening at 5pm. So I decided to drive to there, fighting against the many roadworks on St Catherine. We managed to park close, but the restaurant was closed, chairs on the table, no opening hour on the door. What happened? I came back home, our stomachs empty."}
{"text":"La nourriture et le service sont excellents. Seul bémol, le gérant(?), bref je ne sais pas qui est cet homme, mais un peu bizarre. Du type nerveux, fait de \"drôles\" de commentaires et s'adresse rudement aux employés sans aucunes raison apparentes, car ces derniers sont vraiment l'essence de l'expérience dinatoire. Bref, mis à part cet individu, chapeau, la nourriture et l'expérience sont top. La fraîcheur des ingrédients est évidente, les plats sont savoureux, simple dans les saveurs, mais très bien assemblés et souvent surprenants.  C'est quand même un pub relativement cher à près de 40$ pour le lunch, incluant une consommation et le pourboire. Reste que l'expérience en valait le coût."}
