{"text":"Wonderful lunch spot.  Delicious chips and salsa.  Carmelo makes a tasty margarita! The specials are a great value.  I keep going back for more fajitas and Marias (chicken enchiladas in a creamy sauce)"}
{"text":"Tried this for a Saturday lunch and we were pleasantly surprised. Not your usual Mexican place
We ordered the Chile Verde Fajita Nachos and were blown away!  Not like any nacho we've ever had - it was great.  Crisp chips with a cheesey white sauce, tender-crisp veggies (peppers, onions, mushrooms, summer squash) and tender chicken. We split is - plenty for 2 for lunch.  Also had giant Margaritas which were very good and very reasonable.  Will definitely go back"}
{"text":"By far the best Mexican food in Charlotte! The prices are so reasonable and the portions are always on the more than you can eat in one sitting proportion. They make non menu listed items upon request with no issues. The best non menu item is the Tamale Deluxe plate. It comes with everything and cost next to nothing. You can dine in or eat outside, it is not formal and not fancy just simply awesomeness. See you there this evening!"}
{"text":"OMGosh ... I found this place with one of my gal pals. We both joined the Siskey Y across the street and wanted to try this place for lunch one day after a work out. Boy am I glad we did. 

Since then, I have been back over 6 times. Once, I even brought my best gal pal from Southern California, and she gave the place two-thumbs-up as well. The food is really well priced for lunch and it is just SOOOOOooooo so good. 

If you're there for lunch, flip the menu right over and only get something from the lunch selection. You can't beat the prices on the back of the menu. There are about 30 options, and they all are very filling. I always seem to get the same thing: the chicken fajitas with refried beans and rice. YUM! 

This dish comes with two hot tortillas as well as sour cream. The refried beans are so flavorful and the rice is perfect. The veggies medley that comes with the fajitas is perfectly cooked and the chicken is all breast meat. 

The wait staff is awesomely friendly and they make you feel at home. That is one of the many reasons I keep going back for lunch. It's just a fun place to go after a workout at the Y. 

If you want to go for dinner instead, they do offer cocktails and sangrias, as well as beer and wine. And the prices are not going to break the bank - this place is a win-win all around. 

Honestly, who would of thought that such a great find could be discovered in a strip mall next to a Harris Teeter market. I'm happy I found this place - I hope you find it soon too. You won't be sorry!

Enjoy."}
{"text":"Deceptive business practices.  Chile Verde offers a promotional card where you buy 6 lunches and then you get your next one free.  Sounds great, and we have used this promotional card feeling we would support a local business trying to increase their business and at the same time offering their customer base a reward for continued business.  Well it seems that the owner of this business does not know how to run a promotional campaign.  We usually go in every Sunday for lunch; we always order food items that are over the 6.50 value of the free lunch offer.  This Sunday Dec 4th 2011, we go in and decide to use the promotional card thinking that we would get the value of 6.50 off our total for each card used, but because we were using 2 cards, the owner decides that she would offer us 5.00 off each meal instead of the 6.50 value.  She contends that because we didn't order a lunch menu item that she would reduce the value of the free lunch.  I don't understand why using 2 cards would affect the outcome either.  I pay for my lunch guest and myself on 1 ticket, but we purchase 2 meals each and every time and get the cards punched each and every time, and we always pay way over the amount of the free value offered on the 7th meal.  It should not have anything to do with what type of meal ordered.  Instead, it should come down to whether the merchant is making a profit.  Needless to say, I will not patronize a business that handles their customers in this manner. This is what is wrong with businesses today, if you offer a promotional item...set a value to the promotional item and stand behind what you offer."}
{"text":"This is the best Mexican that I have eaten in Charlotte in quite some time.  It's not gourmet, but it is:  good food, great service, clean as a pin and a better atmosphere than you would expect in a restaurant beside Harris Teeter.  We will be going back!!!"}
{"text":"It's small but gets crowded quickly at dinner time. Food is great and the servers are friendly. Cheese dip and salsa are must haves."}
{"text":"Normally the service in a restaurant doesn't matter much to me, but this place has the friendliest waitstaff there is! Every time I've been, whether with my cousins' kids, mother in-law, or on a date with my wife, the folks serving us have been so welcoming, helpful, and happy. The enchiladas verdes are amazing and it's hard not to order them every time I go. This place isn't upscale, but it doesn't need to be. And, if you order anything that's not a traditional Mexican or TexMex dish (like a grilled chicken salad, for some reason), you'll regret it. But if you're down for some fantastic Mexican food with outstanding service in a very casual atmosphere, this is the place for you!"}
{"text":"In the past I would have given this place 4-5 stars, but last night was a bit of a let down. 

My oldest sister used to live across the street from the shopping center Chile Verde is in and her old neighbors gave us the recommendation. We had tried it out and it was great, prices were super reasonable, service was good, food was great. It was like that almost every time we went or got take out except for one weird take out experience where the service was bad and kind of dumb. 

So last night we were in this part of town and decided to come here, plus we had an $8 off coupon from those City Pass books. When we walked in there were only about 4 tables occupied and no staff to be seen. Finally someone came running out and said they'd be right with us. So he took a takeout order and then sat us. Then he brought chips and salsa and then menus. 

So after sitting a few minutes our actual server came by and took our drink order, and then ran around and did everything else but get our drinks. I watched him pick up and close out checks from tables that left, refill drinks for other tables, take orders, etc. Just didn't seem to know how to prioritize. 

Side note, I don't want to sound overly picky here but I did serve for many years in all types of restaurants and handled many more tables at once and so I just felt he really was slacking. Okay side bar over. 

We eventually get our drinks and put in our order. I always get the same, shrimp fajitas because they come loaded with sauteed onions, green peppers, mushrooms and squash. So we didn't wait too long before my skillet comes out, but that's it just the skillet of food and no tortillas or other accompaniments and nobody else got anything.

So there I sit with a plate of food and nothing to do with it, my sister suggested covering it up so it didn't get too cold because there really was a wait from when the food got dropped till he came back again for me to ask for the tortillas.  He dropped all the other stuff off 1st before I finally recieved them.  He also mentioned the cooks were making rice and he'd bring it out soon.  That took another 10 minutes or so before everyone received it.

My fajitas were good but I was already annoyed.  My sisters dish was too spicy for her which was not noted on the menu as other dishes were, but luckily she was able to switch with her husband.  And the kids enjoyed their burrito and quesadilla.

Since big sis is no longer in the area I guess I won't have to worry about coming here and being let down again anytime soon!"}
{"text":"After a single visit, I'll give them three stars. 

The wife had the shrimp cocktail, and was overwhelmed at the amount of shrimp within (I don't eat shrimp, so it wasn't as if she could share). If you like shrimp cocktail, I guess the word is to come hungry and you won't be disappointed.

She had the eponymous Chile Verde, and I had a combo platter. It was good, not great--I'll admit, as refugees from Southern California, our sights might be a little high--but it was probably the best we've had in the last three years of living in Charlotte.

Service was good, folks were friendly, parking a breeze.

I know we'll definitely go back. Maybe a fourth star will be awarded upon that meal."}
{"text":"I was very pleased with this find.  It is located in a strip mall, next door to a Harris Teeter.  We had heard about it from some of our neighbors and decided to give the place a try.  As soon as we walked in the door someone came right up to us with a big smile and sat us down.

The chips are homemade and came out a perfect combination of crispy, salty and warm.  The salsa was good, but the fresh made guacamole was a hit. I tried a dish called Choripollo, it's white meat chicken and Mexican sausage (which was surprisingly sweet instead of spicy) in a white cheese sauce served with refried beans, a nice salad with guacamole dressing, and  some warm tortillas. I absolutely loved it.  There was so much food that I had plenty of leftovers for lunch the next day.  I ordered a mojito and it was made with fresh spearmint, perfect! Excellent meal at a very reasonable price. 

Service was great, the staff is very friendly and from watching them interact with the other customers I could see that there were many regulars who they knew by name.

They have a very extensive lunch menu at very affordable prices.  I plan to return in the near future to try one of their combos."}
{"text":"Went for a late lunch after shopping. Service was good; food was ok."}
{"text":"We have been going to this place since it opened and we love it. The menu is good and they will bend over backward to accomodate you. It is not fancy but it is good, the portions are big and the service is friendly. We live close by, but we still have to drive so we could go anywhere. When they first opened my husband asked for Scotch which they didn't have, the next time we went int hey had his Chivas and he is happy.Also the food is always tasty, not just a protein thrown in sauce and served . This food is flavorful and well spiced."}
