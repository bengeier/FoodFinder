{"text":"My family and I have been coming here since day 1. We have always felt welcome and the staff has always been friendly. One time my daughter lost her sunglasses and the staff searched everywhere, even in the big dumpster. The staff member that jumped in the dumpster looked through bags of trash and found her sunglasses and made her very happy. The coffee and food have always been awesome and the few times we have had issues, they have been resolved quickly. It has also been great getting to know the owners and staff over the years and their willingness to listen to the wants/needs of their customers. I am super happy Higher Grounds is here and offers Gilbert residents a high quality product. I applaud the owners for their continuous desire to provide a wonderful all around coffee/dining experience. My family and I will continue to support this local business and wish them continued success."}
{"text":"Saw the reviews and they all looked great. Unfortunately the wait for just a basic breakfast was over 25 min. I'm guessing that based on reviews that this was a one time event but still happened. For was good."}
{"text":"This place is really good! I came here for the first time and got an iced coffee and their BLTAA. The coffee was so good and the sandwich was amazing too! It came with a side of fresh roasted vegetables. I can't wait to try more things on the menu!"}
{"text":"Like the flavor of the espresso; nice change of pace vs *bucks. Big selection of coffee syrups. Pastries are really good & good selection. They also have a wide variety of cafe breakfast & lunch choices - haven't tried any yet so can't rate the food though. 
Also, on a hot day try the ice toddy with your favorite syrup, it's a great way to go!"}
{"text":"A friend and I decided to try a new coffee spot this morning and found HG. The coffee tasted fresh and the breakfast looked pretty good! The place was busy so that's always a good sign and the guy taking orders was helpful with helping is pick what we want. The orange infused water was a great touch as well. We will be back again when we are in the area :) thanks HG!"}
{"text":"Great coffee, food, baked goods, breakfast, and lunch!!!! Great atmosphere and friendly staff!!"}
{"text":"This Coffee Shop is one of the best gems in Gilbert. Meet with friends to catch up and share some great food and don't forget you can take a piece of the place with you by purchasing some of their coffee beans! 

The Gilbert home town feel is definitely experienced here.."}
{"text":"I visited Fig Roastery and was plesantly sorprised..great find. Friendly staff. I ordered the French Canadian breakfast sandwich, delicious. Coffee is the best I have had so far. Will come back to try the French Toast.."}
{"text":"I visited this coffee house and cafe 2 weeks ago with a group of women.  On a Saturday morning at 9:30.  I ordered a medium Mocha, $3.50.  It took a long time to receive the coffee, about 10-12 minutes.  I stood off to the side as they didn't offer to bring it to me if I sat down or asked for my name, so I wasn't sure if I should have sat or not.  They have about 3 or 4 small tables outside by the entrance (none were occupied) and about 8-9 tables inside, which about 7 of them were occupied.  It's fairly small inside. They offer a large breakfast menu, lunch too.  Most everyone in there had breakfast items.  There were 3 staff members working behind the counter making drinks.  They also have three tables outside behind their building, which is where I sat with my friends.  They both ordered breakfast and seemed to enjoy it.  We were there two hours, so when we were leaving they were starting to serve lunch.  As we left, it was still busy inside.  Overall, I was pleased with the experience.  Next time I will try the food.  I gave it three stars because the service could have been a little better and coffee should have come out a little bit quicker."}
{"text":"Just grabbed a quick Americano and coffee cake. Coffee was great, cake was moist and sweet. Very friendly staff."}
{"text":"I need to cater a meeting event for 30 people and wanted a locally owned company to do so. I have been here several times in the past with my family for breakfast, lunch and coffee with great results. After contacting Dani the manager late the night before after they where closed her and her crew came through and had the catering set up and ready the next day on site by 1030AM. All I can say is Awesome!! Thank you so much for making my meeting a big hit!!!"}
{"text":"The iced chai  tasted too much out of the box and watery. The French toast was good but nothing outstanding."}
{"text":"Great coffee and good food. I tried the iced caramel macchiato and had the breakfast platter. Simple breakfast was well done just needed some country potatoes or hash browns to make this breakfast perfect. On a technicality, I'd recommend soft butter for the toast. Just a pet peeve of mine."}
{"text":"Nice local business.  Really cool coffee bean roaster - would like to see it on action.  Staff friendly, service good, breakfast croissant delicious, and good joe.  Check it out - hope they make it!"}
{"text":"The actual best kept secret in Gilbert. This place is pretty hidden, but don't let that stop you. As a barista, I can confidently say that HG has the highest quality specialty coffee in this part of the valley. Not to mention, the nicest employees and a completely relaxed environment. 5 stars for Higher Grounds!"}
{"text":"I came here specifically for a cold brew coffee. Not many places around offer cold brew so I was pumped when I found it. At first glance I did not see the usually large cold brew machine but figured it may be in the back. I went ahead and ordered and was given my coffee with a lot of ice and the barista called \"iced coffee\". Upon tasting it I decided there must have been a mistake so I asked if it was cold brew. The barista said yes, then I asked if I could please have it with no ice. He agreed and immediately made another which was awesome. However I saw him reach into the fridge and pour me a coffee from a pitcher. This should not be considered \"cold brew\" as this was just a regular coffee chilled in the fridge. 

I may be a coffee snob but there is a huge difference between chilled coffee and cold brew. I was so sad :( 

On another note, the place was very cute with an extensive menu and a very attentive staff."}
{"text":"So happy to have a local coffee shop! Excellent customer service and yummy fresh roasted coffee. May get 5 stars once I try the food but 4 for now the coffee since it's a coffee house. 

New breakfast menu looks wonderful though I have yet to try the food. I look forward to returning often to patronize a local entrepreneur!"}
{"text":"This coffee shop is located in Gilbert AZ.  It boasts the perfect mix of rustic and industrial decor.  For non-dairy consumers they offer a variety of nut based milks as well as hemp milk. 
This coffee shop also offers a large food menu.  Their breakfast is awesome.  You'd definitely wan to give them a try!"}
{"text":"I enjoy this coffee house greatly. Great coffee, made on site pasteries, clean, great atmosphere. Just ONE thing that makes me leave or not stay long to work or study: when the owner is not there, the employees crank the music SO LOUD, and the music they play can be awful. The speakers are not meant to be that loud, the sound is off and terrible. Once again, this is only when the owner is not working. I'm  assuming the volume is due to the employees not being able to hear their music over the kitchen and other machines going. 
None the less, it definitely makes people wanna get outta there!"}
{"text":"Great coffee selection with plenty of dairy and sugar free options.  Very impressed."}
{"text":"Very good coffee and pretty good food. Love to hang out with some good coffee and just chill. Nice place"}
{"text":"Being that this place is brand new, I didn't want to slam them with a one star.  I ordered two iced vanilla lattes and got two extremely milky drinks with barely any espresso in them.  My husband insists there wasn't any!  Not good.  We tried the cinnamon rolls and they were delicious.  Definitely big enough to share.  Ok customer service.  Since my order was to go and there was a constant stream of dine in orders, mine got lost in the shuffle but it wasn't too long of a wait.  Be prepared to taste your coffee before you leave if ordering to go.  Has a large menu of both eats and drinks so I would be willing to give it another try."}
{"text":"Love this place. Went here for the first time today. I did stand in line for about 5 minutes but I was in no hurry.  I had a caramel macchiato and bagel.  They were both quite delicious. The atmosphere was very laid back. The entire staff was very friendly and attentive.  I will definitely be telling my friends about this place."}
{"text":"Lunch with a dear friend is always wonderful, but lunch with a dear friend at Higher Grounds Roastery and Cafe is downright incredible! My friend and I enjoyed the Thursday salad special, a caprese salad with chicken. I'm still thinking about that salad, and I'm not one to dwell on salad greens. The iced chai latte was refreshing and flavorful. The only thing I can think of to suggest for improvement is to invest in sturdier tables. Our table was a little on the rickety side, however the friendly service and the high quality of the food and drinks more than made up for it. I will definitely go back! I want to try the prickly pear salad next time!"}
{"text":"Love love love. I will definitely be back. It's quiet, cute, and service was very quick. Had a simple breakfast...eggs, english muffin, & fruit. After I ordered my Americano I saw the employee's \"favorites\" board. Now I have to go back for a lavender + honey latte!"}
{"text":"A very cozy spot (despite being in a soulless shopping mall) with excellent coffee and great food.  Try the 24-hour cold press iced coffee!  Had the French Canadian breakfast sandwich, it was excellent."}
{"text":"Fantastic coffee and tea...lots of choices.  In addition to these, they have a very nice breakfast menu.  I think the provide lunch as well, but we were there only for breakfast.  The breakfast quesadilla is a must.  It was perfect and a bit unique, which I enjoy."}
{"text":"Tried this place for the first time today before heading over to Sprouts. I tried to order the Mocha blended coffee but they were out so I ordered the dark roast House blend coffee in the meantime. It was a very good price $2.16 with tax, for a large and I really enjoyed the flavor. I will definitely visit again."}
{"text":"Gist: I'm not a coffee snob by any means but this is a solid place to get some smooth coffee 


Headed over there for some early morning Joe.  It's a sweet little place furnished in that neo modern furniture style with plenty of tables to study at. I got a mocha and it was perfectly balanced smooth and sweet. My cousin got coffee there earlier and loved it as well.  I didn't get breakfast over there but they had a huge array of breakfast burritos, breakfast sandwiches and platters; I will need to hit that next time because it sounds scrumptious."}
{"text":"Great!
Just had breakfast here- biscuits and gravy, tostada omelette and French toast. Everything was well done and tasted great. I am definitely coming back. 

The iced coffee here is the best I've ever had. I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"I was looking for a new place to try, stumbled across this and what a gem. From the staff to the coffee to the breakfast.  It was awesome.  More than I expected. My son had eggs and bacon..cooked to perfection. I had the French Toast which was perfectly devine....hidden secret...stop by as you'll be amazed"}
{"text":"This is my new \"home\" coffee shop. I'm a bit of a coffee snob and their espresso roast is smooth enough to drink straight ..which makes me happy. Also, they have really up their game with the food. The Englishman sandwich comes on a home made English muffin with good sausage...it's so satisfying."}
{"text":"Try the sweet potato muffin (warmed up).  Quiet, calm atmosphere. Friendly staff. Locally owned."}
{"text":"Great coffee.  Amazing blueberry coffee cake french toast. However they have to recognize that in Gilbert you are going to have customers with kids.  High chairs are great for keeping them corralled"}
{"text":"Great place for morning cup of joe and breakfast.  House blend is bold with hints of chocolate.  Plenty of drink options.

Breakfast menu is fairly large and high quality.

One of my favorite breakfast/coffee joints."}
{"text":"We stopped by for breakfast and were amazed at the quality of food and service.  Our food was not only delectable, but it was affordable and quick! The servers kind and quick to help. Thank you!!"}
{"text":"Adorable, calming atmosphere with a small front and back outside patio.  
The employees are very friendly! 
Great coffee and good food! Well priced, not too crazy. I will definitely be back and will be bringing friends next time :)"}
{"text":"Definitely a different kind of coffee shop. They roast their own beans, make unique blends (hot and cold), have a quaint sitting area with a large centerpiece style table, light music, and fun staff!!  They put a real spin on their shop with delicious food (looks pretty too) and I heard they offer catering. To top it off, they support the community, especially the artist community which we love!!"}
{"text":"the experience i had with this place was ehh ok. There coffee is different, which i always love to try new things. the first time walking in i wanted a blended drink with coffee. The baristas there didnt seem to know what i was talking about. i wanted something with coffee. I got the white chocolate with toddy. Then the second time i went in i just got a regular iced latte and put the pumps of sugar in myself. Everytime i go there the bar area with the sugars and stuff is always a mess, and the girls that work there arent very nice. The pricing is reasonable i just wish they were more upbeat like the people at starbucks."}
{"text":"Higher Ground - great tasting coffee and some of our favorite breakfast dishes. I always try a new selection every time we go while my husband always orders the breakfast burrito. Great service too!"}
{"text":"Great coffee and food! I highly recommend this coffee shop! My husband gets chai blended and I get hot mocha or iced caramel macchiato so yummy!!"}
{"text":"Not really sure what sets this place apart.  I love coffee, so when I find smaller coffee shops there should be a reason I chose them over any other place.  I'm looking for really good coffee, or really good food, etc.  

While their coffee menu has things like Cafe Au Lait, I don't think it's anything special.  Even though I don't think places like Starbucks are really good, at least you know what you're getting every time.  

When I left this place, I couldn't think of a reason I would go back except for it might be right down the street from where you live."}
{"text":"Good coffee! Like coming here bc it gives the local coffee feel! Girls are always friendly and coffee is always just what I need when I'm having a long day! It's a little pricey but you get what you pay for! I haven't tried the food so can't comment on that but it looks good!"}
{"text":"So happy I came across this cool laid back cafe.  I love to support local buissnesses and this I will be a regular at.  Great prices and have healthy, veggie options.  I built my own egg white breakfast burrito.  The herb tortilla was really good!  Only little bummer was they forgot one of the veggies inside but I didn't even notice till the end because it was that good.  Give it a try!"}
{"text":"Locally owned coffee/breakfast joint. Love the iced toddy. The coffee is cold brewed and it puts Starby's to shame. *hint- add sugar free vanilla and it's even better* Since we moved away from Gilbert, we don't frequent here as often unless we visit family in the area. I definitely miss their rotating weekend breakfast specials. They manage to come up with something new and 'licious every time.

I read a few reviews that griped about the prices? I think the prices are reasonable and reflect the quality and freshness that I expect when dining out. It's no worse than Village Inn and the food is way better. Also, bearing in mind this is a small local business I don't mind paying these prices to keep these honest folks around and in business. 

Keep it up!"}
{"text":"Mellow place. They have a top of the line roaster and multiple bean offerings. I had a juicy French dip with a side of veggies and some free lemon strawberry water. All was wonderful. This AM I ground and French pressed the Costa Rican beans I bought and the are done right. You will enjoy this place."}
{"text":"The food is not good at all, may want to spend your $25.00 at ihop. They should stick to just serving coffee . Went this Saturday early morning to get breakfast before work with my boyfriend. I really wanted some fluffy warm pancakes!!!! I wanted a good breakfast and didn't want the usually Ihop. (No offense to Ihop) We usually don't go out to eat but when we do we want it to be able to enjoy the food and ourselves. When we got there I was a bit confused if we need to sit down and order or if we needed to go to the counter. We decided to walk to the counter. They have the menus in the counter they have one kind of plain pancakes. My boyfriend ordered pancakes with bacon, large orange juice and I order the pancakes with a side of fruit and large hot chocolate. 
When the food came out the pancakes with super thin and chewy. I took a few more bites and couldn't take it anymore. It was not the fluffy pancakes I expected. I went up to the counter and  informed them the pancakes were chewy and not good. I learned they don't make there food there. I was eating warmed up food. I didn't want to be a pest so I exchanged it for the French toast. And again it was chewy. Food service is not their strength!!!"}
{"text":"Perfect for breakfast, lunch, or a coffee anytime. 

I got a tuna croissant, so good and fresh! I want to try the breakfast next time I'm here, it all sounded delicious. Coffee is also very good here. I'll be back to study (it was nice and quiet today, but it's a Thursday morning, so who knows about weekends)"}
{"text":"Stopped in for iced coffee.  YUM. Only four stars because the sign looks like a rooster and I walked by 3 times b4 I found it. Its kinda funny but also a little annoying.  Service was fast and friendly.  Like the iced brew a lot even without milk:)"}
{"text":"Honestly pretty good :) staff is welcoming and the place is always clean. It's the cutest shop to stop in and relax."}
{"text":"I have never had a bad experience here! Their muffins are all delicious, their salads are to die for and their iced coffee is purely addicting! The staff are all so friendly and the service is fast which sure helps when you are on your way to work!"}
{"text":"I was really excited to try this place but was disappointed once I finally did. 

We ordered the old fashioned oatmeal and french toast with a side of fruit. All around the food was just \"OK\"-- the side of fruit was a few blueberries, two graphed, and a cup of musk melon. If I came again, I would skip food here all together. 

I ordered a butternut squash mango smoothie, which they were out of so I followed up with an iced Almond flavored Latte--I was brought what looked like a curdled milk latte and took it back and was later informed it was made with almond milk instead of almond flavor and it was made again. The correct latte I received was super bitter, as if the shots sat for too long before being poured in. 

My husband had a hot latte with sugar syrup and was happy with it. Maybe I'm more picky as a former barista of 3.5 years. 

All in all, we won't be back. It may have just been today's staff, but I'd rather explore other places."}
{"text":"I was greeted right away and decided on the Cinnamon Coffee Cake and Caramel Machiatto. Both were delicious!! Nice quiet place!"}
{"text":"In house roasting!
Dog friendly!
Terrific staff!
Fast service!
What more can a coffee lover ask for? 

A favorite caffeine stop, especially something iced on a warm afternoon! 

Cheers!"}
{"text":"Came by here while on vacation to work on some homework and try out the local coffee scene in Gilbert. I was amazed how friendly the staff was and the people in general too. I ordered a iced vanilla latte with the All American Breakfast. I was glad to have found this great local spot on Yelp and could come and spend a few hours here to get some work done."}
{"text":"Probably some of the best prices on coffee I have come across in the Valley. They have toddy concentrate that you can take home to make your own. 

Staff is friendly and it's a super cute atmosphere. They have a back patio that is perfect for relaxing and enjoying your food and drinks during the parts of the year that it doesn't feel like we are living in the fourth ring of Hell."}
{"text":"Delicious mocha. Nice atmosphere. Was a bit busy so took a while to get my order waiting in line. Perhaps they can get more people to be working. Though this is definitely a nice place to be studying or chill."}
{"text":"20%tip and ZERO customer service.

You hear good thing about a place and when  I come here for the first time I'm completely dismayed at the lack of common courtesy shown."}
{"text":"Food is great!  Coffee is great! Service is great!  They have a variety of options for coffee and lattes.  Wide range of items on menu.  Everything is fresh and local.  My fav is the yogurt parfait.  The house made granola is yummy!"}
{"text":"Cute place, nice people working. Order your food then sit down.. Starbucks type atmosphere but more food options. Breakfast burritos were good."}
{"text":"The WORST service I have ever received to get a cup of coffee.
The guy in front of me in line ordered a foo foo coffee beverage and proceeded to talk football with the order taker/cashier.  So there's a lot of conversation going on but no other activity.  The worker (big guy with dark reddish brown hair) stopped the discussion long enough to take my order.  He  resumes the football conversation, makes the guy's beverage and the football conversation continues.  Finally, he poured my coffee.  So what should have been a 30 second transaction for me took about 10 minutes.  Customer Service 101 badly needed.  
The coffee was pretty good, although not worth the service hassle so I surely won't be back."}
{"text":"So good!  Digging the monthly specials. They now have their toddy coffee concentrated in jars,  to take home."}
{"text":"This is my new favorite breakfast and coffee spot. The atmosphere is friendly, the coffee was great, and the French toast was amazing! Can't wait to come back and try more!"}
{"text":"I had some pancakes with Canadian bacon, hash browns and sausages.. The hash browns was bland. It just did not have enough salt. The sausages were too greasy. The Canadian bacon was OK..The pancakes were really thin and tasty..I also had Cappuchino, which, I thought, was just not strong at all. The staff working at that Cafe are very friendly."}
{"text":"Staff is always very nice and courteous every time we've been here; they have happy hour on blended drinks which are our favorite since they have a variety of flavors.  Coffee is very good, the purple eye will keep you awake for days haha. We like that they also have a pretty good size breakfast and lunch menu too, we haven't had anything from the lunch menu yet but everything we've had from the breakfast menu has been really good.  This is definitely our favorite coffee shop!"}
{"text":"Great food,Great coffee at reasonable prices. This is our favorite place to get breakfast and coffee in the valley. The atmosphere is perfect and the staff is always friendly."}
{"text":"Fast, friendly service AND incredibly delicious dark chocolate almond coffee cake. My vanilla soy latte actually tasted like espresso, which was a huge plus for me. I like coffee that tastes like coffee- what can I say?
So glad I stopped here instead of froyo!! Wish they were on my morning commute.... Shucks."}
{"text":"Finally a coffee spot in Kohls shopping center! So excited to have a meeting place nearby.  I wish this business great success.  So far only had a chance to grab a quick mocha iced coffee and it was very tasty.  could have used a little more whipped cream but next time I will request it. Looking forward to trying their food next time. I really hope they do well we needed a place like this. :). Will update after I try the food.

GREAT coffee, have been stopping in for breakfast and enjoy the options available from light to more indulgent. i appreciate the delicious coffee they serve Im so,glad this place is here!"}
{"text":"They do have have very good drink 
Pricing is comparable to Starbucks pricing 
They have good food , small portions but the price is not bad."}
{"text":"This is long overdue. My fiance and I have been coming here at least twice a week for a while now. They make the most consistently good cappuccino in any coffee shop I've been to in the valley. That's pretty much all I drink, so I can't comment on the fancier drink menu except to say that it's extensive and sounds delicious. The food is far better than you'd expect - more on par with Liberty Market than Starbucks. The french toast, banana bread oatmeal, breakfast sandwiches/burritos, breakfast quesadilla, breakfast tacos are all seriously good. And the staff is great - friendly and fast and not too chirpy when I'm stumbling in at 7 am pre-caffeine."}
{"text":"I love going to this place! I expected the coffee would be good and was not disappointed. Their service is great and I love the seasonal flavors they have at different times. Their shop is a great place to meet with friends, business associates and customers. I meet many people there and it is always a great experience!"}
{"text":"The chai latte and americano were very smooth and flavorful.  Nice assortment of baked goods as well.  Family owned and accommodating staff.  Better coffee than The Coffee Shop.  The breakfast sandwich on English Muffin needs improvement.  It was like an egg frisby on a tiny English Muffin with a tiny piece of sausage.  Overall, liked it and will go back."}
{"text":"Different from your average Starbucks, good prices and nice atmosphere, I like that it's walking distant away"}
{"text":"Yes, love this place! The cold brew is good and I love that I can buy it in a jar! Thank you guys. Staff is friendly and love the atmosphere"}
{"text":"Awesome little stop for great coffee and a bite.  Had an iced mocha, yogurt parfait, and a croissant.  Everything was very yummy, and the parfait was a great balance of fruit to yogurt to granola. 

Service was very fast, and very friendly. 

The only thing that could use improvement is the flatware.  They have these great plates and cups, but then you're stuck with this cheap plastic utensil. Either invest in some real utensils, or spend a little extra on some better plastic pieces."}
{"text":"I live here! The food is delicious but the coffee is the best part. I've learned the Red Tux coffee drink is tasty hot or iced. They also know how to make a killer lattee. Also, if you want a lemon poppyseed muffin get there early! The staff are all polite and courteous. When I first started going my request to have food to go didn't seem to get communicated to the kitchen because it came out on a plate. They have corrected this in the meantime and now I can order my Frenchman to go sandwich without hassle!"}
{"text":"So, today is my birthday and I wanted to treat myself to a nice breakfast. Based on the reviews I have been wanting to try this place out and decided this is the day. So I get there and I thought it would be a bunch of people but there were like 4-5 in there so it was nice and quiet. The guy taking my order was super friendly. I ordered the French toast (which came with something of my choice: hash browns) and a 24 oz. Iced Carmel Macchiato. It came out to like $14 and some change which I was kind of indifferent about. I don't know if that's because I'm a college student or because I usually eat breakfast at home, but it's my birthday and I'm determined to treat myself damn it. So if that means paying almost $15 for coffee and 2 slices of French toast, then so be it. I had ordered my food to go and it wasn't too much of a wait maybe 7 or 8 minutes. The place itself is very chill so the time flew by. 

I get home and unveil my food. My eyes immediately went to the hash browns, in my mind hash browns are supposed to be golden brown, these were basically heated up shredded potatoes. There were a few strands of brown so I tried a bite because I thought maybe that's their \"thing\" and it was exactly what I thought, not cooked. They were inedible in my opinion. The French toast was good, not incredible. I literally live 3 minutes up the street so I don't think the food quality suffered. The one thing that did blow me away was the coffee. If I do come back that will be why."}
{"text":"Did not get any food here, though it does sound good, but I did like the chai I got. This place has lots of options, and some unique ones as well which I thought was cool.

I like the feel of HG. It is a small, cute place. A nice little coffee shop. I ordered a chai with almond milk. It was good. A lot of places only have cow's milk or soy milk and I do not like either of those, so was excited to see they were one of the more rare places that have almond milk as an option.

Would be interested in coming back here for breakfast!"}
{"text":"Darn good coffee. Oh wait, wrong place.  

But it's true!

I like the vibe, pretty cozy. Lots of wood and neutral tones. Smaller tables which allows me to take up a table by myself without feeling guilty for taking up too much space. They are south-facing with lots of windows which allows the sun to fill the room with natural light. 

Their menu has just enough options to keep my belly happy while I drink my coffee and get some work done on my laptop. Or you can buy a bakery item if you don't want a meal. 

Staff was super nice and on top of things.  Two thumbs up for roasting coffee onsite!!"}
{"text":"First time here, me and my wife like to give small, local business's our business. We both had coffee, very nice.. We both had a muffin, and thats where this review drops to a 3 star. I don't remember the two different flavors we ordered, but they both were very plain, dry, not moist. Tasted and looked like they came from a package. I LOVE a good muffin and this was not. This small cafe is set upon a odd shaped building. Its not cozy at all, feels.....odd. The staff is very nice{ 5-stars}. I most likely won't be back. Doh!!!"}
{"text":"Blended chai and a power bowl - great way to get my post-run calories. Friendly staff and tasty food and beverages. Sunday mornings are laid back - great vibe."}
{"text":"First time trying out coffee shop. Staff was friendly, but if you don't have extra time you will be frustrated. It took a really long time to get tea and sandwiches. 

Quality was average on food. Chicken and roast beef were dry. 

Environment is very cute and they have free WiFi if you want to just sit and have a coffee."}
{"text":"Very simple yet very good Local Coffee Shop. The people here are so friendly and willing to listen to immediate feedback. 
For me, it's convenient, fast, and tastes good. Its like going over to close friends house... The regular coffee is consistently good...
Breakfast sandwiches,  the burrito, and the french toast are so good! and if you want a special order, well they do that too.
Wishing this local shop great success"}
{"text":"We called in a lunch order thinking by time we got there it may be ready within 15 minutes, when we got there we were told it would be out soon.  We waited 20 minutes and decided to ask about our order due to having to return to work, we were then told they had other orders in front and may take additional 15 minutes.  If you have alot of time try this location but if you want an order to go think twice about ordering."}
{"text":"Their cold brew is decent! Friendly staff, and a great atmosphere! Lots of pastries and different coffee drinks to choose from! Seems like a nic study spot!"}
{"text":"The food was good. Eggs were delicious. Oatmeal was also really good. The hash browns were only okay, but not bad. A little oily. Coffee is strong.  The baristas were nice but very young and a little green. They had just opened, so maybe they were just tired. :)"}
{"text":"OK, I don't yelp that much, but I felt I had to on this one. Cute and quiet little place. Very clean. My wife and I ordered the croissant grilled chicken sandwich, and the ciabatta bread chicken sandwich. They forgot the avacados on the croissant sandwich, and it was a chicken salad instead of breast. Had to send it back. It was laden with red onions, so you could only taste onions. That's it. Onion sandwich. Period. The ciabatta sandwich had either frozen chicken microwaved, or it it had been sitting in the refrigerator for alot longer than it should have. We also ordered a muffin, and a marbled coffee cake. Muffin was fine, but, regular coffee cake was delivered to the table. Not the marbled. We told the person, this is not what we ordered, and he said he would get the right order. He came back out and said they didn't have any. He offered a refund or substitution, but we settled on the regular coffee cake. Arnold Palmer with passion fruit was terrific. Service was vanilla. Not friendly, First time here, and sorry to say, our last. For $8.95, and $7.95, waaaay overpriced. Nothing extra."}
{"text":"What a great Coffee Cafe! I love their Iced Coffee. They have baked goods, breakfast and more coffee! The environment is very comfortable, not too busy and plenty of places to sit. A perfect place to hang out. The music is fairly louder than most coffee lounges, so I would recommend it for a place to visit with family and friends. Unless of course you can tune out the music for some studying. Customer service was great and all smiling faces. Everyone seems to be very happy to be working their job. I waited 45 seconds for my drink! Great Place! Very pleased! I recommend it to everyone!"}
{"text":"Weak coffee and grumpy staff, I love supporting the local independent coffee houses, but you may want to look for Starbucks with this one.  I will say that the premises are clean but when I returned my iced latte, refund was not offered.  Aparantly they're made with cold, weak coffee and not bold espresso like every other shop.  When I asked about that method of preparing the late that way , I got t the \"duh\" look..  Hmmmm.  No really!"}
{"text":"Cute kitschy place!! Great Iced tea and food was pretty good !! Pastries look delicious! I had a veggie bowl with biscuit it was pretty good! Atmosphere nice and chill.
Friendly staff!"}
{"text":"There's plenty to like about this place. Nice ambiance inside. Lots of seating, Carmel macchiatto was good, I had one of their breakfast sandwhiches...the sausage was good but the eggs and biscuit (I think it was a biscuit) was bland.  

They open at 6 and have outdoor seating for me and my dog. Yayyyy.  I'll be back to try their other food items."}
{"text":"We love going to Higher Grounds for breakfast. The coffee is always great and I love the variety of coffee drinks they offer. Most important, it is never too sweet - my German palate isn't used to the American standard level of sweetness :)
My favorite dish to order are the grits, and that's where the one star less comes from. The first time I ordered them they came in a cup with a fried egg on top (sunny side up as I prefer) and a side of butter (grits already are buttery) so I could stir that in and get one step closer to cardiovascular disease. Second time unfortunately the egg was over easy (I don't like that too much and they didn't ask how I wanted the eggs) and no extra butter. Third time I got asked how I wanted my egg, and it came just as I love it, but no extra butter again. I added hot sauce instead (several brands are offered for free) and absolutely got that going for me though! The last two times the seasoning of the grits also was so-so, but I can fix that myself thanks to the salt and pepper and sauces you can grab yourself. So the only reason I take a star off is that the quality of the dishes I ordered wasn't always the same high level. All in all this place is awesome though. The staff is very friendly, the atmosphere is homely, and the food is great. I can absolutely recommend it."}
{"text":"Been coming here daily for a couple weeks, and the coffee and pastries are delicious! They serve breakfast and lunch items as well, not just typical scones and muffins like many coffee shops. It's also really nice that the staff brings you your food and drinks. However, I think some of the food items are slightly overpriced for the quality.

I appreciate the ambiance: plenty of tables of various sizes, coffee-themed wall decor, high ceilings, and not too loud of music. Also there is a back patio to enjoy in cooler weather (or if you are a glutton for punishment). 

The staff is friendly enough, but it took me a week of coming before I thought to ask if there is a points reward system, and there was! It would have been nice if someone would have asked me about it sooner. I would have given this place 5 stars if it weren't for that, as well as some of the prices on food picks. But overall, it's a great place to come before work to enjoy some time to myself and read!"}
{"text":"Met a friend here for an afternoon coffee. The place has a great vibe and friendly staff. Menu has a variety of choices between coffee drinks and food. 

I ordered an iced toddy and it was very good. They roast their beans on site. Their baked goods (not the bagels) are made in-house and looked very delicious. It's also nice that they offer free Wi-Fi."}
{"text":"So, I have to edit my review because we've tried a few different things on the menu now. One is the blueberry coffeecake they had available one day last week. I've not seen it available before but they had it on Friday so I tried it. It was really very good, with a crunchy crumb topping and chunks of blueberries. 

Today we went to the Pet Club next store for their customer appreciate thing and so we stopped by for lunch. My daughter got an egg/bacon/cheese burrito. They offer an herb tortilla which my daughter wasn't crazy about, but I loved. I thought it really added some depth to the burrito. I'm not usually a burrito kind of girl, but my kids had all attacked my grilled cheese, so I traded out for part of the burrito and was very pleased with it. I actually finished the second half for dinner tonight (it was too big for me to eat the whole thing at lunch, but my husband could eat a whole one). 

My other daughter ordered the mac and cheese from the kids' menu. I have no idea how they make it but it's definitely not your Kraft mac and cheese. We all stuck spoons in to sneak bites, it was so good. It was served garnished with some herbs and red bell pepper (which I ate since my daughter didn't want the red stuff on her lunch) and loved the combo of the peppers and the mac and cheese. 

I had ordered the grilled cheese. It came with a few types of cheeses (they list them on the menu) served on sourdough. Delish! Like I said, we ended up cutting it and sharing it around the table. It was served with chips and I know there was a choice of sides, but I would have preferred a veggie side. I noticed after that they had a sauteed veggie side listed on their menu. Next time I'd get that, since I don't normally eat potato chips (though these were great, sort of a kettle-cooked variety). I'd love to see more veggie sides offered, specifically with the kids meals. But I think their menu seems to be evolving some as they go and I look forward to see how it changes. 

Going tomorrow for the Mothers' Day Brunch menu and can't wait. Will I be able to choose just one dish? Hmm."}
{"text":"Higher Grounds is the perfect brunch spot.  They have full size meal options and pastries. I had the French toast and Dan had the yogurt parfait. My French toast was delicious but a tad but more than we wanted to spend on it. I tried their coffee milk and Dan had a pour over coffee. The coffee milk is sweet and just strong enough. 

As far as their coffee and food goes it's a 5/5. I loved what I got and I wanted more. 

The store and it's employees are great. Friendly and clean. I love the decor and layout. 5/5 

The price ended up being $20 for food and coffee. Not really what I wanted to pay but reasonable and it wouldn't stop me from going again. 3/5 

Whether you're hard core coffee lover is just like pumpkin spice lattes, try it out. It has something for everyone."}
{"text":"Loved everything about a slow Sunday morning drinking coffee and taking care of some work. Really enjoyed the relaxed setting and kind employees"}
{"text":"Go here practically everyday! The food is always fresh (I can taste it practically off the stove) very friendly staff! Awesome environment for anyone to go to to relax or catch up on a good book."}
{"text":"Excellent coffee and service! Everything I've tried here is excellent, from the iced coffee, to the blended drinks and lattes. Delicious food, made fresh, even most of the baked goods are made here...and they always have different food specials. Chill atmosphere, comfortable place to eat or just hanging out."}
{"text":"It is so nice to have a coffee shop across the street from where I live. $2 for a huge iced coffee is unbeatable and the pastries are pretty good. The only thing holding me back from 5 stars is the food menu. The portions are crazy small for the price and the food was overall just so so. 

Other than that the service is great and I look forward to the cooler months to check out their hot drinks!."}
{"text":"Ten minutes for breakfast on the go is a bit long, but the Southern Burrito is worth the wait. And the house blend coffee is solid."}
{"text":"Coffee was just ok. Got a hot americano and it tasted very bland and weak. Service was good though."}
{"text":"Working on this side of town and not familar with the area. Couldnt find a Starbucks, not that I was looking hard. I typically stay away from small coffee places like this, mainly because their menu choices are half the wall written on large chalk boards. Just like here! To many choices, my ADD wont allow me to process anything and make a choice.

I'm sure there are tons of great drinks just not sure where to begin. I grabbed an Americano from here because thats my drink at Starbucks. 

This drink blew the doors off SBs hands down. The beans you can actually taste the flavor of the roast.
WELL DONE HG!!

I hope I will be back on this side of town sometime soon, ill venture outside my comfy zone and try something new, im sure I won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"Ordered breakfast for pick up and ordered a couple coffees to-go as well. Food was delicious! Kids pancake portions were huge. We ordered sausage with two of the kids meals but they gave us bacon instead. All good though, my kids still ate it. Love that they roast their own coffee beans. Our iced lattes were on point! We will be back again"}
{"text":"Better than Starbucks in every way possible!

There are certain spots in Gilbert that you can find to make your go-to place for something, and Higher Grounds is one of those places! This is my absolute place to go for my coffee fix, and it is in every way, better than its big chain competitors like Starbucks or Dutch Bros. 

Located in the Kohl's complex, I'm assuming only Gilbert locals know about this place cause it's never busy, however I'm not saying it's dead! There are usually around 3 or 4 people enjoying their coffee, maybe on their laptops, just casually chilling in the lounge. The place has a nice modern/rustic feel to it, and has many options for normal hot coffees, special cold drinks, or blended sweet drinks. 

I mostly go here for the cold brew before I go to work, and it is great! They're always so quick at getting my order done and the cold brew is very smooth and generally better than most cold brews I've had. I'm kinda glad this place is low key but I will give props and will always tell people how great this place is!

I highly recommend getting the cold brew here! I've had the caramel machiatto and that's really good too! Even their assorted baked goods are pretty tasty!  and hands down the best coffee in Gilbert. The only place I believe can be on par with it is that coffee place next to Joe's Farm Grill."}
{"text":"My favorite breakfast spot!! The food and ice tea are so good! The workers are all very nice! And it's a great environment!"}
{"text":"**The 4 stars are for the coffee and service ***

The Caramel macchiato half sweet was delicious. It doesn't taste like the starbucks caramel macchiato as the espresso actually tastes better. Im not sure if they put any caramel sauce in it like they do at starbucks because I cant taste it. It could be because I got the half sweet version that I cant taste it. 

The cashier was super nice and helped me to order. She suggested that if I wasn't super hungry that i could order something off of the kid's menu as it still provides a satisfying portion. 

I ended up ordering the egg white panini without tomato on a bagel. It was ok. I actually had to add some salt to it eggs because it was seasoned very well. If I came back here, I'd likely get a coffee or espresso drink and skip the food."}
{"text":"Just tried to go to HG, but they were closed despite saying they're open till 4. Update your Yelp hours."}
{"text":"Really cool little coffee place in Gilbert.  Has a variety of food for breakfast and it really is delicious.  Definitely  a cool place to go if you want to chill, have some good food and great coffee."}
{"text":"Thank you, Higher Grounds, for this amazingly burnt French toast! There was also a hair in my seasoned potatoes! And since I am home recovering from an accident I had with my foot I cannot drive. That being said I ordered using Grubhub. So now my food is burned and I have nothing else to eat and no way to get more food unless I order from somewhere else and spend a bunch more money...."}
{"text":"This place is great. The food was quick and tasty and the home-roasted coffee was delicious. I like the decor, which is a mix of wooden accents and blue-themed artwork. 

The staff were courteous and checked on me more often than some restaurant waiters would (this place is not full service), so I was really impressed!

Finally, the prominent home-roasting machine in the front was pretty cool and let's you know right away that they take their coffee seriously. Keep up the great work!"}
{"text":"First thing I looked for was if they offered a pour over - oh yes. That's what did it for me with Higher Grounds, not many places around Gilbert offer a pour over option, and they have some pretty exotic varieties of coffe (I recommend the Sidamo blend with the pour over). Definitely coming back! They roast in the store, and that's awesome."}
{"text":"I was really hoping that this place would be good...all we got was \"ok\". We ordered the Frenchman and the French Canadian breakfast sandwiches.  Thank god I added jalapenos otherwise it wouldn't have had any flavor at all. Burnt eggs and un toasted English muffins.  Breakfast snob? Perhaps, but if they don't get creative with their dishes,I can't see them lasting much longer...at least not on my roster."}
{"text":"*updated review*
Ok looks like they got the kinks worked out and potatoes are on the menu now (YAY!) and last time I went it wasn't as harsh on the pocketbook either.. Definitely a great place with wonderful coffee

Coffee is great, but over $40 for breakfast for 2 adults and 1 child is a bit much when I can go to other places and pay up to 50% less and get a full service local owned restaurant. 

Breakfasts don't include potatoes either which is weird to me."}
{"text":"The Citrus Salad has really ripe strawberries and not too many greens. I never had to hunt for the toppings. This my first visit and I will be coming back. We also enjoyed the vanilla iced coffee. The patio is pet friendly and the baked goods yummy and made on site. This small business is top notch. A nice casual atmosphere with better coffee than that chain place with the green emblem makes this place a winner. My daughter's Kona Mocha is so tasty, I want one, too."}
{"text":"Expected coffee and was surprised to find they serve breakfast.  The Frenchman breakfast sandwich was really good and coffee was super tasty."}
{"text":"One of my favorite coffee/breakfast spots! I usually get a breakfast bowl. My fiancé has tried a few different things but his fav is the ultimate breakfast sandwich. They have a lot of choices though including lunch which we haven't tried yet. Can never go wrong with an iced cold brew too."}
{"text":"Really happy with my coffee I ordered.  Breakfast was pretty good.  I had the scrambled eggs, and they were nice.  Overall a good place!"}
{"text":"Oh my!!! This place was an awesome find. I had a Large Latte which includes four shots. The espresso is super smooth and tasty. I also order the Englishman...biscuit, sausage, egg and cheese. Made from scratch!!! It looks and tastes like it was just whipped together...like from an actual egg and not some sort of mix, so good. Finally I couldn't resist and ordered a cinnamon roll. This was yummy too. I liked the biscuit better...but I could have been full too!  Well done!"}
{"text":"The staff is super helpful. Their food is awesome! I never thought I could like coffee cakes. They're usually too sweet, too dry and fall apart too easily , creating a mess! Their Coffee cake and Apple crumb (I think that's the name) are awesome!! Fluffy, not too sweet, with crumb-y tops..... Just perfect! The place is also decorated really well - contemporary, fun. I love hanging out there by myself.
The only thing I don't like about this place, is their rewards system. It is always changing and the cashiers forget to ask you if you want to sign up/want points added, etc."}
{"text":"Simply gr8  service,  good prices & Awesome coffee.  Others around me ordered  food which looked  fabulous.  I highly  recommend  u check this place out."}
{"text":"This cozy coffee shop definitely has that \"hipster roaster\" trendy vibe but don't get your suspenders in a twist-this place is the real deal. Their cold brew was excellent-smooth and mind, not at all acidic like some places \"cold brew\" is (which I suspect is just hot coffee over ice). The french toast was also excellent."}
{"text":"If you are looking for a mediocre cup of coffee with a 15 minute wait, and no where to sit because all the tables are dirty then you found the right place."}
{"text":"Prices are a bit steep! Breakfast sandwiches were good but I could've made it at home. Mocha was ok, I should've added another shot as it wasn't strong enough for my personal taste."}
{"text":"This is my husband and my favorite spot to stop for coffee before taking our dog on his Sunday morning walk around Discovery Park. There are many coffee flavoring options (flavored syrups, creamer / milk / soy / almond / coconut milk) to choose from and they don't up charge for every single thing like they do at the bigger coffee chains. 

There are usually three roasts (rotating each week we are there) to choose from. Or you can go iced which is my fav once it gets hot outside. We haven't tried their food but their baked goods look delicious and there are always people in there eating breakfast. 

We recently discovered they had a quaint little back patio (dog friendly as is the smaller front patio) and are looking forward to finally getting around to eating breakfast there soon! 

Side note - our new \"thing\" is picking up a bag of whole beans while we are there for making our own coffee at home. They rotate roast types every time we are there so it never gets boring ;)"}
{"text":"Been here twice.  Once for breakfast and once for lunch.  Had the Breakfast Burrito which was awesome and plentiful and you can build it just like you want it.  For lunch I had the Sonoran Chicken Panini.  Once again, it was awesome and plentiful.  Love their Iced Jasmine Green Tea.  The staff is very friendly and helpful.  So nice to have another option in the area."}
{"text":"This place is small and cozy. When you walk in you don't expect them to serve food except for your topical muffins and bengals like every other coffee shop. They have a huge menu with delicious breakfast and lunch options. I ordered their egg white panini so good. Not to mention the price is right too. I seen a lady order the citrus salad it looked amazing. Service was good, not the best but not worst. they did their job what else can I ask for. Deff will be going back to try that salad :)"}
{"text":"It took over 10mins to make my chai latte. I ended up having to leave without it because I had an appt. Thanks for nothing."}
{"text":"I don't know how we didn't find this hem sooner. The coffee is amazing! And of course the baked goods are incredible. Can't wait to try their breakfast foods."}
{"text":"I have eaten here before and wasn't impressed with the food or the coffee. this time, the mocha was bland and the coffee cake had good flavor but was a little dry. 
The inside metal chairs are wobbly and not ideal. if I return it would be more out of necessity."}
{"text":"I work next door to this place and am thankful to have it so close! I have had a few of their breakfast burritos, eggs sausage and fruit breakfast and a couple sandwiches all very tasty fresh and filling. Also have enjoyed many coffees here always delicious. They have a \"RedEye\" coffee with 1shot espresso and \"Blackeye\" coffee with 2 shots, I like that concept. And they recently started delivery! free within 1 mile range I have taken advantage twice already. I will be sad when I leave work here shortly but will still make a trips here."}
{"text":"My wife loved the chai tea lotte. The coffee has really good, original flavor. Great, friendly staff. Loses a star for the location. Not their fault, but this isn't a great area to soak in culture."}
