I ordered 2 noodles, 1 pancake, 1 tempra .Noodle too salty, pancake just OK! When the noodles ready on my table, the looking very bad and make me dont want to eat !! Just let all the meat, egg, veg. put in a blow .... Anyway, I think I dont go there again .... !!"}
{"text":"My new fav ramen house. Came here for lunch with a group of 3. Three bowls of ramen with a special maki roll came to a total of $48 after taxes. It was quite pricey for lunch but food was great and generous. Service good. But menu(s) are long - it can be overwhelming for first timers."}
{"text":"Walked in and it was empty. Ramen menu was a bit confusing so I built my own. Very bland. Had to ask for hot sauce and vinegar and soy. Oh well. at least I tried it out."}
{"text":"We came here two times and we love the pork bone soup based noodles. It tastes very good but the portion is very small. Also, the tables are small there, if you have a party of 5 or more, you won't be able to find a table that fit all the people."}
{"text":"I ordered beef tartar horrible serving for 10 dollars I also ordered level 4 spicy ramen they did not make the spicy with and spicy spice or with chili powder or with chili they made it with chili oil the broth was undrinkable even know it wasn't that hot"}
{"text":"I came here a year ago and the quality of food hasn't improved one bit and the service today was pretty bad.

I came here with 3 other people, I only got to try 2 dishes because they decided to order the same thing.We found that the Tenderous Rib Soup ramen was too salty and couldn't finish the portions fearing that we would die of thirst. Maybe the people around here like a bowl of salt with a side of ramen. I would rather go a bit north and go to that ramen place in mong kok plaza (I will not name that resto)

Then onto the Oyako don. They have their own style to it; not to my liking though. Not enough egg, maybe they were running out. A lot of rice though, so for you rice lovers out there this is for you if you want a lot of rice. Good for sharing with friends; luckily i had a few with me to share with. They give you enough sauce, I just wish I got more egg. 

Service... my goodness its like they dont want you there. It was an unpleasant atmosphere.
Also I asked if they had Wifi and the server said yes we do and walked away when I clearly had the password page open. Well I thot that he was going away to bring me the password, but that was not the case. Maybe he wanted me to ask for the password, but i thot that it was apparent that I wanted the password.

I guess they got my business again but this will be the last time. We gave a 15% tip and thats the last time they will be getting any money from us.

This place gets a 3 star because I havent tried everything they have, so there may be some redeeming qualities.

Gl yelpers with your food and hopefully you have a better experience"}
{"text":"My friend and I decided to go out for lunch in the area I work in. We decided on Japanese and found this little place super close to my office. 

We checked out the 4menus they had given us. It took a little while to decide on something, since there was a lot to choose from. 

We both decided on lunch bento boxes. We were given tea right away and the drinks came not long after. 

The food presentation was very pretty and we definitely pulled out our cameras to share the loveliness. 

I had the chicken katsu bento which was great portion wise and variety in the bento box. My friend had the teriyaki salmon which was a little overcooked however portion size was good as well. 

The servers were fairly attentive but forgot my dessert. :( 

Overall it was a nice place for a quick reasonably priced lunch."}
{"text":"I have been here on several occasions, and the thing that always impresses me is the quality of their sashimi (especially salmon). It is somewhat weird that I would praise a ramen shop for their sashimi, but it isn't uncommon for me to order a ramen (or a chicken katsu don) and then add a side order of salmon sashimi to satisfy my craving for raw fish.

It's also nice that they serve some of the less common Japanese dishes like okonomiyaki (which is hard to find in Scarborough/Markham)."}
{"text":"Access
I just want to mention that this plaza's parking is a cluster fuck. You are better off carpooling and for some, you might want to park where No Frills is (not even sure if that is legal). Anyhow, other than parking it is located quite close to Pacific Mall.

Service
The restaurant is small so you don't need to worry about bad service. They will definitely see you when your hand is up requesting for help. I didn't experience superior service but average and okay in my standard.

Food 
Forewarning everyone here that the bowls are gigantic. I'm gonna throw it out there that 1 entree and 1 appetizer would suffice for 2 individuals. I did see my male friends engulfing a whole bowl of ramen but it will fill you up, no joke. There are many ramen soup bases to choose from and generally they taste alright. I'm wary about the amount of salt and oil they put it but they don't go overboard like Ajisen Ramen *cough cough*. After dinner you can get some bubble tea or dessert as the plaza offers different cuisines.

Pretty standard ramen place with no surprises or major complaints. I would say that this restaurant is a good choice if you are around the area but definitely does not offer anything new or exciting."}
{"text":"I'm so sad they closed!!! They had really delicious ramen with unique flavors that I loves. They also made one of the best okonomiyakis in Markham. I would always recommend my friends to try this place and they would always love it. Ill miss you, good luck in the future   : '("}
{"text":"I went with my friend and we ordered the baked mushrooms for appetizer and he ordered the level 2 or 1 spicy ramen and i ordered the pork bone ramen. Our friends on the next table ordered their ramen and a eel okonomayaki and they gave us a bite it was actually really good (: when the ramen came i feel like the texture was good but i felt the flavour wasnt enough and my friends spicy ramen was WAY too spicy. Our server was a gentleman and he was very kind and was very informative. OH the baked mushrooms were covered in cheese and im not sure if there was mayo but there was a tangy taste which i wasnt a big fan of. 

All in all the meal was nice. I will go again to try other food on the menu."}
{"text":"I've been to Yokozuna 3 times now, and each time my experience has gotten that much better. 

The ramen in milk soup was really nice and they gave a free upgrade of spinach noodles. In my last visit, we ordered a bunch of sushi rolls and they were all delicious. I especially liked the mango rolls - the mango slices were actually sweet, which was a nice surprise. I had expected it to taste like the sour strips in Thai mango salads that I've never been a fan of. The spider roll was delightful and there was another roll (can't remember the name of it anymore), but it had slightly grilled salmon belly on top and deep fried shrimp inside (not tempura battered, but resembled more of a katsu batter) with a drizzle of this amazing green sauce (tasted like mango and wasabi combined). AMAZING... To top that off, the server was really generous and offered us a half a pound of fresh salmon sashimi for only $2 since we ordered over $50. That's unheard of... there were about 8 sashimi slices, which would normally go for $10-$16 at other restaurants. Sah-weet. I heart Yokozuna. 

The only dish I would improve though is the Tuna Tartar, as it lacked flavour. There was some garlic salt on the side, which definitely helped, but I'd recommend for them to add sauteed garlic chips instead the way Guu does downtown."}
{"text":"Ramen soup was not even hot or tasty. I don't know why my soup was warm. It was disgusting. I left after 3 spoons. The meat slices were so thin and they were so cheap on the meat. Wish I never walked into this place in the first place. Yuck"}
{"text":"First time to a ramen house.  I ordered the regular spicy ramen, (not the hell spicy).  The spice tasted like kim chi, which was okay with me.  It was spicy enough, so I didn't think I would try the hell spicy ramen soon.  What I liked was the texture of the ramen, soft but bouncy.  The price was higher than Chinese style wonton noodle and slightly higher than Vietnamese noodle.  

I think ramen is a good deal for a quick, fulfilling fix.  It is to Japanese what wonton soup noodle is to Chinese.  If you expect much more, I am not sure why."}
{"text":"I really enjoyed their ramen, they had a choice of selecting the soup base and different noodles, then choosing the toppings for $1, $2, or $3? I believe.  I had butter miso soup and added egg, broccoli, and shrimp tempura.  It already included, corn, seaweed, and something else.  Sorry, bad memory ): 
It wasn't very busy in there though, but I think it gets busier when it's later"}
{"text":"Tried the Sapporo ramen and also the squid ink ramen. Both were good but I liked the Sapporo ramen soup better better. Got mine with extra noodles like I usually do and I think that was an extra $2 if I remember correctly. I found the soup was pretty plain and I got bored eating it towards the end. Also got the  tempura eel for $12.95. It really wasn't worth it as the eel flavour was deep fried away and the eel portions were really small."}
{"text":"I guess the ramen and soup were decent, though the okonomiyaki I was a little disappointed; I ordered the seafood one and the only seafood I can truly taste was cooked salmon. Not what I expected.

The ramen selection was quite diverse; choose a soup base, choose your noodle, choose your toppings, and voila! There's your cost. Or you can choose the chef specials that are displayed on the paper menu. My dad tried the satay soup base, which was very good. The red miso I was disappointed as there was not much of a taste. The butter miso was a little tastier.

Service was abysmal; the young ladies refused to look at our directions even though we waved them over until they were close to us.

Still cash only."}
{"text":"I've been here twice. The first time, I didn't really find anything special about the ramen. As a matter of fact, I prefer Pixel 8 cheap combo deals and their noodles over this place. However, I found out they had this garlic butter soup based (Sapporo ramen) and I've been converted. I also think their noodles tasted better the second time around."}
{"text":"I can't understand why other reviewers don't like this place, I have been here for no less than 5 times and I think every dishes are awesome!
The sashimi here is fresh and tender
The grilled salmon served with lemon is awesome and is totally different from the grilled salmon that I have ever tried( spent over 50$ and added 2$ to get these, the original price is 10$!!!!!! GREATEST  DEAL!)

The bibimbap here is my favourite, not like normal bibimbap in Korean restaurants, u can make your own! Love the feeling of DIY my own dish! There are over 30 choices for the veges and meat, and u can order extra meat! I ordered salmon with kimchi, corn, seaweed salad, mushroom and onion with a raw egg in the middle. u can also choose a flavour for ur bibimbap! I prefer the spicy sauce one.

The ramen here is also a DIY style, for people who prefer set meals, there are classic combinations.

The grilled eggplant is great 
The Spanish with sesame sauce topping is heavenly awesome!

20-30$ per person"}
{"text":"Yokozuna Japanese Noodle Eatery took over the Moo Beef Noodle House location at Silver Star Blvd. with minimum renovation and all they really did was rearranged the tables a little and made the interior space more open and now they ready for business!! 

The menu has a selection of Japanese snacks and of course Ramen noodle. Curiously the ramen menu is really similar to Ippai http://www.yelp.ca/biz/ippai-japanese-fusion-cuisine-markham I would even say it is identical even to what soup based they offers. 

Tonkotsu (Supreme Pork Bone Soup) Ramen ($10.95) 
- same price and same name and same description as Ippai which I had the same noodle before 
- Soup base was really rich and milky and has strong Pork flavour 
- The ChaShu was really nicely done, mixed of fat and lean parts and has this char coaled flavour and not dry at all 
- Noodle wise is the curly type and has a good bite to it as it was cooked al dente 

TV showing Japanese cooking show was quite interesting, a break from CP24!! 

Waitresses all wearing short short jean shorts........ hmmmmm....... 

10% off grand opening specials! Cash Only!"}
{"text":"Ugh though the noodles were ok, the pork bone special noodle soup they had was just ugh.  I didn't even drink much of it.  The meats they used were a bit sub-standard and the price you pay for is exorbinant.  Trust me if you want a better ramen experience just drive three blocks west to J-Town and go to Niwatei, it's significantly better with a better price.

I also tried to sample N's garlic soup combo.  It's ridiculously salty.  I think I made the same face as the logo of Guy Eldoon's Noodle Shop in Apollo Justice.

The service was still ok, but no way am I going here again.  The food is just that bad."}
