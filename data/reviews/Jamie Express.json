{"text":"The food here is pretty good for Chinese fast food. Super cheap pricing. Tons of selection. You order your meal and get a choice of either their daily soup or soy milk drink. Portion size is huge! Whenever I need to grab a quick meal at Market Village I go to Jamie Express."}
{"text":"I chose this food court place purely on the tagline - Cantonese Stir Fry.  I am a US visitor that revels in the inexpensive and high quality food court Chinese food. Canadians - I am used to fake and sub par Chinese food in the Washington, DC area.  The menu is quite extensive and I marvel how the kitchen can offer such variety in a small kitchen. Kudos to them.  To be fair, the Market Village Food Court is rather competitive and as a consumer, we're the beneficiaries.  I've frequented the place twice and each time I think I got great value.  The beef chow fun had the smoky small and flavor indicative of a nice hot wok.  The flank beef was tremendously tender. The only knock is that I was expecting a broader rice noodle.  The dish came with a complimentary sweet (and cold) soy bean drink. - a bonus.    Moving to my second foray - the salt/pepper fried pork was voluminous and exceptionally flavorful. The garlic chunks and pepper flavor over the rice is certainly memorable.  To offset the fried meat, the boiled choy sum alleviated the fried food guilt."}
{"text":"If we're in the area and we're looking for a cheap meal to bring home that's super filling - Jamie Express is usually the place we go to. Although not the most amazing food in the world, and not of the highest quality, it's fast food. It's meant to be quick, yet delicious like Chinese food usually is. What we get usually varies when we come here. We usually order the set meals that come with x number of dishes w/ rice and soup or soy bean milk.   We usually order x number of dishes per the number of people that we have. But we have leftovers each time no matter how many people there are. It's just so hard to narrow down your options! There's an EXTENSIVE list of dishes that you can order. Over 50-60 choices, so it really is a gem of a place. Takeout from here can last you a couple days!"}
{"text":"This place is always a favourite when we visit the Markham Village to do some shopping. The food is always delicious and VERY reasonably priced. The people are very friendly ... and not pushy like the person who owns the takeout restaurant next door. You definitely won't be disappointed here!"}

{"text":"The food is ok, but the value is fantastic for cheap Cantonese style take out.  They can be found in the food court at Market Village (which is the smaller mall next to Pacific Mall).  I got indoctrinated into my parents' weekly ritual of shopping in Toronto this weekend and was blessed with years of carefully honed food shopping knowledge.  It's not much to look at, but they're fast, efficient and most importantly, cheap!  Basically, my parents buy a \"dinner for five\" which comes in environmentally unfriendly styrofoam boxes where you choose 5 dishes and with it comes with a big box of white rice, and a choice of soup and soya milk.  There's a selection of over 70 different possible dishes and they do highlight a number for you to look at in a carefully preserved in a glass cabinet at the front (see pics) - which is particularly useful given their english descriptions are often written so as to be as unappetizing as possible.  It came to $26.99 plus tax.  It takes them 5-10 minutes to have everything ready which is pretty remarkable in itself (I have to imagine it gets re-heated what with 70 or so different dishes - but most of these dishes get frozen or reheated during the week by my parents anyway).  I've had the food from here many a time at my parents', just never really realized where it was from - and it's definitely more than adequate.  For maximum efficiency, you can place your order, pay and come back after you get your grocery shopping done.  We arrived around 3.00 pm on Saturday, and while the food court was fairly busy, there was no line up here.  One tip though - check your order even though it's a pretty big bag, before you leave as they have apparently given my parents the wrong order in the past (not that they really minded too much at the time)."}
{"text":"I love the Market Village food court. It is so cheap!  I got the beef brisket noodle soup + cold soya drink for $4.99 plus tax.  Wow!  This is almost like old school 1990's Dragon City pricing (well I think it was closer to $3.99 or something).    Unfortunately, since the food wasn't absolutely delicious, I have a hard time giving it more than 3 stars.   The beef brisket was okay and tender, but the soup was loaded with MSG (it is a food court after all).  However, I really liked their noodles as they were soft,but yet I could bite into them and break them apart with my teeth.  Soya milk was tasty and sweetened.    Overall, it's a good place for a quick meal while at Market Village/P-Mall."}
{"text":"Jamie Express has been around for a long time.   This place is cheap and cash only , so keep that in mind, when ordering here.   The (x) choice dishes for 3 come in under $20 and comes with rice and soup, which is extra value and is cheaper than their competitors. That being said - food quality is  decent for the price point and really can't be beat. They, also, have quite plenty of variety to choose from.   Service is pleasant and polite and you really can't ask for much more than that at a food stall kiosk in a Chinese mall.   Overall, not a bad place for a quick no brainer, don't wanna cook dinner with enough leftovers for next day lunch, if required."}
{"text":"We came here for a late dinner after driving 12 hrs from Chicago. We were thinking of going to check out Pacific Mall for dinner but decided against it. Am I glad we did! This place is great! Daughter ordered tofu with ground beef over rice, hubs ordered the bitter melon with fish slices over rice and I ordered eggplant with ground beef over rice. Daughter's tofu over rice was a bit bland but it was still great. Everything was delicious. I was surprised to find out we had a choice of soy milk or soup for drink. Place is inexpensive. All this for 19.35! Service was very friendly! Will definitely pop by again!"}
{"text":"Disclaimer: I know the owners of this establishment. However, I'm also a foodie and love Cantonese style cuisine. So I'm keeping this straightforward.   The food is cheaply priced as they are in a food court and with your order you get a choice of daily soup or soy milk. The portions are generous and most of their dishes are made to order. None of that sitting around under a heating lamp. The staff is friendly and can provide recommendations if you can't pick from their extensive menu.   Recommendations: Beef brisket over rice noodles and my all-time fave is the fish sauce chicken, the chef makes it in house himself and it is tender and flavourful. It's served with rice and some steamed bok choy as a one-person meal or you can order half/whole  chickens.   Also: Take out is available and they do party - sized dishes."}
