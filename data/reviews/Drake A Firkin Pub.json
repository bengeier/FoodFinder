{"text":"Great place to go have drinks, bite to eat and watch the game. I hear they have renovated and I can't wait to see it."}
{"text":"Good brunch with the girls.... Got the turkey and guacamole Benedict... It was really flavorful and didn't need any more hollandaise as the guacamole added the extra touch.... The potatoes were good as well and fruits sweet.. Would come back again... Good option for people who don't eat beef and pork like me...."}
{"text":"We ordered delivery from Skip the Dishes and it arrived without my spinach dip. The restaurant is responsible for the accuracy of the order. We called the restaurant and they said they would call us back shortly, but never did. I had to call them again to inquire about getting my spinach dip. They completely blamed Skip the Dishes for it and refused to do anything to rectify the situation. We then spoke to Skip who made it right, even though it was not their fault, by giving us a credit to order another spinach dip with....however when we tried to do so the restaurant had 'taken themselves offline' so they could not receive any further orders. Not impressed! We will spend our money elsewhere."}
{"text":"The Drake and Firkin is located in a complex of restaurants that is surrounded by office parks and buildings, so during the week places in this complex get pretty busy. (This is in the same complex as the Union Social Eatery).  In any event we chose to eat here because they have a decent number of tables outside on the patio and it was reasonably warm today.  I chose the Firkin burger....not a good choice I know because I have been eating a lot of burgers and pizza lately! Anyways, the burger was great with a good size patty, and the always deadly cheddar and bacon combo, which itself was topped with 3 onion rings! The fries were a bit of a disappointment as they seemed to be the frozen kind but then again for a dude who should be eating better, this was probably a blessing in disguise!"}
{"text":"To my surprise after the renovation it looks kinda good. It used to smell wired as the carpets were very old and the color used to be too dark. But after the makeover its more open, vibrant and has Tvs on the wall.   The menu has shrank big time and has some great limited choices. The only problem was many things were cooked in Beer, so if you don't drink alcohol; that a problem.  I had there Cajun wings.... and to my surprise they were taste. It had the crispness and the Cajun kick to it.  The portions of all the meal we had were great and filling.   The staff was quite friendly and were able to accommodate us without a reservation on a very busy lunch hour.   The only thing was they couldn't handle the rush as the food was late but the waitress did come by and apologized. It was quite busy and all the rush came at once on lunch time so it was understandable."}
{"text":"Where should I start.   My brother and I came here last night for dinner. He ordered the chicken and waffles and I had the chicken breast with ham and Swiss with a side of mashed potatoes and veggies.   0 stars on yelp should be an option..please.   My meal had a hair in it so the server  apologized and said she will take it off the bill and made me a new one (I asked for it to go). Despite the hair in my food I still gave the server a 25% tip. After I got home and cut into the chicken, it was completely raw. I mean COMPLETELY raw. I was beyond nauseated!! I cut the other end of the chicken and to my horror there was a piece of plastic cooked INSIDE the meat. I was so shocked and disgusted at how a restaurant can serve this to a customer.   I called the Drake and spoke to the manager. He said sorry and as a compensation said he would make me wings and fries. Not exactly sure how that is compensation for a mistake this big.   When I went in to the restaurant to pick up the poor excuse for an apology meal I felt very rushed by the manager. Also, with each sorry it seemed as though He had an excuse.  He said that he is sorry but this type of a meal takes very long to cook...um, if you can't cook it, then don't put it on the menu. He said sorry but maybe the plastic was already in the meat from the suppliers before the chef cooked it...um, is quality control not a concern for the restaurant???  Overall, I will not be returning. Sorry for the long review but a fair warning to anyone who wants to eat here: don't."}
{"text":"We left union social to go for a couple of drinks on Saint patties day at the Drake. Big mistake. Although the place was full there seem to be no fun energy in the room and was pretty i inviting. But we were there to have a good time so we decided to try it. We got seated in a booth and our waiter came by to take her drink order and right from the start was not too happy to be there And put us off with his unfriendly demeanour. When I asked if there was any drink specials (for St. Patrick's Day) he just simply said no. I joked no green beer? He said yeah we have green beer but it's not on special . I then ordered a vodka soda to which he replied \"after all that and that's what you order?\" In a serious tone lol  So our party ordered a tea,  vodka soda and two beers along with three shots of Jamison. The only good news was the drinks came quick. The bad news was our waiter reeked of pot and on his second approach he left another scent at the table that was highly unappetizing so we decided to skip food ask for a bill which was $75 for the round! We couldn't wait to leave after paying I would not recommend my worst enemy to go there on a good day and hope this restaurant gets shut down and replaced with somewhere  more fun to be :)"}
{"text":"Just had an app but it was good. Irish nachos which is basically potatoes. The atmosphere was good, it was a small place and was quite busy with the after-work crowd around 5:30pm.  I didn't get a chance to really look at the menu as I was with a group of people, but the appetizer I ate was pretty good but nothing that makes me want to go back there for more."}
{"text":"I usually have lunch or dinner here whenever I come to Toronto for biz trip. It is about the only place in the surrounding areas that is open late and serves good food and drinks. Fish and chips are great and just yesterday tried and loved their Big Hog poutine with pulled pork and bacon.  Interior has been renovated and has a very clean and modern feel to it. Friendly staff with prompt service. On this particular visit, serving person was a bit forgetful and did not get us the right drinks until after a few requests.  Overall recommended for casual business meals as well as for hanging out with some drinks."}
{"text":"okkkkk.   So I came here because I got a groupon 30$ for brunch for two.    The food was amazing, I got breakfast tacos with a mimosa & my boyfriend got a burger with a make your own Cesar. Great food.   The only flaw here was my waitress. Her name was krystean. She was weirdly rude and for no reason.  She was super unresponsive and barely said a word to us other than taking our order. It honestly  , ruined the whole experience especially when we asked for the bill it took her forrrrrever then she came out all awkward again and just stood there.   Great food , bad waitress."}
{"text":"We ordered the fish tacos, which were good. I wouldn't say it's the best I've ever had. It had a spicy mayo sauce in it, which added to its deliciousness. I don't think the basa fish is the best choice to fry for a taco. It doesn't have the same rich and delicious taste other fishes would have OR it could have been the fact that it was deep fried that ruined it a bit. Maybe grilling the basa would have help....who knows. We also got the A Really Big Poutine. It lives up to its name. It had a lot on the platter when it came out. It had tater tots in it, and I loved that! The fries were your standard fries you would expect. I was impressed by the amount of chunky cheese curds they gave us. They didn't cheap out and give us less than I think other places tend to do. The beef gravy, however, tasted like it came from a can off the grocery store shelf. I wish it had a more homemade taste (aka made in-house). The tater tots and cheese curds are the only thing I would say made this poutine good. It's not to say the poutine was terrible. It was decent enough that we finished the dish.  We came around 7:30 pm on a Friday night. It wasn't as busy as I thought it would be, maybe because the office workers nearby had already left and the night time crowd hadn't arrived yet. Our server was pleasant. She didn't make a whole lot of chit-chat. Our food came out relatively quick. We were in there for about 40 minutes. Easy, nice trip for some food I would say."}
{"text":"The food is horrible. But the beers are great the staff is wonderful and the atmosphere is nice. Only if they could have actual food instead of the nuked fast food items."}
{"text":"Stopped in for some drinks and appetizers. Clean and fresh looking decor. Food is typical Firkin. What made the evening was the friendly and attentive server. Cannot recall her name but a very nice Asian - Canadian young lady."}
{"text":"I just came here for a drink with a friend.   What I liked: -The inside is newly renovated and looks quite nice as opposed to the old British dive pub look -They have daily specials and on this day (a Saturday), 20 oz pint of Rickards Red or Creemore was $5 and I think they had a lasagna for $7. -They have a very nice patio.  Dislike: -Service seemed slightly slow (maybe 20 minute wait for my friend's food)  Verdict: seems like a great place to grab a brew and just shoot the breeze."}
{"text":"Passed by on a Sunday evening .. place had only a couple of people - kinda expected as it's in a industrial zone.  Place doesn't have any character but not much around - they have a nice outdoor patio that over looks the parking lot.   Had the dry ribs to start - barely ok - then had the fish n chips - fries were good but both the fish and ribs tasted as if they just came out of a frozen bag dropped in hot oil - had their own Pilsner \"Butler\" too fruity for my taste."}
{"text":"Great food and service..enjoyed watching the game with some friends and a few pints of beer."}
{"text":"There's nothing that stands out in this place.  Upon entering, I noticed that the venue is outdated.  There was no dedicated hostess waiting at the hostess platform.  They have a couple of tall round tables in the middle and then booths on the side.  The washroom is in plain sight right beside the bar counter.    They offer $5.00 pints of Butler, which is a good deal.  They also had $7 pint deals and $11 burger deal on a Monday. which really isn't much of a deal.  They only offer 1 lb of wings at $14.00.  They are non breaded, over-fried and very dry.  They came with 2 celery sticks and 2 carrots.  The size of the wings were all right, but the dryness took away any enjoyment I may have had eating wings, which is one of my favourite foods.  Fries on the side of wings are $2.00 extra.  The fries were limp and oily.  Overall one pound of wings with fries is $16.00, which I don't think is worth it at all."}
{"text":"Great place for brunch! I bought a groupon for it and it exceeded my expectations! I guess not a lot of people would think about going there for brunch since it was still pretty empty (not complaining since I got the server's undivided attention)  I love Caesars and they had a DIY Caesar bar! All the condiments laid out for you to stuff in your cup, including candied bacon- the best part is that they allow you to refill! (or I could be wrong and they just let us that day, please ask your server)   I think everything is priced reasonably, I'd go again for brunch :)"}
{"text":"I went here for Sunday brunch with my friend and I thought it would've been really childish but it surprised me. It was decorated as an English pub and had a bunch of flags and murals. We decided to have the firkin burger which was their signature burger and I am glad I got it. The burger was so big and packed with condiments I had to squish it. The patty was really juicy and tasted a lot like a stake. I wouldn't recommend you put ketchup on it because it kind of ruins the taste of the patty. Would you put ketchup on your steak? I'm guessing you don't. There is a spicy mayo that is spread on the buns and it is so good. My one complaint is that there is no free refills with the pop. The fries that came with the burger were so good they were crispy and not to oily. It sounds weird but the fries taste good if you dip them in the juices of the burger. Overall the burger was really good I highly recommend it."}
{"text":"surprisingly good. we were going to hare and firkin but they said the chef had gone for the night so they sent us on a road trip to find this location. so now where 40 min further out, hungry, and angry. and the service started off a bit mediocre. the girl must have been afraid of us because i was expecting her to suck, and the food to suck just as much. but after we got the apps everything changed.  the things good food does... makes angry people happy :) the wings were good, perogies good. we had 2 burgers, and fish and chips. and i will admit my love for crunchy things has been fulfilled for weeks because everything here was perfectly crunchy. the fries were beautiful, crunchy outside, with nice fluffy insides. even the waitress, turned out being nice, and told us about sauces and things we had no idea about from since were from the states.  def would go back."}
{"text":"Just came back from lunch at this place and I was shocked with the AMAZING service we got. We were a group of 7 people on our lunch break. At first it took forever for our food to come out because of how busy they were but since we were limited to time, we asked how much longer will it take for our food to come out. This was after waiting for an hour. Food came out right after AND surprisngly they took care of our bill. Food was good, I had the fish tacos and for dessert, I got the creme brulee cheesecake which hit the spot I'm HUGE on customer service and the fact they took care of us without asking deserves a 5 star on its own. A lot of us were new to this place so great first impressions!"}
{"text":"I've only been in for drinks but I enjoy this bar. It's a good size, with a number of seperate seating sections. Attracts a wide variety of patrons. They have a pool table by the patio. Fairly large menu of both food and drinks. Lots of parking. No complaints."}
{"text":"We decided to try some fairly traditional pub dishes from this establishment via skip the dishes. The platter of fried foods fell short in quality and we found it to be fairly forgettable. Over all it was not worth $18. The sweet potato fries were soggy and undercooked, the jalapeno corn fritter was so spicy it was inedible. The Firkin Burger was a hit, my bf devoured it with relish. The salad that accompanied was fairly sad and not touched by any of us. The pieces of carrots on top looked akin to kitchen waste after you peel carrots. Sorry, it really looked incredibly unappealing.  The chicken fingers were horrid. You would be better of buying a box of M&M meats chicken tenders. Fries were gross and soggy. Fairly disappointing when you can't get fries right. The chicken and waffles with Brussels sprouts was AMAZING, tad bit spicier than I expected, but I certainly enjoyed it. The Bangers and mash were not bad, the peas however seemed microwaved and that odd hard/dry peas in some bites was discerning. But overall it was easily overlooked as the mash, onions and gravy were quite delicious. The sausages were well cooked and seasoned well. It was a lot of food for 6 people, but we did enjoy sharing our opinions and getting an idea of what this establishment provides."}
{"text":"the food at this restaurant is horrible out of 10 dishes only 2 people didn't have complaints and they ordered the fries and onion rings  everything else was microwaved and the beef and chicken were very dry and tasted old  and the place has a very stale smell like it hasn't been cleaned in a long time"}
{"text":"Nice patio, great air conditioning in the dead heat of summer, but they are trying way too hard to push the food.  Every time we've gone they have almost tried to force menus on us even after only trying to enjoy a pitcher on the patio..  I wouldn't be against the food but the problem is that most of it is frozen.. the fries are frozen, burgers are frozen..  you can get way way better grub at Union Social next door but they don't have the great patio that the Drake does  Also we seem to always show up on their stupid \"wine deal\" night, wish they would lose that..  who goes to a Firkin bar to drink wine, especially in the dead of summer on a blistering hot patio?  Replace it with a deal on pitchers and we'd be here even more"}
{"text":"Has been our go-to place for years.  At least once per week.  Was disappointed today when I was told that they no longer offer free refills since most restaurants don't do this anymore.  With tip and tax it is $4.00 for a soda in a glass filled with ice.  3 sips and it's gone...  This seems like a cheap move when a typical bill is well over $35.00     It is the small things that bring you back or keep you away...  Will try another place next time and start a survey of 5 or 6 other places to see if the nonrefills policy is so widespread. And I might go back and report my findings."}
{"text":"This place was not good, in fact it was disappointing! I had dinner here 01/21/14. Had the house salad which was wilted & flavourless (had to ask twice for extra salad dressing). Also had wings cause they were 1/2 price on Wednesday's & now I know why. They were VERY tiny, flavourless, & cold!! You could also tell that they were reheated because the had that \"reheated flavour\". The service was extra slow & the waitress acted like she was doing us a favour. All-in-all this is NOT a do over & I would go so far as to say avoid this joint."}
{"text":"I keep going to Union Social because it's right next door and so good, but finally a friend of mine picked this place to go for dinner and it was great! Very different menu from Union Social, but pretty much equally delicious. I usually have the burgers at Union Social because they are amazing, but the calamari at the Drake was definitely better than the calamari at Union Social. I will definitely start dividing my time between these two places, except one big BUT: The Drake doesn't have a cocktail menu, which really bummed me out, but if you don't mind, this place will work for you."}
{"text":"Come for the beer and girls delivering it but skip the food..."}
{"text":"This seems to be the only place that shows NCAA college basketball games in the area. Food and beer are good too!"}
{"text":"The Roasted Porchetta with spicy apple sauce, mashed potatoes and green beans special was to die for! The beer could be colder though."}
{"text":"Haven't been in a while. Stopped in for a quick refreshment and bite while family busy at an event. Had a very quick and welcoming greeting and decided to sit in the cozy living room area to watch the game and eat.  Service was fast, ice cold Guinness came up in due course and my chorizo tacos were not long after.  Food was delicious, like the atmosphere, servers are friendly. Not much more to ask. Why not a 5 then? Somewhat limited selection on the menu, especially for the entrees, and they didn't have my favorite drink on tap, Kilkenny. Only in a can, which quite honestly I can stay home for.  Except then I have to do the dishes afterwards."}
{"text":"If you've been to one new FIRK'in place, you've been to them all!  Well mostly, the people either make it or break it.  The food on it's own isn't all that...and the beers can only do so much to keep the place hopping along.  It's an A-OK place to hang out and chat with a bud that I haven't seen in years.  A MEH place for other things.  There are two bars in this strip mall.  This place and Union Social.  Was going to go to the U but the place looked like it was filling up and I didn't want to have to yell over a screaming lunch crowd.  Drinks were cold and served to us by nice gal.  The manager politely had a cordial conversation with us.  The food was abysmal as the chicken wings were yet to be unfeathered before cooking and brought to the table.  Yew?!?!  Cooked us another batch and assured us it would be good.  Gave it to the kids when I got home and behold, another batch of semi-unfeathered wings.  Double...Yew!  Union Social it is! Cheers!"}
