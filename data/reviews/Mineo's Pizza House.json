{"text":"I imagine the reason why some people rave about this pizza is the same thing that made me dislike it.  I noticed a difference as soon as I picked up the take-out box. This pizza was HEAVY. Way heavier than any other box of pizza I've carried. At home, the reason became clear: there is an insane amount of cheese on top. I mean seriously crazy. The mass of the cheese definitely outweighs the dough and all the other ingredients combined.  So, the good news: if you are primarily craving greasy cheesy goodness, you'll be in heaven. The top of the cheese was browned deliciously, and the bottom of the crust was nicely browned too. Smells great, also.  But, the bad news: nothing in between got baked, because it was insulated by the cheese jacket. So the (bland) sauce left the top of the crust soggy; the mushrooms were soggy; the (curiously flavorless) sausage was soggy. It was a bunch of soggy lukewarm unbaked pizza ingredients, sandwiched inside a thin crust and swaddled in tasty but excessive cheese.  I'd love to love Mineo's pizza. And I sincerely appreciate that the staff were super nice about fixing a mistake they'd made with the order. I'd try them again if I'm ever drunk at 2am and craving grease, but until then, this is not the pizza for me."}
{"text":"So, I have had Mineo's 3 times. The first two times it was bleh, but I really enjoyed it last night.  My previous complaints were that it was greasy and salty, but the pizza I had last night was perfect.  I feel conflicted about this place.  I will try it one more time and update my review accordingly."}
{"text":"I have been dying to try Mineo's for two years. Finally, after helping my girlfriend and her roommate move into their new apartment we decided to treat ourselves to Mineo's.  We go in, its pretty busy, order two pizzas, one cheese and one pepperoni and we wait about 15 minutes (the place is very busy as expected) and voila we get them.  I have never been so overwhelmed by so much cheese and grease in my life. Two feelings came over me after eating 1 slice of Mineo's pizza: I was going to fall on the floor and die of an immediate heart attack and the other, I felt like a fat greasy pig. The pepperoni was covered in 2 thick layers of greasy cheese, it must have been 5 inches thick. Ummm, gross!!!"}
{"text":"I wanted to rate it 1 star, but the selection of beer/ice cream saved them.   Started with the large pepperoni, and that's where I finished with mineo's. The cheese is overbearing, doesn't stick to anything which almost forces you to eat with a fork and knife. On top of that it takes like chuckie cheese and you don't even get to play any games! The pepperoni wasn't cooked well, and the sauce was less than expected. Just about the only thing that raised an eye was the dough, but not enough to bring me back.   This place also had all of their, 'awards', hanging around, and hasn't won anything meaningful in ~7 years.   The management weeny unnoticed; the front end was very rude. I'm surprised they even found the drink I asked for, or even gave us plastic ware.   At $19.90, rip off indeed. I do not even recommend trying this terrible pizza shop under it's current conditions. And parking is a disaster!"}
{"text":"This is my go to place for pizza. I love the flavor of the cheese . This is what I do when I get my pizza. I sit and wait for 10 mins or more so the cheese can cool down and harden. After that I take slow bites and enjoy the goodness."}
{"text":"Not a lot of places in Pittsburgh do Sicilian pizza. Mineo's does it well. Do not overestimate how much you can eat-- one piece is probably the equivalent of 2 slices of regular pizza. I actually like their sauce, and the cheese is good. If anything there's too much cheese!  The restaurant itself is kind of shabby. I don't look too closely at the floor and doubt the grated cheese ever sees the inside of a fridge, but it's nice to have this place within walking distance for a quick slice of pizza. The fact that they have ice cream makes it a good place to take kids, too."}
{"text":"The Pizza is above average for Pittsburgh but that is not saying much for Pittsburgh pizza.  It does not even compare to pizza from New York or Chicago but takes a close second to a DiGiorno pizza."}
{"text":"Favorite pittsburgh pizza shop around. Doesnt quite compare to my dear pizza my heart @ home, but definitely havent found anything better in the area. Staff is very friendly. Pizza is greasy but good."}
{"text":"Called to see when their kitchen was open till, was told 1am on the phone. I got there at 12 and was told they stop serving at 1230. I quickly ordered because after a 20 min drive there i didn't have time to go elsewhere, and was met with rude comments like \"what you don't have a watch\". When my food came i was basically old to leave because they were closing so i ate half of it and left. At 4am I woke up and got very sick, my friend who was with me had the same thing happen at the same time. I believe they did something to the pizza and will never go back. Terrible beer prices, over rated pizza that lives by its name not its quality."}
{"text":"Best Pizza in Pittsburgh!!! NO CONTEST!!!  Doesn't even need toppings but try a pepperoni pie and it'll get you wet!!!  Yup, You should try that!!!"}
{"text":"Growing up this place was a 10 star. 3 years ago this place was at least a 4 1/2 if not 5. Now like all good things Mineo's quality has come to an end. It was and has always been a dirty little spot. The dirt  makes it taste better. But the sausage on my pie was chewy and weird. Like I got the cheap meat. Sigh... I had waited 3 years. Now this is no longer a special place just your average PGH pie."}
{"text":"Well, since my previous review of Mineo's, I left Pittsburgh and returned a few months ago.  I gave them another try and I must change my prior assessment of their pizza.  I don't know if they've changed how they make it, but the problems I listed before weren't so apparent this time.  I still wouldn't say they make the best pizza in Pittsburgh, but it is definitely good."}
{"text":"Mineos the bomb yo for that ill delishus pizza at 1 in the monin. Betta check ya self befo ya reck yoself. Word.  No but seriously, it's delicious - been my #1 pizza go to for 20+ years."}
{"text":"After having Bellasario's pizza in West Mifflin that I did not like, I was looking to try some in my favorite place so far (I'm new to the 'burgh, was born here but not raised, and I am eyes wide- small town girl in a big city) Squirrel Hill. I initially set out to get something to eat then it turned into a Jerry's run (I lost the three dollars change he gave me. LOL) and as I was approaching Jerry's I saw someone walk down Murray Ave with awesome smelling pizza. I went up Murray Ave after I got my vinyl fix and found Mineo's. I ordered two slices with mushrooms and bacon and it was, so far, the best pizza I have ever had and that's saying something, as Harrisburg had Mama's on 2nd Street downtown.  I noticed all the accolades on the wall near where I was sitting and they were all older but I am sure well deserved. Someone here said that it was much better a long time ago though I wasn't here so I can't compare it. 4 stars because I have not been through the entire city and apparently there is 1,000+ pizza joints in this town. Can't say it's the best as I have only eaten at two joints. Best as of today though!"}
{"text":"It's ok. Better than most in Pittsburgh but definitely would not survive in New York or New Jersey. I am not trying to be a snob or anything, it's just that the pizza itself is not outstanding and it's pretty expensive for what it is. Plus every pie I've taken out has been super soggy and floppy."}
{"text":"I was a little disconcerted when I picked up my pizza box to take home because it was super heavy. Twice as heavy as any other large pizza I've ever encountered. I was expecting a major dough-wad when I got home. When I opened the box I was shocked that there were no pepperonis on my pepperoni pizza. Too late to go back, I took a bite and discovered the pepperonis were under the cheese!!   I am happy to report that the pizza was not the pepperoni-less dough-wad that I had feared, but was instead a delicious pepperoni pizza! The cheese was pretty thick. It took longer than they said it would for the pizza to be ready (they weren't busy and it was on a Wednesday) and the pizza was a little more expensive than I was expecting, but I was generally satisfied."}
{"text":"The pizza was pretty good. Decently crispy crust, plenty of sauce and a load of toppings. I ordered a pepperoni, sausage, and bacon pizza and we really were impressed by the amount of cheese and meat that were on it.   That being said, the taste just wasn't phenomenal or anything. Took a long time to get the pizza. Neat neighborhood and decent pizza though. I thought it was a classic dive style pizza place."}
{"text":"Best pizza. Period. Employees aren't the friendliest, the seating isn't especially comfortable and the decor isn't any more exciting than the next pizza house, but I absolutely love their greasy, salty, cheesy pizza."}
{"text":"Worst pizza I've ever had! So soggy and too much sauce. I hate it when the crust is soggy!!!"}
{"text":"By far the best pizza in Pittsburgh. The crust is perfectly thin, the sauce is great. Too much cheese? Maybe, but thats better than not enough."}
{"text":"Decent pizza. As far as the whole Mineo's vs Aiello's, I don't have a preference which is why I rated them the same. In my opinion, Aiello's sauce is slightly peppery for my taste, but Mineo's is slightly greasy for my taste.  Back to just Mineo's...if you like greasy pizza then you will probably like this place. I don't mind a little, but I literally have to use 3-4 napkins per slice just to blot the grease down to a minimum. As far as customer service, these guys have been constantly grumpy and short-tempered every time I had gone in the past.   So if you want pizza in Sq. Hill, like greasy pizza and don't mind dealing with pissy employees, then try it out. If you don't like either of these things, I wouldn't waste your time."}
{"text":"Bad service. Ordered a pizza for pickup. Got there and paid, was told it would be a minute. Was told 25 minutes when I ordered it, was probably 20 minutes when I paid. After a half hour of waiting, I walked up to the counter to see what was taking so long. Another guy was being told they screwed up his order and could make his Pizza in 15 minutes. It was the same thing I ordered, so I asked what happened to my Pizza, the employee asked another guy at the oven, he said it's out and pointed to a box sitting there. I asked how long has it been there, said I was standing here for a half hour. The employee handed me the pizza and said sorry, the owner was standing behind me, gave me a dirty look when I was walking out. That probably explains the lousy service. Pizza was ok, but extremely greasy. Not at all what I remembered when I are here before."}
{"text":"Consistently great pizza. Although the Sicilian doesn't blow my socks off, everything else is superb."}
{"text":"Cheese lovers congregate!  This pizza is just the best!  Tangy sauce, crust the perfect thickness ( not thin or thick) toppings plentiful. They fedex pizzas around the country for a reason folks. We are lucky in da burg to have this place!  5*"}
{"text":"I grew up eating  this pizza. It's very good. I think it's better when you order it by the cut instead of a whole pie. Its crispier & the toppings are on top instead of under the cheese  it's definitely pretty expensive and not pizza for eating every day. But it's quite good& enjoyable"}
{"text":"I am born and raised in NY and pizza is my favorite food.  So I have high pizza standards.  This pizza is the best in PIttsburgh and right up there with the best places in NY.  The sausage comes in crumbles, and tastes like it has to be home made.  Not the manufactured balls or slices you see at other places.  There is plenty of cheese and it has just the right amount of salt.  Although it's a little pricey you definitely get your money's worth.  You will get stuffed from 2-3 slices.  I usually eat half the pie at which point I have trouble breathing but it's worth it.  The best part though is the sauce... it is like crack.  I could drink a bowl of it.  Just writing this is making my mouth water.  Also, they have a large assortment of bottled beer that's reasonably priced.  And there's plenty of seating with a low-key, simple, old-fashioned pizza shop feel to it.  I've been here many times with friends and they all love it too.  I've only eaten in, and that's how I'd recommend eating it... fresh out of the oven.  You will not be disappointed."}
{"text":"I LOVE this place.  It is the best pizza I've had in the city.  Cash only but they have an ATM in the shop.  I go there pretty much on a weekly basis and I get the pepperoni pizza and a meatball appetizer.  The pepperoni slices are really thick and they put them under the cheese.  The crust is thin and crispy and the sauce is amazing.  The meatballs are a must have!  This is a family owned and operated business and they deliver excellent service and food consistently."}
{"text":"I understand that there are people who don't like this pizza. What I don't understand, is where the heck they're coming from. We discovered this place back in 2008 while staying at the airport Hilton, on recommendation by the concierge. I had never eaten so much as a slice while in Pittsburgh prior to that, and we ordered a pepperoni pie to share right there. It was, and still is, my absolute favorite pizza of all time from that moment on. I've just never had those flavors replicated anywhere else, and wouldn't change a thing about the sauce, crust, or especially the cheese. In my opinion, this beats the best that New York or Chicago has to offer, and is the underrated gold standard of American pizza. What more can I say? I'm getting some Fed- Exed to NY asap, and I can't wait to be back in the steel city for more!"}
{"text":"Pretty good but I still prefer a vinnys pizza over anything."}
{"text":"I've come here twice.  Once on a usual ordinary weekday night, delicious.  I was eating for about an hour when the waiter said something like, \"I'd better get you guys a box, no way will you two finish that.\"  We were there for another half hour as I ate the last three pieces, while my girlfriend watched.  Gluttony at its finest.  The second time, returning from a weekend backpacking trip, thinking, \"what would be the most satiating, comforting food spot that we can stop at after physical exhaustion and a diet composed of freeze-dried foods for days?\"  Our mutual decision without much discussion:  Mineo's, and it was the right decision, and it was the right decision...  You can read other reviews for the specifics of the pizza, but the facts above deserve some consideration when deciding on where to get that hot savory slice."}
{"text":"Hands down my favorite pizza in town.  The crust is just thick enough to support the mounds of cheese that is on top.  In my opinion toppings are optional, the cheese pizza stands on its own."}
{"text":"Meh.  My friends rave about this place & all of its awards.  I don't see what the big deal is.  The sauce is good, but there's way too much cheese.  Good for a late night snack is nothing else but Eat n Park is open, but they're so slow!  The trick to eating the pizza is waiting 5 minutes for it to cool first, otherwise the cheese will never stay on - unfortunately, when the pizza takes 20 minutes to get to the table at midnight, another 5 minutes seems like forever."}
{"text":"they use too much cheese, not enough sauce, and the bottom crust is too thin.  pizza amir on forward is better."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza place growing up, the place in Squirrel Hill makes the best pizza I've ever had. I recently moved back to the 'Burgh with my wife (who was convinced she knew her favorite pizza from Colorado) and for nostalgia's sake I ordered the pepperoni & mushroom w/ extra cheese. The brilliance of this place is in their pies (if you just want a slice head up street) but their full-size 'large' pie is the best tasting pizza as well as a great value (would be an XXL at any chain) and holds up in the fridge for days. It's cash only so be prepared, ATM on site and they sell single beers, 6-pk's & all kinds of other foods (cannoli is fresh filled and also delicious).   My wife has never mentioned any desire to try any other pizza joint since. I'm sitting here waiting to pick up another one and my mouth's practically watering. Also, be sure you call the right location. They're cool about it, don't get me wrong, but it sucks for them (and for you when you find out your hot delicious pizza is in Mt. Lebanon if you're in Sq. Hill, and vice versa.)  Try it. Don't look back."}
{"text":"Coming of age in Squirrel Hill, our crew frequented Mineos multiple times a week. Back in 97' while eating a Mineos Pizza, myself and 3 friends formed a Pizza gang called the Pizza Lovers.   We had Pizza Lovers tee shirts made at Bar Mitzvahs that we wore around Squirrel Hill. The shirts had a giant Mineos pizza pie on the front with our four favorite toppings--onions, mushrooms, black olives and green peppers. We were one of Squirrel Hill's most feared Jewish pizza gangs.    For many who grow up in the Burgh' Mineos is the first meal you eat when you come back to town.  There's something about walking into Mineos Pizza House.   \"Gimme 3 cuts, black olive.\"   You're back home, the home of the Pizza Lovers."}
{"text":"Dry, flavorless crust with a ton of white flour coating the edge...ugh.  Sorry, but that pizza was no better than what you find at chuck e cheese"}
{"text":"My friend fedex'd me two pizzas to Seattle.  I was amazed to find they tasted just as good as when they come right out of the oven at the pizza shop!"}
{"text":"I LOVE MINEOS. Dominic Always does it right. All I can say is... Can Aiello's do it like MINEOS? Nah... Nah they can't. Just sayin'."}
{"text":"This place has one of the best pizzas I have ever had. It's loaded with cheese on a thin crust and it's cooked perfectly."}
{"text":"FINALLLLLLY!!! a fabulous pizza place that i can crave when i'm hungry! i have been searching for pizza place since my stay in pittsburgh and this is so far the one! bought a slice and mmmm it was so damn good. really cheesy which i LOVE! i'm also planning to try Aiello's pizza soon after reading the reviews (:! SUPER excited to find a great pizza place! But I was just was disappointed at the pizza slice size when i got it, it seemed rather small. I don't know if I just got a small slice or it's always like this? I'm just used to the big slices in nyc i guess (: but overall it was really good!"}
{"text":"Worst & most overrated Pizza in the 'Burgh.  People who like this place don't know good pizza.  The cheese is disgusting, and the crust and sauce are nothing to write home about.  Simply awful."}
{"text":"Not quite as good as the Squirrel Hill location, but quick service. Would recommend the Sicilian Pizza over the usual style."}
{"text":"Great cheese and pepperoni pizza - really cheesy and greasy (in a good way).  I would skip the veggie pizza though - the veggies are cut a little too big and chunky."}
{"text":"Hands down, best pizza in pittsburgh. no contest."}
{"text":"I like to get Mineo's pizza as a treat, it's not an everyday pizza for me.  Of course, I grew up eating a thin crust pizza and that's still my favorite kind.  The crust is really yummy, the cheese is thick and delicious, and I love the pepperoni - it's very flavorful.  The white pizza with spinach is also really good.  I've had the Italian sub and it's good, the flavors are a little bit different from what I'm used to.  As for service, I've never had a problem with the staff.  They typically aren't happy-go-lucky people, but they have always been cordial when I've been there.  I don't expect table service in a pizza place usually, that's not a standard where I grew up so I'm used to it."}
{"text":"We're picking up out weekly pizza from Mineos in about half an hour. Best American pizza I've had since 2003 in Brooklyn (Sunset Park, Elegante, don't know if they're still around). Legit thin crust, lots of cheese, etc. Maybe someday I'll try Aiello's, if Mineos takes a month-long vacation. We always just pick it up and take it home, so no deeper insight than that the food rocks."}
{"text":"First time at Mineo's and I loved it! Be aware it's a cash only establishment. They do have an on site ATM but it has a fee. Had some issues with finding parking, and thought the places was really not that great upon stepping inside (kind of a dump). Went up to the corner and ordered. Not too many options to pick from. Beverages are by the bottle (pop, beers) Chose a 12\" pie with ricotta cheese and double cheese. Wait time was about a half hour. They call your name to come back to the counter and pick it up. Some may not like it, but we loved the puddle of oil (?) on top (you can dab it with some napkins if you want but it adds to the taste imo). The crust was soooooo good! The cheese was so stretchy (more than I've ever seen). Overall this was some darn good pizza! I would definitely return in a heartbeat and would recommend this place to anyone looking for really good pizza!"}
{"text":"I was visiting from out of town.  What more can I say than this is the best pizza I have ever had.  And I have had a lot of pizza in a lot of places.  Pie perfection in every possible way."}
{"text":"Mineos is by far the best pizza in Pittsburgh. 2 convenient locations."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best pizza in Pittsburgh, and quite possibly the world. I've tried pizza in NY, LA, NJ, Venice, and many more places. Nothing compares to the powerhouse of a pizza that is Mineo's. Perfect cheese, crust, and sauce. It really has it all. Disregard any negative reviewers on the grounds of stupidity: If you plebeians don't like cheese, why are you eating pizza? Get breadsticks or some terrible $5 ready-made garbage that I'm sure you ungrateful imbeciles probably prefer. If you want a REAL pizza, heavy with high quality cheese and ingredients, look no further than Mineo's. The other local \"competitors\" can't hold a candle to Mineo's. I've proudly been eating at Mineo's for about 20 years, and I would continue overnighting their pizza anywhere if I were ever to move out of Pittsburgh. It's that good.   I even created a Yelp account specifically to counter some of the nonsense that I'm reading on here."}
{"text":"Their pizza is phenomenal! I love how they put the toppings under the cheese. Always done perfectly! Be warned though- it is cash only!"}
{"text":"Grew up on mineo's pizza. Everytime I get back to Pittsburgh, I get up to th squirrel hill location for my slices. Great pizza!"}
{"text":"Mineos used to be the best! Real sausage out the door, its sliced kielbasa now...and mushrooms from the can thrown on your pizza..yea I'll done. They have lost a customer of 10+ years! Fioris...here I come!"}
{"text":"Huge fan since a youth however my last visit is my last. Ordered a half-baked large pepperoni to go then walked across the street to my parked car to drive home. Shortly thereafter I noticed that my pants had splattered oil across the front and I pulled over to further inspect the situation. Needless to say the oil was all over the floor mat as well. Totally confused I called to share my unexpected story. Mineo's was polite on the phone and said the owner would call me - yet here we are several days later and no follow up. I'm busy too and all that said the purpose of my post is to make others aware that they should inspect their boxes and wear rain suits before exiting the premises. #notHalfBaked #lineYourBoxes #ruinedShirtNjeans"}
{"text":"Diggin the new bar/outdoor seating area!!  This summer has had some great nights for enjoying a pizza in the open air, while also enjoying your favorite beverage!  Hubby and I ordered a pizza and sat at the bar the other night, pizza was fabulous, bartender friendly and made great drinks!  Will be doing this again soon!"}
{"text":"Love Mineo's pizza! We usually order traditional crust with onions/spinach/mushrooms. It is just AMAZING! The cheese they use for the pizza is the best I have had in Pittsburgh. So good! And I love their dough too, thin in the middle and thicker on the outside. And it tastes great!  I know they have other food items too, and we want to try them as well, but the pizza is just so good that we always end up ordering that."}
{"text":"This is my Friday pizza spot.  The bartenders are friendly, the atmosphere is great and the pizza is high quality.  You can absolutely tell that they use the freshest ingredients and really pride themselves on selling a high quality pizza.  The sell individual slices but you are better off ordering a small so you know it's always fresh.  One suggestion: order the pie well done, you won't regret it.  I'd give it 5 stars but I'm a bit of a pizza guru and feel that none of the pizza establishments in Pittsburgh would fall into the elite category."}
{"text":"Mineo's is the Mecca of pizza! I grew up in Pittsburgh on Mineo's and Aiello's and on every return visit, it is a mandatory stop.  The cheese is cheesy (100% mozzarella), the sauce is nice and tangy, and the dough is both soft and crusty. Several years ago, they tweaked the crust recipe (with corn flour?), but last time I was in the 'Burgh, the crust was seemingly back to normal.  Pittsburgh has the best pizza in the USA!"}
{"text":"My dad raves about this place and always encourages me to stop in. I finally gave in and stopped through one day on my way home from studying at Uptown.  I ordered 2 slices of pepperoni to go for less than $5. I was sad that they didn't have an actual pepperoni pie; they just slapped pepperoni on the plain slices and tossed it in the over. That's my only complaint.  When I got home, I was really excited to get to chewing. The bottom crust was crunchy and good (I couldn't eat the end bits of crust because it was a little hard). The pepperoni was authentic, thick, and spicy. The pizza was super greasy and cheesy, but flavorful and delicious.  I will be trying again when I have the cash in my pocket."}
{"text":"Very friendly staff. We ordered rice balls and John's Special pizza. The vegetables were fresh and slightly crunchy; just right!  Lots of cheese and the sauce was great. So glad we went here instead of the chain pizza place near our hotel."}
{"text":"One of the best pizzas ever eaten  and I LOVE pizza!!!  I miss it!  The pepperonni underneath the cheese is amazing..greasy n all.  Great for when you're hungover from a night out in Da Burgh...yum!"}
{"text":"Was on a business trip in Pittsburgh and decided to explore some good places in the area. Our über driver recommended this place and told us that it is the best pizza place and a must stop in Pittsburgh so we decided to give it a try.  Food - We ordered pizza by slice. I ordered 1 slice of traditional pizza with toppings and one with just cheese (lots of cheese) and my co workers got the Sicilian style with a few toppings. The pizza looked average and taste was not that great at all! We were expecting something really good after reading so many Yelp reviews and so much praise of this place from our driver but we were highly disappointed. I would say that I would definitely not come back here if I want a good pizza. A home made pizza tastes better than this!  Drinks- We ordered wine,beer and whiskey; they don't have a big wine selection but a lot of beer options just like an average bar so not bad in that respect.   Overall comments- The place isn't too big, the ambience is okay just like any other bar, they have a few tables outside that covers the side walk so I would say it's not too comfortable to sit when other people are walking past you continuously. The service was okay, there was only one person serving 3 tables and a few people sitting at the bar so it was very slow and you had to get up or call him if you need something. The worst part is that the place is CASH ONLY! So make sure you have cash in your pocket if you go there, otherwise there is an ATM nearby (in case). Conclusion - Not recommended by me!  Cheers and live,laugh and love!"}
{"text":"Overall: One of Pittsburgh's better pies, but definitely for eating only on premise. Better service than Aiellos, but the pie is heavier, greasy, and not as fresh. Come here on occasion, but Aiellos wins across the board. ____________________________________________ Ambience: (3/5). Dim lighting, dingy pizza parlor table-tops, and framed accolades and family photos turn this into a pizza den. Crowded, booth-only dining area save for the stools for the island in the middle. The front counter is the kitchen, so you'll leave smelling like pizza. ____________________________________________ Service: (3/5). Rushed but pleasant. The 10+ people behind the counter swap in and out, delivering pies and taking orders. It's cafeteria style, vending machine included, and you do have to give them your dirty tray.  ____________________________________________ Drinks: (1/5). Soda, and nothing special. Ice cream is served next door. ____________________________________________ Food: (3/5). An experience in excess, and if you want grease and cheese, this is it. The cheese is thicker than the crust, slides off at least 50% of the time. 2-3 paper plates are soaked at the end of a pepperoni.. spicy and occasionally burnt. Crust is thin and absorbs a large amount of grease. The sauce is occasionally burnt on, otherwise thin, thankfully salty. Pepperoni or mushroom are good bets here, as are onion and sausage. You DO NOT need extra cheese."}
{"text":"Jekyll and Hyde was first published in 1886, but the issue here is much older, and more important. It's that $1M pizza question: \"dine-in or take-out?\" The pie is going to change in some way during the ride home, it always does. You lift that box cover up and hope your warm, respectable favorite is still inside. You fear a cold, mangled monster.  So are you for take-out or dine-in? I dine-in 99% of the time. Fresher, hotter, no sliding in the box, no temptation to sneak slices while driving, no mess on your car or carpet, easier clean up and no disposal of a cardboard box that doesn't fit in the trash or recycling. The promise of the Pizza+Beer+TV trifecta calls from the comfort of your couch, but I prefer my pies dine-in any time. Ok, not March Madness.  Not Mineo's. The restaurant has captured a nostalgia with its ambiance. Dimly lit cafeteria tables and comfortless booths transform into a cozy family spot like the days of \"Book-It\". Littering the walls are pizza awards (some two-decades old) and the owner's mullet-heavy family portraits (all two decades old). Love it. The soda machine glows. The counter is crowded and the boisterous kitchen loud. All that's missing is Contra in the corner.  Yet even with ALL that, don't dine-in. Mineo's pizza NEEDS that 15 minute ride home. The quarter-inch layer of mozz will bleed out grease if you dine-in when it's scalding hot. Multiple paper plates will be soaked through. You'll need another soda halfway through to wash down the extreme salt from the sauce and pepperoni. Plastic forks and knives will melt and bend as you try to cut through the chewy yet grease-soggy crust. You laugh--\"Use a fork and knife?\" The cheese will slide off if you don't, guaranteed.   So enjoy mineo's, which is at the lower end of Pittsburgh's best pizza. And yes, DO try this at home."}
{"text":"I went to Mineo's today for the 1st time. Everyone RAVES about how GREAT the pizza here is.... So I took my daughter and girlfriend and we ordered a Large Cheese Pizza. It was SUPER greasy and had WAY too much Cheese! I lived in Brooklyn for a few years, I know pizza!! This was horrible! This pizza is in the top 5 WORST pizza's of all time, that is unless you like greasy soggy pizza......"}
{"text":"The white pizza is delicious from here, our office always gets a white and a pepperoni pizza and they never disappoint!  HOWEVER, they apparently only have a 2 Mike delivery radius, so most people in Dormont can't get delivery."}
{"text":"I visited here with several of my friends for dinner and we all had a good experience.  For the pizza, I would rate it as average overall.  All of the pizzas we ordered had a lot of cheese, sauce, and toppings which resulted in a pretty heavy slice of pizza that some of my friends complained about being too greasy.  I generally dislike pizzas that are loaded down with toppings, but it wasn't a deal-breaker in this case because the cheese and sauce were tasty.  The crust was the best part of the whole pizza, with decent flavor and a good crumb.  Service was great and friendly as well. They also had a great variety of six packs of beer for sale and a decent variety available on draft."}
{"text":"Best pie on the planet!    The reviews that claim it's more nostalgic than anything and if you don't know \"real\" pizza... blah blah blah.  I've traveled the world and have had \"pizza\" all over the globe, including Rome (which doesn't even use much cheese unless you go for a cheesy pizza).  Nostalgic?  Absolutely!!  But, I've had NY pizza and like it very much too, but it is no Mineo's, it is a skinny delicate thing that NEEDS to be folded or you'll chip your teeth before you hit substance.    You simply can not fold Mineo's, it's too rich full of goodies.  It'd be like complaining that you can't fold a lasagne.    It is a cross between a Chicago deep dish and a New York thin pizza.    I had an old GF from that area that used to put 15 or so napkins on top of the freshly made pie to sop up the oily juice. LOL    It is a hard pie to pick up since it has so much cheese, sauce and fillings.  What makes the place amazing for me is the pepperoni pizza.  The pepperonis are so pepper filled and spicy and overly abundant, under the cheese, that the spicyness  becomes a part of the slice, instead of simply on top of it.  I live in Lauderdale now, but maybe the pizza is so rich because, yes, they do grow us bigger there and it is colder, so a rich meal sustains us throughout the winter.  (summer too. LOL)  If you love their pies then you do.  If it is too much for you, then go for the dainty NY skinny stuff.  Pizza is a name, not a recipe, other than it's round.  Oh yeah, some are square.  Nevermind."}
{"text":"Hands down the best pizza place I've been to and is a must have if you are in the Squirrel Hill area.  It's cash only (there is an ATM onsite) so don't plan on paying with a credit card.  The toppings are placed under the piles of cheese they put on the pizza (there is no need to order extra cheese like you would have to at other establishments).  The crust is a yellow dough and is very good.  It's a unique taste - they make their own dough, sauce, and cheese mix.  Parking is street parking and can be challenging at times."}
{"text":"Had this pizza for an office party. Since the person who bought it did carry-out, I guess one can take this review with a grain of salt, seeing as I have no idea how long the pizza took to make, how long it sat out, etc.   The options were Hawaiian, cheese, and pepperoni, which was really more like a cheese pizza with the occasional pepperoni in the proverbial haystack. The crust was just so thick, and it seemed like the whole thing was just cheese and bread. This made it taste relatively good within the first five minutes of eating, but eventually turned into a force feeding-I had read such fantastic reviews about the pizza, so I wanted to like it.  The saving grace was probably the sauce-I'm a fan of the sweet stuff, so it was exactly how I liked it."}
{"text":"This is how pizza should be done! Great thin crust; generous helpings of cheese and perfect sauce. The pepperoni and sausage were also fantastic. They had pizza by the slice and I actually ordered a pizza to go after finishing our whole pizza at the restaurant. Top notch pizza!"}
{"text":"Best pizza ever!!! Waiting on my FIL while he is in surgery - perfect comfort food! Be sure to try pittsburgh's favorite, \"Turner's Iced Tea!\"  Yummmmm"}
{"text":"Mineo's Pizza is a pizza place we've been getting from ever since I was little. The pizza is amazing and it's right in the heart of squirrel hill surrounded by other shops! The sizes of their pizza's are huge! This is the original Mineo's however there is also one in Mt. Lebanon. If you want pretty good pizza, that everyone talks about, go to Mineo's!"}
{"text":"Gross pizza. Way too hot. Poor service. Dirty dining room. People in Pittsburgh actually like this place because they've never had a decent pizza before in their life. It's sad."}
{"text":"To this day, my favorite pizza house in all of Pittsburgh, just slightly beating out Fiori's.   Chunky sweet sauce that finishes with a tiny bit of heat. Crusty yellow dough with flour along for the ride. And of course gobs and gobs of salty cheese. Does have a tendency to slide off on the first (piping hot) bite but I'm used to it.  Most of the time I get plain pizza but also enjoy their mushroom. Since they put their toppings under the cheese the canned mushrooms work really well. I always avoid pepperoni as if I ever do order it somewhere I want it crispy and you won't get that here.  Super friendly staff - I rarely eat in but the expansion and remodeling they've done is nice."}
{"text":"No one believes me when I say the best pizza is in Pittsburgh, but it's true. Hard to choose between Mineo's and Aiello's.  But from this far away, I would say it's a tie."}
{"text":"This pizza is a classic!  If you visit Pittsburgh, you have to try it.  The shop is not big on \"ambiance.\"  It is a casual little pizza shop with a few tables, very small, very VERY informal.  But, man is that pizza great.  I love the sauce!"}
{"text":"I went to Mineo's yesterday in Squirrel Hill. I was on Murray Avenue to get my computer repaired (I'll review that later), and I figured it would be a good chance to try \"the best pizza in Pittsburgh\". I wasn't  terribly impressed. I don't really understand the hype.   The crust is just too thin. Its literally about 1/3cm thick. Like the thickness of stacking two CDs on each other. There's way too much sauce and way too much cheese for the wafer thin crust. Plus its pretty expensive for pizza in Pittsburgh plus they're skimpy on the toppings. I like thin crust. But the crust was so thin the pizza was uneatable without silverware. And since they don't have any silverware, you're forced to eat it with a plastic fork. And since you have to eat it on a paper plate, you end up cutting through the paper and/or eating some of it....the sauce and grease from the pizza seep through the plate.  After we realized that you can't eat the pizza like a normal human, it wasn't that bad. Everything tasted good. The cheese was delicious. I just don't understand the hype.  A medium cheese pizza is like $12.70. We got it half sausage, half mushroom. There was hardly any toppings on the pizza and for some reason, they were all around the outter edge of the pie. We also got a garden salad. The salad's six bucks and its pretty big. There was plenty for myself, my daughter and my friend. I was hoping for some homemade Italian dressing or something special but you just get a packet of Ken's.  Speaking of my daughter...she loved the pizza. 2 year olds don't mind turning into the sloppy, saucy messes that grownups don't usually enjoy. After the pizza cooled off enough for her to eat it...she dived head first into sauce and cheese and paper-thin crust and emerged a sloppy red mess. She told us several times that \"This is good pizza\". So hey, Mineo's...you had at least one fan at our table.  The service was excellent. Everyone was nice and courteous. My only complaint is they're stingy with the plates and the plasticware. Considering the fact that its impossible to eat this pizza without a fork and knife, I find this very odd. And considering the fact that your paper plate will get sippy soppy with grease and sauce and shred itself....I don't know why they don't just hand you a stack of plates an inch high. Or at least get better paper plates.  Final verdict? This is NOT the best pizza in Pittsburgh. Not even close. I really hope the Yinz don't take their out of town friends to this place to show them what \"Pittsburgh pizza is like\", its just going to scare them. In a town with at least a half dozen pizza places within delivery range of every residence...there's at least a hundred pizza shops that serve better pies. The pizza tasted great....but it was structurally unsound. If they put less cheese or made a thicker crust, it might work.  After we ate pizza, we went next door to their little ice cream/beer shop. We ordered a sundae and it was $3.65 and huge! The guy who made it asked me how I wanted it made and I just told him to make a good sundae and the guy did indeed make a good sundae. My daughter loved it, that's for sure. And it was huge....we all got our fill and I took half it home for the next time she's in an ice cream mood.  While I wasn't drinking....the beer shop was well stocked with 6-packs of all sorts of tasty look beverages. I didn't check the prices but I'm sure they're in line with the rest of the city's monopolistic price-schemes."}
{"text":"Hands down, Mineo's has the best pizza in Pittsburgh, if not the country.    The pizza is perfect, with a thick layer of cheese and a thin crispy crust.  I dig the pepperoni the most, as its baked under the cheese and combines perfectly with it.  Their sausage is also mad good.    If you're ever in Pittsburgh, stop here.  You don't even need to go anywhere else."}
{"text":"This is one of the things I miss most from Pittsburgh. I think Mineo's is my all time favorite pizza. I only lived in the 'burgh for 4 years during college, but Mineo's will always be in my heart - or at least I'm sure it has had some long term affect on my heart. :)"}
{"text":"Flavorful sauce, extra cheesy, crispy on the bottom thin crust. What's not to love about Mineo's pizza?  The staff isn't the most attentive, but they're friendly enough and take care of you.  Also the pizzas are huge. We got a large and weren't expecting it to be quite as large as it was. This is another plus.  Also, got the meatball appetizer. Cheesy and meaty and delicious. Tasted like it came from an Italian grandmother.  Be warned, they're cash only.  Despite what Yelp says, they do have waiter service in the bar area."}
{"text":"Mineos isn't just the best pizza, it is in a class by itself! So good they've never had to deliver, people come to them.  That is slightly inconvenient, but worth it! My fiancé walked up to get tonight's pizza. Excellent as always. We just grabbed a plain. The cheese is fresh gooey wonderfulness. But my favorite is the unique sweet yellowish crust. Is it cornmeal? Is it magic? It is Delicious!"}
{"text":"I ordered the meatball parm which was listed under \"Dinners\" which states dinners come with garlic bread. I did not get garlic bread I called and was told \"that's like the only one that doesnt come with garlic bread\" And i also ordered a side of rigatoni with butter which was $5.50 and i got about 15 noodles. So i paid $14.45 for my meal plus $3.55 tip so $18.00 and got this"}
{"text":"The gold standard in Pittsburgh. Under-rated white pizza."}
{"text":"They have gluten-free for the people who are so inclined which is a plus when you are craving pizza but are stuck with \"those\" people. The cheese is amazing and it really makes the pizza. Bar has good happy hour and sporting event specials."}
{"text":"When it comes to the longstanding battle of \"Who really is Pittsburgh's best?\" That has lasted a generation between Mineo's and Aiello's loyalists, I am unashamedly in the Mineo's camp (even though Aiello's has a good pie), I simply feel Mineo's is the top pizza in the Burgh. Why, you ask? Well, for starters, I love the generous portions of cheese, which isn't artificial tasting in the least and doesn't gum up in certain sections of the slice. The tomato sauce is among the best I've ever had and the pepperoni is the perfect spice for my tastes. The crusts are garlic buttery and not too doughy which is perfect, and it really isn't that greasy for a pizza. Overall, I'm a Mineo's loyalist and can't wait to go back."}
{"text":"This is the best pizza I have ever had in my life. I've had pizza in NYC (lived there in my youth), Italy, Chicago, you name it, I've hit up the big pizza places.  This is by far the best pizza I have ever had in my life. I've been vegetarian for over three years and I still dream about their pepperoni pizza and desperately crave it.  A word to the wise. There is no fricken ambiance in this facility. But who the hell asks for ambiance from a pizza joint?  Hell, maybe the next time I am in Pittsburgh I will give up giving up meat to eat a pepperoni pie here.  Can you get a better endorsement than that? I think not. Go and enjoy the pizza, save some of your crust to dip in the oil that is left. This isn't a health conscious pizza place, but who eats pizza for their health? Splurge and enjoy!"}
{"text":"Mineo's has quickly become one of my favorite pizza places in Pittsburgh.  I usually only go here for slices, because ordering a full pie is too many calories to have around the house (and my wife is pretty much vegan so she doesn't go for the cheese...)  What makes their pizza stand out from other pizza places is that is tastes homemade.  Their crust is fabulous and crispy and their sauce is fantastic.  Plus, they are open late and most people in Mineo's are quite nice!  I am updating my listing to add the following:  If you go to Mineos, bring cash.  They don't accept credit cards!"}
{"text":"This was probably the best pizza I've had in my life. Just got a plain cheese to go and ate it in the car. Super cheesy and greasy, but not grease like shitty mall food court pizza, but grease like pure melted butter. Incredible. I would come to Pittsburgh again (3 hour drive for me) just to come here."}
{"text":"When I heard that this was the best pizza place in Pittsburgh, I was pretty skeptical.  Though Mineo's does not take the definitive title (yet), the no-frills atmosphere, down-to-earth waitstaff, and absolutely heavenly pizza makes Mineo's a must-visit.  Dominic, one of the co-owners, suggested his own recipe-- sausage, onion, bacon, and roasted red pepper.  It was unreal!!! Add to that their signature rice balls, a few craft beers, and some good conversation, and you have one hell of a weekend night.  Highly recommended!!!"}
{"text":"A charming local place, but not my personal taste. A bit too much cheese and not that flavorful of sauce. The staff was very nice though."}
{"text":"Mineo's is by far my favorite pizza ever!!!  I've been eating a Mineo's ever since I was a little kid.  We used to walk to Mineo's for our lunch from Washington Elementary School and have our slices of pizza and of course some ice cream for dessert!  It's a great place to go for lunch or even late at night!  I love how you can get pizza by the slice or order a whole pizza if you want. We always get Mineo's take-out for our Steelers parties or if we're just craving some great pizza of course!   I love the people that work there too.  They're always really friendly. Probably my only complaint about this place is that they only take cash.  Sometimes we don't end up ordering from here if we don't happen to have cash on us.  However, this usually doesn't stop us!   I'm a Pittsburgh native, but I've lived in LA for a year now, and I'm always craving Mineo's!  Every time I'm back in Pittsburgh I have to get some!!  Definitely the best pizza ever!!  I highly recommend this place!"}
{"text":"This is more of a 3.5, but I'm rounding it up for being an iconic Pittsburgh institution.  This has been my family's go-to pizza place for as long as we've been in Pittsburgh. Admittedly we went here on recommendation and never actually tried their primary competitor whose name I can never remember how to spell, so I can't directly compare. The pizza here has fairly generous portions of everything and the flavors are all what they should be (though the cheese was a bit too salty last time). The crust has a delicious doughy flavor. It's oily and the cheese can slide off, but that's all part of the appeal.  For whatever reason, after a few years of living in Chicago, the pizza somehow didn't quite taste as good as I remembered. Perhaps my taste adapted to the more cracker-like crust of Chicago-style thin crust, or the slightly reduced cheese levels on Chicago-style thin crust. (I literally only had deep dish twice; nobody actually eats those things.) But in any case, Mineo's is still very much a solid pizza choice."}
{"text":"Lots of good ppl like Mineo's so I do feel a lil bad writing this.  Plain English:  the pizza is terrible!  My son and I order pizza every Friday as a treat for a hard worked week @ daycare.  The cheese kept sliding off the pizza.  The middle of the pizza didn't really get cooked and was soggy as ever.  I tried putting it back in the oven at home and tried crusting it up.  Nope!  Didn't work.    Tried cutting off that first couple bites of ea slice, nope still bad.  Mushrooms aren't fresh, expensive, over use of cheese, parking isn't easy, confusing on which door to enter to pick up, undercooked pizza.  Just pass.  Kinda gross"}
{"text":"Great Pittsburgh pizza. Take out is solid, but nothing beats eating it in house. Friendly staff too. Bar is full service with lots of TV's, so it's a great place to watch a game."}
{"text":"The best pizza in Pittsburgh besides Vincent's Pizza Park.   I always get pepperoni, mushrooms and extra cheese. Their ice cream next door is great as well! Parking can be a pain at times!"}
{"text":"A Pittsburgh native directed me to Mineo's Pizza House, and I'm glad he did. It's definitely a different kind of pizza than we have in California, and we have all kinds of pizza.  Cheese is the focus here. When our pepperoni pizza was ready, we picked it up and looked at it. Ummmm, where's the pepperoni? Well, it's hidden under approximately five pounds of cheese.  The ingredients are all great. The pepperoni appears to be fresh and hand-cut thick. The cheese had plenty of flavor. The crust was a bit on the soggy side, but good. The sauce did it's job nicely.  I guess my complaint was the balance of the ingredients. SImply put, it was just too cheesy for my tastes. It feel like a ton of lead in your stomach, which may be exactly what some people crave.   In the end, I was glad I went. I liked the pizza. But, there's no way I'd ever go back. It's just too heavy for me."}
{"text":"After all the hype about this joint I decided to check it out. Different strokes for different folks. This place didn't impress me one bit. The sauce was comparable to the great value brand that you buy at Walmart. The grease was authentic."}
{"text":"Best pizza ever. No frills but the cheese is wonderful. When we want pizza, it is always at Mineos."}
{"text":"this place had been hyped up by many prior to my arrival. ordered a large pepperoni pizza and the arancini. this will not be the best pizza you've ever had, but it's good. might bring my boys here for a pregame, they have coolers filled with four loko. could be a wild night..."}
{"text":"Definitely a good pie, no doubt about it. There's a reason why it's famous in Pittsburgh. The crust is thin and crispy, the sauce is mild, and the cheese is plenty. One thing that makes Mineo's different from your standard pie is that the meat toppings are under the cheese, which I think prevents them from drying out during the baking process. This can be a good thing but I kind of like it when my pepperoni is a little crispy. I'm sure you can request them to place the toppings on top.   Overall, I like the pizza here and it's definitely a special, stand-out pie. The only thing I don't like is that it's cash only."}
{"text":"I could go on for a year if I had the words to say how good this pizza is. Every time I am in Mt. Lebanon I need to go in for a stop."}
{"text":"Mineo's will always have a special place in my heart.  I didn't want to like this place, but I couldn't help falling in love with it after my first slice."}
{"text":"One of the best pizza places in Pittsburgh!! I love the cheese and toppings underneath it! Always hot and fresh when I order"}
{"text":"If you're on a quest to find the best pizza in Pittsburgh, you definitely have to stop at Mineo's. So many in Pittsburgh claim Mineo's to have the best. While I don't agree it's quite the best, I definitely enjoy the pizza here and I also enjoy it more than its competitor a few doors up the road.   I think what makes Mineo's so good is the really crispy crust, the slightly sweet sauce, and the ooey gooey cheese (which there is a lot of). With so much cheese on the pie, you need a sturdy crust to balance it, which you have with Mineo's. If you dine in, you've got to try the cannolis for dessert! Even if you're anything like me and you're usually not a fan of cannolis, something about the cannolis here might change your mind. The filling is so smooth and has just the right amount of sweetness.   While I've also tried their Mount Lebanon location, I prefer the Squirrel Hill location. The bar at Squirrel Hill is a perfect place to watch a Steelers game and enjoy great pizza. Just remember to bring cash!"}
{"text":"Ordered three pizzas to feed the family while my Grandpa is home in hospice. Before leaving the store, grease soaked through the boxes and dripped all over my cousin's pants. Ah well, it's sausage pizza, it happens. But when we arrived home the cheese had migrated to one side of all of the pizzas. The dough itself was soaked through with grease and was severely undercooked. We called and the manager, Ron, told us to bring them back for new ones. He was cordial speaking to my aunt and everything seemed good. Then we arrived and asked for Ron, who promptly told us it was our fault the pizza was a mess, that apparently we neglected to carry the boxes \"straight enough\" and had the gall to drive them home. He continued to insult us, made us look at the pizzas we brought back and told us over and over all the many ways this was our fault, how no pizza left his shop this way, how much pride he took in the pizza, and how he refused to argue with me (while arguing with me).  My cousins and I are young, in our early twenties, and the difference in how Ron treated us compared to when he was speaking with my aunt was shocking. I've managed a coffee shop in the neighborhood and I cannot even imagine treating a customer this way. He continually insulted myself and my cousins, to the point where I begun to raise my voice. I was furious and trying to hold it in, but he just kept going.   We didn't ask for money back; all we wanted was a fresh pizza. Ron decided I needed a lesson on the intricacies of cheese and his oh so delicate pizza. My family has been patronizing this business for over forty years. This will be the last time any of us ever grab so much as a slice. Thanks Ron!"}
{"text":"Pittsburgh pizza is the BEST pizza. In the universe.  Thats coming from someone who grew up in the NJ/NYC area.   Buttt NJ NYC pizza is the best!? Waaaah!!  FALSE the pizza aint shhh compared to what Pittsburgh has.  I TRY to stay away from this spot, but its hard since the pizza is OUT OF CONTROL every time I eat here. My faves pizza place in Pgh.  It stays crazy busy on a Fri /Sat night!  If you're gettin a pie to go- call ahead.  They do something weird where the pepperoni is under the cheese so I usually order it with pepps on top.  I work out just so I can eat Mineos."}
{"text":"Yummy pizza! So much cheese!!! Do let it cool down or you'll get the dreaded blister behind the front teeth... Totally worth it though."}
{"text":"I recently moved to Pittsburgh from the west coast and I relied on Yelp to help me find some good Pizza. A friend was in town so I took him to Mineos. The pictures on yelp didn't look good but I trusted the reviews. Bad Decision! Neither of us thought it was good and it has been a running joke ever since. The pizza tastes about as good as it looks in the pictures.   There are a few restaurants here in pittsburgh that have high reviews but not good food like Primanti brothers. It must be a regional taste or faked reviews."}
{"text":"Best.....Pizza.....Ever.  I could live off of Mineos.  The crust is not too thick, but has a chewiness to it...cheese and sauce combo magnificent!"}
{"text":"Fat and calorie conscious eaters beware! This is one time when blotting the grease of your pizza just isn't worth it. Mineo's pies are succulent, flavorful, crispy delicious-ness.  If you're wondering how pizza can make your life more meaningful, try their white pizza."}
{"text":"Not a bad spot for a pie. Extensive menu and many great options. The cheese is amazing and the garlic seasoning is delicious. I was a little disappointed in the mushrooms (pickled) because I prefer mine less tart. Sauce could have been thicker but the crust was on point. Pricing is a little high and the Saturday night staff is meh. Nice, quaint neighborhood but parking is tight."}
{"text":"When I remarked I was going to go to Mineo's for the first time last night my neighbor, who has been a Pittsburgh native his whole life growing up in Homewood, told me it's really good pizza but not nearly as good as it use to be. Without having it from before I still kind of get that vibe. It seems like Mineo's makes some okay pizza but mostly rides on the fame it built up from its past.  The store is small but you don't really dilly dally so it looks like you can usually find a spot before your pizza is done. We did. I ordered a large pepperoni and sausage and received a pepperoni and mushroom. My girlfriend hates mushrooms but the place was so busy we didn't feel like ordering a new pizza so she picked them off. The crust is \"okay\". It seems like it's trying to be authentic but was kind of on the dry side. In my opinion a good pizza crust should be crispy on the outside and nice and chewy on the inside.  The ingredients were top notch. The mushrooms were good quality and so was the pepperoni. The pepperoni had the full flavor of a true pepperoni. Not that spicy greasy mixture you get from the store or from most pizza places. The cheese was really good and was slightly browned which is cooked better than most places but still not \"ideal\". The cheese should just be plain dark in some spots. Pizza should be cooked at high heat so give it the texture it was meant to have. However, it still kicks the butt of most places in the city.  The once great Mineo's is still great because it's become almost a cultural landmark of Pittsburgh. It's a shame they seem to cut a few corners because it truly is the makings of a great pizza."}
{"text":"I'm originally from the midwest, so I have an affection for deep dish.  I dislike most nyc style pizzas.  I don't know if you would call mineos nyc style, but its the best east coast pizza I've eaten since I've been here.  the crust had more flavor than other places I've been too, the cheesy is thick and gooey and the pepperoni plentiful, all great.   The place is kinda messy, but for a 50yr old establishment I've seen worse."}
{"text":"yah, its not bad. but its not great either. everyone kept talking about this place and even some random guy next to me on the plane could not stop raving about it... but i think it gets too soggy really quickly. i definitely like another pizza place in pittsburgh better - village pizza"}
{"text":"My favorite pizza in Pittsburgh. Very very thick cheese. Many many toppings. I like meat ball best! Try it!"}
{"text":"I had lived in Oakland for so long as a student that I kind of forgot that Mineo's was still around; I'm ashamed that I did. This was one of my favorite places as a child - I distinctly remember being brought here for fresh pizza and for the chocolate cake slices they used to serve. Now instead of it being the place my parents would buy a tasty treat from, Mineo's has become my favorite place to go and grab a snack after a long day of work in a shop down the street.   This place is not only cheap (when compared to many other places), it is outright delicious - everything is either cut from a fresh pie or is made fresh and tossed into their oven right after you order. In my experience everything comes out piping hot and cooked to perfection. If I want a single piece of pizza with a weird combination of toppings, they'll get it ready for me, no problem! And the cheese - this is a great place for pizza with a decent layer of cheese that's also paired with the right amount of homemade seasoned sauce. The result is a tangy mouthful of \"yum\" that always hits the spot.  Definitely one of the best local pizza places, even if you need to deal with things like paper plates (admittedly not the best thing to use when trying to eat pizza fresh out of an oven). The seating isn't exactly fancy, admittedly, but still better than what you'd find at a total dive of a place. For quick eats, it works - and it's been clean, cozy, and decent in my experience.  And hey, if you really don't want to sit and eat here, just get your pizza to go - you'll enjoy it all the same!"}
{"text":"Stopped thru for a carry out pie while my car was getting serviced. Glad I stopped. What a pie! I'm pretty much a plain cheese thin pie dude and this pie solid. I'll be back for sure."}
{"text":"Pizza is nothing special. Canned mushrooms, spinach, and shrimp. Sauce and cheese ordinary. We will not go back"}
{"text":"No doubt the best pizza in Pittsburgh. The pie speaks for itself. I love that they have expanded with a bar too. Great happy hour specials and game specials. Can't beat a mineo's pizza, cold beer, and a Pittsburgh sporting event together."}
{"text":"If this is the best pizza in Pittsburgh, I'm preparing to be sorely disappointed by this town.  I just moved in a few blocks away and thought I'd check it out, since everyone's been saying this is the best in town.  These guys must be coasting on their reputation, because I would have been better off walking up to Giant Eagle and buying a frozen pizza.    The crust is good, and the sauce is okay, but the cheese and pepperoni were just plain nasty.  On top of that, the seating area is dirty - I was there 30 minutes and didn't see anyone come out to wipe down tables, and this was on a moderately busy Saturday evening.  The service is pretty snippy, too, and they only take cash.  Not really any bright spots here."}
{"text":"Love love love Mineo's pizza!  I stop in here or the Squirrel Hill location just about every time I come back to Pittsburgh.  They've got delicious red sauce, are generous with the flavorful cheese, and have a perfectly crunchy crust that is consistently awesome.  Though I'm usually turned off by really greasy, salty food, Mineo's just crushes it every time.  One of my few true cravings.  Only drawback: Yes, they only take cash.  They've got an ATM inside, and no credit card fees keeps the prices down somewhat, but c'mon: don't make me turn around and walk out just because pay day is in a few days and all I've got is a credit card."}
{"text":"A perfect pizza pie!  I wish we had this is California.  The pizza in So. Cal sucks.  Anyways, great service, perfect pizza."}
{"text":"Excellent pizza. Consistent great quality. Can't go wrong here. Tastes as good as pizza from New York."}
{"text":"My partner swears this is the best pizza in Pittsburgh, but I guess I'm just not that impressed with it's unfounded cult status.  We call to place our order, it's specifically cash only upon pick up, and a large mushroom pizza is $20.   I've had Mineo's a few times now, and walking into the shop, there have been a bunch of people inside every time. Young adults are visible, working hard in the back, making dough and pounding crust. It does seem to have a house made integrity, and you can taste that in the pizza.   There's a good amount of cheese, they put the toppings underneath the cheese sometimes. I kinda wish there was more sauce. I found the crust on the end to be too crunchy and dried.   Overall, my partner will continues to order plain pizza from this hard working shop. I will eat it and enjoy it just okay, wishing they gave out little packets of red pepper and parm."}
{"text":"best pizza in Pittsburgh. I grew up in chicago and I am definitely picky about my pizza.  I love the sauce, they dont skimp on the cheese and the crust is perfect."}
{"text":"The pizza ranks among the absolute best in town if you like thin crust, extra cheesy, flavorful sauce pizza.  I'd only ever get it plain or maybe once in a blue moon with pepperoni.  And I don't get anything else.  The fact that it's cash only is a downer, but not enough to drop it from 5 stars.  Seriously, if you like cheesy pizza, you can not find a better place than Mineos."}
{"text":"Best pizza place in squirrel hill.  They might be a little more than other pizza places but they are certainly the best in terms of quality.  Sometimes the employees can be a bit rude, but the pizza is always great."}
{"text":"Only gave it two stars for the beer prices and the fact that they even serve alcohol. It's weird that so many places here are BYOB??   Anyway, service was garbage. Lady never once smiled or even seemed to care about us. Put on her coat and left halfway through our meal?   We're from Buffalo, New York. To me, nobody can beat my hometown's pizza. This place was so well known in the area that we wanted to give it a go while in town. Bad idea. Tasted like my high school cafeteria pizza with an overload of cheese. I love cheese, but this was too much.   Pittsburgh, if this is the best you've got for pizza, I feel bad for you. Come to Buffalo and you'll change your mind!"}
{"text":"Let me start off by saying, I love the add-on.  Now I can eat some solid pizza, while watching a baseball game, etc.  I think ordering a whole pie vs. a single slice makes a difference.  The crust seems a lot better, when you order a whole pie.  Single slice crust seems too hard.  I usually get pep and sausage or pep and mushroom.  The sausage seems a little fatty lately.  Too much cheese perhaps?"}
{"text":"I did a taste test of pizza places in the area recently, and Mineo's was part of the line-up. I'd heard great things about it and knew it was a local old-school place (the kind that only takes cash). I was very fair and got the same toppings on every pie I ordered so that i was judging them equally.  I was so disappointed with my meal at Mineo's. The pizza was just...nothing special. I've had more distinctive pizza pies at Vocelli's for God's sake. It was simply a generic pizza and didn't have anything special to write home about it. It's a very standard pizza.  The place itself is sort of a dive, but if they had out-of-this-world pizza they could get away with being quirky instead of just depressing. But they don't. It's making me sad just remembering having to sit in that Formica-laden place while a group of teenage, pimply boys watched tv and giggled behind the counter while they made my food.  By contrast, A'Badamo's just a block away has mouth-watering genuine New York-style pizza and they take credit cards to boot!  Anyways, now every time I seen someone walk out of Mineo's with a big pizza box I shudder and withhold the urge to cry, \"Why!?!\" at them."}
{"text":"Way too greasy for my taste. I like some grease on my pizza but not to the point where the pizza box is falling apart because it is drenched in grease, yuck! The cheese they use isn't so tasty either. I'm all about the cheese and it was so bad I ended up taking it off. That's no way to eat a pizza! Next time I will try Aiello's."}
{"text":"Pizza is great, the food is 5 stars.  The dining area could use some remodeling and upkeep though."}
{"text":"For personal reasons, I have a soft spot in my heart for Mineo's. With my personal feelings aside, Mineo's is a pretty awesome pizza place and BAR. They have a happy hour Monday through Wednesday 9pm-10pm that has $2 off drinks (which are moderately priced to begin with). The drinks are perfectly made and the bartenders are similar to how I imagine the bartenders on Cheers would be towards non-regulars like Norm or Frasier. The servers are also very sweet and give great service. The basic cheese pizza is pretty good, but I've had a few different topping combinations and they have all been delicious."}
{"text":"Used to be better and now is just another joint with a history and clientele. Their desserts and other menu options won't disappoint as much as the pizza, which has sadly become overpriced and not up to par."}
{"text":"Great pizza smack in the middle of Squirrel Hill Pittsburgh.  I definitely liked their made to order pizzas which gave me a nice nostalgic reminder of NYC pizzerias while at school in Pittsburgh, and as such, the best pizza I had in Pittsburgh.  Not for the grease haters, but man, they can serve up a great pie."}
{"text":"Growing up, we lived maybe 5-10min from this place, and every Friday my parents would order Mineos, take it home and we'd have our little pizza day.  Pizza Day, opposite as the Aquabats would lead you to believe, became the worst day of the week.  As a child, I guess I couldn't stand this thick thick cheese and greesey floppy crust. I thought my parents were dinosaurs for using forks and knives to eat this thing. I'd wind up eating one slice and being \"full\" just because I didn't want to eat any more of this stuff.  Now, I've heard everything under the sun defending Mineos honor whenever I speak these critiques. Most notably \"Oh, well you need to eat it THERE\". Well, unless Mineos pizza changes quality in the first FIVE MINUTES it's served, then it's official:  Mineos Pizza tastes like a foot.   Never bought it in my adult life. Very happy I didnt after hearing people say how expensive it is, here."}
{"text":"My personal favorite.  I have nothing bad to say about this place, apart from the higher cost, but you get what you pay for.  The crust is very good, but the toppings are what makes the pizza.  Mineo's doesn't skimp on their cheese/toppings.  At first glance, I wondered, where are all the toppings I ordered!?  Not to worry, they were all burried in the heaps of cheese on this wonderful pie.  The pepperoni was a little on the salty side, but quite tasty.  While it is expensive, it's very filling too!  I could normally eat half a large to myself easy.  I bring over one of these pies, and there's still leftovers between the three of us (hungry guys mind you)"}
{"text":"Excellent pizza.  Love the sauce, cheese was crazy, like a double cheese pizza.  Pepperoni is thick and meaty.  Crust is somewhere between thick and thin, just right.  Nice Craft beer selection too.  Would definitely eat here again."}
{"text":"i am NOT afraid to give a 3 star review to a pizza place that I think is good.  This place is good. probably the best in Pittsburgh (somebody tell me otherwise please) but you know how doggin a slice and searching for records is synonymous- so after Jerrys, you gotta go how and try this slice  Ok- the crust and bread is pretty good- above average, and WELL above average for Rust Belt slices. Sauce is sub par- but not bad. cheese has a good taste- but no surprise here TOO MUCH- always too cheesy in this part of the country. I guess just lots of big folks who like to fill up on two slices.  Also, when buying a slice- it is cheap- but it took three medium sized CHOMPS and this small slice was in my large intestines. and im POLISH! you know what I mean?!"}
{"text":"Yelp  deleted my previous one-star review - what's going on here?    Mineo's is terrible.  I truly hope this is not 'the best pizza in Pittsburgh' like locals claim, because if that's true I'm in for a wold of pizza hurt.  Also, it's a cash only business, and they are down right rude if you ask if they take credit/debit.    This pizza is not any particular style, i.e. NY, pan, Chicago, etc.  It comes with a thicker salty crust with too much bad cheese, and is very very greasy.  It might be more tolerable if the crust had a little cornmeal in it, but it's really bland as it stands now.    Usually every big city has a great pizza place - where, oh where is that place in Pittsburgh?"}
{"text":"I really don't get the hype. First of all the pizzas don't really blend together as one ingredient. Ingredients and cheese are thrown sloppily together and never really mesh. They make up for average consistently by overdoing stuff, then it falls apart all over your plate. And the price, like most pizza in Squirrel Hill, is ridiculously overpriced."}
{"text":"The feud will always be there Mineo's vs. Aiello's. However, this girl's heart can be found deep in the sauce of Mineo's!!! Why you might ask. Well, I enjoy talking with the folks that work there. They are very friendly. And then there's the pizza....The pizza...We have our usual orders of plain or mushroom, well done. But, we recently tried their white pizza. WOW...it was awesome! Great flavor...addictive in fact! We have also had their breakfast pizza. One might say, \"breakfast pizza?\". In fact I have said that. But, try it...you'll like it! It is my son's favorite (he's 18 for reference). We've also eaten in their restaurant. They have AMAZING meatballs!! They are all beef and are moist and flavorful!  They have a fairly cool wine list as well. Remember cash only! That is the one piece that (and perhaps it's a good thing) that limits how much we order!"}
{"text":"It's okay.  Here is an objective review:  - The pizza is decent.  It's so standard.  It's what it looks like and what I expected, but nothing more.  (Dare I say, it's kind of like mall pizza.  Not bad at all, but zero on the special or unique scale.)  - The setting is old enough that it does not look extremely clean.  The whole place needs a re-fresh.  - Sorry, but CASH ONLY is a drag in 2014.  Who carries cash?  - The salads are a bright spot - very fresh and crisp, and big enough to share.  - The staff seem friendly, which is a plus.  The location is excellent, and I think that's the back-story.  Where else does a young pedestrian get a cheap slice that's decent?"}
{"text":"Cash only place so make sure you hit the atm before hand. If not they have one right there. It's good pizza but it's not as good as Fiori's."}
{"text":"Mineo's  is the Best Pizza I've had so far!   I'm from the D.C Metro area and I've raved and raved about this place! the crust and the sauce is awsome some say it' s too cheesey but I love cheese so thats how I like it !  and there are many good pizza places in Pittsburgh something D.C.  lacks and it's all that gormet shitty ass California pizza  kitchen based bullshit pizza! and when it'  tryed to come close to traditonial it's either okay or cardboard! and what the fuck do you people know about greasey pizza come down to DC taste the difference you'd be crying for Mineos in a minute! or any other pizza place in pittsburgh!  In DC We are known for our Latino and Asian Resturants in pittsburgh it's your italian Resturants and Pizzarias  and subshops! Be proud yall got  better Italian food up there !   Just as I'm proud of our  Latino and Asian places!"}
{"text":"I've been eating their pizza for over 30 years, and never grow tired of it. Try the special with everything on it and you won't be disappointed."}
{"text":"My boyfriend and I are on a quest to find the best pizza in Pittsburgh, as we are from jersey and need our pizza fix! So far, this has been the best spot we have found in the burgh. The service was quick. The employees were really nice! And they sold pizza by the slice which can be pretty hard to come by! We got 4 plain slices and two sodas for 9 dollars which we felt was pretty cheap.  The pizza is thin crust with lots of cheese. We will definitely be back here soon and I highly recommend you try it!"}
{"text":"I enjoy the ambience of this pizza joint, along with their beer selection.   The pizza is tasty, though it's pretty greasy which seems to be a Pittsburgh thing!   Service is fast and efficient!!"}
{"text":"Haven't had Mineo's in quite some time, probably since the last time I wrote a Yelp review.  It's definitely my favorite pizza in Pittsburgh, but I would say that it's been trumped by Tony's & Capo's in San Francisco.  If only I could get past a 2 hour wait for dinner.  The pizza is still as awesome and cheesy as ever, served searing hot by friendly young Pitt students.  It's the perfect proporition of toppings vs. sauce and cheese.  I used to pair my pizza up with grape Welches soda, but they've definitely stepped up the game with their beer cooler, which is fully stocked with a stellar selection of IPAs and artisan beer.  They kind of had me at Lagunitas Little Sumpin, my favorite beer of all time.  Anyways, I highly recommend and vow not to let so many years go by before I return."}
{"text":"Really excellent crust. I particularly like the white pizza with spinach.  They sell a lot of pizza here and for good reason."}
{"text":"Good pizza, but certainly not great.  Its tough for a new yorker to find an acceptable Pizza place in pittsburgh, sadly this is one of the better spots ive come across.  I enjoyed their tomato sauce, and crust most.  Cheese was just avg and the toppings were lacking fresh flavor."}
{"text":"We were out Urban Hiking in Pittsburgh and basically got hungry. I was traveling with my hubby, daughter and her boyfriend and we all decided on PIZZA. I went to my trusty YELP.COM mobile app and did a search on best pizza in Pittsburgh.  To be truthful, his was the second location on the list but the first one to serve BEER...I called them both and this was the winner and to be truthful, I am glad it was...it was delicious.  We parked on a side street to avoid paying for parking. We only had to walk about one city block and cross the main drag to get to the pizza restaurant. We went into the first door of three facing the sidewalk. This was the pizza joint location where you can order by the slice. They grabbed a booth and I walked up to the counter to order. The guy directed me through the doorway to the right and up a step or two because there was NO Beer served in this section. We had to go to the bar area.  The next room was ice cream and bakery, and they directed me through another door to their right and up a few steps. Everything in Pittsburgh is made on the hillsides, so you are constantly going up or down based on where you are going...reminds me of San Francisco.  So we finally made it to the bar area. The waitress guided us to a table near the front window facing the street. She explained due to the cooler weather the large windows were closed but normally would be wide open.  We ordered our drinks of soda, water and beer for Tony. Tony and I opted to share a small pizza supreme made their way without any substitutions. Noel went with an Italian sub sandwich with chips and Adam went with a calzone.  She was gone about 20 minutes but it was worth the wait. The food was amazing. I would definitely eat here again. I was so happy that I had some leftover pizza to take home for dinner. The pricing wasn't bad, I paid $45 for all the food, taxes and tip of $5. We were very pleased and I highly recommend. This of course is my personal opinion, I hope that if you decide to go here that you are happy with your choices also. Can't wait to go here again!!!!"}
{"text":"I finally did the obligatory Mineo's vs. Aiello's taste test and Mineo's came out as the victor!. Unfortunately winning this contest is equivalent to winning the award for best Entry Priced, Sub-Compact, Non-Electric, Manual Transmission vehicle in it's class.   The pizza is OK, but it's not nearly as good as the hype (which according to the plaques on the wall was created in the glory days of the late 90's) will lead you to believe. The crust is super thin but lacking in flavor, the sauce is sparingly applied and almost non-existent, and all of this pizza's flavor is derived from the thick layer of cheese. The only reason this pizza won the taste test was because of the two, this pizza had SOME flavor."}
{"text":"Mineo's is a Pittsburgh classic. Their pizza is delicious. The sauce is on the sweeter side, but not too sweet. Last time we came, our order was ready and sitting on the oven for about 10 minutes before the guys working realized it. So we waited extra for no reason, which was a little disappointing. The pizza was delicious though (although I am a bigger fan of the competing pizza place up the street). Keep in mind they are cash only!"}
{"text":"Still don't get it. Stopped by for a few slices with my wife. The pizza is only ok. And the takeout area was filthy - tons of silver pizza trays, plates, etc. not picked up."}
{"text":"In the sq hill pizza wars, Mineo's wins my heart for plain cheese pizza. Everyone thinks this is the greatest pizza shop in Pittsburgh but I consider it to be one part of the pizza holy trinity: Mineo's, Aiello's, and Napoli's."}
{"text":"Not as wonderful as natives to these parts make it out to be. Plus what is with the baby slices? A big let down if you ask me..."}
{"text":"Mineo's Pizza has become a favorite of our daughter and son-in-law. On a recent visit, they wanted to introduce us to the restaurant. Mineo's is loctaed in a three-bay storefront. Each bay has its own entrance and characteristics. The first is for carry-out orders at a counter, though there is some seating. The middle is desserts, ice cream, cheesecake, cannoli and tiramisu. The third is the main dining area with a full bar and television screens.   We sat in the third area for table service. Mineo's was crowded and we needed to wait a while for a table to clear. Then we had to pounce on it before another party, just coming in the door, could take it! Mineo's has traditional thin crust pizza as well as deep-dish \"Sicilian\" pizza. Julia and Frank waned deep dish. So, we ordered a John's Special with pepperoni, mushroom, onions, green pepper and sausage toppings. A tossed salad to start. (The salad arrives in a large bowl to be shared.) The pizza took a long time to arrive, but it was delicious! It is served in a rectangular shape. I could only manage one slice before I had reached my limit. Our millenials had more, but there was still plenty for them to take home for later.  I definitely want to return, but think I would prefer to try the thin crust pizza."}
{"text":"I hate to admit this as I grew up and have always been a die-hard Mineo's fan: Mineo's, my first love, kind of stinks now. And by kind of I mean a lot. Granted its better than most chain pizza but that's not saying much. It is sickeningly greasy. And yes...people always said it was greasy but I used to disagree. It used to be an acceptable amount of grease given the amount of cheese you were getting and not so much you couldn't deal with it with a napkin. I ordered a to-go pizza because I was really excited to share the love with an uninitiated pizza eater. There was so much grease it soaked through the box and damaged the front seat of my car. Keep in mind...I didn't spill or tilt the pizza. That was literally from it soaking through the box. Gross. Also the flavor has gone downhill. What happened? Where is my beloved Mineo's? I would mourn this loss but my mourning would only make me want Old Mineos pizza to drown my sorrows thus creating an infinite loop of despair."}
{"text":"What happened to the Mineos I remember? The sauce tasted SOUR and the crust like cardboard. I'm so very disappointed because this used to be my #1 pizza place."}
{"text":"The pizza is amazing! Be careful when ordering the toppings are usually under the cheese so if you do a half and half because of a picky person you may not see the toppings."}
{"text":"I love Mineos Sicilian Pizza. I work in a pizza shop for last 25 years and it is hard to find a really good Sicilian pie. They are generous and it has always been good. I dont mind driving 40 minutes to get it. We get several toppings with extra cheese and it is a heavy pie. Its $27 bucks and worth every dollar."}
{"text":"Best Pizza, bar none, in the city. A gooey, greasy, incredibly flavorful pie (thin crust of course). I used to drive one home all the time when I lived in Ohio. I had to put the pizza in the trunk ('cause in the backseat it was torture driving home). If ya haven't had a \"cut\", go NOW."}
{"text":"Been going to Mineo's for the longest time I can remember. Good pizza but certainly not the best one around town! Cash only though!"}
{"text":"I don't know if it was an off night. I have been a long time fan, but it has been a few years since I've had their pizza. The staff were friendly.   It is a cash only establishment. It took about 45 minutes for the pizza to be ready; when it came out, it was soggy with grease to the point it pooled on the platter. The crust was off as well; you could taste the baking soda. My wife, a first time visitor, couldn't eat it. Fair warning to everyone."}
{"text":"I've got to update my review a little.  To be honest, my husband Rick likes Mineo's a little better than I do.  There are a lot of other pizza shops in Squirrel Hill and my personal preference is Aiello's.  Plus I want to try Lucci's.  That said, the pizza here is still good.  It's just that they bury everything under mounds of cheese here.  If you don't like your pizza so cheesy, then this place is not for you.  We decided to hang out in the neighborhood Saturday Night.  Y'know, pizza and then a movie at the Manor.  We ordered ours with pepperoni, onions, and black olives.  Not too bad, but I get very full after just a couple of slices.    They've got sandwiches here.  Maybe one of these days I'll stop in and get me one."}
{"text":"I am here at the recommendation of a local. Pizza here is a cross between New York and Chicago. We ordered a large pepperoni for the four of us and it was way too much. We left almost half of it over and had to bring it back to the hotel. Do use about double the amount of cheese on a regular pizza and they use extra thick cut pepperoni which I loved.  The place is a basic walk up and order Pizza place. There is no tableservice here. Because of the amount of cheese  the pizza took about 25 minutes from ordering it. The tables are very small and we couldn't fit two adults and two children with a large pizza in the middle. Everything was hanging off the edges and very difficult to eat which lessened the experience. The pizza itself was very good I would definitely come back for another but likely get it to go. They only have two sizes of pies small or large. I would get the small next time. They also sell it by the slice which looked like a popular option. I normally would've given this place 4 stars but took a star away for the small tables, lack of table service, and indifferent staff."}
{"text":"Cheese was pure solid, too salty, and half an inch thick. Way too greasy, partially from being too cold, partially from just being greasy. Crust was pretty good. A major plus is that it actually looks and feels like a pizza place inside."}
{"text":"Probably anyone from a good pizza town will tell you about their favorite hometown pizza.  Well, this is mine.  It's just different.  The crust is distinctive.  The mounds of cheese are distinctive.  The sauce has cocaine in it or something.  I just really love it.  There are other great pizzas out there, but something is just different about Mineo's.  Maybe it's because I have been eating it for 30 years.  I dunno."}
{"text":"i love this pizza but had terrible service here tonight. the rude bartender with the purple hair could not be bothered with us. we came in for happy hour on a monday so it was not especially busy either. we waited 10 minutes with empty beers and then she refilled only one and left us wait another 10 minutes until i flagged her down to ask for the other one. this was all we were getting. after finishing this round, we were completely ignored for the rest of the night until we asked to cash out. if i see her in here again im going to turn around and go somewhere else."}
{"text":"Love the place and have been going there for 30 years.  BUT, the place is filthy in a disgusting way not a old patina way.  Can't see why they don't make cleaning and some basic upkeep a property. The bathroom sink leg has been broken off and laying on the floor for months. I could go on but enough other reviews maintain this theme."}
{"text":"The pizza was really good best iv'e had in a long time iv'e been looking i'm new here."}
{"text":"The mecca of pizza in Pittsburgh. Bar none the best the city has to offer. I've had Aiello's, Fiori's, etc- they are great, but none top Mineo's. The cheese is thick, and perfectly salty. The sauce has a nice spice to it that perfectly compliments the cheese and the crust is buttery and crispy. 10/10"}
{"text":"My husband loves Mineo's pizza, being originally from Pittsburgh and now living in Houston, I thought I would surprise him for Valentine's Day. Pizzas were overnighted. The pizzas  were horrible. The sausage was crumbled, and basically nonexistent. It was like a pizza of cheese, there was so much cheese it was gross. My husband actually commented that if he would of got this pizza at the shop he would of returned it. Never will I do it again, too expensive for the product. I still have a pizza frozen in my freezer, in no hurry to bake."}
{"text":"Mineo's was the first great pizza place in the Squirrel Hill area...now it's mighty questionable.  I agree completely with Hasina D., when I was growing up in Pittsburgh, this place was 10 stars...as I got older, I realized the cheese was way too salty and generally too greasy (as other reviews have noted).  By the time I was a senior in high school, I stopped going here.  Suddenly all of the old smiling staff was gone and hired in their place was a bunch guys who you wouldn't want to turn down a dark alley way and run into.  I will sum up a lot of the same complaints that other reviews have also pointed out:  - Salty/greasy cheese - Dirty tables/floor/kitchen - Very poor service & attitude  Here's how I'll put it...Would you want to go to the dirty, poorly lit and rude pizza place or the bright, recently renovated, clean place up the block?  And the correct answer is: Go to Aiello's instead...it's right up the block."}
{"text":"Unless you're eating at Mineos, order your pizza half-baked to-go.  Take it home and put it in the oven for 25/30 mins at 450 degrees.  I always preheat my oven with pizza stone in it so that the pizza goes onto a piping hot cooking surface (makes a difference).  The crust is so so good when its *almost* burned.    The pepperoni they use is especially awesome."}
{"text":"who hasn't had a slice of Mineo's Pizza ? it's been a Pittsburgh, Squirrel Hill tradition since 1958. It is true you either love it or hate it. It's fierce competition up the street is Aiello's is quit the same, either you love them or hate them. I have been eating slices of Mineo's since the late 70's   It's not the greatest pizza in Pittsburgh, but I like Mineo's. Good pizza, I like the sauce, but what really sells the pizza for me is the cheese blend, I really love it. There is something about the greasy cheese slice that has that boardwalk feeling I get without being near the beach, when I can't get to the beach. I like the thin crust pizza Mineo's offers, you can get it in Sicilian, but I don't recommend it.   I love the dessert cafe next door. I come from a family of Italians and I know they would agree, they have the Best Cannoli's in Pittsburgh. The cafe is easy to get to from the pizza shop without having to go outside to the next front door. They also have a small bar area, I am told, but I have never seen it.   Try a slice of Mineo's !  Highly recommend for late night pizza fix. Take out is good, but it is best eaten there when it's nice and greasy and warm."}
{"text":"Bravo! Clap clap clap. People usually choose between Mineo's and Aiello's in Pittsburgh, and I'm a Mineo's fan! Why? Simple: EXTRA CHEESE. The pizzas are essentially the same to my amateur palate, but Mineo's dumps EXTRA CHEESE onto your pie. The crust is also far superior to Aiello's. Mineo's crust is flavorful, chewy and not dry. The sauce is a little sweet (edge to Aiello's on this one) and I think they must get the cheese from the same seller, because both are deliciously salty, but Mineo's just puts on more. YUM. VOTE MINEO'S AS BEST ZA IN PITTSBURGH :)"}
{"text":"Great pizza! One of my favorite places! I loge that they get their geese from Penn Mac right here in Pittsburgh. Although the service is okay, the guys are douche bags but it's alright cause that's just the personality of the place. I would definitely recommend."}
{"text":"no no no no no. soggy and too thick of a sauce... Onion too thick so raw when the pie comes out... pepperoni buried under the cheese so it doesn't get crisp... no credit cards taken... nowhere to park... just no from every angle."}
{"text":"Mineo's is a top-rated (by local magazines, etc.) cash-only pizza house.  I've only been to the (original) Squirrel Hill location, and I only come for the pizza.  The prices are high, but the quality here is top notch - loads of cheese, generous amounts of fresh toppings with a tangy sauce and a just-right chewy hand tossed crust.  A great variety of drinks on offer, from soda cans to beer cans/bottles to 6-packs to go.  The neighboring shop is connected, there is ice cream and desserts.  If you are driving by and you have a hunger, I suggest you park, walk in and indulge."}
{"text":"My favorite pizza on Earth, period. I've been in the Bay for almost 5 years and I still haven't found any place I like as much (the person who said Pizza My Heart was better should be committed to a mental institute). Any time I'm back in Pittsburgh I have to stop by for a few slices. As of my review, I'm the 8th person from the Bay Area writing a review, so I guess my experience isn't that unique.  When you walk in Mineo's, you immediately understand your in a classic family pizza parlor. Magazine awards and reviews line every wall. There's pictures of family members at various stages of growth. Tables and tiles with color patterns right out of 1983. And an Italian guy vying for the \"Mario Look-alike\" contest behind the counter tossing a pizza crust. Perfect.  As for the pizza, it's a little messy and a little on the greasy side, which is the only downside. To that end, it's a little bit of a guilty pleasure, but so worth it. A hand-tossed crust, topped with a slightly sweet tomato sauce. Toppings will sometimes be under the cheese which is a unique touch, although I'm not quite sure what the purpose it--but who cares. Cheese is in a thick layer, but quite tasty and flavorful.  Everyone in Pittsburgh has their personal favorite of the pizza places on this block and will defend their choice feverishly. I'm Mineo's through and through."}
{"text":"My first adventure when visiting Pittsburgh was to decide for myself who had the best pizza in town - Mineo's or Aiello's. There's long been a debate between the two local pizzerias, located only a block or so from each other. I ordered one slice of pepperoni to go, headed to Aiello's and did the same, settled in at a bistro table along Murray Ave. and prepared my test slices. There is an obvious difference in the look of the slices and my first guess, based on appearance as best slice, went to Aiello's. But in all reality, looks don't matter so I dug in. The verdict? Mineo's wins hands down (on the right in my picture). I don't know if it was the extra grease or the loads of cheese or the sauce, but it was so so yummy. And hot!  I visited the original Mineo's location in Squirrel Hill, which is currently owned by brothers Dominic and John Mineo. Their father and store founder, Giovanni, passed away. The interior is small and modest but the walls are plastered with awards. Many naming Mineo's as the best in the city year after year. The brothers haven't changed a thing, using the same recipe their father crafted in 1958.  It did take a minute for someone to come help me and while the girl who took my order was a doll, the guys behind the counters seemed irritable.  Oh, it's also cash only!   In addition to making dough daily, Mineo's also makes its own sauce and grates its own cheese."}
{"text":"No fue nada fuera de lo normal, eso sí la ración es bastante grande, la pizza me tuve que llevar a casa la mitad. Calidad precio creo que es razonable."}
{"text":"Keep it simple.  Great pizza, great crust, sauce and cheese. Some of best pizza in town. Not sure who has better. Still searching lol. The craft beet selection is awesome. Great eats for my cheat days"}
{"text":"I love this pizza! American classic pizza!!! Every time I visit  Pittsburgh this stop becomes a staple! The sauce is amazing! Everything is made fresh, in house. They even grate the cheese them self!"}
{"text":"I was born and raised in PIttsburgh and pizza is my favorite food. I pride myself on my pizza tasting abilities. My family would ALWAYS bring home Mineo's and it will forever be in my top 3 in Pittsburgh. It's very heavy on the stomach, very cheesy and very greast, but the crust and toppings underneath the cheese are so freaking delicious.  For those of you viewing this page and are curious of other pizza places to check out that are in my top 5, look no further than below!  5) Michael's Pizza in Southside 4) Frank's Pizza & Chicken (Go to the one in MIllvale, order Buffalo Chicken). AMAZING. 3) Fiori's 2) Mineo's 1) Benny Fiero's in Southside  Benny Fiero's is more my style because of the THIN and CRISPY crust, but delicious and massive NY slice that I love."}
{"text":"Not sure if this was a fluke or not, as I don't regularly go here for pizza, but we were less than impressed by today's fare. We ordered a large pizza, half pepperoni, half meatball, and a cheesesteak hoagie.   The pizza just wasn't that good. There was plenty of delicious cheese, as usual, to bring this score up to three stars. But the pizza seemed to be in some weird state of being undercooked in the middle and the edges were perhaps too cooked or chewy. Also, the meatballs were frankly not balls, or even half balls. They were crumbled to pieces and, frankly, gross.   As for the hoagie, I just wasn't impressed. Firstly, it is on the small side, in my opinion, and not toasted. Though I did really appreciate that the used real steak and not steak'ums, it just didn't resemble in taste to that of a good cheesesteak (i.e., Peppi's). It had no saltiness, not enough sauce, and lacked in the gooey cheese department.  All in all, I will probably try Mineo's again, but not for a while. Honestly, if this was the first time I ever had their stuff, I would probably have written them off for good."}
{"text":"I've been a loyal customer for 30 years; however,  tonight will be my last time to go to mineo's. Granted it was superbowl sunday, but I've never experienced  such ineptitude. When I called to order the pizza, the gentleman told me it would be 30 mins;  I ended up waiting 1 hr. After all that waiting, the pizza was undercooked and just horrible!  What happened to the usually reliable pizza establishment;  I believe it's become a bit too complacent! !"}
{"text":"The best pizza in Pittsburgh, by far, is at this place.  It is lot like Chicago Style Thin Crust pizza, which is thicker than the thin New York style.  But they do not skimp on the cheese.  There is no need to order extra cheese, because it is loaded with it.  The staff isn't overly friendly and it's not the fastest service in the world, but the pizza is great.  Just remember it is CASH ONLY.  They do have an ATM there.  And the parking is terrible.  There is a pay lot on the other side of the road."}
{"text":"Best pizza in the 'Burg! They definitely don't skimp on the cheese and the sauce is awesome....it has a fresh tomato taste to it that goes well with the crisp, nutty crust."}
{"text":"Mineo's is a staple in this area, and everyone knows.  If you didn't, now you do know.  As a arrogant NYer (we are the worst), we can be critical on pizza.   With that said, Mineos has it figured out.  What is \"it\"? Cheese, cheese and more cheese, a tangy sauce, and a soft crust.  The combination is unique and works.  However, the price is premium based on the quality of the ingredients (okay)."}
{"text":"It is SO unique.  Provolone vs. Mozz is the key.  This is a cheesey pizza, and hard to classify (not pan, Chicago, or NY... just different).  I come from NY/NJ so I know about good pizza.  This isn't anything like what I get back home, so I won't compare it to NY style.  I simply appreciate how different it is.    Messy, bring some good utensils until the pizza cools off!  (I gotta knock them for the cheapo fork and knives they provide, which melt upon contacting the bubbling cheese)."}
{"text":"The current star rating of 3.5 stars is incredibly accurate of Mineo's.  I'm going to be unpopular and round up to 4 stars because I think Mineo's is a more unique pizza than other places in Pittsburgh.  You're going to be indifferent or love it.  I'm confused about my emotions, clearly.  Disclaimer:  I did not order a pie here, only two slices.  Mineo's crust is unique.  It's thin but not like cheap Pizza Hut burnt-to-a-crisp-thin pizza.  It's almost like the dough doesn't rise the whole way or something, but it worked for me.  The sauce was ok, not too special.  But I love cheese, and this pizza was swimming in cheese.  It was pretty fast for my two slices to come out, and at $1.70/slice, not terribly priced.  I actually had really friendly service while I was there so I'm not sure about those complaints.  The tables were a little dirty and some weirdos were sitting inside.  Not pizza items were super slow, but it's not a huge kitchen.  I wasn't totally shocked by that.  I would come back here for a few slices on a laid-back night.  Cash Only"}
{"text":"This is a must stop place whenever we're Pittsburgh! We've done nothing but talk about how delicious the food was since our last visit a year ago. The pizza is outstanding! The lemon rosemary chicken wings are to die for! We actually took two half-baked pizzas home with us to hold us over till the next time we can make the trip to Pittsburgh. Super friendly staff, too!"}
{"text":"Visiting  Pittsburgh and looking for some good pizza.   We found it at Mineo's!  Just the right amount of cheese and toppings.   Was a little pricey,  but don't mind paying a little extra if the food is worth it.   Wings were tasty also.  Didn't realize it was cash only payment,  but they have an ATM there.   Will definitely come back on our ?ext visit."}
{"text":"Sauce good, but minimal meat toppings on our pizza. Expensive drinks and beer."}
{"text":"After hearing so much hype about the rivalry between Mineo's and Aiello's, I was expected to be blown away by our meal. On the contrary, I was extremely disappointed. We had a group of 6 and were quickly seated at a large round table by the window. Our server was very nice and suggested that we wait a little to order drinks since we were there just before happy hour. I always appreciate someone looking to help us save a few bucks!  The wings that we ordered to share were very good. Huge in size, cooked very well and great flavor. Unfortunately, I can't say the same about the pizza. The pizza was half mushroom and onion and half pepperoni and onion. There were about 5 times as many onions as there needed to be. The pizza was also not cooked nearly enough, so a sea of cheese fell off as you tried to pull a slice of pizza from the tray. I never thought I could possibly complain about too much cheese, but it happened. I had to try to eat it with a knife and fork because it was so moist and soft. We didn't even take the leftover pizza with us.   I hope this was a one-time mistake, but I won't be very likely to go back for pizza."}
{"text":"Very good pizza, although it's a little pricey. One of the few things that will get me to the pretentious Mount Lebanon area."}
{"text":"I was here with a friend before he was leaving got the summer. We ended up spending over 3 hours here, each of of us downing 3 beers. This place is at the sweet spot between too casual and too classy. They had some very nice beers on the tap.   We had tried their lemon garnished chicken wings too, but I found them a little too sour and a little too greasy."}
{"text":"We finally tried Mineos after living in Pittsburgh for a year and a half. Truth is, I could have waited another 10 years and not missed anything. I had somewhat high hopes because so many people rave about it, but as I have learned, people in Pittsburgh don't really know food.  We ordered two small pizzas. 1 Pepperoni and 1 sausage and mushroom.   Let's start with the pepperoni.  The pepperoni had a decent flavor and the cheese wasn't bad but overall the pizza lacked flavor.   As for the sausage and mushroom, what a mess.  The sausage was hands down disgusting.  It tasted like bob evans breakfast sausage that had been boiled. No flavor  or texture.  The mushrooms were slimy and gross straight out of a can.  My biggest complaints lie in the sauce and construction.  The sauce was bland and flavorless.  No acidic pop or sweetness to speak of.  Also both pizzas were impossible to eat.  All of the toppings slid off because of the moronic sauce, meat. cheese construction.  Pizza is a handheld event. If you have to use a fork, someone screwed up.  I am not sure what else to say other than I could have gotten a better pizza at a chain anywhere in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Mineo's is hands down the best pizza I have ever eaten. Pittsburgh has almost as many pizza shops per square mile as bars and churches, but none of them can compare to Mineo's.   There's nothing like sliding into one of their oddly uncomfortable booths with a few friends, grabbing a grape soda from the machine and lovingly dabbing the grease off the top of a Mineo's pizza."}
{"text":"Cheese overload! I usually get extra cheese, but decided not to this time. It ended up coming out with a ton of cheese. It made the pizza too heavy to pick up and extra greasy. The topping just slid off. I actually had to pick some off. It is bit my favorite, but would probably go back and get light cheese next time."}
{"text":"My favorite slice. Had a slice of pepperoni and a Sicilian slice of mushroom. The pepperoni was crispy and flavorful. The Sicilian was even better."}
{"text":"Great place for pizza. Bring cash! It's a two minute walk from my home. It has been around forever and for a good reason, they simply make great pizza. There are salads abs desserts too. They are all very friendly and it's clean."}
{"text":"Pizza was good, not amazing.. Teenage staff ANNOYING, loud, bored, dumb never ending jokes..  felt like I was stuck in a grade 11 cooking class."}
{"text":"I stopped by on Tues. for a quick dinner of a couple slices on my way to a gathering in Squirrel Hill. I'd tried Mineo's pizza before several years ago, and I remembered enjoying it, but it'd been long enough that I'd forgotten the specifics. Thus, my visit gave me the opportunity to retry and review this legendary pie.  I ordered two plain cheese slices ($3.40), which only took about 5 min. to warm up. Upon biting into them, they seemed promising due to the generous helping of cheese and crispy crust (my personal pizza hangup). However, upon tasting the flavors, I was let down. This is one of the blandest pizzas I've ever tasted--the sauce was nearly flavorless, and the crust tasted like cardboard and had an odd texture (definitely not thin, but not really pan style, either).  The only flavor I clearly tasted was the cheese, which was accompanied by a greasy aftertaste.  Even the addition of oregano and garlic powder did little to increase the complexity of the flavors.  How disappointing!  While the price and service were right, unfortunately, the pizza failed to measure up--esp. in light of my past experience, not to mention the numerous awards Mineo's has won over the years.  Based on those factors and some of the other Yelp reviews, it seems that Mineo's has gone downhill.  At any rate, I'll stick to Aiello's for the time being, and will keep searching for the magic perfect pie-in-the-sky pizza in Sq. Hill."}
{"text":"The pizza was good but was not thrilled with the service. As a new Pittsburgher, I had no idea how to order or what my seating options were at Mineo's so my husband, friend and I walked up to the counter to order in a room that had booths (but was definitely not a sit down/service booth). We then found out that two doors up is the restaurant section. We asked the counter staff if they could bring the pizza out to us at a table in the restaurant.   When we sat at the restaurant, we were given very little attention, assuming because we'd incorrectly ordered in the other room? The server took a long time to bring us waters, did not ask if we wanted a drink, did not refill our waters, did not check in once our pizza came. The restaurant was not super busy so can only figure the reason was we didn't order through her? Signage in either of the spaces (or even a quick explanation as we were placing our order) would have been very helpful in understanding the process.   Anyway, given all the pizza places in Pittsburgh, we'll likely be trying the rounds before making it a point to come back. I'm sure people who'd been to Mineo's before and knew what to expect love their experience but as a new person to the city and restaurant, was pretty turned off by our experience."}
{"text":"Absolutely the best in the 'Burgh. Everything about this pizza is perfect. They put on a ton of cheese, so you really don't need to get extra cheese here. I tend to prefer white pizza at other shops, but Mineo's sauce is so good I opt for the red. If hoagies are your thing, the vegetarian clyde special is really really good.   When you're done eating the pizza/hoagie, stop at the extra dining room and pick up some Prantl's burnt almond torte."}
{"text":"Good sauce, cheese, crust... everything about their pizza is great. They are cash only but there is an ATM if you need it. If you dont like your pepperoni under the cheese, just ask them to put it on top.  This is one of my favorite places to go when I'm back in the 'burgh. And recently they were voted best pizza in the state."}
{"text":"This review is for the ice cream served adjacent to the pizza counter. What makes this place nice is the fact that they often have interesting flavors not seen elsewhere, such as apple pie with actual pie chunks or grasshopper (mint, chocolate, and fudge). The flavors also change regularly. I find them to be a much less expensive alternative to Cold Stone, which is way too indulgent and sweet."}
{"text":"After three days or so of being bedridden sick, and unable to eat solid food, Mineo's was my first solid food meal.  Wise? Not really, no.  Probably should have had toast or jello or something.  But hopped up on meds and ravenously hungry, the idea of what some call \"Pittsburgh's best\" pizza-wise was a siren calling to me from afar.  Dangerous, but irresistible.  I ended up having no trouble eating it, actually, so I got lucky there.   Is this the best pizza I've ever had? No.  Was it pretty good? Yep!  The cheese was laid on a bit thick for my tastes, but other than that it was pretty delicious.  I really didn't see what was terribly remarkable about it, though.  To me, it was a decent pizza, but not a reason to celebrate.    So that's my take on this Squirrel Hill staple.  'Tain't bad, but 'tain't life-changing, either."}
{"text":"Darn good pizza. They only take cash.. no debit cards. I am torn between four stars or five. Christopher's in Jeanette, PA is still my favorite but Mineo's is darn good as well. If Mineo's were in Texas .. it would hands down be a five so I'll go with five."}
{"text":"Ok , I finally made it out to Squirrel Hill , I had to pay Mineo's a visit.  Man , I missed This Pizza !  It is still one of my all time favorites. I ordered a large cheese pizza to go , and they told me 20 min. Well after 45 min , My Pie was finally done. Seems like a really long time to make a pizza , but honestly , after getting home and taking my first bite , all was forgiven. I did get to see a few other places on Murray & Forbes that I gotta try soon.  I wanted to go to Jerry's records & a electronic repair shop , but they were closed at 8:00. Maybe next time I order a Pizza from Mineos , I'll use the 45 min. to buy some old records. ( If I can find my old record player.)"}
{"text":"I have been continually disappointed by Mineo's ice cream. For somewhere between $3-4 (I forget the exact prices) you can get a \"double\" scoop that is about the size of a very small single scoop at any other ice cream shop. The second \"scoop\" isn't even a ball of ice cream, it's basically a sliver. For somewhere between $2-3 you can get a \"single\" scoop that is smaller than a typical kids cone, with the ice cream barely filling the cone. Every time I've gone the cone has been cracked/broken making for a very precarious ice cream situation. The ice cream itself is delicious, which is why I am giving a 2 star review instead of a 1 star. I have been multiple times this summer because we live so close and was hoping that it was just a mistake the first time I got a cone that small. But it's happened now three times. When I asked the scooper today, she said they were instructed to make them that small. We will be going elsewhere for our ice cream. We may have to drive to Oakland to Dave and Andy's, but at least we will get our money's worth with a cone that is actually a normal size."}
{"text":"Mineos is, has and always will be a hit or miss. They have expanded over the years into 3 storefronts. They have ice cream, a full bar and a regular sit down pizza place. When I was younger, there was really no better place to go. Over a span of 10-15 years or so, the pizza was awful. Then came the expansions. With it, the pizza almost returned to its former glory.   That is, until I went there tonight. I sat in the bar section and ordered a beer and a small pizza. The bartender seemed busy and reallt agitated. After 35+ min, it finally came out. It seemed like it took a long time, especially since the couple next to me came in 10 min after me and got their pizza 10 min before I did. It may have been a mistake. Maybe it really takes that long?   I took two bites. It tasted bad. The crust was gummy, the cheese tasted cheap and the sauce was metallic. It was not the thin, sharp cheesy taste I remembered. I literally paid and left and walked up to Aiello's to get slices there. I am yet again feeling disappointed. I want to like it. I used to like it. I don't think I am interested in continuing to try."}
{"text":"Mineo's is the kind of place in between New York style and Chicago deep dish -- geographically too. First, the cheese. The loads of moz on the pie puts the large at 3 lbs. The cheese is supreme, not rubbery nor dry. Second, the crust is rich, buttery, and baked to perfection.  And the size. For a large you get 12 slices for $18 that's cheaper than chain pizza places. Plus the atmosphere of the bar next door makes it a great place to eat in."}
{"text":"**Warning! A legend falls....New management, new pizza, my family woke up this morning with projectile emesis within 3 hrs of eating a calzone! I have been a huge fan of this place since my first calzone in 1994. I haven't eaten there since 2004 or so, so I was going to take my GF there for some sunday night nostalgia snacking. We took  a traditional to go. I had 1/2,  she had 1/4 pcs, and as is our custom w/pizza we let the cats have a finger of mushy dough and sauce at around 2am when we have these carpet picnics. We woke up this morning and everyone in the house,( cats included!) were projectile emesis! I would have said, I deserved it eating so late, except the cats were sick too.  So, it looks like new management, cost cutting on toppings and the dough w/sauce lost it's firmness and it was quite unsatisfying, banal, and common. I would recommend Aiolio's three doors up, unless they've changed too. I'm considering a call to the health department. This is unsat!"}
{"text":"Yum, always good pizza.  Sq Hill and Mt. Lebo locations are both good to stop at.  I know the Mt. Lebanon location sells cuts, I don't remember if Sq. Hill does or not?  I like the plain, but the white is good as well"}
{"text":"BEST greasy, cheesy, gooey pizza evarrrrrr!  Definitely hits the spot when I'm in search for a pizza fix.  The pizza does taste much better if eaten at the joint hot out of the oven since the crust will be crispy, but the quality and taste aren't exactly all that jeopardized if it's taken to go.  Either way, the sausage pizza definitely tantalizes my taste buds!"}
{"text":"As a New Yorker, this is a gem in Pittsburgh. Its a smaller, crispier but cheesier and equally delicious cousin of a traditional New York style pizza. The garlic bread is no bueno and should be replaced by garlicky oily garlic knots but who cares, this place is for pizza. Beware, cash only so come prepared."}
{"text":"I ordered the steak salad with ranch dressing and an order of onion rings. I was very happy with the freshness of the salad ingredients. The onion rings were crispy and flavorful. A friend recommended this location to me and I will be coming back here to try other menu items."}
{"text":"Mineo's in Squirell Hill has the best pizza in all of Pittsburgh! The slices have lots of gooey cheese and it's over 50 years old. It is relatively expensive, but I feel that the food is worth the price, and I like to help out a local business. The best thing to order: a plain pizza. Make sure to grab extra napkins :)"}
{"text":"I just don't get what people like about this place.  I am not a pittsburgh native, but shortly after moving to squirrel hill I had three out-of-state friends come visit and so I decided to try out the famous Mineo's pizza I had heard so much about.  We all ate a slice or two with no one commenting on the pizza, until finally, one person said what had been on all of our minds: \"hey, this isn't very good\".  We all agreed, and we didn't even finish the pizza.  Just too much cheese and an overall low-quality taste.  Maybe we got a bad batch, I don't know, but I was completely unimpressed by this Pittsburgh legend.  On another note, one of my friends really likes to go there for a late night ice cream."}
{"text":"Finally decided to try this place after hearing so many Pittsburgh natives rave about it.  I thought the pizza was good, but nothing extraordinary.   Perhaps all the hype set the standards to high in my head before I tried it.    The staff was very friendly--no complaints there.  The biggest drawback for me is that the the place is cash only--even with tabs over $10 (the standard minimum at most bars I've been to)."}
{"text":"What...in....the....hell....has....happened....to....this....place?  Ordered a sausage pizza.  Sausage was almost non-existent.  Pizza was greasy as could be.  Waited a half an hour, ate about half of the pizza and threw the rest away.  For the price, expected much better.   This used to be the best pizza in Pittsburgh.  I think they think that due to past reputation they can put out whatever garbage they want, and people will eat it up. Obviously they do not care about the competition, which put out much better product and at a far cheaper price.   Mineo's...step it up, guys.  Or the competition will put you out of business, regardless of your past reputation."}
{"text":"I love their pizza!  Ordering take out is so easy.  I have yet to experience a long hold or an inaccurate order! I also like that they don't bombard you with \"would you like to try\" questions before you have a chance to order.  The wait to pick up your pizza has ranged from 15-30 minutes, 30 on a weekend night.  My dad has been stopping by to visit me more and making excuses to order pizza!!! So he drives 45 minutes just for this pizza!"}
{"text":"\"It's nasty. It's so nasty I crave it.\"   \"The cheese is so thick it's like eating a steak!\"  Those are not my words. Those are the words uttered by a lifetime fan of Mineo's when I asked him where I can find the best pizza and why. I was so perplexed by his use of the word \"nasty\" in such a positive manner that I had to try the food. So after watching \"20 Feet from Stardom\" at The Manor Theater, we went to try Mineo's  Like many of the pizza parlors in the area, you must order at the counter. Our order: Italian Wedding Soup Meatballs Parmesan  16\" Pepperoni Pizza  It's amazing how many people come in and out of Mineo's, most leaving with only a slice and never taking a seat. I was able to watch the interactions, comings, and goings of the other patrons as I waited in one of the wooden booths. The arrival of he soup was a welcome distraction due to my hunger.  I liked the fact that the soup was not overly complex and that the broth had a strong cheese flavor to it. So many places like to add too many extra items to an already busy soup. I was happy that Mineo's version relied on the main ingredients. I returned to people watching after finishing the soup and waited on the rest of the food to arrive.  The pizza and meatballs arrived a short time later. As hot as the pizza was, I decided to try the meatballs first so as not to scorch my mouth too bad. The flavor of the meatballs were okay. They bordered on having too much filler for my taste. The sauce was the same way, it tasted like the balance of spice to base was a but off. I ate half a meatball and left the rest for others.  I looked over at the pizza and took in the pretty image it created in my mind. I didn't see any pepperoni on it, but figured it must be in there somewhere. Taking a piece, I tested the heat and then took a bite.  \"The cheese is so thick it's like eating a steak!\"  That description came back to me at that moment. And it was not undercooked like so many other pizza places that like it pile on cheese. All of the cheese was melted and it was even browned and bubbling on top - big plus! The pepperoni was hidden within the vast sea of cheese. Personally, I prefer my pepperoni to be on top so that it can crisp, but the  pepperoni they used was fairly tasty even hidden from view.   The one detractor from the pizza was the sauce. In my opinion, it was almost over seasoned. The closer I came to the crust, the thicker the sauce, and the flavor, became. I like the Italian spices, but they are easily overdone very much in the same way that cumin is overdone in many Hispanic foods.  I will be eating at Mineo's again, my friends really enjoyed the cheesiness."}
{"text":"Lived in Pittsburgh for 15 years and believe this is the best pie in town. Order a pepperoni mushroom and eat it there. Not good for reheating or takeout because cheese will cool down. Nice addition to restaurant."}
{"text":"My in-law's seriously talked this place up to me, so when we were in town my honey took me here for some pizza. I don't mean to hate...maybe I have no right since I'm such an out-of-towner, but I wasn't a fan. I get the hype; it's an established piece of Pittsburgh charm, but it just didn't do it for me. Way too much cheese! I couldn't even believe it. And I adore cheese. I worship cheese. It was too much for me.  Keep on keepin' on, other people seem to love it, but it wasn't for me. Definitely dig the restaurant itself though. Neat little spot."}
{"text":"I mean, the pizza is edible, but not worth the calories.  Boring, nasty, wouldn't go there again."}
{"text":"I sort of feel my heart breaking writing this review. The hype and love for Mineo's Pizza is stuff of Pittsburgh legend. I know not all pizza is for everyone, I personally am a fan of a style of pizza many people hate: thin flakey pastry crust with sweet sauce, but these sounded like straight forward delicious quintessential Pittsburgh pizza.  Having a car is truly expanding my pizza horizons in this city. Branching out to neighborhoods and pizzerias outside of delivery and walking range is amazing. One evening we decided to finally experience the mythical Mineo's.   I called ahead and the girl who answered the phone was polite, informative, and quick. I always like to try a plain Jane cheese pizza to truly test a pizzeria. A large plain cheese pizza was $17. I was floored. That's more expensive then a specialty large or extra large at most other places. I still placed the order, as by this point I needed to know.  The boyfriend dropped me off and I ran in to get the pizza. The interior reminds me of a pizza place I loved in my youth. Orange booths. Wooden walls. Dark interior. The smell of the pizza was UNREAL good. I actually found myself salivating. The employees were friendly and I was in and out in no time.  Once home we sat down to assess this masterpiece we'd purchased. A fluffy crust, almost too much cheese (which is hard for me to say because I love cheese), nicely browned. It looked great. Upon tasting though, I couldn't believe it; so salty. It was overpowering and seemed to be coming from the cheese itself not the sauce. In all it wasn't a bad pizza, and the second day was much better than fresh which isn't really a good thing (no matter how much I love what the boyfriend and I call \"tomorrow slices\").   I may stop in for a slice here and there if I'm in the area, but I don't think I'd ever pay those prices for a whole pizza again. I don't think Mineo's lives up the the hype."}
{"text":"Oh how the mighty have fallen.  It's sad that Mineo's has obviously become one of the places that relies on it's legacy to keep open. Your wallet will be mad at you after buying one of this sullen slice pies.  There just isn't anything noteworthy that should make anyone go here over a good handful of other pgh pizza places, and dear god it's near 20 dollars for a large here.  Don't go here. Let the legend die."}
{"text":"Mineo's is in a league all its own when it comes to pizza. I'm not saying it's the best, but it's a very different slice altogether.   Mineo's is a sweeter pizza, with plenty of cheese and an always crispy toasted crust. There is an art to eating Mineo's when you order in--you can't eat it immediately. Wait a couple minutes for it to cool down, but not too long! Mineo's is at it's very best when eaten fresh.   This spot is always bustling, and the shop has recently taken over three full storefronts: a causal pizza parlor, an ice cream area, and restaurant/bar. There is a full bar in the restaurant, and beer in coolers in the other section. I was surprised how great the selection is! I've found some really hard to find stuff tucked away in the coolers.  The only downside to this spot is it's cash only, all the time. It's fine for a few slices, but can be tough if I want to grab a drink or entree. Not too much to complain about, always happy to snack on a slice."}
{"text":"This place is a solid 2 star joint.  The multiple times I've been here, the pizza has been somewhat inconsistent.  Sometimes it is better than others, but overall it's just not that fantastic.  I think I agree with a lot of the other posts that it rides on its past fame.  I always end up going back though because my friends insist that we go there for a few slices.  So I'll be honest, if it's put in front of my face, I will not hesitate to eat it.  However, there are plenty of other better options for pizza in and around the Burgh."}
{"text":"Too much sauce with too much cheese. It's fine but too many other quality pizza shops in town. But the worse part of this place is their rude employees. If you want a good slice, skip this place and head to Badamo's."}
{"text":"My wife and I are pizza snobs. We've tried sooo many places and are always looking for a new favorite. Well, this is now our number 2 place. Don't let the appearance deter you. The pizza is amazing. We had pepperoni like we always do. It's our benchmark. Every part of the pizza was great. The sauce was unbelievable. Take my word on this. It's a great pie. Oh, even warmed up later it was just as good."}
{"text":"It's a toss-up. It seems that a lot great, low-cost restaurants with high patronage and lots of awards in this area have one big thing in common: GREASE. The pizza tasted great, but I could feel my arteries clogging as we ate, and I think the only reason I let myself eat the whole slice was because I knew I'd be going for a long, intense bike ride afterward."}
{"text":"Listen, any review less than five stars is basically a crime.  Mineo's is a Pittsburgh destination pizza for out-of-towners and a hometown treat for locals.  No, they don't deliver, but that's the badge you earn as a business owner when your food is that good.  You want the best pizza in Pittsburgh?  Then get in your car and drive to Squirrel Hill and pick it up!  Mineo's is covered in cheese, thick, glorious cheese.  The crust is made from the wings of angels and the toppings are fresh and typically hidden within said glorious cheese.  The prices are a little higher for pizza (but of course worth it) and they used to only take cash, but that may have changed.  But again, when you're that good, you make the rules, and I'll gladly follow them."}
{"text":"Hands down, best pizza I've ever had. Nothing more to say.  Let it cool down before you eat it. The cheese will slide off.  On that note, a regular cheese pizza is like extra cheese pizza anywhere else...however, I love that.  Sauce is good. Crust is so amazing and like nothing I've ever had. Crunchy, chewy, tasty.   Bahhhh I love this place."}
{"text":"They serve up a great slice of pizza. During my last visit to Pittsburgh I ate there three days in a row, one of those days I ate there twice. You will never needs to order extra cheese, I don't even know if you can, because the cheese is just right. It will come off the pizza if you don't take a bite like a man so be warned. Also, it is hot out of the oven so those with dainty mouths needs to give it a second.  I would recommend getting a canoli from next door while you wait because they are legit."}
{"text":"Mineos is always amazing! A Pittsburgh favorite and must have! Everything there is pricey, but the pizza is worth trying out. I've loved coming to Mineos since I was a kid and strongly encourage people to go! It's one of the best pizzas in the city hands down."}
{"text":"Mineo's has to be in the top five of my \"best pizza I've ever tasted\" list!! It's something about the cheese and crust combination that makes it so delightful!! I grew up in Pittsburgh and always used to come here..now every time I'm in town this is on my must stop list!!  There is a lot of cheese on the pizza but it's soooo good!! I normally just get cheese pizza; it's so good it doesn't even need toppings. The crust is flaky and thin and the sauce is good! If you're ever in Pittsburgh I would definitely recommend that you stop here for a slice. It's cash only but they do have an atm inside!"}
{"text":"Is this the best pizza EVER, worthy of hours-long drives and a \"must stop\" for out-of-towners? I don't think so. But might it be the best pizza in Pittsburgh, the land of lackluster pizza? Quite possibly.   Despite the fact that I used to live in Squirrel Hill, I hadn't tried this famous pizza until recently. We were in the neighborhood and decided to pick up a pie. Fortunately, we happened to be carrying cash that day (which rarely is the case), as we discovered upon arrival that they're cash-only. I still can't believe cash-only businesses still exist in 2017...but I digress. We ordered the sicilian-style pizza (of which there is only one size...the humongous, \"you'll-hate-yourself tomorrow\" special) and it was ready in about 20 minutes. Just picking up the box made me wonder what we had gotten ourselves into....I swear the pizza felt like it weighed about 10 lbs! Pro tip: If you're taking it back to your house in your car, be careful about where you put the box....ours was leaking oil, which luckily I noticed before it stained our back seat.  When we got this monstrosity home, we opened the box and suddenly I understood why the box felt like an anchor and was leaking oil....there was SO. MUCH. CHEESE. If you're a cheese lover, you'll like this pizza. The crust was super thick (as it should be on a sicilian-style), but not tough....it was soft and chewy and held up to all of that cheese well. I also thought their pizza sauce was top notch....it  balanced sweetness and acidity perfectly and tasted fresh. Overall, it was a really delicious pie, and it makes me want to go back to try their regular thin crust pizza. There are a lot of pizza places in the 'Burgh that I haven't been to, so it's hard to say unequivocally that this is the best Pittsburgh pizza, but it's certainly the best I've had so far. I can see why it's been historically loved among the locals. I'll definitely be back!"}
{"text":"You already know that the pizza is the best in Pittsburgh, or you should. But you may not know that the newish bar is a great place to enjoy that pizza, and maybe one too many beers.  While I've been coming here since I was a kid, the bar/table service dining room is a relatively new addition. The bar itself pretty big, taking up most of the new space, with comfortable stools and nice decor.   They have a good happy hour from 5 to 6:30, seven days a week. Love that. Plus, their drink prices are reasonable to start with. Both Dale's Pale Ale and Brooklyn Brown were $5 regular price. And what goes better with Mineo's perfect pizza than a cold beer?  Finally, the service is great. Elissa has waited on us the 5 or so times we've visited, and she is friendly and attentive. I heard from another customer that she makes Pittsburgh's best Long Island, but I haven't tried one yet to confirm. Something to look forward to for inevitable future visits."}
{"text":"Mineo's is one of my favorites. Even when I was newly pregnant and sick as a dog - I could still stomach a slice of their pizza! So anyways, we came for lunch on a Saturday.  Crust is thin on the bottom. Lots of sauce (I prefer light sauce, but..) and heavy cheese that you can literally eat off your pizza with a fork which is my favorite part.  The wedding soup was kind of slimey, so I probably wouldn't order that again.  Some negatives about this place: cash only / which would be totally fine except we bank out of state so we very very rarely carry cash.  Parking / minimal street parking.. it was freezing so we were trying to avoid walking far but we didn't luck out with on street parking.. we used the metered parking lot 2ish streets down.  It was also kind of dirty but the staff was well aware and extremely attentive. Once we picked a table, they came over and cleaned it. They were also very very kind at the counter."}
{"text":"A classic pizza parlor (it was even featured in Life Magazine) that serves up some of the best slices of pizza I've had.  Yes, you'll want to dab off some of the grease with a napkin, but the crust is perfection and the sauce has a wonderful, gentle spicy kick."}
{"text":"Very good Pizza. I had a half pepperoni and sausage pizza. Good sauce and quality cheese. Definitely will return, the next time I'm in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"this place is super fire, I like this pizza better than the one next door which is also great.  its a must try."}
{"text":"$20 for a pizza that had CANNED mushrooms??!!! I can hardly believe it, but that's what I paid and that's what I got. I don't understand how a place so popular in this city is using canned anything. Why not fresh??!!  There are places in this city that have a better pizza for a less costly price. I still love la gondola in downtown over Mineo's. Too bad because I really wanted to like Mineo's."}
{"text":"Mineo's serves a unique style of Pizza. It's not the type of pizza you will find in most of the of the other joints in the 'bugh. It's very good, just different. Let me describe it for you: The crust is neither too thick or to thin and is quite flaky and soft. The sauce also is pretty standard, but the difference comes with the cheese and toppings. At Mineos the pepperoni is actually placed under the cheese. And there is not just a couple pieces sporadically tossed over the pie, but instead the entire thing is covered with thick sliced pepperoni. To top it off the cheese is layered on like an inch thick. I've never seen so much cheese on a pizza before. And it is greasy, I'm talking grease ponds pooling on the slices. For my tastes it is great, but i can see why other people don't like it. Have a gallon of water handy after you finish eating. Every time I eat here I am thirsty or hours afterwards. Like most pizza places you either love it or hate it.  A large one topping isn't cheap, something like 20 dollars. But in my opinion well worth the extra 5 dollars to support a local restaurant instead of some chain."}
{"text":"Yummy.  Pizza and great beer selection.  We are talking perfect combination.  I really like all the additional menu items as well.  Definitely one of the best pizza places I have ever been."}
{"text":"In my opinion the pizza here is better than Aiello's, but the staff is impersonal. Take the awesome people at Aiello's & combine with this pizza & it's a home run."}
{"text":"There's just something different about this pizza. It's amazing. Their Sicilian is great. But they don't accept cards. Which kind of stinks. But they do remind you before you come to pick up an order or before they deliver."}
{"text":"As compared to Aiello's Pizza down the street, at least Mineo's looks like a pizza shop! The decor was typical of the kind of pizza places I grew up with, so that was definitely a plus.  The pizza itself was decent. Nothing special, but not bad either. If pressed, I would go again, but this certainly wouldn't be a pizza joint I jump for the chance to visit."}
{"text":"I was having a really hard time picking where to go for dinner (as always) and after several hours of debating we settled on pizza. So where to go?   We didn't want to go anywhere too far from Oakland, and it was getting late, so we decided to go here.  We heard rumors of their pizza and a local even stopped us to tell us how good it was saying that it was \"the best\". That combined with my intense hunger I was ravenous to try their pizza. We got a simple small cheese pizza (even though I'm usually a topping kind of girl) and my god. The worst part about a fresh pizza is that you can't help but biting into the pizza too early leaving you with a burnt tongue.   We fought through the pain and let me say, it was amazing. Totally worth the wait, the pizza itself was fine without any toppings due to the amazing quality of the cheese and tomato sauce. Usually pizzerias get the crust wrong, but this was perfectly crispy and wasn't bland at all! The soft melted cheese combined with the crisp crust made for a perfect pizza.   Afterwards we decided to get a cannoli - because, who doesn't enjoy a good cannoli? These where stuffed to the brim with the creamy filling and were freshly made. They wait until the last minute to put the icing in so the shell doesn't get soggy, so no worries there.   TLDR: Pizza good. Cannoli good. Would go again."}
{"text":"The famous chef Thomas considers Mineos to be the best pizza in the Pittsburgh region. The pizza sauce and cheese is the absolute best. New York pizza has nothing on this place. Chefthomas.recipes"}
{"text":"Nice place for an Italian dinner if you can walk from home/find street parking. Hubby enjoyed the pepperoni pizza, I got the meatball parm (sooo cheesy) and a salad. Somebody was confused, though, because the waitstaff kept trying to serve my dishes to the lady looking at a menu at a completely different table. They've got a central bar with stools for drinks/food and tvs on the walls playing sports. The front opens onto (covered) sidewalk seating."}
{"text":"This is a staple amoung the food stops in Pittsburgh for us! Had another amazing pizza (pepperoni, sausage and onion) and tried their stuffed banana peppers.  The stuffed banana peppers were amazing! Whole peppers stuffed to the brim with their Italian spiced sausage. Absolutely tender and just a little kick of spice at the end! Another amazing experience dining here!"}
{"text":"Ordered takeout from here the day before we moved out of town - so we had no chairs in our apartment, and needed something we could eat quickly, standing up against a counter.  PIzza made the most sense!  Since Mineo's is a classic Pittsburgh pizza joint, we thought we should finally check it out.  I trudged over in the snow to pick up our pizzas, which were about $20 each for a large with 1-2 toppings.  The counter staff was extremely friendly and gave me all the extra plates and silverware I needed because ours was all packed.  I carried them back to our apartment where we opened them up, and saw that the cheese had sort of....swirled around messily in the center of the pizzas.  As if the cheese wasn't firmly attached to the crust, but sort of a loose, amorphous being with a mind of its own.  I immediately started apologizing, fearing that I had tilted the pizzas while I was carrying them, but then one of our friends said \"No, that's how it always is from Mineo's.\"  Um, okay.  Kind of weird, but at least it wasn't my fault!  The pizza was tasty, but very messy.  It didn't really stay uniform and attached, with globs of cheese sliding off the crust into the middle of the box.  People would pull out a slice and suddenly realize they only had crust and sauce because everything else was gone.  It's like there's too much cheese for such a thin crust, it can't support the weight!  So it was definitely knife and fork pizza, but it was decent-tasting.  Pretty standard.  But I have to say - GROSSLY overpriced for what you get.  And thus the two stars.  If this pizza was like...$7 less per pie, I'd give it 3 stars.  But seriously - it's just ridiculous.  It really was totally average, but they charge you like it's made of gold.   I truly do not understand what makes this such a lauded pizza place."}
{"text":"Horrible.  Tried it several times.  Taste like frozen Pizza.  Found a hair in it the first time so against my better judgement tried it again.  I swear it was worse than my first experience.  The locals that like this joint must have smoker destroyed taste buds."}
{"text":"Skip this! You can not eat this pizza in the car while driving. It too greasy!  I had to use the box for a napkin. The crust is chewy. The sauce is meh. The cheese is meh. The pepperoni is small and meh. The green pepper is raw and tasteless. Four slices with pepperoni an green pepper was $9.60, and they ONLY take cash.  I had to pay to park to pick this up, A quarter for (2) minutes. So far Campiti in Dormont is the best. Fiori's is bad too. I would skip this pizza shoppe if I were you."}
{"text":"Better pizza than any chain.  Better pizza that you would get anyplace other than NYC or Jersey.  BUT, why go here when just up the street is Napoli?  Mineo's has the rep, Napoli has the better pie."}
{"text":"Delicious pizza!! The sauce is sweeter than I normally like but everything else ingredient wise is spot on so it's hard to complain. Dined here with my husband and 10 month old and it felt kid friendly enough. Staff was friendly and service prompt."}
{"text":"I don't see the attraction. This place DEFINES \"living on past glory\"  For pizza, its not cheap.  The pizza doesn't taste all that good and is greasy at best.  The place has not been renovated since the 70's and it shows."}
{"text":"I had a situation in which I couldn't eat most of the day, and picked Mineo's a the place to chow down at the end of the ordeal.  I noticed they have Arancini on their menu and wanted to try them.  I have not seen them anywhere else in the US but ate them all over Sicily.  I wanted to see how they handled them.  They were round, hot, and made with a mix of peas, rice, and ground meat.  They were served with a red sauce that my husband liked but I thought they didn't need any sauce.  Compared to the dozens we ate in Sicily, we thought these were solidly in the middle of the pack--which is a high compliment since food quality is generally much higher in Sicily.  Given the Sicilian theme, I also chose to go with Sicilian pizza.  Very bready pizza like this is not my husband's favorite, but it was a nice change since neither of us had this type in many, many years.  Also we were painfully hungry upon arrival.  I also decided to go with the John's Special since it's our mode to opt for house specialties when available.  This meant that we got sausage, peperoni, green peppers, and onions for toppings.  We thought this was a good value since the individual toppings are pricey.  Even though we were so crazy hungry, we each only managed to eat two pieces of the pizza.  It was a satisfying experience.  We ate the pizza for breakfast the next day, and the next day, and lunch another day, and finally took it to my parents.  At $28 it wound up being a good value...a gift that kept on giving.  And it made dad happy, because he LOVES leftovers that are not his own.  Would I deal with the hassle of the heat and the wait at Mineo's again?  Probably not.  Twice before we set out to eat there and decided we couldn't manage it.  For me, it fit the bill for the specific events of that day.  If I was in Squirrel Hill and wanted pizza, I would just get a slice to go from one of the other shops on Murray."}
{"text":"Stopped in for a couple quick slices of plain red sauce.  $1.60 each.  They were really great.  I loved the sauce, some of the best I have had.  I sprinkled some oregano over and it was great.  It was short of greatness, however, because of the amount of cheese.  Way too much and really hard to get down.  I would definitely go back and order a pie with 1/2 the amount of cheese and some toppings.  Some may love the cheese but I, like Darren, found it overwhelming."}
{"text":"It took me a long time to \"get\" this place. Like 5 years.   I don't love spicy tomato sauce on a pizza (and this is spicy and oregano-y) and the crust is bright yellow!! But in time I found I loved this pizza. Quality ingredients, a fair deal, quick, fresh pies, BYOB, a friendly, low-key atmosphere.    Strange, and definitely Pittsburgh.  UPDATE: I can't believe I forgot to mention the amazing discovery I had right before I left Pittsburgh - the tiramisu at Mineo's is pretty good. Maybe a little too sweet, but it does not taste like the fridge. At this price, and in this town (sad but true), that's saying a lot. For example, at the famous Dish the desserts taste like the fridge.  Oh, and the ice cream is not exactly quality, but I liked it. If you are serious about mint, the peppermint patty is an experience."}
{"text":"While I can not say the Pizza I have been ordering there since 1981 central catholic football games. I have to say is excellent. But this new bread of employees is for the bird. I watched one of the pizza men argue with a customer. Are you serious like the customer was not yelling or causing a scene. I was so appalled at the behavior.  I won't order a thing while me low self esteem is working. That was so wrong what a horrible way to treat a woman. What a horrible way to represent Mineos. I am shocked. I'm glad the lady did not get loud that way so uncalled for."}
{"text":"One of the top four pizza places in the city. Mineo's can hold its own with any nyc pizza place.  At $1.80 a slice for plain and 2.25 with a topping, extremely cheap too!  I'm sure the rest of their menu is excellent as well. They have some cool vintage posters and nostalgic memorabilia on the wall as well.   They now have a full service sit down bar area in the back with flat screens and beer and happy hour specials!"}
{"text":"Best pizza in the city. Period."}
{"text":"Want a biased review of a local Pizza joint? Look no further. C'mon guys this is your classic battle of what amazing thing is the most amazing-est. Pizza is my favorite food and so this review is critical of everything.   In Pittsburgh, there is no better Pizza as of right now. I don't know about the saddle these 3 star reviews ride on but my 5 should help off-set any overly critical reviews. The pizza is great. Yes, greasy. Yes, heavily cheesy. Crust, crunchy. Toppings average. But it is everything you want. This is a saltier pizza with a tasty homemade herb tomato sauce, all cooked the way you want it. The takeout boxes were recently upgraded which was easily the biggest negative (it used to burn your hands as you held it and sagged in the middle.  They have good sides and what not but that isn't what you go here for. I go here for a appetizer of plain, a main course of onion and mushroom and a delectable pepperoni desert.  Oh by the way, if you really want desert, Mineos is connected to and owns the desert and Ice Cream Parlor next door; walk through the middle, no need to leave.  Meanwhile these people gave it a 3 star review? pssh. So what about a beverage? Pop? you got it. Soda? maybe somewhere else (but really, you got it). BEER? BEER HERE my friends. Quite a nice selection of local and imported beers available by the bottle at the pizza parlor. Want more? they have six packs. Don't want it in a bottle, you prefer tap? Mineo's owns the bar two doors down from the original, next to the ice cream parlor you can get your favorites on tap there and catch the game whilst enjoying a slice of my favorite pizza in Pittsburgh.  To me, this place is JUST RIGHT.    P.s- Don't hold it to your silly New York pizza standards. Its great pizza. Not claiming to be the best pizza in all of the milky way."}
{"text":"I've been eating Mineo's all my life. I moved a little bit away from the city so I don't get it too often anymore. My dad picked us up 2 pies today and I swear it's only getting better. Probably the best pie I've had from there in my whole life! You won't be disappointed!"}
{"text":"Just get to Mineos right now! It's a pittsburgh tradition. If you are the kind of person who critiques pizza based on aesthetics then go somewhere else. If you like homemade sauce and dough topped with a thick layer of cheese served up hot by great employees, then get yourself to Murray Ave. and bring your appetite."}
{"text":"I found this to be highly overrated. The sauce wasn't that flavorful, the crust is not really worth eating, and the pepperoni is placed underneath the cheese so it's not crisp. Not sure how the reviews are so glowing, but there is far better pizza in Pittsburgh. Let's not forget they don't deliver, don't accept credit cards or have online orders. No thanks. Rather have a great pizza from a place that realizes it's 2018."}
{"text":"Best pizza in Pittsburgh! The cheese is the most interesting part and super unique - definitely not your average Joe's. I've been dining here for 30+ years and it's always my first stop when I come back to the area."}
{"text":"Two things Mineo's taught me: 1) There is such thing as too much cheese. 2) Some pizza slices really do need to be blotted.  Normally, I roll my eyes when people blot their pizza--what's pizza without some grease?--but Mineo's slices are an exception.   The sauce here is pretty good, but as is the case with the cheese, there's too much of it.  I've burned my finger holding down the cheese as I bite into my slice so I don't end up pulling off all of it.  I thought the crust leaned towards being a little too crispy.  I like the paneled walls and the framed photos--check out the Life magazine cover of young Molly Ringwald.  But I don't come to a pizza place for ambiance, so it's not enough to keep me from looking at other places for a superior slice."}
{"text":"Very nice ending to a very nice December day in the 'Burgh.  We started with the risotto balls, they were tasty but a tad overdone. Loved the flavors inside, peas were a great texture and flavor.   The pizza at Mineo's is very good.  We opted for the traditional crust which is not a lot of bottom crust but the perfect edge finish.  Perfectly flavored sauce and generous toppings.   Hubs had the hot sausage hoagie which was very large on the bread, small on the sausage and so much sauce that it couldn't be picked up. He also got an order of fries that were huge, crisp and very good.  We would definitely go back for the fabulous pizza, but probably wouldn't try anything else.   Also, I've had Mineo's take out pizza many times and can tell you that these pies travel very well!"}
{"text":"I met my husband here for lunch today and was excited because I've heard a lot of good things about mineo's. It's a decent sized pizza shop, enough tables for 20 to 30 people and they get you your food pretty quickly. They serve beers as well even though it was rather early for one of those.  I ordered two regular slices while my husband ordered 2 slices topped with pepperoni, mushrooms and green peppers. When our order was ready a mere 5 minutes after ordering I noticed that my husband's veggies were completely raw and just sitting on top of the pizza. It's like they took a plain slice, warmed some veggies and just tossed it on top. I'm use to my veggies being incorporated into the cheese. I understand the need for speed and convenience but I don't want to pick my slice up and have all the toppings just fall off.   My slices were hot and cheesy with the shiny gleam of grease floating on top. Not too much but more than I wanted. I have to admit that I wasn't too thrilled about the flavor. It literally just tasted like melted cheese on bread. I could barely taste the sauce which had a sweet after taste that I'm not fond of. The crust was had a good bite too it, not too thick and not too thin but again it lacked flavor.I normally eat the end of the crust if it's good but this crust tasted too much like flower. I ended up only finishing 1 and 1/2 slices and gave the rest to my husband.  I was expecting a little more spices and flavoring in the sauce but this tasted like gas station pizza to me. I probably won't be back here even though they have other items on the menu. Sorry Mineo's: I just wasn't impressed."}
{"text":"The pizza war between Mineo's and Aielo's pizza.  One saturday I decided to judge for myself who indeed had the best pizza.  Mineo's won the battle!  The sauce was much more flavorful and cheese was better quality.  Highly recommend if you are in the squirrel hill area."}
{"text":"Stopped here because we heard that this was the best pizza place in Pittsburgh. I will say the pizza sauce had a great peppery flavor and the cheese was creamy and bold, but the service and environment was subpar at best. Maybe it's because I'm from the Midwest, but the attitudes of every person we interacted with were just above the mark of rude. The environment reflects your local pizza joint, nothing fancy and is exactly what you would expect, but the smell was what I couldn't stand. It smelled like bathroom air freshener, which was hard to get over since you're standing in one of the most famous pizza places in the city. I expected to inhale the scent of delicious melted cheese with greasy pepperoni and a perfectly toasted crust, but was met with a Porta-Potty fragrance. The food was pretty tasty, but I recommend getting it to go so that you don't have to interact with the staff."}
{"text":"The best pizza in Pittsburgh. I've been coming since I was old enough to drive myself. The quality has never wavered. Aiello's is excellent too, but I'm a Mineo's guy."}
{"text":"I ordered two slices of the cheese pizza. Their slices are a bit small, but at $1.80 they are a good value.  The cheese was thick and a blend of salty, milky savouriness. The sauce tastes fresh, slighty sweet and slightly acidic. The crust was very crunchy and dense. Because I prefer chewy and thin crust, this was not the right accompanying crust for me.  This pizza was savoury, sweet, and had a thick and crunchy mouthfeel that gave it a slighty crackery element. It's quite good."}
{"text":"I am sorry to say that after having been an Aiellos fan( recently my family and I have been consistently disappointed there)for years, we decided to give Mineos a second try with disappointing results also.This is definitely not the pizza I remember from the 70s and 80s but totally has been revamped with a lower quality cheese and bland toppings -it literally had no taste!I am going back to Aiellos because a bad piece of pizza there is better than what I just experienced -the only redeeming value of Mineos is the price is cheaper."}
{"text":"If you're new to the Burgh, you may want to give them a try.   1. They are cash only (they offer a atm onsite for a fee) 2. A small pie with one topping is moderately priced, i.e. $15 3. It's a cross between a New York and Chicago pie, but minus the deep dish. 4. Great pizza when it's hot right out the oven, but not the greatest when reheated the next day   The 3 Stars reflect the issues with it not being as tasty the next day, and the inconvenience of not taking cards; for the price you pay for food, cards should be accepted."}
{"text":"Mineo's has the reputation for being one of the better pizza places in Pittsburgh. I've always heard good things about their pizza, but never got around to going to Mineo's before. I decided to finally stop in and give it a try to see how good it really was. I got two slices of Sicilian pizza and a small drink for lunch and the total came out to be $7.25 (just remember that Mineo's is cash only.) The pizza had a good combination of sauce, bread, and cheese. It was quite filling as well. Their pizza is delicious and I was able to get in and out for a quick lunch. Overall, I'd say Mineo's is a pretty good place to grab a slice (or a whole pie.)"}
{"text":"For the type of pizza that this is.... it's probably the second best in Pittsburgh, after Fiores. I do remember it being much better last time, but i blame me. My tastes have changed. I like fresh sourdough dough, fresh mozzarella cheese, and fresh homemade tomato sauce. You know, the trendy hipster pizza that has been taking over the world....  This pizza is exactly what you would expect for a joint that opened 50 years ago, or whenever it opened. It's loaded with mozzarella cheese, sauce is decent, covered in grease. It reminds me of when I was a kid and I would melt cheese in a bowl and shove it in my mouth. The cheese is thick and rubbery and you couldn't ask for more. It's a very satisfying pizza. It would be great if there were little Parmesan shakers of cheese at the restaurant. Overall, it's great but if I want a pizza from the 70s, I'd probably choose fiores.."}
{"text":"Just as good as Sq. Hill location.  Mineo's is as good as it gets.  The pies are straightforward and not fancy.  No reason for them to be.  This location is also byob - bonus!"}
{"text":"Aw hell. I heard good things about this place but was once again left wrestling with how to rate a restaurant.  I dunno guys, I got that Fiori's feeling. Regular readers will remember my 2 controversial reviews of that particular establishment.   Now, the crust was done rather well; crunchy and a little chewy. The sauce was so gloriously, thickly succulent I kept licking it from of my fingers.   That cheese, blanketed over the pepperoni (our lone topping today),  was ALL Fiori's, and therefore killed it for me. One could use it to caulk up windows or plug leaky tires.  Like Fiori's, Mineo's cheese is gummy, not yummy and even slid right off of each slice as we bit into it. You should not have to eat the cheese apart from the pizza or keep trying to reapply it. Unforgivable.   Put some of DeMino's or DiCarlo's cheese on Mineo's pizza, and you'd have a near-classic. Maybe I can get them to sell me a cheeseless pizza so I can put my own cheese on it. Brie perhaps? Hmmm.   We ordered a pair of cannoli for dessert, and while they weren't bad with their chocolate-lined ice-cream cone quality, the cream inside wasn't sweet enough. No one seems to be able to make a better cannoli than Kribel's Bakery in Brookline, and I was almost charged 16 dollars for them! The guy behind the counter forgot that we already paid for our pizza, which brings me to the service...  The staff epitomizes Gen-X slackerdom. Oh, they look cool with their tats, piercings, and subversive tees straight outta South Side or Lawrenceville, but their hospitality is like, Dullsville, man. They take your order, you pay for it at the counter (Was the cat tryin' to hustle me as he coughed incessantly into his hands?), and then they just put your pizza up onto said counter, quietly calling out \"It's ready.\" We had to make eye contact with one of the help so that we knew our pepperoni pizza was finished.  I had to get up, take the hot pie pan back to our table (OUCH!!! %^&&$!!!!), and then go back to get the flimsy PAPER plates and strangely enough, real silverware. We also had to bus our own tables.   As wildly busy as they can be, at least Beto's brings your food out to your table after you order it and manages to offer a superior (albeit odd) pizza to boot. Mineo's was rather slow today, so there was no excuse for such lazy, detached service.  However, I will say that it is rather posh looking inside (it's in a posh side of town) with a nice refrigerated case displaying all sorts of pastas, salads, and expensive desserts (12 bucks for a slice of cake? Nuh-uh). And again, that pizza would have been an easy 4 stars with better cheese, but I have to be honest and go 3, regardless of their lineage to the fabled Mineo's in Squirrel Hill. Sorry guys, this is the best I can give yinz.   Yes, they have a tip jar.   No, I dropped not a nickel into it."}
{"text":"Note: This is a review of the adjacent Mineo's Ice Cream & Sweet Treats, which seems to share the same address despite being next door. I want to put up a separate listing, but I can't find anything to indicate that the ice cream parlor has a different street number.   After eating at Ka Mei, we both wanted dessert. The sign above the door, one that screams \"independent,\" beckoned us.  Wouldn't ya know they use Edy's ice cream and bring in their other desserts (pies, cakes, tortes, oh my!) from outside bakeries?  So I ordered a caramel apple pie with vanilla ice cream. The pie was tall, full of apples, and was heated in an actual oven instead of a microwave. It satiated my sweet tooth, but a visit to a supermarket could have gotten me the same thing, y'know? I mean, ya buy a pie, a pint of ice cream, you're all set. Is it that hard to bake your own pies and make your own ice cream? Why bother with storebought stuff, even if it's pretty decent?   P.S. I didn't try the pizza but can't imagine it differs much from the underwhelming (in my opinion) Mt. Lebanon Mineo's."}
{"text":"One of my favorite pizza places.  Yay, I am a fan!    Walk in and notice a nice aroma and usually get a hello from the guys working.    Have been told that the ingredients are fresh even the sauce is homemade and the I like the sauce flavors, although not to spicy and a nice tomato taste.  I think the cheese may be one of the reasons it is so good.     This is not a NY or Chicago style, a crust that is tasty and a thin medium (is there a thin medium?) and a nice texture with a crispy crust edge.  Mineo's seems to put more cheese on then many pizza places and usually I don't want a lot of cheese but it works at Mineo's.  Sometimes the cheese seems to get a little greasy looking but not today, and it is always good.   The pepperoni slices are thicker and very tasty.    Cash only but an ATM on sight."}
{"text":"We ordered cheese and also pepperoni pizza , took 30 min and we came to find out that our order had been messed up, no problem because we were offered money back or extra pizza, we chose the extra pizza..When it came out it was verrrry cheesy and gooey and dripping with (grease?) but tasted like butter .. The 1st bite that I took, I literally choked on the cheese.. And continued to choke for a few more bites , definately be careful.. The pepperoni pizza was spicy and definately less cheesy.. I'm on the fence about this place , it was good but bizarre.."}
{"text":"Went to Mineo's Pizza House the other night for dinner. I should of had the pizza which seems to be highly recommended. Instead I had the chicken parm with ziti and a house salad and garlic bread. It is basically a pizzeria so you order up front and then sit and wait to be called. The salad was pretty good as well as the garlic bread. Th Chicken parm was just ok a bit dry and did not thrill me at all. The chicken parm was just not that good. I would not go back to Mineo's for a regular diner. However I will be going back to try the pizza as it does seem to get rave reviews. If I go back i will update my review and let everyone know how the pizza is. The staff where friendly and the service was fast. Unfortunately from this experience i can not give them more than 3 stars as the food was not that great."}
{"text":"Good traditional hand tossed pie.  Good sauce and cheese has a good amount of provolone with the mozzarella.  Crust is good with nice char marks on the bottom.  Rice balls were decent.  Needed to be packed a little tighter but good.  Slices were small when ordered individual ones."}
{"text":"Having tried most of the pizza places in the Pittsburgh area, I can whole heartedly say that this is my favorite pizza. Its reminiscent of pizza shops in New York. What sets is above the rest? For me, it's the dough and the way its cooked. They also use just enough oil to coat the pizza but not to where its dripping like Pizza Hut.   NOTE: Cash only. But they do have an ATM.   My opinions are verified by all of the awards hanging on the walls as decor. I haven't tried much besides the slices of pizza because I'm so satisfied with them.   5 stars."}
{"text":"Literally standing in the waiting area for 42 mins and I JUST saw them top my pizza... happened the past few times I came. Pizza is great. Customer service is one of the worst I have experience in pittsburgh so far. This will be the last time we order. Not everyone has all night to wait on a pizza..... super disappointed."}
{"text":"Mineo's used to be our go to pizza shop.  But over the past several years, when we think pizza, we think A'Pizza Badamo.  I don't know what Mineo's uses for cheese, but it never fails that all of the cheese drops off of the slice when you take a bite.  My kids cannot get through eating a slice without this happening and it only happens at here.  Mineo's needs desperately to remodel the shop and for the love of God, GET A CREDIT CARD READER.  This is 2016 not 1956.  No one carries cash any more.  I hate having to make a trip to the ATM to get cash just so I can get pizza.  Clean the place up and take my debit card and you're back on the list, until then though, it's up the road to Badamo's."}
{"text":"I finally tried Mineos Pizza!  I thought it was really good! One word of advice don't ask for extra cheese you don't need it, they already put a lot on!  They have a large assortment of different craft beers for the beer lovers!  There desserts looked fabulous have to try something next time I go!"}
{"text":"It was okay...  Switched it up, and got pasta dinners instead of pizza for a change. I had the ziti with tomato basil and mushroom sauce, and my boyfriend had the rigatoni with meat sauce. The meatballs that come with it were in the same container as the pasta. If you're a vegetarian I would advise them to separate or not include the meatballs in the same container.   For my ziti (that was actually penne), I had to jazz up the sauce. I added salt, more basil, thyme, and red pepper flakes. I also had the stuffed peppers which needed more flavor as well (mainly salt).   On a positive note - the garlic bread was to die for!!!! I wish they had a separate menu item for these with a side of sauce. Too bad you have to buy a meal to get the bread."}
{"text":"If you like pizza, then you have to try Mineo's. I ordered a pie from here with one of my best friends (of Italian descent, and raised in the US pizza capital - New Haven, CT). I absolutely loved it, but she didn't think it was all that great. I'm going to give it 4 stars, since I'm the one writing the review. It's quality pizza, without a shadow of a doubt. It tastes great! And there are a few other items to choose from if you don't want pizza."}
{"text":"Who the monkey said that this was NY style pizza?  I'm gonna smack them and their taste buds. I'll have to write my treatise on good pizza and print it on flyers to the world to describe the infinitely large difference.  But for now:  Super salty and school-cafeteria style sauce. Yellowy sliding-off-the-slice cheese. Un-foldable-in-half-like-normal-ny-pizza dimensions of Mineo slice.  Like my professor says on the design process, \"You have good intentions, you're not hurting anyone, but you have to have more rigor in your process.\""}
{"text":"I have always heard that Mineos is one of the great pizza places in Pittsburgh. And of course to survive on Murray Ave is impressive since that place is a Foodie paradise with so many places to choose from.   Walking in the door over the weekend my girlfriend and I were pleasantly surprised by the atmosphere. We grabbed 2 seats at the large bar and immediately dug into the drink menu. The beer selection was pretty nice, but for a pizza place it was expensive. I didn't want to spend $7-9 on a beer so I got the cheapest, a $5.50 Yuengling draft.   But then came the pizza. A thin dough that had a satisfying crunch, decked with my favorite veggie toppings: green peppers and onions. There was really the perfect balance of toppings and they were so fresh. You could tell That nothing about this pizza came from a can.   They sell by the slice which is always a nice bonus, although eating a whole pie wasn't exactly a chore. I don't know when I'll make it back to Mineos, but I can definitely say it is one of the best pizzas on the East End.   If freshness is your main focus, and if you like a thinner crust pizza this may just be the place for you. The only knock on this place is those beer prices, but that's the price of eating in a nice neighborhood perhaps."}
{"text":"We were really excited to try this place. Unfortunately it did not live up to expectations. We ordered a Sicilian pizza with sausage and mushroom for pick up. The cheese completely slid in one piece and the we couldn't even hold the pizza in our hand it was so flimsy. To top it off, the pizza only tasted okay. Definitely will it be coming back."}
{"text":"Cheesy heaven. Had read about this place online and heard about it from various people I asked for good pizza in Pittsburgh. This place did not disappoint. Parking is a bit of a problem, but once inside it just smells good, too. They also deliver frozen pizzas anywhere in the US, because it really is that good. Anything less than 5 stars would be a crime."}
{"text":"Mineos Pizza.  A classic.  The best pizza joint in Pittsburgh.  Although I have moved away, this place is a must every time I come back to town."}
{"text":"I was in town for a funeral last weekend stayed by the waterfront, tried to get into all the restaurants there on Sat night but all had A 2 HOUR WAIT. We asked at our hotel for a good pizza place and  the girl at the desk told us about Mineo's . Boy was I glad she did, they were packed also, but we got a table within 5 min.  Food was excellent I got the calzone to die for my son and his wife pizza exceptional, my Niece  got the raviolis delicious, we all got desert to go cannoli's were yummy  service great atmosphere fun. Our waitress I think her name was Karen great service, wish I lived in the area would eat there all the time."}
{"text":"For all the hype, Mineo's struggles.  I usually appreciate a family-owned old- time pizza place that's renowned as any city's \"best of.\". However, this is not up to par for their reputation.  It's a cash only place and a large cheese pizza will set you back over 17 dollars. If we ordered our usual two-topping pizza, I would have needed to find an ATM machine.  The overall taste of the pizza was average, comparable with any other standard neighborhood pizza joint.  I wanted Mineo's to be delicious because I live close by but the price and the lackluster flavor was a disappointment.  The pizza proved that there is such a thing as too much of a good thing as the cheese flavor overwhelmed the entire pie in a very unsatisfying way.  Why anyone would ship one of their pizzas out of state is simply beyond me."}
{"text":"Mineo's Pizza is my favorite pizza in the Pittsburgh region! So much so my family and I make the 30 mile journey to this location once every other week. Parking can be difficult, the dining area could use some TLC, and it is unfortunately that you better carry cash with you because that is the only form of payment they accept and it could be expensive. They do offer an ATM if you forget. Minor unfortunates, however, the pizza is a must try if you never had it."}
{"text":"Every time I eat Mineo's, I feel like I've died and gone to Pizza heaven. The crust is so delicious that I actually look forward to the last few bites of crust. The sauce is so flavorful and dynamic. I usually prefer the bare minimum when it comes to sauce, but their sauce is just too good to wish it away. The cheese and toppings are loaded up and piled on. It's seriously delicious pizza."}
{"text":"Pizza is great, but for the love of GOD it is 2017 having a cash only establishment with a full bar is absolutely ludicrous. Crappy ATM that runs out of cash during happy hour on a Friday, I would spend so much more money here if they took cards."}
{"text":"I heard that Mineo's had some of the best pizza in Pittsburgh, but it did not live up to that. I had it delivered, so maybe that's where I went wrong, but overall it was still pretty bad. The flavor was good and I liked how they put the toppings below the cheese. On each slice though there was about 1/3 of inch of cheese, while the dough was barely existent. Just too much cheese. Also, it seems to be a Pittsburgh practice to not cook a pizza through, and Mineo's followed suit. So the thick cheese and soft dough kind of had the same consistency. Just not good pizza. And not to sound arrogant, but I'm from NY, and I might have a high bar for good pizza. Still though, I've had better pizza than this in Pittsburgh."}
{"text":"Ah man. Here's the other pizza that's in my top 5. Seriously so delish and it's not rocket science to see why they've been in business so long. Freshest ingredients and yummy sauce on a crust of perfection."}
{"text":"Mineos Pizza is one of the most popular pizza shops in Pittsburgh, I assume it is because the people of Pittsburgh prefer walking around with mean streaks of fecal aftermath in their tight white Hanes.  A large cheese pizza (which is 16', or 12 slices for those of you who think that makes a difference) costs a rich neighborhoodly $17.50 (plus the $20 parking ticket which I will take half the blame for...bringing the pizzas total to $27.50).  The kid making the pizza was exactly 12 years old and was a spitting image of Ernie from Billy Madison, I was half expecting him to pee his pants mid pie.  Ernie has a lot to learn about making a pizza and the fact that it was 2 in the afternoon on a Thursday and no one in the kitchen was over the age of 20 makes sense as to why the pizza is so sloppy.    Mineos is making their pizza the traditional way, directly on the brick with no screens.  Ernie smothered the dough in flour to the point that the dough was all white and a bit powdery and it left a residue on your hands.  I can't say that I blame him for that thought because if he didn't use the giant hand full of flour to slide the pie in the oven than he wouldn't have been able to put the 9 pounds of cheese on the pie that Mr. Mineo requires for a pizza to be deemed edible.  The pie still didn't quite make its way into the oven without turning into a wonky oval shape.  The pizza was way too thin in the middle and the gelatinous wad of cheese that enveloped the pie made it pretty much impossible to pull the slices apart from each other.  This is the kind of pizza that you need to eat with a spoon.  You really can't eat it like pizza, you just kind of have to pick the cheese curd off and eat it by itself and then you can eat the crust afterwards.  The pizza was relatively well cooked, it lacked color but probably just because of the excessive flour.  The sauce was spread on fairly well but the cheese was just wadded on with absolutely no regard for my butt hole.  The dough has that typical bad salty cracker Pittsburgh type taste to it.  The crust has a pretty low hydration rate and is quite dry but you probably won't notice because you will be too busy choking on the grease from the cheese.  The middle of the pie was way too thin and the crust was pretty puffy.  The flavor of the dough is generic and salty.  The dough was also fairly dense.    The sauce wasn't bad, I would be curious to try this sauce on a pie that had a sensible amount of cheese.  The flavor is mostly derived from basil, oregano and sugar.  They are definitely using a lot of water in the sauce and adding sugar to offset it.  Its not the worst sugar water sauce I have had in the city but it certainly isn't great.  The tomatoes seem to be decent quality, no real chunks though just a thin even consistency.    The cheese ruined this pie.  It tastes like a mix of mozzarella and provolone, quite possibly some cheap stuff blended in with some good stuff.  I don't understand why any pizza shop would want to put so much damn cheese on their pizza when it is by far the most expensive part.  I can't even think of a joke, I just want to take a nap.   All in all this pizza just sucks.  Its sad to me that places like this are the standard for pizza in this city, its just breeding more fat oblivious ranch dressing dunkers.  People don't eat pizza like this because it tastes good, they eat it because it gets you high as fuck and releases all your happy lazy brain molecules so that you can just lard there and continue watching the latest scripted reality tv show.  I am feeling pretty defeated by this pizza, both in brain and bung.    4/10"}
{"text":"If you like thick gooey cheese then Mineo's is your place. They now occupy about half a city block with their combination of bar, pizza place, and ice cream shop; maybe you'll see \"Mineo's Daycare\" by the time it's over. I like the pizza, but it's not my favorite in the city. I'd certainly go there though."}
{"text":"I am so disappointed with mineos mt. Lebanon. I have been going to mineos in both locations for 30 years. The past 5 years I have lived in the south hills and used their delivery service. They even delivered to my house last weekend. I placed my order today and 20 minutes later they call to tell me that they don't deliver to my house. Mind you they have been delivering to me for 5 years here so it's a complete lie. They screwed up my dinner plans for my family and were rude when I called. It is pure laziness on their part and horrible customer service. They have lost a 30 year customer because of this. I ordered a pizza from Tomatoes II after and they were very friendly. Order pizza from anywhere other than mineos!!!! If I could give 0 stars I would but 1 is the lowest option."}
{"text":"I recently did a pizza crawl through squirrel hill with a friend, where we hit every single one of squirrel hill's 7 pizzerias, and got a slice of pepperoni pizza at each one in a row!  Our favorite of all of them?  Mineos!  It's like loading a shotgun full of delicious cheeses and pulling the trigger.  Their pizza is all around good, but it's primarily a righteous cheese delivery system, and a cheese lovers delight!"}
{"text":"I dont know what all the rave is about with mineos. it is cheesy salty with hard crust and excessively over priced."}
{"text":"Mineo's offers an extremely cheesy pizza with a spicy sauce. The toppings are \"hidden\" (baked in under the cheese.) The cheese on a Mineo's pizza is not only abundant, but flavorful (likely a mix of several cheeses including mozzerella and sharp provolone.) The sauce has a strong and spicy flavor. The standard crust is a thinner Neapolitan, but Sicilian is available upon request. Mineo's also serves up a very good chicken wing as well as oven cooked hoagies. All portions are very generous. If you aren't ok with eating a significant amount of cheese then I would not recommend Mineo's, but if you're a cheese lover then this is heaven. Dining in or carrying out the service is always prompt and friendly. Make sure to bring cash as they do not accept debit/credit cards."}
{"text":"Any yinzer knows the true pizza pickle that exists on Murray Ave. Mineo's take (IMO) is 1/3 crust to 2/3 cheese with a generous amount of tangy red sauce. Toppings are baked under the cheese. A veteran Mineo's man-at-arms knows to wait at least 5 minutes before even thinking about taking a knife + fork to it. If not, enjoy peeling the skin off the roof of your mouth before bedtime. These days their consistency has struggled a bit in my experience, but when they get it right it's like nothing you've had before...mmm, that crust! What's keeping them at 4 stars is that they've expanded again in recent years to offer a small bar and dining room. A nice sleeper option to watch dem Stillers!"}
{"text":"After reading all about this place, I have to admit that I was really let down. Not being a native Pittsburgher could definitely have a lot ot do with it. Don't get me wrong, it was not bad, but I found the pizza to have too much cheese, and the quality of the ingredients were just average, if that. If you are a New Yorker, or like a New York style of pizza, I really don't think that you will care for the pizza here. I would recomment Aiello's (right next to it), or even better Pizza Bellino which is a few blocks away on Forbes."}
{"text":"I hate to say it, but I am really not a fan of this place.  I would give it 2.5 stars if I could, but I don't think that it can merit 3 for me.  The quality of the ingredients is one of the most important things in food, and when it comes to pizza (where a basic cheese pizza has only a few), the lack of quality ingredients stands out, as it does here.  In addition, I am not of the mindset that greater quantity=better food.  They really put a ton of cheese on their pizza, and it ends up being an even greasier mess than a usual pizza.  Waaay too much cheese for me.  If you are from a city with great pizza, don't believe the hype about this place."}
{"text":"I wanted to love it. I had a friend who lives in Wexford who raged about Mineo's. I live in Morningside so how could I not make it down to Mineos. It just was not that great.   I feel really guilty for the three stars, but in a city with 1,000+ pizza places I am just not sure this is really the best of the best or even worth the trip out of your way.   I will visit again because I mentioned I wanted to love and just simply ended up feeling sad that cheese slid right off the pizza when I tried to eat it."}
{"text":"I have to have Mineo's whenever I come home to see my family!   Its become our tradition to order a few pizzas, usually larges with extra cheese, mushrooms and pepperoni!   My review isn't very long, but my fellow burghers, that know Mineo's Pizza, know the deal!   If you visit the Squirrel Hill location, you won't find parking on Murray Ave.  Park on Hobart street, just down the block from Mineo's, on the same side of the street."}
{"text":"Top shelf pie. 1st time visitor and I fell in love with the sauce and the crust. I can see why they keep winning best pizza in the city. Only took about 20 minutes to order and get our hot pizza at out table. Liked being able to buy a beer as well. A little pricey but hey I wanted one with my pizza. Loved it."}
{"text":"The Pizza is awesome. I like a slice of bacon and a slice of pepperoni. But the sauce and crust are outstanding and they are not cheap on the cheese. The stuffed Banana Pepper Sub is great as well. They have a little bar too which is pretty nice with cool bartenders to hang out and watch a game or something."}
{"text":"this place is ridiculous the overrated. The staff is always rude never accommodating. and they don't take debit cards like geez just pay your taxes like everyone else..I mean I'm sure they make enough money where they can pay their taxes I know why they don't. The pizza was all right but very inconsistent..this place is definitely overrated"}
