{"text":"We started to come to this restaurant when our other favorite Italian place closed and the place is great.  We try to go as often as we can.  The staff/owner is really friendly.  They are accomodating.  They are also great with kids.  We have gone there twice with friends who have kids and they have been great both times.   The best part though, is that the food is fantastic and is consistently awesome.  We have never gone there and had a less than stellar meal and therefore is always one of our first places we go when we have friends in town.    Hands down one of our most favorite places of all time."}
{"text":"Over the last year or so i have been at this restaurant several time with my family and friends, not once have i ever been disappointed. The service is hands down the best in this city, it sure is nice knowing you can still go somewhere where they care about there customers and its obvious no one cares more then this group of people. The food is always great! always hot and very fresh. Thanks for giving me a great delicious spot for great eats and good laughs"}
{"text":"Average. Food is medium taste and nothing to brag about. However, best service i have seen in an italian resturant."}
{"text":"From the moment I walked up to this restaurant I truly wondered what the hell I'd gotten myself into - seriously. However as I was a house guest and my delightful host and hostess were adamant that this was very highly recommended place so I put my stomach in their very capable hands.  This is family owned and operated establishment and I'm not exaggerating when I say that every bite of food was made with love - it was delicious !!! THe service was amazing and I practically had to be rolled from the place from gorging myself on every bite !! I would not hesitate recommend this place to everyone :)"}
